At the age of 12, it was the first time I had to face myself.
It was the year I started sports and changed school.
I was now a student of my city's music school and I was completely at the age of adolescence.
My classmates were talented children with a variety of occupations.
Some played music, others football and others were just better than me.
Or at least that's how I felt.
I felt that I was lagging behind in many areas in relation to my peers and in relation to what I had in mind that I can be and become in the future.
Think, I was overweight, shy and not popular at all.
I thought I didn't deserve this situation, so I started looking for ways to change it.
My first move was to look at Google, as we all do now today, how to become better, smarter, how I can get the impressions in a group, and I continued doing all sorts of similar searches.
I started reading books and self-improvement articles every day.
At some point I believed a very good choice besides the articles on the internet would be a book that would have a concentrated knowledge of me.
And I went to a bookstore.
I was learning about techniques and methods that could help me improve and I was trying to apply them.
I studied the posture, the tone of the voice, the speed of speech, and I sought to control the style of each conversation.
Somehow, as you can see, it was very difficult to do all this from scratch, suddenly, and to study all this at the same time and it was utopian to think that I would do so simply.
This is how I realized that the theory from practice was a long way away and somewhere there I began to believe that I would never get where I wish and with the disappointment in my face growing.
And then, one event was going to change my whole theory around life, and for several things, at least as I perceived them to myself.
It was a simple suggestion by a teacher at my school to take part in a large short film competition.
We took part and excelled in the best teams of the competition, and then it was the moment when I found something very important.
The next day after my success, I asked myself a few questions.
Why should I fear to lose something I never had, and why would I overshadow the fear of victory? What is it that I really want to want my life and what my purpose is?
Millions of people are born and die at the same time without having any idea that we coexist or co-existed in the past for a period of time.
billion people have completely different ideas and perceptions and beliefs from us.
And there are also these people who we consider rare and unique and we are happy and happy to be by our side.
But they and others and we all have one thing in common.
This time between birth and death we call life.
Life, as you all know, is not play, laugh, right?
Life is play, laugh, cry, claim, risk, win and lose.
Life is a very big game and has many parameters and many rules.
Some of their rules we know from the beginning and some other parameters and rules we learn later by playing this game.
A very important part of the games is to define from the beginning your own framework and your own rules so that you reach the desired result.
You basically have a goal that you try to reach and achieve, and that can only happen if you move properly.
But what is the right path that will lead you to the goal?
There's only the way you'll chart.
And if the path you have paved leads you to the goal, then your reward comes.
Does this scenario remind you of anything? Hmm, that's what happens in our lives.
You see, games are connected and influenced by life.
Many times we have thought that this is our last chance to succeed, we live with deadlines that define others for us, and this makes us afraid of failure, resulting in many times wrong or sometimes not acting at all.
Imagine what our life would have been like if it had been influenced by games.
Initially, there would be no fear of failure, because we all know that in games you always have a second chance.
Even when the lives and opportunities in your game are reduced, you are able to increase them and make life and play last longer.
After all, what's the point of not doing the same in our lives? Every time we fail at something, we automatically raise our success rate to the next attempt.
If you think about it, that's great!
Another important thing we can find in games is time.
If you have usually noticed, many games do not get harder but faster.
This is what actually happens.
For example, today, here, I could make a better speech in my own game, but the production of TEDx set me a certain amount of time to talk, resulting in making the game faster, not harder.
Because, therefore, we know that our time is limited in this game and the hourglass spins only one time, we define our own degree of difficulty in relation to it.
Most of the time we think it's either difficult enough for us or that we don't have time.
Think about it a little too.
We are captive of the same thing, considering it two different.
This confusion often leads us to inertia.
The way to get away from it is to have a clear purpose in our game and by extension in our lives.
Time is the only fortune we have.
It's that hourglass that when you turn it, suddenly you start to feel the pressure for action.
This is your key that helps you lock the door of inertia.
And you have to lock her well because she will find many ways to escape in order to create confusion and lure you.
So if you manage to believe and see life as a big game, then you're likely to trace your destination.
You will realize that you are the protagonist of this game and you will start looking for the rules you need to follow and all your potential opponents.
Then you will discover a very large void.
There are no rules to follow and there are usually no opponents who want to beat you.
It's you, it's the actions and the time.
What is there is your time and your actions.
Even time is a human invention that you will never be able to understand, and when you find out, you will realize that you are fighting completely alone.
All the burden is on you and the actions you will do.
In decisions of secondary importance, it is useful to consider pros and cons.
On critical issues, however, decisions should come from your heart.
Success is hidden in you.
So listen and feel your heart and let her show you this right strategy for your game.
Depend on a target and pursue it.
If you hit him, you'll enjoy the result.
If not, you'll have enjoyed the journey.
In any case, you will have found out why it is worth taking risks, because it is worth claiming and why it is worth playing.
Those who have a "because" to live can endure whatever Nietzsche has said.
This is why we are all called upon to answer it.
The day you discover it will be the most important day of your life.
Seek within yourself without fear and you will find it.
I found it a few years ago after a simple contest.
Now it's your turn.
Oh, thank you. Thanks.
(Applause)
To get our economy back on a path of steady growth, they will have to change jobs half with a million people.
That's 10 to 20 percent of the workforce.
And when I say change jobs, I don't mean working more productively or more honestly or smarter.
I mean, change the subject of activity.
And let's see why.
If we divide the economy, the sectors of the economy into two categories: the left the non-marketable, i.e. those who cannot be offered from afar and are not subject to international competition.
And on the right the marketable, i.e. the products that can be transported industrially, or agricultural, the services that can be offered to foreigners.
Tourism, shipping and various forms of technology marketable such as software.
The problem of our economy, the structural, beyond the fiscal ones, is that we have very few jobs right and comparatively above many left.
And to get back on our feet, hundreds of thousands of jobs have to come from there.
Let's look at another category.
To divide them into sectors that need large and organized enterprises that mean capital, hierarchies, etc. and those who can be done today by micro-enterprises.
Those who talk about investments and hope that jobs will come with "investments" in quotation marks, hope in fact that jobs will come in ready-made packages, here, up, to the big competitive companies well-designed, spatialized, with their hierarchies and their equipment.
Indeed, the international model of an extrovert economy is this.
The big industries, the big companies, rather in the competitive sectors, are the ones that make exports or those that prevent the large penetration of exports from outside, defending the domestic market.
To us, this model cannot prevail.
And the reason is that our whole society, our entire institutional environment is conspiring so that we don't have many big businesses in the competitive sectors.
At the moment, not even 5% of the workforce is working in large corporations up there.
And when I say big, have over 250 workers, not huge.
Not even the 5%.
About 25% work in large organizations or the state, and especially in the state, in the non-marketable sectors.
And 70% is the small and medium economy.
And of that 70 percent, at least half are self-employed and peasants.
Therefore, the great adjustment we have to make is from all the non-marketable sector and from the whole pool of the unemployed to create the jobs here, in the small, export, extrovert economy.
Now, this is a trajectory that is not at all common internationally.
We have no standards to copy.
We have to create a trajectory of our own quite peculiar, quite Greek.
Greek households will succeed because they have some data that do not exist to a very large extent in the west.
First, the self-employed and small businessman has a commerciality.
He knows how to manage receipts and payments.
He knows how to set up new jobs that an executive of a big company in the west that has made his career in a hierarchy doesn't necessarily know.
Then there is the famous multi-property of the Greek family.
The different sources of income, some various assets, a field from here, some rent from there, a pension, the wife's salary in the public sector that is stable, etc. Because the research that has been done internationally, statistical surveys, about what are the main factors that convinced someone to become an entrepreneur, to start a new job of their own, the most important factor statistically is to have a detachment, a small fortune, something.
This factor is more important than even character data.
That is, if we have a risky spirit, etc. So I think that Greek households have all the elements to achieve this great shift that I spoke about.
And so I don't think it's hard to imagine a philologist leaving the tutorial and going to tourism, or an engineer to return to his paternal field and try something new, a new crop, - no innovation has been found for hoarseness from what I see - or three young technicians designing applications for the global economy digitally, some of our best ones here today.
There will be too many barriers.
And one of the biggest is the patterns we carry in our heads.
The patterns we carry in our head will be one of the biggest obstacles, models for what? For example, what is a good job.
For me, for my child.
Or what kind of businesses are the best businesses for the national economy.
In 1980, the dominant model, the Western standard, was what growth means industry.
And we happen to... We don't work it rationally.
As Stelios would say, we import them.
There are dominant Western narratives that fit the west, but they may not fit us.
Well, in the '80s he used to say the dominant standard: "development means industry."
And that's why Andreas Papandreou, the charismatic Andreas Papandreou, had said at the time, if you remember: "We will not be the waiters of Europe."
And it has negatively colored tourism for many years.
Imagine if he had said, "We want to be the hosts of all Europe."
Come here, meet each other, have fun, entertained, seek.
How different would there be for tourism.
Today, a dominant model says that development is infrastructure and organization.
And that's true to some, some.
But for us, we must have a wise balance between this infrastructure and organization on the one hand and our own particular characteristics.
And to continue with one example, tourism.
The foreigners to come to an island will land in Eleftherios Venizelos.
They will come into contact with an organized airport, which only large organizations and infrastructure and plans can have.
The top of the painting I showed before.
But they're obviously not coming to the airport.
Then they will enter a ship, which if it is fast and clean, will make them reach their destination cheerful and rested.
And the ship obviously only a large company can operate it properly.
But it's not the reason why the ship is coming.
The reason they are coming is after the boat leaves them on the island, what will they do there? They will go to the small business and rent a pig and start the adventures.
And they'll get here.
And they'll lie here.
And they'll pass after the business fund and pay here.
And in the afternoon they will go and buy honey produced by another small business in its facilities, which is them.
Well, the airport and the ship are not our product, it is the channel to reach our products.
Which is the route with the pig, the beach, the tavern etc. And that's what the little ones offer.
And to explain, I'm not saying that small rooms to let are better than the big hotel units.
What I'm saying is that, since we either don't want or we can't have a lot of large units, the success of tourism will be judged by the small professionals.
From how hospitable they are, how they are inventive, how much they care for the environment and how they convince the customer to pay without feeling stolen.
So I think that the airport and the pig is a good parable for the entire development model.
We need the good infrastructure that only planning and large hierarchies and big capital can provide, and we should not differ from the west.
We have to have these standards.
But what will define our place in the global economy, which will not be the same as Germans or Chinese, will be the small entrepreneurs who need to find ways to sell their products everywhere.
Where can we rely? Apart from the crops or tourism that we have natural advantages? There is a cliche that says: "To our young people, their intelligence and their studies."
Because they are open-minded, they travel, they know languages, and many of them even study in the finest universities in the world.
This has some substance.
That is, based on these elements, we can have a few successes.
But I think not too many.
Where we can have more is if we combine these elements, intelligence and studies, with some local peculiarities, which I must tell you, no one can tell you from either one at home.
Neither I nor anyone else.
These are discovered by entrepreneurs every day, small businessmen from work to work.
And to set an example.
Foreign language learning books.
The so-called foreign-language books, especially English.
I know at least three Greek publishers who are very successful internationally.
One of them was bought last year by a multinational and the other two are exporting significantly.
From where and to where Greek publishers in English language learning.
We have this peculiarity.
In most countries children learn English in school and their books are either taken by large multinationals or by some domestic publishers, one or two with long-term contracts.
We don't learn English at school.
We learn them in the tutorial where there are six thousand in Greece and each one decides what books they will get and re-fascistize next year.
Thus, a very competitive market for English language learning has been created, which is about 15 at the moment and most are domestic, they are Greek.
The other characteristic of Greece, the peculiarity again, is that Greek students want to be finished with English, with tutorials and exams at 16.
Because then we have to start the other tutorials, the Panhellenic.
This creates a need for teaching methods that are more concise and faster.
Faster than the multinational publishers have developed.
And so the Greek publishers, by clicking on this peculiarity, made products that are competitive internationally.
Stepping into an institutional peculiarity of Greece.
Be careful now.
How many will admit that this scheme of tutorials that some despisedly call paradigm has created a know-how that is competitive internationally, that the official school will never create.
These are the dominant narratives, the dominant patterns I was saying before that sometimes hinders us.
There is a Greek model, a business, the Internet Cafes, that go to students in the afternoons and play with their friends online adventure games.
This model is a prototype internationally.
It does not exist in Europe.
And it is very beneficial for students because it develops a spirit of cooperation since they play together, and of course other complex skills, things that of course the Greek school does not give them.
But the state treats the Internet Cafes with huge suspicion of gambling behind.
And he tries in different ways to close them.
And entrepreneurs cannot defend their work by citing European standards because they are not comparable.
That is, their peculiarity, which could be an advantage, becomes a disadvantage due to the suspicion of the state.
In 1976, at my first job, I was working on a research project for the education ministry and the world bank.
And there were a lot of foreign counselors coming to help us at work.
At one point a professor of economic history appeared from a very large, well-known American university.
We were in a building on Ermou Street.
During a break in work he asked me about my thesis - I then did a thesis - which was about monopoly concentration in the Greek industry.
I was very influenced at the time by the neo-Marxist theories of development.
The neo-Marxist theories of development which spoke about the dependence and underdevelopment of the Euro-Pacinter region.
So when he asked me, I started telling him about the metropolises of capitalism that gather all the technology there, and how underdeveloped my country is.
He listened very patiently and at the end he says to me: "Well, all this, but have you noticed the coffeemaker's disc? this one.
He meant that.
So he explained to me how amazingly designed he is, in order to loosely touch the fingers and with the weight of the glass to stabilize and when the coffeemaker goes up and down the stairs of the ministry do not pour the water.
And he says to me, "So well designed record, I, in America, haven't seen a show.
And I admit, he stunned me.
I was talking to him about the big stories and he was talking to me about the coffeemaker's record.
I learned something that day.
That you don't learn the real economy by reading, you learn by observing.
And that technology is not just what exists in Intel's labs, but the choices every professional makes every day.
Obviously I'm not saying this to say that the records will save our economy.
I say it because I think he is right, Nikos Anagnostou, the blogger who writes about technology, when he wrote in a recent post very nice: "Extroversion does not need to be impressive."
Competence doesn't have to be impressive.
Well, our new extrovert micro-enterprises will not fit into some big narrative, they will not have the official blessing of the state that, say, a pharmacy has today.
They will not be considered a function, nor will they have the confidence of the public, nor the glamour of the career in a large company, nor will they have copied successful models from Business Week.
They'll be improvised, they'll look like us sloppy and Balkan and mysterious.
The owners themselves should invent the narrative that will give meaning and duration to what they do.
We, the rest of us, don't underestimate them because they're the ones who're going to save us.
Oh, thank you. Thanks.
(Applause)
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
When I was asked to speak at this year's TEDxAcademy, the first obvious question, of course, was what the issue is and I admit that the answer troubled me.
Evolution, I was told.
I can talk to you about many unpleasant developments in my country, but that's not the point.
I thought about it a little bit, I didn't mean to say no.
It was an honorable invitation, and suddenly I came to what the younger ones say.
An inspiration.
And I said that here Europe, 60 and more years, is doing the most impressive, revolutionary, political experiment.
Well, let me talk to you about it.
Let me tell you the good news, let me tell you the bad news and close with a few words about Greece.
Well, my theme today is experiment Europe.
First of all, the consolidation of peace in a Europe with open borders.
Remember on a small continent, fragmented, with many states carrying on their backs a long, glorious history, but full of wars and bloody conflicts.
Second objective: achieving economic prosperity through the creation of a large, free, competitive European market, but at the same time by creating the tools that would help Europe's least developed countries and regions converge.
The third objective is to strengthen democratic institutions, especially in countries with a problematic political past.
And fourth goal: the application of the ancient saying: "power in the unification" that is, in a world that changes too quickly, in a world that counts, the countries of Europe, even the formerly large and powerful, no longer have neither the special weight nor the size to be protagonists on the world stage, nor even usually secondary fighters.
These were the main targets.
What are the means we use to achieve these goals? First, the consolidation of a culture of cooperation and dialogue.
In Europe, we choose and negotiate to the death.
Endlessly.
But, to tell you the truth, I prefer seventeen-hour negotiations, albeit after midnight, rather than shooting at each other, as we had the habit of doing for centuries in Europe.
And second means: the creation of common institutions and policies on which this culture of cooperation will be based.
You will tell me all this is beautiful in words, but in practice what can be done? My answer is simple: that too much has been done.
Europe has become unrecognizable in 50 years.
And you want me to tell you differently? What is the proof of the success of the European political experiment, at least until the last few years? Think of Europe as a small shop, starting in the 1950s, it is small, poor, selling only two products, essentially coal and steel.
These were the two products with which the European Coal and Steel Community started.
And with six members.
Today, this small shop has turned into a huge supermarket, which sells everything, although of different quality products, and has terribly increased its clientele.
From six members we became 28 and many more are gathered at the entrance to enter.
I don't think there's any more great proof of a shop's success than constantly increasing your turnover and your clientele.
And add something else, and be considered, until relatively recently, a model for the rest of the world.
Good news, but let's get to the bad news.
And there is bad news.
Europe is in crisis.
The crisis is deep.
You'll tell me crises Europe has had many in the past.
My answer, however, would be that this crisis is fundamental, it risks becoming an existential crisis for the European political experiment.
So why the crisis? let me give some explanations.
Obviously, the list is not exhaustive.
A first reason Europe is in crisis is because sometimes, we probably went too fast, without enough preparation, without thinking about the consequences of our actions.
I will give you a very simple and characteristic example.
This is the example of the euro.
We decided in Europe, in the early 1990s, to make a common currency.
This is the height of the European political experiment.
It is the most advanced stage of political development.
But we made this common currency, but we didn't build the institutional, or the political background on which it will be based, nor the economic tools that will make the euro sustainable.
In other words, we tried to repeat in politics and economics, the miracle of immaculated arrest.
A currency without a state.
A currency without a state does not exist in history and we learn this as the hard way, as the Turks say.
That's the first explanation.
The second is that we were unprepared, but we were also unlucky.
Because the euro did not have time to complete the tenth of his life and came the break of the largest international financial bubble since 1929.
No one could predict it, that's misfortune.
So it is also a lack of preparation and, obviously, misfortune.
But there are other reasons.
The third category refers to reasons that have to do with the internal of our countries.
What has been going on for 20-30 years? In European countries, but also in all developed countries of the Western world?
This is much more pronounced in the United States and Britain than in most continental European countries.
At the same time, the number of our fellow citizens who feel they are losing, that they can no longer cope with the competition created, who lose from globalization and European integration, is constantly increasing.
These people are turning against globalization and against Europe.
If there is no way to address this problem, the problem will swell further in the coming years.
The fourth reason is: it's not the best neighborhood.
Let me remind you, if you look at the map of Europe, we only have a neighborhood in the east and south.
To the north there are only polar bears and in the west we have fish.
So we are dealing with neighbors in the East and the South.
These neighbors are not doing well.
Most of Europe's neighbours fall into the category of globalisation lost.
And to all this economic problem came to add war and religious conflicts in recent years.
One of the results of all these problems in our neighborhood is the huge increase in migration flows.
The migration crisis risks becoming a crisis in Europe in the face of which the euro crisis will pale, and a crisis that can blow Europe up.
Europe certainly needs to show solidarity with people who are persecuted.
We need to discuss a fairer distribution of burdens.
But it also needs a third condition.
And this is the effective control of the external borders of Europe, in general, and of Greece, since it is throughout Europe.
So, with this crisis in recent years, we have come to a situation in which our coexistence within the EU becomes difficult.
Discontent is being overcome, the acceptance of the European political experiment is constantly diminishing.
And that's why it sometimes looks like a cohabitation, I called it in a book I wrote last year and published in various languages, "unhappy union," that is, Europe risks becoming a cohabitation in a polygamous relationship in which partners stay inside, not so much because they love each other, but because they fear the cost of divorce, or because they are afraid to be alone.
You'll tell me fear lasts a lot of marriages.
But I don't think it's enough for a successful European symbiosis.
And now a few words about Greece.
As you know, Greece has been an integral part of this European political experiment for many decades.
Greece's relationship with Europe has sometimes been very difficult.
I would say that the people in Greece, our fellow citizens, those who consider our participation in the political experiment European, a positive development, can be divided into three major categories.
The first category belongs to our fellow citizens who believe that Europe is like a cow that you milk as much as you can.
These people usually have a very relaxed treatment of how common rules are applied.
Any rules, whether Greek or European.
A second category considers Europe as the safe anchorage for a ship, the Greek one, which often seems ungovernable, because crew members constantly fight with each other, because they do not let the captain take the wheel, because everyone has a different view of where to go.
And this often ungoverned ship is forced to travel in very difficult seas.
Because the neighborhood of Greece is difficult.
So, in this category, Greece offers a safe anchorage.
There's a third category, which is less, I think.
Although, I believe, the most suspicious.
They are the ones who considered our participation in the European political experiment from the beginning as an additional, not only, as an additional means of achieving a goal that goes far back, in the Greek Revolution, if you want, or even before: the creation of a modern, European state in Greece, a rule of law with strong democratic institutions, with economic prosperity and social solidarity.
Obviously, these three categories have always been the vast majority of Greeks and Greeks.
Of course, there were always others.
The others, who, whether, of whom Europe says nothing, never meant anything, perhaps because Europe represents what they call "bourgeois values" and "bourgeois democracy," which does not satisfy them.
Or because some others fantasize about a Greece in another part of the world that is not exactly clear where it will be.
And of course, in recent years, with the great crisis, the extreme nationalists came out of the caves.
This crisis in Europe is changing the internal balance within the country.
Greece, unfortunately, has ended up being the most problematic member of the Eurozone in recent years, certainly of the Eurozone, probably of the whole European Union.
And of course the big question is, "Who is to blame for all this? I don't have the time, about three minutes I still have in front of me, to answer this question.
I'll answer that indirectly.
I believe that the management of the Greek crisis of recent years will take place, already, but much more in the future, a lesson that will be taught in more and more universities, not only in Greece, but internationally.
Because it is exactly the example of a crisis that says what you shouldn't do in a similar crisis.
And the responsibilities concern not only, to be fair, to the political leadership of the country and our society in general, but also concern our European partners and the International Monetary Fund.
That is, it is a realization of a great, enormous responsibility for a failed crisis management, of course the cost of which is too high.
And I get to the end.
Sure, Europe needs to change if it wants to overcome the crisis.
I know that the TEDx is expected the speaker or speaker who will come here to bring a positive message.
We need optimism.
If I only got a positive message, I think I'd make fun of you.
What is at stake in Europe today is huge.
There is certainly the possibility that Europe will overcome this crisis with more unity and changed.
But the risk of Europe stagnating or even having ruptures or partial disintegration is really visible.
And the first thing I wanted to tell you all is that you think that the success of the European political experiment is a matter for all of us, it is something that directly concerns all of us and our children.
If Europe's political experiment fails, one of the biggest victims of the failure will be this country.
So, do everything you can, as active citizens of the European Union, to contribute, as far as possible, each to achieve this European experiment.
And finally, something else.
Sure, Europe needs to change.
But I believe that before Europe changes, we need to change Greece.
We must, at last, be honest, look in the mirror, take responsibility, see what is wrong in this country, try to free the country from its bonds.
Only when we start to change Greece will we have a credible and serious reason for how Europe will change.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Let's talk about ideas.
The ideas are alive.
They come to us through questions, images, coincidences, and even dreams.
They're attractive. They're attractive.
[Idea] They excite us, they lead us to wonderful roads, which are full of challenges and full of unexpected developments.
They give us strength, but they also have their own dynamics.
A dynamic that helps them evolve and influence more and more people, which feeds them back and thus maintains undiminished the enthusiasm and inspiration they exude.
Although I prepared a speech and I have offered it, I wish, good enough to tell you today, I am sure that the ideas and associations that are coming will probably deviate from what I wanted to say, but let me start and see.
The German philosopher Edmund Husserl had described that every man is the center of the world.
This is because it perceives the world with it as a starting point and as a measure of comparison.
What describes the Inul point, as he called it, is that every person has a completely personal image of the world, which passes through his emotional or logical filter.
We could say as Greeks: between Apollonius and Dionysian self.
This balance between us has gradually begun to subside.
This is because logic is beginning to prevail.
Although we perceive the world mainly by experiencing - that is, we describe a distance, not in meters, but in how many minutes we take to walk it - nonetheless we try to rationalize it all.
We could say: square them.
The ideas that brought me here today concern architecture, but especially an architecture, which tries to satisfy the conditions of modern and future man, but through the bridging of emotion and logic, from the experiential with the metric space.
Modern man is active.
We understand this from the intense rhythms of life and often by the frequent change of our way of life.
The established architectural immobility does not seem to satisfy this condition.
And that's why the first idea I'm going to talk about is flexibility.
Flexibility is nothing new - and I personally had applied it in an architectural context, either as research or as practice.
But I understood its true dimension from another occupation.
As a set designer and assistant director in the amateur theatre to which I belonged.
There, mainly due to [unsucturated], but also because of the challenge to create the right environment with the most impact at the lowest cost, I often made the sets with multi-functional objects.
That is, objects, which depending on how they were placed in the space and what orientation they had created a completely different feeling.
The feeling that was necessary to transmit this feeling that the theatrical performance wanted.
This very dimension, that is, how we understand the environment differently, I considered that as a basic element of variability, it was something I looked for and I think I understood enough to gradually lead me to create a theory that optimized the use of space in time.
That is, we could use the space as best as possible in time, so that we would not waste it.
This was called the spatial economy or spatial economy.
But the preoccupation with theatre, the truth is, led me to something else, which I was concerned: the place of man in architecture.
The position of man, theoretically, is at the heart of design.
However, what I found is that it is more involved as dimensions.
And not as an experience.
In directing and scenography, the basis is an action, an activity, and man is always a focus on it.
The space complements him.
It complements him as an expression, complements him as a general sense.
And here I was born another idea.
That architecture, it should probably be more concerned with this feeling, with this experience, coming out of activity, and not in some other way.
So, he was born - or rather, because this was something that already worked - was activity-based design, i.e. planning based on activity.
This is a design direction that has a qualitative difference from ordinary design.
That: he does not understand activity as a fragmentary use, which leads to ergonomics, but as a whole.
As something, which has a time footprint and varies experientially depending on time.
This thing, this dimension, this perspective, means that we enrich the architectural question beyond ergonomics.
With other features, so the architectural answer is better.
Here I want to stress this: The role of architecture is to provide answers.
The answers are dependent on how well the questions were asked.
A well-decorated question means a better answer.
And in our case: a better architectural solution.
Thus, the creation of a methodology, which was enriched with more issues, for which the space should be addressed, led to the formation of spatial needs around an activity, to be better identified, so that the architecture would come to dress them.
Thus, the logic of the dynamic building program was created, which in turn led to the creation of an online platform, where people, through an application they already probably use, such as Google Calendar, can go through the activities they have and thus better perceive their spatial needs or what kind of spaces they need to make them better.
And in this way, in principle, to evaluate the existing spaces they have, but also to better identify the future based on their future needs.
This application, of course, could not be carried out unless we have diffuse information.
I belong to the generation that has lived all the way in today's digital culture, let's call it.
I was 13 years old when the first personal computers came out and I was, perhaps one of the first, to deal with it.
In fact, an activity that was hidden, as it was not very popular at the time because we had the girls.
And I lived through the whole passage how they slowly started to deal with each other.
In fact, to such an extent that with some friends of mine we had been discussing that we should probably stop worrying because this acceptance is strange.
The issue is that these two, that is, this digital age has brought to everyone two, say, basic concepts in our lives.
Automation and interconnection.
[automation + interface] Automation is something that happens for us without our assistance.
That is, it is something that is considered beneficial, it is programmed in this way to do so without us spending time and energy. Interconnection, on the other hand, is the ability, in a variety of ways, communication of connecting with distant people and places.
These two are so intense today, so widespread, so much facts, that their absence is really unpleasant to us.
This means that these two technologies are perfectly utterly integrated into space.
That is: it is a logical next step and this leads to robotic architecture.
The robotic architecture - the research I have done and my occupation with it - has clearly and confidently shown me that it is applicable.
That is, the technical problems I considered, in its implementation, seemed that everything is solved and really solved.
I was excited about it.
In essence, it is the apogee of variability in architecture.
It is really the combination of many ideas with different starting points that came and completed a puzzle, a puzzle, which I thought had been completed, that is, either in terms of theory, methodology or application, all the pieces had been set up so that robotic architecture was applicable.
So I thought a bigger idea had been formed and completed.
I was so excited about what I wrote and a book on it.
The point is, as I told you before, ideas are alive.
And that came to prove something simple, a door.
Tell me what a door did?
Tell me, what did you expect from a door?
That's what I thought.
The point is that this door when it opened while I was working and I was absorbed, I was annoyed, I was annoyed.
In fact, to the extent that this started to trouble me because it happened and suddenly I think that I may have one of the most important ideas I had in this area.
That is, that although something is considered useful, expected, even if we have asked to happen at the wrong time, is unpleasant.
It doesn't matter what that is.
[the strange] And this, suddenly, struck me that bell at something that in a sense was underlying, but I didn't see it.
That is, while robotic architecture seems to have so many benefits, why isn't it more widespread? And I understood why it can be annoying.
What makes communication between people undisturbed and enjoyable is the quality of empathy and understanding.
In other words, to understand, to read a situation and to adapt our behavior so that it is compatible with that situation.
If one does not have this ability, behaves exactly the same or similar in all possible situations, then an embarrassment is created that in turn leads to the remission of communicability.
Unfortunately, robotic systems have a predicted and usually similar behavior.
And this can be great if we are to have a repetitive task, such as asaming something or screwing a screw 24 hours a day, but when dealing with people, this is problematic, because people change their mood and behavior.
And in order to be pleasant, you have to follow it.
Incorporating empathy and understanding into the cognitive characteristics of a robotic system gave rise to the - to say - methodology of design or incorporation of technology in architecture, Sensponsive, derived from the word sensibility, meaning empathy with understanding, and responsive which means responsiveness.
Such a system, then, will never react to a situation unless it first understands the mood of people in the space.
Of course, a system that will truly fully understand all situations is far from our potential.
But what we can do and on this we work, is depending on the activity we want to benefit through our architecture, we study the dominant factors.
Those factors that benefit it most directly.
Another characteristic of this application, that is, beyond the ability to understand man, is discretion, that is, what we said before that the behavior must be such that it is appropriate in the circumstances.
This means that the system is trying to have the right behavior to be the least annoying.
Minimize this dimension and be as beneficial as possible.
And how? Right now we have two basic directions in which we work in this theory.
One is about enhancing learning.
The goal is to create an original lecture space where the listener can keep his attention for longer and be able to learn more from the lecture.
We do this as we monitor two critical parameters: one is of attention and the other is alert.
When the degree of these two has fallen enough that we understand that listeners probably get the least of this lecture, then a system of discreet interventions in space is activated, which we have experimentally confirmed in the laboratory, that when they happen, they activate the public and revitalize attention.
So with this Sensponsive intervention we manage the listeners of a lecture to get the most to give and all that remains is the lecture itself to give it.
The other direction is about something mixed.
It has to do with the concept of habitation and the concept of psychological balance.
The aim of this research was how we can undo the negative effects of mild stress and depression, often caused by the intense rhythms of life and work in the modern world.
For a variety of reasons, this research was ultimately more focused on extreme environments, so we found ourselves studying and constructing functional prototypes of a living room for astronauts on the international space station.
[unconscrected] The aim of this system was to understand people's mood in order to change the layout and environmental conditions, so as to help them calm down, better, find themselves in a psychological balance, rest more and endure the continuity of their mission.
In fact, this investigation opened another door.
We were invited to NASA, Houston and especially the Human Research Program, as this is one of the few approaches that really suggests a solution to improve people's living conditions in long-term missions in space.
Something that is designed for the near future.
I think that all these ideas, and especially the application frameworks to which they led, really describe a window into the future.
They describe the application of an interactive architecture that aims to create truly beneficial environments, which are free from negative effects.
I think this should be the vision of technology.
Optimism for a tomorrow, which we think is better.
Personally, in order to keep this visual clear, I write science fiction novels.
so that I can live the worlds I would like to make.
But the key ingredient for all this is ideas.
Ideas are alive and must be diffused.
[idea] Let your ideas spread out, grow, evolve, for only through them can we live the world of tomorrow, today.
Thank you. Thank you.
(Applause)
Good evening! Good evening!
(Authority) Today I would like to talk to you about the value of truth in our daily lives.
Let's start from us here today, which of you remember to have told a truth, we don't have to say which, to a friend, to a partner, to yourself, in the last month, let's say, to raise a hand.
Who has told a truth?
I'm glad, because I didn't know what the public's reaction to this question would be.
But what is it that we call the truth? Many have claimed that truth is a reflection of our reality to which we do not always have access to, for our senses are imperfect.
Others claim that truth is a personal matter, it is subjective to each of us, and it changes with the becoming of our lives.
Today I want to refer to the truth as Heraclitus has defined it, who told us that the truth is the opposite of oblivion, that is, something that needs to be revealed and come out to light.
This truth is linked to many aspects of our daily lives, indeed, it is linked to reality, reveals its aspects, intensifies the understanding and perception of our world, promotes the self-knowledge and authenticity of our personal expression, and very often leads to honesty and decision-making.
On my own personal path the truth has always been linked to architecture and the city.
The theoretical architect Louis Mamford has told us that the final mission of the city is to intensify the conscious participation of man in the universal and historical process.
This proliferation of all dimensions of life, through emotional union, logical communication, technological aristocracies and above all the dramaturgical representation, has been the most important task of the city in history.
This argument made me think that our cities functioned roughly as accelerators, i.e. they accelerate processes, relations, events, in which we exist, with our values and our way of life, that is, the cities create chain reactions that increase our consciousness.
The interesting thing here is the way.
Mumford tells us that this is happening through emotional union, logical communication, technological aristoracy and dramaturgical representation.
Today I will focus more on technological craftsmanship and dramaturgical representation as I have encountered it through my work.
But before we talk about technological craftsmanship, I want to take a step back and look at the tools we use.
According to theoretical architects Beatriz Colomina and Mark Whigley in their book "Are We Human?," they argue that the tools we make finally make us.
They claim, starting with Darwin's theory, that the human hand is what was adapted to his tools, not the opposite.
That is, our relationship with technology is two-way, and they continue to say that human creations are interface surfaces, which as we shape us.
Let's take our mobile phone, which you all know, may have noticed that changes in the design of the device over the years have changed and the way we behave, our habits, have changed even our gaze and our walk, so a technology device can change us.
How could we influence this relationship? If we were probably planning our mobile phone and its applications? What if we were planning all our technological tools?
Maker Movement is a movement that aims to contain technology through the creation of free software and hardware.
About 15 years ago in places such as hacker spaces, Maker spaces and other online communities, groups of inventors, researchers, developers, began sharing technology platforms with the general public and creating new technological tools accessible to everyone.
For example, microprocessors such as Arduino, Arduino lilypad, Raspberry Pie among others, and corresponding programming languages with which we can easily program our own applications and create our own tools.
He managed to bring new tools into the light, to get them out of the black box of technology that was until today for most of us.
Another thing that Maker Movement has achieved is to change our relationship with technology, it has made it a game, and through easy experimentation many of us have come close to technology to play, experiment and often create innovative applications out of nowhere.
One last and very important element that the Maker Movement achieved is that it brought us together.
That is, through the sharing of knowledge, through offline and online communities it brought us together to create, and taught us to operate collectively, in groups.
But what is the value of open technologies in the public space, and especially in the art sector that concerns me? The political scientist Chantal Muf has told us that art in the public space needs to challenge the given order of things, the Status quo.
When technology is used in art, it does not need to repeat the mainstream applications, the mainstream way we use it, but should be used in a different way to create new correlations.
Why? Because we need this pluralism in the public space, because it promotes the dialogue between us.
So open technologies lead us to this direction, because through accessibility and experimentation they allow a large group of users, specialists and amateurs, to engage, to propose new meanings and new representations in the public space.
Speaking of representations, I return to the saying of Mumford, who told us that the dramaturgical representation is important and for the first time I met this concept when I was studying architecture here, at the School of Architecture of Patras several years ago and I wondered which direction to follow.
Among the visual arts, urban design, the architectural landscape, I was a little undecided, at some point I did a project that brought to the surface my love for the cultural landscape, that is, I wanted to explore the relationship of the human body and gaze with its immediate natural and artificial environments through small-scale architecture.
I was also curious about technology and how technology can participate in these experiences, so I went to London to do a corresponding master's degree.
In one of my first works I began to explore these representations and the relationship between natural and artificial.
For example, I created the Wind chime, which is a representation of metal melody.
I don't know if you know it, it's this musical instrument that we put on the porch and it makes a metallic melody when the wind blows.
In my case, in my version, I exchanged the metal pipes with the plastics, the wii remote controls which I programmed to produce metal sounds, imitate them and slowly turn them into noise.
Another representation, I explored through Fabrique, this work, in which I wanted to explore our relationship with a nature that is not natural, a mechanical nature, and to essentially question the concept of nature as we know it, to see what is behind it.
This particular work when watered with light these pots, begins the chains on the roof to move, and in the end they are coordinated in a small choreography.
At some point, in my artistic quest, I decided to follow another path, that of the game.
In 2011, with two partners, we created Athens Plaython.
Athens Plaython is a festival of horror games and new technologies.
At that time in Athens we had very frequent phenomena of violence through marches in the streets of Athens, and they were accompanied by arson and disasters and we wanted to give another voice, an optimistic voice, through play and collectivity.
And we saw our city change, we saw too many, maybe thousands of people in the last special year, coming to play with us for a weekend and we saw the city's space change.
Why does the game have this property, to magically introduce us to an inner world of fiction, for example it can turn the urban space into a battlefield, where various groups may negotiate a neighborhood, or begin to appear mermaons, dragons, knights and so on.
This world of fiction, however, is not independent of the urban space, on the contrary, it contains it.
That is, urban space is enhanced through play, acquires new qualities, which are created collectively.
So at that moment I realized that for me this means of representation, the game, is important, because it brings us all within it, and creates collectives.
Later I created my workshop Entropika together with a team of partners, and we continue to create interactive facilities in public space, for example one of our works, Cloudscapes, creates precisely the representation of a natural phenomenon, cloud and rain.
It essentially simulates the sound of lightning and rain, and light light when passers-by pass by.
It was another opportunity to explore how these representations affect urban space.
Indeed, in this particular work he showed me a truth after many years, that while the first works were more theoretical, with ideas that I had worked out very much, and I particularly liked, a work like this, simpler, with a simpler idea but with a playful mood, it had much greater immediacy with the world, we had children trying to enchant it by shouting abras, we had passersby putting their hood, believing that they would get wet and we had a teenager sitting under the cloud, and as soon as he heard him they thunder.He kept yelling Thor.
(Laughter) On the same street, we continued with the Playstools, where we again explored a little bit the playful dimensions of the objects we were making, and created a hybrid variation of the game musical chairs.
In this game, these stools also have extra properties, we wouldn't just leave the physical objects, each stool has two touch sensors, they have light, they produce sound and communicate with each other through a wireless network, essentially because they facilitate and can get into any space like this.
They invite players to interact with the stools in each round of the game and wins the team that wins the most in color wins.
In fact, the future of this game wants to become an open educational platform where children, perhaps wiser designers than us, can raise their own games and change the rules of the game at will.
At this point I also put an upper dot in January last year, because I decided to go to Matera, Italy, where I work at the Open Design School.
The Open Design School is a pilot project of the cultural capital Matera 2019.
There we are called to design structures for the public space, which serve all cultural events for this and the following year.
These structures can be stands, stand for information, theatrical scenery and so on.
The interesting thing here is that we still use open design tools, that is, through the philosophy of Open structures if you know what they are, it is an online platform, a website and a community where everyone can share their plans, freely without copyright, with the rest of the community, and anyone can develop and re-share them online.
The second interesting thing is that here we are called to plan through play and experimentation, and this follows me.
That is, we are not called to design the well-known structures, such as stands that look like stands, this can be done by anyone.
We are called upon to explore through experimentation and design mysterious, playful objects, which raise questions to the residents and the city, not to give the answers immediately.
So all my course I've seen that I'm very often returning to Mumford's original question, what is the technology we need, what is the technological craftsmanship, and what are the representations we need in the city? And the personal answer I have given is that the technological craft we need must be open and accessible to everyone.
As for the representations, I have seen that many of them need to be participatory, collective and invite us to play with them.
Of course this is my answer, it is my truth, and we don't need each of us to deal with art and technology to see the value of truth in the city.
Mamford at first, if you remembered, had said that the truth in the city also emerges through emotional union and logical communication.
So our cities are us, and regardless of the quality of each, each of us can contribute truthfully to our collective life.
So today I would like to invite you to share a truth with your colleague, with the partner, with a friend, but first of all, I would like to invite you to share a truth with yourself.
Oh, thank you. Thanks.
(Applause)
Because I'm old-cutted, I get the microphone and not the one they put in the ear.
Needless to say, because I see too many young people and I know they've been through panhellenic, I feel like I'm having the same crash, like I have to go through Panhellenic.
However, I prefer as old as I am to be 18 and having to spend time in Greece.
(Laughter) (Authority) I'll tell you a story, a fairy tale that has many starting points.
Many have a starting point in their lives.
I don't know why, I missed too many and every time I started off a new street.
As far as I can remember, I remember myself in Samos, while I was not born in Samos, but I went three years old with my sister who was a year and a half older than me, because our mother had tuberculosis and sent us to my grandfather and her big sister.
For me the whole world was Samos, this was Greece.
The pine trees, the sea, the grandfather - which we thought was an ancient Greek because he was a professor of ancient Greek, was in a pension - only for the ancients he spoke to us, told us myths and we felt that this is a happy place we did not want to lose at all.
And what we saw, most importantly, is that in life, as you put your shoes in the morning, so you have to get a book.
We've always seen our grandfather hold a book in hand.
When our grandfather left, I thought he took everything with him and it was a new starting point.
Soon we went to Athens, we went to school and at school I felt the first thing that is friendship; I became friends with Georges Shari and until her last moment, when she left forever, we stayed friends.
And this, children, to your young people, I tell you that friendship plays a very big role in life.
At school I started reading and in fact, with my sister we loved reading poetry and mainly poems sad: Palamas's "Afykasti and the Impossible of the Tomb I don't give you."
Warry's... And we cried, read them at night and we cried.
And so something went inside me, in case I write a poem.
My mother had a twin brother, a beautiful - both externally and internally - human.
He was a math teacher and he was engaged to a girl who made us very bad because we thought him - he was my godfather - that he belonged to us.
This girl was called and Dido on top, she had a little crooked nose, but she had some eyes that were burning.
This Dido became our great author Dido Sotiriou.
And many may have known her as a writer, but anyone who has not known her as a man has lost much.
At her wedding I wrote a poem.
She smiled, but when I looked at her eyes, it seemed so sad and I made a decision in my life that I wouldn't be a poet.
(Laughter) Well, I'll tell you guys the poem because it's been 82 years and in Brussels I often live, to my daughter, it came to mind one night.
I'll tell you to figure out what poetry saved from what you and I saved yourself from.
"At dawn with the dew, my dear godmother, where I went with the boat a little to swim I saw a white seagull flying joyously run to me told you to go to your godmother Hara, tra la la la la, tra la la (Laughter) (Applause) You thought I lost?
And I'm so glad I didn't.
I forgot to tell you that at the grandfather's house in Samos, in the living room, there was a window and inside was a tiger, the "kaplani."
So they used to say it in Samos and I thought that everyone in Greece knew it when I was writing the book "The Kaplani (of the Showcase)."
Neither Kaplani knew then, nor did I, what role we will both play in our lives.
With Dido we learned a lot of things, she made us want to love something, to be interested in something, to read of course.
The war came and Dido put us in the resistance.
And our first resistance act we did - and Dido told us, "Don't think it's nothing, it's a big thing."
While my father was away at the bank where he worked in the morning and was coming back at noon our house became a yafka.
Dido brought the women of resistance: the Electra executed by the Germans, Melpo Axiotis, Zevgou, Svolou.
They were sitting and when they left - because they smoked like teks - our resistance act with my sister was to open the balcony door, to ventilate the smell of smoke not come home and see that it was such a situation.
We organized ourselves in EPON and so that we remember now, and many times with ZI, while she was alive, we sat and said, "Don't tell anyone that the years of occupation were happy years."
Because we believed in something, because we had a vision, because we believed that we were really helping to liberate Greece.
And we had a vision we were talking about, when the occupation is over, we will live our vision.
Now if it didn't come out, it's another... In the occupation I went to Aidonopoulou's school and we had a teacher in the techniques who wanted to take us out of this sadness and blackness and hunger and go our minds to think about other things and says "Children...." - she'd studied in France at the art school-- we're gonna do puppetry.
He says, "What do you know to do?" I say, "Nothing."
He asked me my name, "I," he says, "are you Alki Zei?"
Because in the school magazine, a little bit of mine was published.
Dimitris Kalavros-Gousiou: A thousand apologies.
Alki Zei: Will you hold it for me?
(Laughter) (Applause) He says to me, "Then write works for the puppet show."
And I sat very simply and wrote works for the puppet show, which we played, and one day he says, "Now look, be very good because some friends will come; for it was the children of the school who were seeing them.
She had a great friend Embirico and brought us, not more or less, Embiricos, Elytis, Marios Ploritis.
Who Marios Ploritis brought a friend of his who was, along with Kun, from the founders of the Kun theatre, who was George Sevastikoglou and became my later partner.
And my sister had been telling me for a long time, "Who are you going to go out with him with the ugly last name?"
(Laughter) Embiricos was thrilled with the puppet show.
And we didn't think we did anything great.
We simply loved this thing that we did.
And when the ones we had, the great people, the poets - who were very simple and very friendly - they invited us to have coffee at Loumidis, and since then we went and listened often.
And there were other girls, I don't know why girls and not boys, they weren't going.
And we listened to them, so, with great joy and learned things.
That is, we learned more from them than from the university.
At EPON we also had a party all night because we couldn't go home late, traffic was forbidden.
And we used to put on a gramophone, we did what we danced so we could print illegal newspapers, press, proclamations and more.
Of course, in the meantime, we were dancing, we were flirting.
On the piano he played all night with a long scarf and we put black raisins in his mouth so he wouldn't be hungry all night.
And this child was Manos Hadjidakis.
(Applause) October 12 is a day that is neither celebrated in Greece nor learning it school, it was the day of liberation.
As far as I can remember, it was the happiest day of my life.
We were freed, which we believed that all our dreams will be.
But it didn't hold many days and the December '44 began, which I wish hadn't existed either in history or in my life.
That's where I knew what a civil war was.
What does it mean to divide in two?
What will the friend say next to me in the desk that I had, when we arrived on foot and went to Volos, and I knocked on her door, she saw me as if she saw her great enemy.
And there I said, it is no longer possible that we do not love each other, the man we were close to.
And all that wildness that December had, I haven't forgotten.
And now when I see the refugees walking miles to get there, I remember how we were walking to get away when December ended, where not sliping bagged there was nothing at the time, we put newspapers and we slept in a lot, they were kicking us from above.
Then I realized what war means.
I wasn't afraid in my life as I was scared in December 1944.
It's over, it's over.
Some liberation came, things started to go smoothly in Greece.
In the meantime I married George Sevastikoglou, I went to the Drama School.
I forgot to say that I was writing short stories and posting them in a magazine called "Young Voice."
I was starting to write.
And because Giorgos Sevastikoglou was very much with Kun, I went to the theater of Kun, and this is the very important thing, in the black occupation Kun learned Iben, American theatre, the real theatre.
With the famine that existed, and his actors and himself were hungry, but they did what is an unforgettable theatre and its roots remain today.
So I pinched a little bit and I'm thinking maybe I'll go out to the theater.
George told me, "I think you should write, write."
I didn't go to the school he was teaching at Rota school, because he was sure he wouldn't take me.
I went to the school of the Athens Conservatory, taught by Roderis and Veakis, and they said that Roderis also made a stake speak.
Looks like he did the stake a little bit and he talked and I finished school.
Meanwhile, a civil war is slowly beginning.
They're starting to arrest people.
George is invited to the army and leaves Greece secretly.
With a boat and I didn't know where he went.
I was also sent a walk in Chios.
There I met the women of Greece, who outside Athens I had not left.
I met women from Mytilene, from Northern Greece, from islands, everywhere.
Women who came not for ideology, had no idea, but they had mainly caught Mytilinias too many, a child who was a guerrilla and brought them there and when they were told that they were free, they cried because they understood that their son had been killed.
I learned there for a year and then I came back.
I almost knew for two years where George was.
Until through the Millliex, who was then in Paris, I got a letter to try to leave Greece to go find him.
At the beginning I didn't know.
They had been taken after the end of the Civil War in Tashkent, and because I'm geographed, my children tell me that if I knew where Tashkent was, they wouldn't have been born.
(Laughter) I managed, anyway, with the many and big means and I got a passport and left.
And I went to Italy, waiting for the Soviet visa, which took two years to come, and I arrived in Moscow.
And when I got off the train and saw that George wasn't expecting me, I got.
I say, "Where do I go, where do they send me?"
Anyway, they received there, neither Russian I knew nor anything, a little French, a little Italian I could communicate.
They put me on a train and there were strange women in uniforms, in costumes, curious people with beards.
And I traveled five nights and four days.
And I passed the Steppa, and every now and then I asked, Tskenden?
Anyway, I'm here.
This time George was waiting for me.
And I learned something that immediately troubled me: that they had not allowed him to come.
Not the Soviets, ours, the Greek party.
He hadn't been allowed to pick me up in Moscow.
A new starting point, this time a little difficult because I had to get used to where I am, who I am, what I do.
I haven't written there, I'm not writing anything, I'm trying to learn the language.
My daughter is born and, fortunately, we're going to Moscow.
Because we were completely isolated from Greece, while in Moscow we could and the ice began to break through the Greek-Soviet association, intellectuals, artists began to come.
And one of the first to come was Embiricos, whom I hadn't seen for 20 years.
And I went to the train to welcome him and the performance that Embiricos had seen - because I was writing parodies, the tears I said, stories of Odysseus altered - and this work he saw was "Kalypso," who was in love with Odysseus and was an intellectual surrealist.
Because we just learned about Surrealism.
And when Odysseus left, she commits suicide and says, "I'm a sad corn."
(Laughter) When the train arrives, the first to go down was Embiricus and, as soon as he sees me, with the 20 years, he says, "Here's the sad corn."
(Laughs) And it's what's left.
Why... (Appointment) I didn't think I was doing anything great and I didn't put on carbon at least, to have a copy.
I left, put them in a basement, they ate the mice and there's nothing left.
In Moscow, I began writing.
I wrote short stories, sent them to the art journal.
And then I wanted to, because I had given birth to my son in the meantime - who was babysittinged by Tarkovsky, because he was a student and he wanted to make a pocket money and through a friend who knew him was babysitting.
(Applause) Maybe that's why he became a director, and from his father of course, but for the cinema he wanted.
I wanted my children to know about Greece.
And what more real stories it would be to tell them my childhood with my sister in Samos.
These were my best memories.
And there he was born "The Kaplani of the Showcase."
I sent it to Greece, it was a publishing one, the Foundation.
I never got an answer.
And in a short time, in a year I take a leave of going with my children for two months to Greece.
I'm going to the foundation.
He was a friend, a very remarkable man, Dimitris Despotidis.
I tell him, "What about that Kaplani?" He says, "Hey, he's in the window."
He had published it and put it in the window.
The Kaplani of the Showcase, I admit, that if it weren't for the teachers, it wouldn't have been released, it wouldn't have been in schools.
Because too many people fought not to get into schools this book and not to go in, of course.
But the teachers stubbornly put it in schools and now it's fifty years that Kaplani has been in school.
And I, of course.
(Actor) We returned to Greece, I with the ten years, my husband with the age of 15.
Let our children know the language again.
They were talking, of course, but let's get used to Greece.
In two years, the Junta took place and we left in Paris.
It's a new starting point.
For two years in Greece I did not write anything.
I only translated for livelihoods.
In France I began to write most of my books: the "Fare of Peter," the "Purple Umbrella," and the Engagement of Achilles, there I began to write it.
Because it was the environment that gave you the opportunity to write.
I went to French schools and I was sorry.
I say, I go to French schools and I can't go to Greek schools.
The Showcase Kaplani has been translated, got prizes, and this gives you an uplift.
And when we came back to Greece, I understood - because when I was writing Kaplani I didn't know that I was writing a book about children, I wanted to tell memories of my childhood.
Now I go to school very much, I go all over Greece, I talk to the children.
And what I tell you to the young people, however crisis I may be - because many times I hear, "We have a war, we have a Junta" - neither war nor a Junta.
It's a difficult time, but it's not compared to the hunger that exists now.
And in the occupation we were hoping for something.
And I wanted to tell you that a little thing, even if you are very small to hope, will slowly become a big puzzle.
And most importantly, be together, love each other and help each other.
This is the best thing we can do today: to stand up to each other.
And material, but also mentally.
Don't let us get depressed, guys.
It's terrible to get depressed as a people.
That's why I think we should have a little flame inside us, a little joy, and then you'll see that everything will be lighter.
I think I've crossed the line.
(Applause)
I wake up in the morning in a warm house.
I'm preparing the family's breakfast, and we're all sitting together to discuss the day's schedule.
Today, the program will be different.
The bags for school are ready.
I say goodbye to my wife, I wish her a good day, and I take my little daughter to her elementary school.
I hug her, I tell her that for whatever she needs during the day she should contact her mom, because I won't be able to talk to her.
I see her passing through the school in the backyard.
I'm leaving, he greets me, in a way we greet a man we're going to have years to see.
After half an hour, I park my car in an area of Athens.
I empty my pockets of various small objects, I only keep one book, my ID, and I turn off my mobile phone.
I'm starting to head to a gate.
I press a button on this gate, and as if by magic, this iron door opens.
Now I'm in a place where it's full of scouts.
In a check, you know, it reminds me of control at the airport when it comes to traveling to another country, to an exotic island, if I've forgotten something in my pockets, I'll have to go back to check.
I give up my ID, my mobile phone, they're holding them to me, and they're giving me a card with a certain color and number.
This card, from now on, will be my passport on this strange island.
If I miss her, I might have a problem getting out of there.
Holding the card in my hands, I feel that now I have to cross my own personal boundaries.
It's like I'm on a cliff, and I'm gonna have to jump into the void.
The first door opens, and then closes her own hermetically behind me.
An iron noise can be heard in my ears.
Successively now there are iron doors that close and open, I pass through detectors, I have lost count, I don't know how many there are.
And slowly something new is beginning to affect me.
It's just a smell.
It's the smell of prison.
Now I'm in front of a last door, which I'm gonna have to open myself, and I'm gonna have to go through a room.
Inside this room, I'm expected to be 20-25 prisoners.
I'll have to meet them.
My mouth was dried out of agony.
I've seen a lot of prison movies, I've seen people who look hard at you with a strange look, criminals, who you wouldn't have anything to say with them, you'd be afraid even if you sit next to them.
All these, the imaginary people, begin to turn into my head like a squirrel, push my thoughts in and threaten me.
I take a deep breath, open the door, and I walk in.
A warm, smiling face comes towards me, a warm handshake disarms me.
He tells me his first name, then 20 men come to me, they tell me their first name, greet me with cordiality, and they ask me if I want tea or coffee.
Then we sit in a circle.
I'm looking at them.
They're looking at me.
And then, I see faces thirsty, excited, hurt.
All those imaginary people I've met outside this door are slowly starting to get out of my mind.
Good morning, they say, "Welcome."
For a year and a half I have been going in and out of Korydallos prison.
My first collaboration was with the treatment center of addicts in ACTION.
After five months, we managed to stage with 18 participants a theatrical performance titled "The guest."
The born-again man.
The new man.
This collaboration and the texts written about it were based on the poem of Kipling "Anni."
The participants wrote their own "Ani."
Since last November I have been participating in a very important effort of Korydallos prisons, the National Theatre, the Ministry of Justice, Transparency and Human Rights, and the General Secretariat for anti-criminal policy for the creation of the first theatre workshop in prisons that will be open to all wings of the prison.
This is very, very important.
(Authortion) When asked if I wanted to take this project I said yes, of course!
Of course I will.
It's time to cross the line, as a man and as an artist.
Then we talked about what I was thinking about doing in relation to this theatre group, then I came to mind a play by William Shakespeare: "The storm."
I chose this writer, why?
His main works are written for bad heroes.
Shakespeare's bad heroes have committed all crimes in the penal code.
They have crossed all limits.
But we applaud them in the theaters.
Thousands of actors every year, all over the world, they earn their wages.
In the storm, of course, there is not even blood drop, all attempted homicides are thwarted.
There are no wars, the action is evolving on a desert island, on a secluded island.
On this island lives the exiled Duke of Milan Prospero, along with his daughter Miranda.
He has been driven out by his brother who had thrown him into the sea.
Prospero, in his 12-year stay on this island, won the greatest achievement a man can achieve.
To become the master of himself, to truly gain free will, and when with the help of the higher spirit Ariel calls through a tempest his wrongdoers on the island, then he can do to them whatever he wants!
To avenge them or forgive them.
Revenge and forgiveness.
Two words that have, believe me, different meaning in prison and different meaning in the outside world.
Temporation is not only an external phenomenon, it is an internal phenomenon of people, choices, located in the extremes, on the edges, located at the extremes, who are looking for boundaries.
Now I'm back in the room.
I look at the participants.
Everyone expects me to say something.
You know, the hardest part for a director in creating a show is the first rehearsal.
And I wonder, what did I come to do here, what can I say to those people who have not experienced it, who have not experienced it? To talk to them about the performances I have staged?
I look at them and I see that I know nothing about their past, I don't know anything about the journey that brought them in there.
They are not actors who came to play a role, but people who came here together to share something important, something we should discover together.
I can't breathe, and I don't know what to say.
I see a clock facing me dangerously, as this one looks at me.
The markers roll, they spend time, and then I say, this clock, looks at me and I feel threatening me.
We already feel very happy, and we start talking about the theatre, I am talking to them about the basic object of theatre, which is the study of man.
This complex machine that we constantly write its user guide, and we don't know exactly how it works.
The limits, the functions, we don't know yet.
In the theater, we can make this choice.
The conversation goes on, and we're already starting to talk about arts, philosophy, painting, dramaturgy, and suddenly I forget that I'm in jail, and I think I'm somewhere, like here.
And then I wonder, these people here, who are opposite me, could very well be scientists, painters, poets, and I can't figure out how they got in there.
And then I understand that the limits to be in prison are very thin: a financial debt, a dark feeling, a choice, a tempest, and the limit is lost.
We immediately begin a powerful improvisation.
Through the group there is a sailor.
I tell him to tell us the adventures he spent in the seas.
He's starting to talk about the Pacific, Atlantic Ocean, and all together in there, with this sailor captain, we begin to create the conditions of a ship as it sinks.
It was a pleasure!
I really felt, both them and I, that we escaped.
We escaped mentally and went to a distant place, on an incredible island.
I could tell you a lot about all those moments I lived with these people as a whole.
By next June when we will raise our performance in Korydallos prison, I will have passed the entrance of the prisons more than 80 times, and I will have collaborated with a total of over 50 participants.
I could tell you a lot.
Many touching human moments that exist even in there.
For this meeting.
But I'll only stay in one.
When Prospero, at the beginning of the play, tells his daughter for the first time, "Now my child, I will tell you who your father is, who is not king, only in a God-made cell; one of the participants approached me at the end of the rehearsal to tell me how moved these words.
They reminded him of the first time he met his child in the prison visits to tell him who he really is.
The rehearsal's over, time's running out, I'm gonna have to go out.
I greet the participants, they greet me too, we succeeded, we managed for a few hours to escape from our prison.
I go out, I get my ID again, my cell phone, and I take a big step out of prison.
No, I'm not gonna turn on my cell phone, I don't want to know who called me, if I have messages, or I'll answer an e-mail.
No, right now I want to enjoy it, I'm out, I'm out again, and I'm starting to look at the sky, listening to the birds, the trees, and the lyrics of the poet Giorgos Sarantaris come along: "I need to go for a walk, with the trees to go for a walk, in a world of ymata waters."
I would like this experience to share with the walkers who walk around me.
I look, I see them, and I see sad people, bent faces, but is it possible? I was now in prison and those I see, who think they have no limit, who think they are free, do they have the right to be sad? To be sad, to be imprisoned in their views, in their attitudes, in their attitudes, in life?
I wonder if freedom is an internal or external affair.
If they in there may be incarcerated, but truly free, we here may ask ourselves if we are truly free.
If freedom means the coming of boundaries, then free is the man who has limits.
Who is looking for boundaries.
Every time it sets new limits, to overcome them afterwards.
I'm getting in the car.
I take out of my pocket the book, I open it, and I see a dedication: Voice: "To our director who helped us escape with the art of theatre, and who personally helped me remember again who I am."
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
I'm going to try not to be tempted and talk about everything that happened this morning.
Let me tell you the moment the counterterrorism goes home...
Well, leave it.
Let's go to the established ones.
(Voices) Let's get started.
Well, this is my school.
It's this little shop there in the corner, under a working-class apartment building in Agia Varvara.
I want the translators to be a little careful in this last because there is often a confusion with Saint Barbara.
(Laughter) Let me tell you a story.
A few years ago I was invited to college, only as a guest I could go, along with Dimitris Papaioannou, of the Olympic Games, to choose the best student, who makes nice speeches, etc., and at some point I get to the American director of the college, a gentleman with straps, bow tie, tummy, a little red nose, but very, like, American, and he says, "What school have you finished?"school in St. Barbara.
"Oh, Santa Barbara College!"
(Laughter) I left him with the question, I made a nod anyway, I didn't keep talking.
All right, St. Barbara.
This is the school, this is the tutorial.
It was a basement, there was a first floor, but the lessons on the first floor were more expensive.
That's the ballroom, it was in a much better view.
Thefts of Thunderstorms.
"Thunderbolt" was also the athletic team of the gypsies of Saint Barbara.
It's irrelevant information.
This is through the...
I'm not here anywhere.
Because I've always had a problem.
I liked to participate more in the screening, to photograph, etc., than to play.
Unresponsibly, I will tell you that Agia Varvara was a very nice area, that is, I grew up very beautifully, there were, of course, various accidents.
There was, however, camping, there was a stinging that we were playing, there was Koutalianos, the older ones may remember him, who was pushing the cars.
These are all my pictures.
I'm not on the bikes either.
Fifteen years old, we all got a motorcycle.
I took a Vespa, I said my father was leaving me etc., the usual lies you're telling, anyway, I took the Vespa, after a week, I turned it back.
They say to me, "What happened?" I tell them, "Hey, there's a problem with this Vespa."
The Vespa, you remember, the old one, had the speeds on the steering wheel, one, two, three, four, right?
I say, "Look, when I put first, I start too fast, but then I can't finish, while if I put on a fourth, I find it hard to start, but then it runs a lot."
I mean, I thought the manufacturer was giving me a choice.
That is, one morning I start with the first, one day to start with a second, one to a third, a fourth.
I'm saying this because that's how we learned things.
I mean, we were learning, wrong, we kept going.
That's how we learned journalism.
Well, we're talking about... Oh, because we're talking about Vespas and I want to pause, because along with our mistakes, we had the little lies, the little myths.
I'm going to the painless one today.
We've all heard that first Wegge's said, "Do you know from a vespa?"
So, from a very young age I had noticed in that film the black and white that Veggos drives this or leads this.
Little to know about a machine, you know this isn't a Vespa.
And because I know something more, I tell you that he's a Zhoudap.
The Zudab was a machine that came out in the 60s-'70s.
In '84, the German Zudab went bankrupt, and then bought it by the Chinese.
So, since then, there has been a bankruptcy and a German and a Chinese.
In other roles, though.
Well, it's... (Laughter) (Applause) We are talking, however, we are talking about going back to our history, in 1981, very old times.
A long time ago? I wonder at times.
Because I have the feeling that too many times, reality makes a lupe.
That is, the same persons, the same facts and just the subtitles change.
I don't know if you agree.
Be careful.
PASOK, 1st Athens, Manolis Glezos.
The elections of 1981.
Manolis Glezos, of course, emancipator, then of power, as he is the executor of power today.
And then me with a doodoo, today with a microphone, a small variation.
Well, we're talking about 1981, to withdraw this, it's wrong.
We are talking about 1981 and I want to move to the protagonists of today, starting with my friend, the boy.
Let's go. Let's go.
Stavros Theodorakis: What are we going to talk about? Kyriakos: For the school.
I was just talking about girls.
K: But the school precedes.
T: Okay, the school.
What class are you going?
ST: Tuesday.
I learned a good student, huh? P.S.: The favorite lesson? K: Mathematics.
K: If you know,ucosia, it's not difficult.
T: You know good education, don't you?
Tell me, let's say eight.
Which makes it harder for me to eight.
K: Oh, eight have not learned, we have learned of the six, the five.
ST: Tell me six.
K: One six, six, two six, six eighteen, four twenty-four, five thirty, six or six thirty, six or six thirty-six, seven or six forty-two, six or eight forty-eight, nine or six fifty-four.
HP: Nice.
K: A few tens, a few nines.
Nine and up I have.
In mathematics, of course, ten.
Q: So, will you become a mathematician? What will you become? K: Master of mathematics.
A, teacher of mathematics.
Do the younger children hear you?
Q: What do you say to them? K: Be quiet.
I'm asking you something difficult now.
K: Yes.
If you could change something in your life... K: Mmm.. K: I would like the environment to be cleaner and to see more often my whole family, my father, my mom and my brother.
This is my friend Kyriakos.
There is an opinion that the worst family is better, it is preferable to the best institution.
I personally disagree with this view.
Kyriakos lives in the OCC, has been abandoned by his parents at the OCC of Perissos, and since he was abandoned, "Anthice," hanging out with children who have been taken by prosecutors or their parents.
Kyriakos has many dreams, as you can see, as do the other children of the OCC.
That is, all the time, what they say is not what they have been through, it is what they will achieve or what they are achieving right now.
Cheylan.
STH: There in Thessaloniki, did you have problems? The style is Muslim, the peasant.
Cheylan: Well, no.
Oh, thank God, no.
Okay, racism, there's no, so the whole department is talking to me, talking, talking, doing, rifting and knowing me.
T: I tell them what is happening in the village.
And they like it.
STE: How do you justify not knowing the language well? Or you don't know it... T: I don't know her that well.
STE:...with accent.
You know her very well... T: Yes.
Oh, thank you. Thanks.
ST: You talk very well.
T: Thank you.
T: I tell them that I am Muslim, that my parents don't speak Greek, that I know to read Arab, Pomakika I speak, Turkish I know very well, and that's why I am not so good at pronunciation and they understand me.
Chilan: But I like the village.
I do what I want.
Whatever madness comes to me.
I get up, I go down Xanthi, I go down Thessaloniki, I can pick them up, we can gather at home, do whatever madness we want, watch a movie, go out.
No problem, no restriction.
Okay, you may be a girl who knows what you're doing, you don't do what you're forbidden, but you can do whatever you want.
If you know what you're doing.
So I like being in the village.
I'm having a good time.
ST: Well, Cheylan is from almost Bulgarian borders, Pomakochoria.
An area so close, but so far away.
By '96, you'll know, to go to these villages you had to get special permission from the army.
Now, it's a big deal, because we were afraid of these people.
The important thing is that Cheylan has found a very simple trick.
When he gets on the bus to Thessaloniki, he takes off the scarf and the colorful clothes, he wears some other sportiest.
He studies in Thessaloniki Economics and aspires in two years from now to open the first accounting office of a local in those villages.
Let's go see Katherine.
A dose in the morning?
But every day.
I'm being granted, drinking it, and I'm leaving.
NHS: Don't they trust you to give you home? K: I don't think that's it.
It's the program strict.
This is one of the most closely in Greece.
They have lost administration for a minute.
And there's not a minute or a half.
You're not granted, you're sick all day.
And he's more deprived than heroin, methadone.
K: I expect, basically, that a lot of things go well in my life before I start coming down.
That is, if I am again with Panagiotis and I see these things, I don't know if in the end I will be so strong and I still have patience to continue like this.
T: Relationships; Panagiotis: Relationships; STE: Do you have?
Elsewhere is my mind.
Q: What? Katherine: Well, we sleep together like two friends... K: ...for a long time.
P: It's somewhere else.
Degrading, but it's somewhere else, son, okay.
Humiliating, not for masculinity and good, humiliating in general.
STE: Katerina was in the dope, in heroin for eight years, at some point she decided it alone, entered a program of substitutes.
He's done it.
Of course, in a country where it's much easier to find heroin on the street than substitutes or medication to quit drugs.
Katerina's big bet is whether she will go back to her friend's world or whether her boyfriend will return to her own world.
Let's go see Marina.
Marina: I will never forget that moment when the loudspeakers shouted: "Litvinova, he is released."
Which, say, came out, the whole wing to say goodbye.
From the emotion and tears, I couldn't see, I didn't know faces, only when they were hugging me and giving me the wish in my ear, I was trying to figure out who she was.
That day I had a lot of wishes.
I think so far they've accompanied me and give me strength.
Does prison ever turn like a nightmare? M: Very often.
And in the smallest things, I often think about prison.
When I get out of the house and lock the door and play with the keys in my hand and go to work or university, I'm filled with joy.
And I thank God.
That I have keys, where I have a home, where I'm busy.
It's like a dream that I'm living.
Marina spent about three years in prison.
At first, he was very afraid of the isovisions.
Then, at some point, he thought about making a handkerchief for the child of a life-saving woman who had a birthday.
Since then, he has been approaching them.
He put them in line, at some point, he says, "I put them in the line and I gave them pedicures and I took phone cards."
You wash my clothes and I give you a pack of cigarettes.
Spare economy.
The main thing is that Marina got out of prison, entered law school and is one of the few cases that she got a large compensation from the Greek state because she was in prison unfairly.
For every day he was in prison, about three and a half years, he received 25 euros from the Greek state.
And last is Dimitris.
ST: That is, in the morning you feel a little taller than the others who are hugged in the streets, hy? Dimitris: Why are you free.
And you're not trapped in smallties.
You see them a little like God, from above, from a distance.
People are like looking for problems.
D: Now, we're planning with the Cuban kids just want me to do my treatment before I'm ready to be ready there.
N: No, more heat.
Because we're struggling in the heat.
But it's worth it.
Dys: I met him, such days, last year.
Dimitris suffers from a very rare disease, cystic fibrosis, which is the deadliest hereditary disease of the white race.
When he was born, life expectancy was ten years.
He turned 20, turned 30, and now the doctors think he'll be 40.
Dimitris, when he learned that the limits are too small instead of abandoning the weapons, entered Architecture, founded a club that changed Sismanoglio, that is, many children of cystic fibrosis dynamically changed the conditions of treatment in Sismanoglio and continues and, of course, I believe that he will defeat all the statistics.
Dimitris, therefore, who fights and defeats death, Marina, who goes against the mistakes of the state, the children who try to correct their mistakes, Cheylan who goes against the conservative environment of the country and her community and my friend who is trying to defeat the social exclusion.
That's what I wanted to tell you tonight.
I wanted to tell you that there is also the old road.
That man has a momentum that can make him defeat the exclusion, the stillness, perhaps death.
The thirst, that is, for what we do not have can lead you against the river and take you across.
(Applause) In the past, our socialization was the work of the family.
Exclusively.
Then the school was added.
Then the media was added.
Social media is being added.
Just a little parenthesis.
I wonder too many times if I grew up in an environment where everything was in front of me.
If, I found, I've discovered pages by pressing the key on a keyboard.
Did this discovery be enough for me and I didn't go to the next discovery?
What I want to say, closing, is that television, as the most powerful medium, must, among other things, give space to this momentum.
That is, he needs to teach people to listen to their momentum.
That's what I think I'm doing with the "Protagonists" or rather, to be precise, that's what my protagonists and I do, believing that the momentum can successfully counteract the immovable fate.
Oh, thank you. Thanks.
(Applause)
