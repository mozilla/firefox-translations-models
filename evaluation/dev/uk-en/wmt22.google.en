Thanks in advance.
In Kherson, people again went to a rally, the Russians did not have time to disperse them
As the participants of the event told the agency, the people of Kherson managed to hold a rally before the Russian military with equipment arrived on the scene to disperse them.
&quot;We managed to hold a rally. Now Russian equipment has arrived there,&quot; said one of the participants of the event.
Previously, the townspeople traditionally gathered for protest actions on Svobody Square - near the building of the Regional State Administration and the Regional Council.
This square, as well as the building, is currently controlled by armed Russian troops, who use weapons against the participants of the rallies and kidnap people.
As reported, on April 3, armed Russian occupiers used weapons against peaceful demonstrators in Kakhovka.
As Ukrinform reported, residents of Donetsk region regularly hold peaceful protests against the Russian aggressor.
The Russian military uses force and weapons against people, and there are wounded and detained.
Also, Russian invaders kidnap residents of the region.
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy awarded Kherson with the special title &quot;Hero City&quot;.
On February 24, Russian President Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Russian troops shell and destroy key infrastructure facilities, carry out massive shelling of residential areas of Ukrainian cities and villages using artillery, rocket launchers and ballistic missiles.

Helloüëãüèª I&#39;m sick, so it will be better to postpone our meeting to next weekend, sorry.
I know how to cook, the main thing is to have a recipe, but I like to bake pastries.
Borscht, dumplings, and others are traditional in Ukraine.
I don&#39;t have favorite dishes, I like to try different dishes from different countries.
What are your food preferences? do you like to cook

Zelensky: Mariupol is the heart of the war, stop fighting - we will have weak positions
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy believes that the battles for the east of Ukraine and, in particular, for Mariupol, will determine the course of the war - and if the Armed Forces are defeated there, the Russians can leave the negotiations and re-occupy the de-occupied territories.
Direct speech: &quot;Mariupol is, you know, the heart of this war today.
It fights - we fight, we are strong.
If it stops fighting, we will have weaker positions.
They (defenders of the city - ed.) are people who have drawn a large number of the enemy to themselves.
The stronger our position in Mariupol, the stronger our position will be in the east of the country, in (the region of) OOS, and if they are stronger, then the negotiating table will be closer for us and we will have advantages in dialogue with the Russian Federation.
If our situation is weak in all these directions, then we may not wait for the meeting.
Because then Russia will take all these steps that may lead to a return even to those cities that we have now deoccupied.
They can go for that too.
Then our situation in the negotiations will be weaker and, perhaps, not even interesting for the Russian side.
Unfortunately, we state.
We believe in our result, in our victory...&quot;
Details: Zelenskyi also said that it is difficult to go to negotiations after the torture of Ukrainians, but &quot;we must not lose the opportunity for a diplomatic solution, if we have them.&quot;
Direct speech: &quot;People will accept peace either way because people want this war to end.
On our terms, on the terms of Ukraine&#39;s independence, but... every family has lost something - and I don&#39;t think that any peace on any terms will satisfy them.
But if we do not speak emotionally, the war must end in peace or end in millions of casualties.
And even where there are a million victims, everything comes to the end of the war.
Yes, we must fight - but for life.
You cannot fight for dust when there is nothing, there are no people.&quot;
Good afternoon, do you still have places available for the Czech course for adults from 19:00 on Tuesday?

In connection with the change in the aesthesis of Ukrainian literature, new concepts were needed to describe its new qualitative state.
It is the analysis of the metaphorical space of Ukrainian literature, the study of the state

The Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine published a list of Russian servicemen who participated in the commission of war crimes in Bucha, Kyiv region.
As reported by Ukrinform, the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine announced this on Facebook.
&quot;Every Ukrainian should know their names!
The GUR of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine obtained a list of servicemen of 64 separate motorized rifle brigades who directly participate in the commission of war crimes against the people of Ukraine in the city of Bucha,&quot; the message reads.
The GUR of the MoU notes that all war criminals will appear before the court and be prosecuted for the crimes committed against the civilian population of Ukraine.
You can view the list at the link.
As reported by Ukrinform, Irpin, Bucha, Gostomel and the entire Kyiv region were liberated from the Russian invaders.
Mass murders of civilians by the Russian military were recorded in the liberated towns and villages.
On April 1, the mayor of Buchi, Anatoly Fedoruk, announced that 280 people were buried in mass graves.
Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova said that on April 3, 410 bodies of killed civilians were removed from the territory of Kyiv region liberated from the Russian invaders.

Good afternoon, I apologize, but I will not be able to work for you, because I will be flying to Canada in the near future.

Let them wrap you in their blanket of love and warmth this night.
My heart belongs to you.
Do you mind if I come right after the war?
place, day and time will be specified according to interests and possibilities
We promised that when you go to school, we will bring you a surprise.
It was wonderful, I have money for two months of rent, in Olomouc the district does not matter, I will be very grateful.
Most of my acquaintances are deeply shocked by the news about the brutal abuse of the civilian population north of Kyiv.
Photographs of tortured and shot people confused the entire civilized world.
Dozens of people question each other, how could this happen in the 21st century?! As?!
But nothing surprised me at all. Exactly what I was waiting for with sadness is happening...
I took children and elderly parents out of Kyiv on the second day of the war.
Then the girls-colleagues with children, and only after that he returned to the capital to work.
Since 2014, he has consistently helped the Armed Forces of Ukraine and never doubted for a moment that in the event of the occupation of the suburbs of Kyiv, my family would not be spared.
Because I was and remain absolutely sure that the essence of the rotten Communist-KGBist regime has remained unchanged since 1918.
It simply cannot exist without terror, it is built on terror.
In 1937, one of my great-grandfathers was shot in the Zhytomyr prison.
A few years ago, the Zhytomyr SBU had a copy of the great-grandfather&#39;s shooting case removed: the whole case is more than a hundred pages long, but the death sentence is very simple and even more terrifying.
The accused was illiterate, denied guilt.
An ethnic Pole, a Catholic, he had five children, he was from free people, a poor &quot;one-court&quot; nobility, he had never been a serf.
The fact that they lived on farms and had several cows was enough to sentence the plowman and the feeder of young children to death.
Relatives did not even learn about the burial place.
The grandmother said that almost a hundred people were taken from the village and killed except for two who agreed to give false testimony.
In the criminal case, the knocker&#39;s surname is Shariy.
Our former speaker of the Verkhovna Rada comes from a neighboring village.
I believe in genetics and would not be surprised if his relative was a KGBist informant.
As you know, the apple does not fall far from the apple tree...
The firing squad that sentenced the villagers to execution were ethnic Russians.
Analyzing the case of his great-grandfather, he became interested in various information resources.
There are excellent (no sarcasm) informational resources in Russia, such as &quot;Bessmertny barak&quot;, which qualitatively remind of the events of those years.
So, in modern Russia, the descendants of the NKVD found ways to punish and exterminate almost everyone who seriously investigated the crimes of their ancestors 70-80 years ago.
The system first discredited and then destroyed people who found mass graves of victims of Stalinist repressions and publicly wrote the names of the murderers.
Apparently, files with child pornography were found on the computer, he was put in prison for it, and he quickly died there.
KGB agents are still killing those who try to find out the truth about the crimes of the last century.
So why are you suddenly surprised by their actions now?!
The most despicable features of human nature are concentrated there.
Slavery and imperial chauvinism of the 16th-19th centuries were superimposed on the thousand-year Horde tradition.
And then on what came out, they did a beastly genetic experiment, cutting out the intelligentsia during several waves of red terror.
Watch the semi-French film &quot;Chekist&quot; from 1992, that&#39;s how it was.
Have you seen my photos in a swimsuit?
Can you ask my wife what I can buy for a cough?

Love, Igor asks if it is convenient for you to go tomorrow? (he has the day off and can go, because the car hasn&#39;t been looked at at the station today).

We arrived at the place where we were settled from the center in Pardubice, the conditions are good.
But there is a big but, men live here who drink alcohol and smoke indoors, loud music is the least that &quot;disturbed&quot;, the smell of cigarettes, drunk men and we with children... it&#39;s scary to go to bed, to be honest.
Please help with housing, for money, please.
But where it will be safe and not smoked.
The smell of cigarettes in the rooms is such that they are smoking right here.
I&#39;m begging you, one of them is barely standing, he&#39;s shouting something, he doesn&#39;t like something. Very scary.

I forgot to write you, sorry.
Everything went very well yesterday.
We talked about children with special needs and the system of their education in Ukraine.
When Mrs. Shakhova introduced me as an employee of Fpoint, the first question was how they found the dog, how they found the pug.
Everyone follows the Facebook page.
They asked me to convey my greetings to you and to say that it is very interesting for them to read the news.
They also talked about people of Roma nationality, which they have privileges in Ukraine.
And we agreed that if a child comes and the parents do not understand Czech at all, then after work I can help them over the phone.
I need to change the bed linen, 2 sets.
It suits me especially on holidays.

The queue for General Chapek there is very slow.
Everyone has a chance.
The main thing is that the love is real and mutual.
I don&#39;t know how it is in Europe, but in our country people get married for various reasons, mostly for selfish, mercantile purposes.
And I have a problem with this, if I don&#39;t love a person, nothing will work.
Yes, we took it home and took it to my aunt right away.
She thanked me very much, she even cried.
I told her about you and how you help Ukrainians.
There were tears in her eyes.
She said that if it was possible, there might still be some old blanket and pillow.
But it is not necessary. Only if there is. I am also very grateful to you.
I really felt sorry for him.
My best friend was killed in front of him.
I had many questions to God, why there were situations in my life that just made me despair in everything.
Do small grocery stores work? I need to buy bread and other products.
I just decided to go and you made the meeting
This is true, but we have not yet orientated ourselves in the area and do not know where everything is. Today we looked for a supermarket for an hour and returned on foot. Two blankets are not suitable, so we need two large ones
Even now, I was thinking about you, and you wrote to me.
Does your dad only know how to communicate in Russian or someone else in the family?
It is possible for children to come to Vali and play in the hall
Well, let&#39;s take a risk then :)
I am also glad to have met you
For housing, I talked to Volodymyr and consulted whether to wait for me until they found it or to look for it myself. The ladies who live with us also told us that we should go to the museum metro station. There is an institution there that helps us find housing.
For the sake of the little one, I will cross the barrier üòÇüôÉüòÇ
I didn&#39;t even know the answers to some of their questions
That would be good for Thursday, if possible
I can&#39;t call the doctor because I haven&#39;t taken the food license test yet.
But I can&#39;t call him because my account ran out of money.
I can&#39;t top up my phone because I don&#39;t understand Czech online banking, and I can&#39;t top up from a Ukrainian bank card.
In the Vodaphone application, I cannot change the tariff so that I have normal calls and Internet, or top up the number.
I&#39;m already going crazy
Where the price is not the cheeks, but the face... The title does not sound right, what did you mean?
I am ashamed to sit without work
I just wrote that I&#39;m in class at school
Sorry to bother you, I was just really worried
But it is already closer to the time they leave the borders of Ukraine to know exactly what they will reach.
Because now everyone&#39;s life is in question.
So. Size for 10-11 years. But our sizes do not match. Everything must be measured
I am looking for everything for the home and for the children.
Thanks to the people who accepted me, I live in a chapel, they always ask if I need something, but I am ashamed to say, I ask to find it myself.
I just came home, I&#39;m having breakfast now :)
Don&#39;t explain anything, please pretend I&#39;m not there
impossible to answer without resume sent
I won&#39;t be able to tell my mother that :)
And I&#39;m actually a bit uncomfortable now that I couldn&#39;t hold back my feelings before we left the apartment.... Like last night....
God grant that Yura will fall asleep üôè maybe then I will lie down immediately and get some sleep.
I will write to you in any case.
Hello. Susana, help. I received the payment for March. Is it for the two of us with Yulia or just me, I can&#39;t figure out why such an amount.
Yes, you can make copies of passports when it&#39;s convenient for you :)

I turned to Caritas, they offered temporary housing for a week - two, but I need permanent housing where I can be with my child, and why are there fewer and fewer
The flowers are blooming. Everything is fine. Everyone is rested and very beautiful.
As &quot;European Truth&quot; reports, Welt writes about this with reference to sources in government circles of Ukraine.
According to the publication, the corresponding offer was sent to the Ministry of Economy of Germany on Saturday.
The cost of 100 howitzers, including the training kit and spare parts, is 1.7 billion euros.
Howitzers are also offered in the version for the Boxer armored personnel carrier for 1.2 billion euros.
While tanks in battle have to get relatively close to enemy targets, the Panzerhaubitze 2000 can fire at a distance of more than 30 kilometers.
As reported by Ukrainian government circles with reference to KMW&#39;s proposal, the supply of self-propelled howitzers will take place on a circular basis.
The Bundeswehr will provide Kyiv with 100 of its howitzers as soon as possible, and the resulting gaps will then be filled by industry in the second stage.
The first new howitzers can be delivered 30 months after the signing of the contract, that is, before the second half of 2024.
Full supply will not be completed until 2027.
And is it us in the first half of the day, or in the second half of the day together?
Thank you, we will find a way to replenish the account and let&#39;s go. I will write you back. thank you

Tell me how to get to the city center?

For me, marriage is a sacrament of two people who do not discuss each other with their relatives or friends.
A man and a woman themselves decide the issues in their family, especially without the participation of relatives.

hello, sorry, I just woke up, I didn&#39;t sleep well
Sorry to bother you.
I was upset that Kolya and I had a bad start translating the test yesterday.

Maybe I can be of some use to them?
If there is such an opportunity, I want to tighten up the math terms over the weekend.
Geometry is generally difficult, but we have to work with Kolya so that there are no mistakes.
Thank you for the test tasks
We also really hope for that
And so she is very happy with any gift
I wanted to connect the Internet to my Czech number
Yesterday, at the stop of bus 402, I met a Ukrainian woman - Victoria.
This girl is a child, but here she is alone... her eyes are full of tears and grief...
I couldn&#39;t stay away.
Now we have agreed that we will be friends.
And last night I thanked God for this girl, because she is the first person from Ukraine with whom my heart felt reciprocity.
The branch in hall No. 29 is designed specifically for submitting and processing applications for assistance
it turned out that I ordered a spare card
It&#39;s not worth it, I&#39;m a simple person
So that she would not be afraid that no one would come
I didn&#39;t go. Yes, I baked it myself. I can do it! The main thing is that you taught me how to turn on the oven.
So you are leaving the city for a long time?
Half a year ago, at the Babyn Yar Holocaust Memorial Center in Kyiv, we commemorated the 80th anniversary of the mass shooting of Ukrainian Jews by German soldiers in Babyn Yar.
I had the honor to speak after three heads of state, including the German president.
He spoke about &quot;the common basis of international law and human dignity, the freedom of people to choose their own path and life in territorial integrity, a peaceful and secure Europe.
We have to protect this foundation - it is also part of our responsibility related to our history.&quot;
If &quot;the evil demons of the past appear today in new clothes,&quot; he said, &quot;there can be only one answer for us Germans: never again!&quot;
The struggle must continue.&quot;
Today, Russia attacked a peaceful country, bombs and kills thousands of civilians, starves the inhabitants of the cities blocked by it and lets them die of diseases.
Russian troops carry out mass executions of Ukrainians, even visually it resembles the executions in Babi Yar.
For over a month, Germans have been seeing it on the news in real time.
Yes, Germany implements sanctions, provides humanitarian aid, as well as weapons, which was unimaginable not so long ago.
Germany is delaying the delivery of heavy weapons needed by Ukraine.
But &quot;Never again!&quot; means not only to oppose the swastika.
This means fighting by all possible means against mass murder, genocide, war crimes and atrocities.
There is no easy way without risks and sacrifices to defeat evil and stop the atrocities taking place in Ukraine.
One song for you at night
We agree, agree on an excursion, and write when to be collected
Everyone was sick, only Lydia was not sick, they had omicron, a new type of covid
Then I will do it tomorrow
I use this coupon instead of a ticket
Call for delayed documents.
The ticket cost me 2000 hivna from the conductor
Serhii Sydorenko: Our membership in NATO is no longer a distant prospect
9 years ago, Ukrainian sociology showed that 67% of Ukrainians were against joining NATO and only 18% of respondents were in favor.
After the Revolution of Dignity, the escape of Viktor Yanukovych, the annexation of Crimea and the start of the Donbas war, the number of opponents of NATO began to fall, while the number of supporters, on the contrary, increased.
After the start of a full-scale war with Russia, Ukrainian sociologists recorded a record level of support for Ukraine&#39;s accession to NATO among Ukrainian citizens - more than 75%.
Despite the support for Ukraine&#39;s accession to NATO and the help that NATO provides in wartime conditions, there is now a lot of criticism of the Alliance and its member countries - for the untimely delivery of weapons, the refusal to close the sky, the unwillingness to &quot;annoy&quot; Russia.
In addition, there is a great risk that Ukraine will be forced to give up its desire for membership in the Alliance due to the position of the Russian Federation, if it can stop the war, and Ukraine will receive reliable security guarantees, including military ones.
In the new episode of the &quot;Damn Questions&quot; podcast, together with the editor of &quot;European Truth&quot;, we talk about exactly how the Alliance has helped Ukraine since the Russian invasion, why NATO should be criticized, and why the Alliance is criticized in vain, why our prospect of NATO membership is close , than ever before in history and why the security guarantees being negotiated in the negotiations with Russia may become the second Budapest memorandum.
What do you think is here?
In my volt partner, it is marked that my application is pending.
I submitted it through this mobile application

Denis left today in a good mood.
I arranged with a boy from Ukraine, whom I met yesterday, to meet near the school so that he could show him everything.
So I hope he&#39;s okay

Ukraine reports that the Czech Republic sent T-72 tanks and infantry fighting vehicles to Ukraine
I go, leave the children alone, wait there for 3-4 hours and go home because I can&#39;t leave them any longer.
And take with you for 6-7 in the morning
Yes, there was a sick heart.
I had sincere feelings for this person, but he did not act very decently and I left him.
After some time he came back again and asked for my forgiveness.
I refused him.
Then after a while he called that he had undergone heart surgery.
I asked him just to talk, I felt sorry for him.
I supported him psychologically for almost six months.
During this time we talked a lot.
At the same time, I started having problems at work.
His support also helped me at that time.
Such mutual help.
And I thought, maybe we really need to look at him differently.
And he proposed to me, and two days later he died.
Therefore, God himself decided our destinies.
What does ready for marriage mean to you?
And he speaks only Czech
I wanted to say that I managed to find a place to live, and I am very happy about it ‚ò∫ now I have a place to live and I have a place to be with my baby.

God is never late, everything has its time and place.
I don&#39;t think he wants to rob me :)
I perfectly understand the price of unskilled labor and I understand that I will not be able to have the kind of work I had at home in Kyiv, and the money I earned at home, I will not receive here either.
But I can&#39;t just sit and do nothing, because then all kinds of bad thoughts creep into my head, so I have to occupy myself with some kind of physical activity

He comes to visit you
Please tell me, do you have at least an approximate schedule for cleaning the apartments for a month ahead, at least for an approximate understanding of which days?
I can&#39;t remember this schedule)
The Russian army threatens to launch missile strikes on Kyiv: they say &quot;they have never done this before&quot;
Konashenkov&#39;s direct speech: &quot;We see sabotage attempts and strikes by Ukrainian troops on objects on the territory of the Russian Federation.
If such cases continue, then the armed forces of the Russian Federation will strike at decision-making centers, including in Kyiv, from which the Russian army previously refrained.&quot;
The Russians have been launching missile attacks on Kyiv since the first days of the full-scale invasion of the Russian occupation forces into Ukraine.
On February 25, remnants of Russian missiles shot down by the Ukrainian air defense system fell on an apartment building in Poznyaki, the capital.
On February 26, a Russian rocket hit a high-rise building on Valery Lobanovsky Avenue.
On March 1, the Russians hit the television tower in Dorohozhychy near Babyny Yar, as a result of which 5 passers-by died.
On March 2, Ukrainian air defense systems shot down Russian missiles flying in the direction of the Ministry of Defense building over the Southern Railway Station.
On March 14, fragments of a downed missile of the occupiers crushed a house and a trolleybus on Kurenivka in Kyiv
On March 18, a Russian rocket hit a residential area in Vynogradar, killing one person and injuring 19 others, including four children.
On March 21, Russian rockets completely destroyed the modern Retroville shopping center in Vynogradar, as a result of which at least 4 people died.
Kyiv Mayor Vitaliy Klitschko once again stated on April 13 that it is still too early for residents of the capital who were evacuated from the city to return.
The military explained to the local authorities that the Russians could still launch missile strikes on Kyiv, and besides, there were a lot of mines and unexploded ammunition on the outskirts of the capital.
The Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine warned on April 12 that the Russians are planning to launch a series of terrorist attacks on the territory of the Russian Federation in order to blame the Ukrainians and justify the brutality of the Russian army against the civilian population.
On April 1, an oil depot exploded near Belgorod in Russia, allegedly as a result of an air attack by Ukrainian helicopters.
At the beginning of April, the local authorities of Belgorod announced that a &quot;Ukrainian projectile&quot; had allegedly fallen near the city.
It is obvious that elites in both Washington and Berlin are breaking out in a cold sweat at the very thought that NATO fighter jets will shoot down Russian bombers in the sky over Ukraine.
But Zelensky does not speak so much to them as to their voters and societies in general.
With his speeches in parliaments and in front of thousands of crowds in the squares of Europe&#39;s largest cities, the Ukrainian leader is doing something that was not available to any of his predecessors.
Zelensky does not convince European politicians to do everything for Ukraine, he convinces the European peoples who elect those politicians.
And these speeches, this sophisticated blend of power, poignancy and sometimes despair, gradually achieve their goal.
While the same Biden is categorically against closing the sky, 70% of his fellow citizens already support this idea.
Although Paris or Brussels are against the acceleration of Ukraine&#39;s accession, this process is already underway.
I understand you, that&#39;s why we don&#39;t want to be considered scammers.
The money you collect is better given to people in greater need.
I can come to you and we will decide on the spot. I still want to help

I have a lot to say today, so I ask for your patience.
Are you doing well with your imagination??
You live your normal life, go to work, plan shopping, vacation.
You have dreams.
You are planning to buy that dress you saw yesterday at the mall.
Tomorrow night, after work.
Your brain can&#39;t handle it.
He clings to the old reality.
You call work to find out whether you should go to work today or not.
You decide to leave the children at home.
Until something becomes clear.
There is hope... it won&#39;t last long.
Now ... they will agree ... something will happen.
The brain refuses to perceive...
Where to go?? I have no one and nowhere.
I have $50 in my pocket. We spent everything we had at home.
Many people were not paid by our managers at our jobs.
Where should I go?? Who needs me? How should I provide for my children? Where should I live?
You cannot take many things.
You didn&#39;t take anything from home... you have 1000 kilometers to go.
You don&#39;t know if you will have something to feed them tomorrow or not.
Every day, from morning to evening, you drag children all over Prague.
And what&#39;s next? It is unknown. How much? Not known. Children ask for sweets. And you can&#39;t. It&#39;s expensive for you.
And of every iron - we don&#39;t have one.
We have a choice - to stay there and call the children to danger, or to try to save ourselves here

These are heroic guides who fearlessly go to the war zone, calm and help refugees in wagons, and at peaceful stations help volunteers load humanitarian aid into wagons.
These are gas stations that stood on the Zhytomyr highway in the first days of the war and patiently served frightened and nervous people.
These are utility workers who, under fire, remove garbage, repair water pipes and power lines to provide people with the necessities.
These are doctors and nurses who save people 24 hours a day, without complaining about anything, and in their spare time they also volunteer, collecting first-aid kits for the front.

Therefore, I decided to look for accommodation in or near Prague.

Foreign electoral district of Ukraine (ZVO of Ukraine) is an electoral district that unites polling stations located outside the territory of Ukraine and consists of voting premises in embassies and consulates of Ukraine and premises at military bases abroad, [footnote 1] on where Ukrainian peacekeeping contingents are located (Kosovo and DR Congo).[1] The role of the district election commission for the Overseas Election District is performed by the Central Election Commission.
In the Foreign Electoral District, only nationwide votes are held: elections of the President and People&#39;s Deputies and all-Ukrainian referenda.
Local elections are not held in ZVO.

Very tasty apples, what kind is this?
The head of the President&#39;s Office, Andriy Yermak, said that Russia is starting a &quot;fake operation&quot; regarding the weapons that are being transferred to us by our allies.
Yermak&#39;s direct speech: &quot;They understand that they will lose the war, see their backwardness and seek to &quot;knock down&quot; arms supplies by any means.
For example, one of the latest fakes is the alleged destruction of the S-300 air defense systems handed over by Slovakia.
Prime Minister Eduard Heger has already denied this information.
What happens next? We know the scenarios of the Russians. I will name one of them.
They can launch fakes that Ukrainian soldiers are surrendering with weapons from the allies, and they are massively transferred to the Russian army.
I want to immediately warn against such fakes.
Because the weapons in the hands of the soldiers of the Armed Forces exclusively send the enemy to the other world.

The international community continues to express shock and outrage after evidence emerged that Russian forces had committed atrocities against civilians in Ukraine, with Moscow dismissing the reports as a &quot;provocation&quot;.
&quot;Reports of Ukrainian civilians killed, raped and seriously injured by Russian troops are deplorable,&quot; New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern told reporters in Wellington on April 4.
&quot;Russia must answer to the world for what they have done,&quot; she added, noting that her government would discuss additional measures to support Ukraine in its fight against Russian invasion.
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida called the incidents a &quot;violation of international law.&quot;
The statements came after reports emerged that hundreds of civilians had been shot and dumped in mass graves or left on the streets in the Kyiv suburb of Bucha by Russian troops who withdrew from the area after weeks of occupation.
The photos, which allegedly show the bodies of executed civilians with their hands tied, have shocked many and led to calls for increased sanctions against Russia and criminal prosecution of those responsible.
French President Emmanuel Macron said in a radio interview on April 4 that there are signs that Russian forces committed &quot;war crimes&quot; in Buch.
&quot;What happened in Buch calls for a new round of sanctions and very clear measures,&quot; Macron said, adding that additional sanctions should target Russian coal and oil exports.
The Prime Minister of Spain, Pedro S√°nchez, said that Russian troops could go so far as to commit &quot;genocide&quot; in Bucha.
&quot;We will do everything to ensure that those who committed these war crimes do not go unpunished,&quot; Sanchez said in Madrid.
Speaking on state television late on April 3, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova dismissed the accusations as a &quot;provocation.&quot;
She claimed, without evidence, that the United States and NATO &quot;ordered&quot; the images to discredit Russia.
&quot;In this case, it seems to me that the fact that these statements were made in the first minutes after the appearance of these materials does not raise any doubts about who &quot;ordered&quot; this story,&quot; Zakharova said.
Earlier, the Russian Ministry of Defense also stated, without evidence, that the image of Buchi was &quot;another staging by the Kyiv regime&quot; and that all Russian troops had left the city by March 30.
Moscow asked the UN Security Council to meet on April 4 to discuss what it called a &quot;provocation by Ukrainian radicals&quot; in Buch.
On April 4, the Investigative Committee of Russia published a statement in which it announced an &quot;investigation&quot; into accusations that Ukraine spread &quot;knowingly false information&quot; about the actions of Russian troops in Buch.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyi spoke out on April 3, accusing Russian troops of committing &quot;genocide&quot; in the city and told Kremlin leaders that they should come to Buchi to see what their military had done.
&quot;I want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are carried out,&quot; Zelenskyy said in a video message, switching from Ukrainian to Russian.
And there is a shared responsibility.
For these murders, for these tortures... For the shots in the back of the head,&quot; he said.
He said that Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian military should bear responsibility for the actions of the troops in Ukraine.
&quot;When we find people with their hands tied behind their backs and decapitated, I don&#39;t understand,&quot; he said of the scenes of victims scattered on the streets of Buchi, a town about 35 kilometers northwest of Kyiv.
On April 2, a correspondent of the Ukrainian Service of Radio Liberty saw the bodies of what appeared to be civilians on the streets of a small town.
In only one place, the correspondent saw up to 10 bodies on the street.
AP reporters saw the bodies of at least 21 people in various locations in Buchi.
The bodies of one group of nine people - all in civilian clothes - were strewn on the ground near what local residents said was used as a base by Russian forces.
It appears that the victims were killed at close range.
In total, Ukrainian authorities said the bodies of at least 410 civilians were found in an area of Kyiv that was controlled by Russian forces until last week.
Thank you, everything is there, we bought everything according to the list.
&quot;They were told: Kyiv is gone.&quot; How the occupiers despicably deported Ukrainians to Russia and Belarus
The Russian invasion of Ukraine is accompanied by terrible things: robberies, rapes, murders, tortures.
There is one more item in this list, about which there is currently much less information - the removal of the local population to enemy territory.
Since about the middle of March, the Russian occupiers have been &quot;evacuating&quot; Ukrainians from temporarily occupied settlements to their territory and the territory of Belarus, which self-proclaimed President Lukashenko actually gave to a Russian military training ground.
&quot;Ukrainian Pravda&quot; sought out the deported Ukrainians and their relatives to ask how the same &quot;evacuation&quot; is taking place and whether there are ways to return to Ukraine after it.
The heroes of this text insisted on voluntary and forced evacuation outside of Ukraine under psychological pressure and because of hopelessness.
Fortunately, they are alive and in touch with their relatives.
However, according to the statements of the Ukrainian authorities, many citizens were taken to Russia and Belarus under strict coercion.
Thus, in Melitopol, the Russians kidnapped the staff of the second maternity hospital, took away children without parents, including 12-year-old Myroslava, the daughter of the fallen Ukrainian swimming champion Yosyp Zachepinskyi.
The family of Oleksandr, Maryna and their 10-year-old daughter Vali moved to Gostomel a few months before the war.
Oleksandr actually got a job at the Antonov airport, located 2.5 kilometers from the village.
The family settled on the territory of a military town, even though it was a civilian.
As true sleuths, Denys and Marina packed their emergency suitcases in advance, but they did not have time to evacuate on the morning of February 24.
They did not have their own car, and suburban buses no longer took anyone.
At approximately 12 o&#39;clock in the afternoon on February 24, they saw helicopters with the Latin letter V, followed by the first shells.
One of them hit a nearby house.
Then the family went down to the basement and stayed there for three long weeks, until March 17, until the Russian military took them to Belarus.
In total, about 40 people were hiding in their basement.
Not everyone decided to go.
&quot;At 6 o&#39;clock in the evening on February 24, people who spoke neither Russian nor Ukrainian entered the entrance.
They ask: &quot;Is there anyone?&quot; - I say yes. - &quot;Get out!&quot;.
They searched me, asked who was in the basement, whether there were any weapons.
All men were asked whether they had served in the army.
The women were told: &quot;We have come to protect you on the instructions of Ramzan Kadyrov.&quot;
It was Chechen riot police, not even troops, young guys aged 25-35.
They said: &quot;Ukrainians helped us in the war, Sashko Belyy (commander of the unit of the nationalist UNA-UNSO &quot;Viking&quot; movement, which fought on the side of the Chechens in the first Russian-Chechen war - UP), now we have come to help you.&quot;
On the third day, they asked what we were missing.
We say that water, there was a big problem with it.
They broke up the store, took the goods from there under the pretext that &quot;the Russians will take them anyway&quot; and brought us 6 bottles.
There is also a video on the Internet where children thank Kadyrov for food.
So, after looting the store, they brought sausage and said: &quot;We understand that this is wrong, but we really need a video for Ramzan Akhmatovich.&quot;
Nobody really wanted to talk, but they made a beautiful cut.
Our child there says: &quot;You have 7 days to return our phones&quot; - they laughed.
They also constantly separated themselves from the Russians.
They said how good it was that they came, because they didn&#39;t want war, they support the Ukrainians and are generally good: &quot;Putin is a bastard, Kadyrov too, but we can&#39;t do anything because our families are there.&quot;
And mostly they did not fight, but went to rob shops, looted.
They brought in chickens, tied a St. George&#39;s ribbon to one leg, and their white scotch tape to the other, and called her &quot;militia&quot;.
They came to Ukraine completely unprepared.
I don&#39;t know how their intelligence worked... When they were beaten on Buchi, so that they didn&#39;t even take the killed, they asked us: &quot;Do you have artillery?&quot;
Moreover, we had united squads - the Chechens did not know each other, in the first days they asked for passwords to find out whether they were their own or someone else&#39;s.
We had them until March 13, after which the Russian riot police arrived, followed by the Omsk landing force.
They placed 30-40 pieces of equipment between the houses - ours constantly fell into it from &quot;Bayraktars&quot;.
But they came and told us that the ZSU no longer exists, but there is &quot;Azov&quot;, and, according to them, there are 100,000 &quot;Azov&quot; in Ukraine.
The narrative &quot;Kyiv has already surrendered&quot; has been advancing since the beginning of March.
Once a Russian came to us - either an airborne officer or a representative of the FSB - and said that there would be an evacuation.
And we listened to the radio - there was talk about Bucha, Gostomel, we thought, maybe they gave us a &quot;green corridor&quot;.
From the very beginning, we gave the Chechens our lists, they promised to contact the Ukrainian command.
But they tell us: &quot;You will be taken to Belarus, and then, perhaps, to Rostov.&quot;
We say we don&#39;t want to go there or there.
To which they replied: &quot;Then take pity on the psyche of your children!&quot;
How it worked: they drove us into the basement and started shooting from under the house - either with Grads or mortars.
And then it flew back... Neighboring houses simply burned down, some of them collapsed.
Our building had a direct hit on the third floor.
Later, they agreed to take us only to Belarus, promising to hand us over to the border guards and the Red Cross.
Some did not go, saying that it was for traitors to the motherland - they said, &quot;you will be shot there, sold for organs.&quot;
We were driven through Chernobyl, there were fires on both sides of the road, broken equipment, although the Belarusians said that the Russians were immediately taking the equipment to them.
A lot of caponiers, buried equipment and soldiers.
At the Belarusian checkpoint &quot;Komar&quot; we passed an improvised control, many were without documents at all, because they were burned.
We were accommodated in Red Cross tents and given tea.
And then we hear shots! A rocket fires, and a trace is visible - it was &quot;Iskander&quot; operating in Kyiv.
Although those from the Belarusian Red Cross said: &quot;No, it&#39;s planes flying, turning around at the border.&quot;
But we are from aviation, we have an education, we understand what it is.
Then we were put on a bus and taken to the &quot;Chonky&quot; sanatorium near Gomel.
His manager, Wenger Vasyl Stepanovych, came and said: &quot;Here, I&#39;m a hohol, I&#39;m from Chernihiv.
But I understand that Putin and Lukashenko will not stop until these thieves of yours are finished.
Poor people are suffering!
And our Lukashenko is so good!
As he says, so it will be.&quot;
They offered to give an interview to Belarusian journalists, but no one wanted to.
The administration of the sanatorium told us: &quot;But you are already traitors!&quot;
And people from the Red Cross and the UN representative office (at least that&#39;s what they were called) spread misinformation that men can&#39;t go to Poland.
Many believed it and were afraid to leave Belarus.
But we still decided to leave, even though we had a problem with documents - my daughter did not have a foreign passport.
We were supposed to receive it on Monday, and the war started on Thursday.
They did not help us at the Ukrainian consulate, and in Minsk at the train station they said that no one would take anyone on the bus without passports.
Here I will say that we were helped a lot by Belarusian volunteers.
We were accommodated in Minsk and escorted.
In the sanatorium, they were not held by force.
The migration representative told our second group that you can live here for a week or a half at most, because Belarus is not Europe, there are no payments here.
We found a domestic carrier who volunteered to take us to Warsaw.
Driving near Mozyry (about 50 kilometers from the Ukrainian border - UP), we saw the launch of ballistic missiles over Ukraine: the missile first takes off, glows beautifully, and then goes out.
People who boarded the bus in Mozyr said that the Russians were constantly shooting from firing ranges there.
But I can say that the Belarusians absolutely do not want to fight.
Generals resign from the army.
One woman told us that she would break something for her son if he was called.
However, the northern part of Belarus, where Minsk is, they do not believe at all.
They say: &quot;You are lying, we are a peaceful people.&quot;
They do not perceive that their training grounds are used for shelling Ukraine.
Friends were waiting in Poland who took us to Estonia.
Now we are going through registration, we are deciding what to do next.
There are probably as many Ukrainian flags in Estonia as there are Estonian flags.&quot;
Marina lived on the territory of the military town in Gostomel together with her brother&#39;s family - his wife and two children, aged 18 and 22.
On the morning of February 24, she called her nephews and asked them to gather the most necessary things and documents.
In the evening, they went to spend the night in the basement of a neighboring house.
Marina herself could not return home and in principle will not be able to - the house is no longer there.
No one really knew anything about the evacuation.
Can&#39;t you be somewhere in the center on Monday?
Thank you, we have everything. And we always welcome you as a guest!
Thanks for the arrangement, the moths are beautiful
And in this small apartment there is no Wi-Fi, mostly I answer all your questions, and now I don&#39;t know what to do? And the children have online classes since Monday, but there is no Internet.
So I will live with two women from Ukraine and their children? Is this a family that is ready to accept us?
It is written in the Koran: &quot;even a leaf from a tree falls with his knowledge.&quot;
Our children study online, I am a salesman and a cook by profession, but I can also work in the field and as a cleaner, that is, Maryana is a handyman.
Can you agree on the best way to do this?
On April 1, the mayor of Buchi, Anatoly Fedoruk, announced the good news - the Ukrainian military liberated the city from the Russian invaders on March 31.
The next day, the occupiers were thrown out of the entire Kyiv region.
However, the joy that Ukrainians should have felt at that moment was overshadowed by horror and hatred, because at the same time it became known that in Buchi alone, the Russians shot at least 280 civilians.
They were killed just on the street, some had their hands tied and shot in the back of the head, some of the killed were minors.
Olha Sukhenko, the head of the village of Motyzhyn, her husband Igor and son Oleksandr, who were kidnapped on March 23, were found dead and with traces of torture.
The bodies of Olga and Oleksandr were in a mass grave, Igor - in the sewer.
The bodies of several undressed women wrapped in blankets were found on both sides of the highway 20 km from Kyiv.
The Russians tried to burn them.
And if I go, there will be no one at home
I ordered a package from Germany using DHL.
It was supposed to be delivered to me yesterday, but no one contacted me and the parcel was not delivered, and the DHL website said that the recipient could not be found.
Therefore, the parcel was sent to the post office and the address of this branch was indicated.

Good afternoon, I have just been offered a job at a dentist in Prague, so thank you very much for your concern and apologies.
She is very careless and somewhat irresponsible.
Then she passes her stop, then she forgets her phone, or she doesn&#39;t pick up the phone and hasn&#39;t texted me that she&#39;s at school and that everything&#39;s okay :)
And I worry about her, because after all, she is not at home, but in another, not yet completely familiar state
I hope I got the math right
You didn&#39;t think I was still a child
And work is of course also interesting.
However, if I&#39;m not very physically fit, I&#39;m fine, because I&#39;m not in such good physical shape
I could pay for housing at moderate prices if someone would give me a room.

The charitable organization Archdiocesan Caritas Olomouc wants to organize a project that will be interesting for Ukrainians living in the Czech Republic, namely in the city of Olomouc.
Imagine, Russians rape women, their children are forced to watch it.
Then they can rape, mutilate the body, and children see it all.
Good afternoon, I&#39;m talking to you in my thoughts - I have to learn Czech, and I can&#39;t tear myself away from the news.
I very often communicate with you thinking. I think you hear my thoughts.
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that certain types of weapons provided by Western partners arrived too late.
He said this in an interview with the Associated Press, excerpts of which were published by the Office of the President, &quot;European Truth&quot; writes.
&quot;All the equipment, everything they&#39;re already sending, for some types of equipment it&#39;s late.
So, when we talk about Mariupol, for example, when you lose thousands of people, what now?
From the leaders of some countries I see 100 percent support, it really is.
And some European leaders have changed their position, but you see the price of these changes,&quot; Zelenskyy said.
When asked whether Ukraine received enough weapons to make a difference in the war, the president answered: &quot;Not yet, not yet.&quot;
The president also said that if Ukraine was a member of NATO, this war would not have happened, or it would have taken a different form.
&quot;It would unfold in a different way, we would have the shoulder of close neighbors, we could fight together.
But I am sure that there would be no war after all,&quot; he added.
It will be recalled that the Prime Minister of Great Britain promised Ukraine new military aid, which includes armored vehicles and anti-ship weapons.
I have a dream that the war is over and I can return home
write to me about everything that will be needed, please
I wanted to ask you, maybe you know where the blender came from in our kitchen
Destructive actions in the form of spreading fakes and disinformation are aimed at provoking panic and disorganization, which are sensitive to public safety.
I am from Ukraine, now I am in Plze≈à.
Before the war in Ukraine, I worked for 20 years as a designer of women&#39;s and children&#39;s clothing from various materials, I can also sew on special equipment and make VTO.

Why do people run away?
Why don&#39;t they live in a territory where there is no war??
Are you in your right mind??
Did you live in a warring state?
When prices soared by 100-200%.
When the majority of enterprises DO NOT WORK.
When there is nowhere to earn.
When do children hear anti-aircraft fire?
Did you live like this?
You have no idea.
And God forbid that they should not have.
If you also find out - it will be HORRIBLE.
That&#39;s why we run away.

Have you tried taking the subway with your children to the fund?
When you are looking for food in one, clothes in another, and there is not enough time to go to the 3rd.
And tomorrow I have to go again... because the food they gave me is only enough for a day.
You WANT to provide for yourself... but where are the children??
How to live without knowing the language?
When you can&#39;t even ask for help.
Yes - there are free courses ... but what to choose?
Looking for work, food, clothes, or courses?

But my children cannot be there.
Simply - understand us.
You come to the town hall, and downstairs at the reception you say that you are looking for Mrs. Krzhkovska, if you are not told the way and the door number to her.
It will be written on his door, there is a department head.
If you can&#39;t agree, call Dominique, but I believe everything will go smoothly.
If Mrs. Krzhkovska has not come yet, wait for her for a moment, she said that she has a meeting before that, so maybe she will be a little late, but she knows about you, she booked you at this 9 o&#39;clock precisely so that you made it to the doctor.
Yes, of course, it would be very nice to spend time together

For exactly how many hours and on what days, I will see how it will turn out for me, so that I can also go to cleaning apartments, they pay more for cleaning there, so I don&#39;t want to give up that job.

He was a very rich man. After some time, he called and said that he had undergone heart surgery.
He asked me just to talk to him and support him, I felt sorry for him.
He was a very rich man and thought that maybe I was his toy and maybe I needed his money.
And then he proposed to me

And how do I pay?
&quot;I tell her that the &quot;repair of the TV and radio receiver&quot; has been delayed due to imported parts, and friends and acquaintances have been warned not to talk too much when they call.&quot;
&quot;We hide information about the war from our mother-in-law for a whole month.
So far it works.
However, Plyamka (the cat - UP) had fur on her belly and hind legs - this could be due to stress, a change in feed, and a lack of vitamins.
The last two reasons have been eliminated, but the stress does not depend on me, unfortunately.
Spot, unlike her mother-in-law, is not deaf, she hears both sirens and explosions.&quot;
Due to the fact that Olga is hard of hearing and spends most of her time in her room, her daughter-in-law lived in the apartment with her &quot;incognito&quot; for a month.
And on April 1, 93-year-old Oksana Poleva picked up a weapon for the first time in her life.
&quot;For 33 days, as a partisan, I lived with her in an apartment.
They hid from her both the war and the fact that I was nearby - she formally came as usual for a few hours.
But when her friend spoke, I gave her the receiver - she listened for 4 hours, then sang for 2 hours.&quot;
The radio was always by the bed.
The mother-in-law spends most of her time in her room.
Hard of hearing - this allowed me to be invisible to her.
If I heard the sound of her &quot;walkers&quot;, I hid in my room.
First of all, I hid the receiver and TV from her.
Then she called everyone who communicates with her. These are 6-7 people.
She asked to talk to her about anything but the war.
I will ask my friend, she was there from the beginning to the end
It is April 17 - I have 2 apartments cleaned :)
Good evening, I somehow didn&#39;t think about it :)
Hello, if we still need our help tomorrow, we will be able to come
It is necessary to order lunch, is it possible to take lunch from home? These documents need to be printed, or will they be printed on the spot and I will sign them?
I offer men&#39;s, women&#39;s, children&#39;s haircuts with a visit to you, I ask all interested parties to write in personal messages, the price:
I understand you and I&#39;m not complaining, but in my situation I will look here for now.
I&#39;m telling you, there are only embassies here,
A Briton who defended Mariupol in the ranks of the Ukrainian Armed Forces says he is ready to surrender to the Russians
The Briton, who is a member of the marine brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which is participating in the defense of Mariupol, told his friends and family that they would lay down their arms and surrender to the Russian occupiers.
Source: twitter page of Aidin Aislin, a Briton who has served in the Armed Forces since 2018, BBC citing family members and friends of Aislin, Atlas News citing a friend of Aislin who spoke to him
Aislin&#39;s twitter verbatim: &quot;We received word from him: &quot;It&#39;s been 48 days, we&#39;ve tried our best to defend Mariupol, but we have no choice but to surrender to Russian forces.
We have no food or ammunition left.
Thank you all, I hope the war will end soon.&quot;
Details: Aislin served in the 36th separate brigade of marines of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, which is participating in the Mariupol defense operation.
BBC reporters contacted the soldier&#39;s mother, Anne Wood, and she confirmed that her son had told her on the phone that they were planning to surrender.
A friend of the soldier, Brennan Phillips, also confirmed to reporters that in the last phone call, Aislin told them about their unit&#39;s plans to surrender.
According to him, the brigade ran out of ammunition and food.
Atlas News journalists contacted his friend, who said that Aislin&#39;s unit intends to surrender to Russian units so as not to fall into the hands of the so-called &quot;kadyrovtsy&quot; units without weapons and bullets.
An audio recording of a telephone conversation was also circulated on social networks, in which Aislin is allegedly talking to an American friend of hers who is planning to go to Ukraine.
In the conversation, Aislin said that they tried to get out of the city in civilian clothes, but they did not succeed.
Earlier, the British man said that representatives of the private military company &quot;Wagner&quot; threatened him on Instagram.
Aislin was a social worker in the city of Newark-on-Trent in Nottinghamshire, but in 2015-2017 he went to take part in the battles against the terrorists of the so-called &quot;Islamic State&quot; in Syria.
In 2018, he officially joined the ranks of the Armed Forces and took the oath.
Aislin was called Johnny by his friends and relatives, and in social networks he is better known by the nickname Cossack Gundi.
Please, I know it&#39;s hard for you. But I would like to know too. Are we together or not.

One brother went to war in Mariupol, the other in Zaporizhzhia, and the husband was transferred from Kyiv to Kharkiv today.

I wanted to come to you, but I still wanted to take care of some business. When
I will ask my husband in the morning if he will make it tomorrow.
When you get home, write to me please, I would need to talk to Daniil.
The Bolshevik attackers fully recovered for their losses in the battle.
They shot the teacher Dmytro Pavlytskyi, his relative whose name is unknown, the young man Boris Oleksienko.
Their bodies were thrown into a &quot;deep sinkhole, which was covered with earth.&quot;
According to memories, &quot;there was a kind of dead silence in the city.&quot;
Occasionally, one of the residents would run from house to house in a rush.
Bodies of those tortured by the Bolsheviks were constantly found on the streets
And maybe I really will follow you. I need you. I can not without you.
3. Which of your own activities/activities would help you or your friends better adapt to life in the Czech Republic?

I am not afraid of work, as I also lived in the village, so I can and love to work physically.
When can you bring things
You have a very interesting tradition, we do this at Christmas
Last week, the Verkhovna Rada adopted draft law 7176, which is entitled &quot;Regarding the monitoring of potential threats to the national security of Ukraine in the economic sphere.&quot;
It is surprising that in fact the only potential threat to Ukraine&#39;s national security in the economic sphere turned out to be... the place where the members of the supervisory board of state-owned companies and state-owned banks hold their meetings.
The initiators of the draft law believe that decision-making by the supervisory board of the state-owned company in conditional Kyiv can somehow solve the problems of Ukraine&#39;s national security.
We are aware of a large number of new dangers for state-owned companies, but so far we are not aware of any company that has had the need to physically hold a meeting of the supervisory board at the address of the location.
The potential threat of such a law is clear - it is an excellent basis for &quot;demolishing&quot; all assets in the difficult reform of state-owned enterprises after the Revolution of Dignity, including independent supervisory boards, and then establishing manual management.
The one that existed until 2015.
Why do state companies have supervisory boards and who should join them?
Moreover, if one harmful draft law &quot;takes flight&quot; under patriotic slogans, then tomorrow others may take flight as well - for example, the system of public procurement through ProZorro or the independence of the NBU can be demolished.
Much can be attributed to the war.
By the way, this initiative appeared even before the start of the war and draft law 7176.
So, on February 22, this norm was included in the comparative table of draft law 5397.
And in general, the desire to disperse the supervisory councils in one way or another has been circulating among some people&#39;s elected representatives for a long time.
Not for the sake of criticism as such, but in order to show the possible consequences of the draft law, we will analyze the arguments used to explain the need for its adoption.
And then we will present our suggestions on how to solve the issue of managing state-owned enterprises during the war.
First Deputy Minister of Economy Denys Kudin explained the need for such an innovation by the risks of losing the Internet and other means of communication, which would make the remote work of supervisory boards impossible.
In other words, the risk is that the supervisory board will not be able to make the necessary decisions, which may paralyze the company&#39;s work.
We agree that there is such a risk, but will it be possible to prevent it by moving the members of the supervisory boards to Ukraine?
Let&#39;s imagine a rather cynical situation when independent members of supervisory boards (who make up the majority of the entire composition) will put their personal safety above the interests of the company and refuse to come to Ukraine.
In this case, according to the draft law, they can be released.
And then, most likely, this will lead to the loss of the quorum necessary for the supervisory board to make any decisions.
On the other hand, it will not be possible to quickly appoint new independent members of the supervisory board, since the law provides for the need for competitive selection, which lasts 3-4 months on average.
Therefore, the decision proposed by draft law 7176 most likely will not be able to prevent the supervisory board from losing the ability to make decisions, but rather, on the contrary, will lead to this!
People&#39;s deputy, author of the draft law, Dmytro Natalukha, provides other arguments in support of it.
In particular, he notes: &quot;many enterprises, in particular the defense-industrial complex (OPK), now need relocation&quot; and therefore &quot;it is difficult to imagine that a person can, for example, from Vienna via Zoom discuss addresses and other sensitive information.&quot;
To begin with, in Ukraine there are almost no state-owned enterprises of the defense industry that have supervisory boards.
There is a supervisory board only in &quot;Ukroboronprom&quot;, which essentially manages almost all state-owned enterprises of the defense industry.
But even in &quot;Ukroboronprom&quot;, according to the legislation, the supervisory board has rather limited powers, and all its members perform their duties on a non-gratuitous basis.
All power in Ukroboronrom belongs to the general director, who, by the way, will make decisions on the necessity of relocating one or another military-industrial complex that is part of the concern.
In addition, such an argument does not stand up to criticism also because draft law 7176 does not make any changes at all to the legislation regulating the activities of state-owned enterprises of the defense industry.
On his Facebook page, Mr. Dmytro also gives arguments that can be classified as &quot;emotional&quot;.
Such arguments, as a rule, have nothing to do with increasing the efficiency of state-owned companies and state-owned banks, but let&#39;s try to analyze some of them: &quot;respectable foreign experts at the first word &quot;war&quot; will leave Ukraine in 2021, but at the same time remain members of supervisory boards in state enterprises of Ukraine with a full salary of several hundred thousand hryvnias, while Ukraine itself is really suffering from the war.&quot;
First of all, this is manipulation - most of these members of the supervisory boards have never lived in Ukraine and only periodically came here.
Therefore, to say that they are &quot;leaving Ukraine&quot; is, to put it mildly, unfair.
Secondly, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, both foreign and Ukrainian members of supervisory boards have long resorted to the practice of holding online meetings.
This tool has long been widespread in world practice, and in completely different areas: business, education, medicine, etc.
It should also not be forgotten that membership of the supervisory board is not a full-time job.
As a rule, such people also have other occupations, and electronic means of communication help them in this.
Thirdly, all these statements are read as claims against foreigners only.
I wonder why Mr. Dmytro does not express identical claims to the members of the supervisory boards, who are Ukrainians?
After all, they are also not located at the location of their companies.
By the way, this is far from the first populist attempt by deputies to remove foreigners from supervisory boards, and the war is just another convenient opportunity.
Congratulations. I am in Ukraine. I am looking for possible options for temporary shelter with a family. I have 2 children with me.

In the Brovarsky, Vyshhorodsky and Buchansky districts of the Kyiv region, which were liberated from the occupiers, a strengthened curfew will be introduced for 2 days.
Pavlyuk&#39;s direct speech: &quot;In the settlements of Brovarsky, Vyshgorod and Buchansky districts, which were under Russian occupation and were liberated by the Ukrainian defense forces, the curfew has been strengthened!
On the territory of these cities and villages, restrictions will apply from 21:00 on April 2 to 06:00 on April 5.
Details: According to the head of the Oblast, at this time it is strictly forbidden to be on the streets of populated areas and in other public places, to travel by vehicle or on foot.
Residents can only go outside during an alarm to take shelter.
Such restrictions are introduced in order to remove the consequences of Russian aggression - to clear and demine the territories.
Omelanyuk called on people who left these areas to refrain from returning home for the time being.
In the rest of the territory of Kyiv region, the curfew will last from 9:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. every day.

There is a word-for-word translation of that document in Czech.

The Serbian defense budget has been growing exponentially for several years in a row.
In total, over the past six years, Serbia has invested more than two billion euros in the modernization of the army, the renewal of military equipment and the acquisition of modern systems, rising to 22 places in the list of the most powerful military states in the world.
After the full-scale aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, Western countries took the prediction of a possible escalation in the Balkans quite seriously.
For Ukraine, this means that the diplomatic solution to the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is becoming more complicated and globalized.

Great Britain Wants To Evict All Russians From Its Territory With Confiscation Of All Property!
Good afternoon, you have a toy box
I traveled around the city a lot by transport, by car.
However, I&#39;m not good at navigating names.
This is in principle normal, because my thoughts were about something else entirely.
Currently, I am psychologically calmer compared to when I first arrived here
How are you ?
Fake information about conscripted students, preparation for the evacuation of higher education institutions and freeing up places in student dormitories was spread on social networks.
Art helps to distract and switch
I understand that you, as a volunteer and just a good person, sincerely want to help and support us.
And I understand that you need a photo, that you are helping and so on...
But understand me too. I lived well in Ukraine, I did not need any help.
And I don&#39;t want some of my friends to see it and so on. Understand me correctly too ‚ò∫Ô∏è.
Can I ask a question?
Do you know how life turned out for those girls who left you?
Did they want to get back at you?
Have they formed a new relationship?
But are they happy?
Hi how are you? What did you do today?
I had two Pfizer vaccines in Kyiv
I have a certificate, but the other day it expired, and I think I need a booster dose?
If it is not difficult, can I find out the details from the doctor?
I have Sunday off. We often went to Kharkiv, it was beautiful there
I hope everything will be fine (( and we believe our housing issue (
Also, one man should call back today and say if he found something for me
I don&#39;t know how it is with the contribution to the whole family
What time do we meet to put things in for washing?
My birthday is on Wednesday
I wanted you to print an ad for the kitchen so that everyone washes the stove after themselves
My turn was taken
I generally think that I won&#39;t make it tomorrow without you
I wanted to ask for a long time and I forget everything.
And how are you doing with the vaccination against COVID?
I did not have time to make a booster (third dose) of the vaccine at home. Is this vaccination paid here?
I will wait when you call. Something to take with you from the devices?
It&#39;s good that you have already arrived üôèüèª And I am very grateful to you for a pleasant evening and üåπ
I will print a new ticket and you can go to the hall

Security forces of the Lukashenka regime detained three Belarusians aged 27 and 28, who were involved in the destruction of two relay cabinets of the signal installation near Osypovychy, which ensures the movement of railway trains.
Source: &quot;Radio Svaboda&quot;, human rights center &quot;Vyasna&quot;, chief of the criminal police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Gennadiy Kazakevich, quoted by the state information agency &quot;BelTA&quot;
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus reported that on the night of March 30, three residents of Bobruisk were detained, one was injured, with the force support of &quot;SOBR&quot; special forces.
According to &quot;Vyasna&quot;, during the arrest, the men actively resisted and tried to escape.
Security forces used weapons.
One of the detainees was injured and is in a medical facility.
Others were treated at the scene.
The head of the criminal police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus, Gennady Kazakevich, said that &quot;acts of terrorism on the railways of the Republic of Belarus will be strictly stopped&quot; by security forces using weapons.
On April 6, it became known that on March 30, the police detained another employee of the Belarusian Railways, an employee of the Baranovytskyi branch of &quot;BZD&quot; and the administrator of thematic resources of &quot;BZD&quot; in &quot;VKontaktie&quot; and &quot;Odnoklasnyky&quot; Valentin Samasyuk.
Where he is now and in what condition is unknown, reports @belzhd_live.
At the end of March, at least 40 railway workers were detained in Belarus for sabotage.
We will remind: The formation of BYpol, declared extremist by the Lukashenko regime, continues to call on Belarusians to carry out sabotage on the objects of railway transport and infrastructure in Belarus as part of the &quot;Victory&quot; plan.
Belarusian &quot;rail partisans&quot; are thus trying to resist Russian aggression against Ukraine.
As you know, through Belarus, the Russian Federation transfers manpower and equipment to Ukraine in order to fight.
This is to raise self-esteem
Do you like to read books?
And they don&#39;t work in phone mode on Easter holidays either?
Can this be done by phone on any day or not?
Even a separate law was passed regarding this issue
We drove here for 4 days, so it&#39;s just a horror, not a road.
We drove through the Kyiv region, the city of Irpin, then there was horror, shooting, sirens.
I worry about them too.
Silvia, Masha hasn&#39;t received the money from Kletsana yet, can I call them?
Yes, I will tell them, I think they will be at home.
There are different Muslims. There are fanatics, and there are true believers.
The meaning of jihad is interpreted differently by different Muslims.
But to be honest, I am very uncomfortable doing it for money.
You have done me a lot of good.
I can do it for free.
Temporarily for the period while we are looking for a university, then of course permanent residence will be required
but maybe she will have a dormitory. (we are looking for Prague, Brno, and other places)
We are not far from Prague now, we have a car, we are ready to partially pay for accommodation.
city or village does not matter, it is preferable that it is a separate residence.
I poked something into vodaphone and connected two unnecessary promotions for which funds were withdrawn and I can&#39;t turn them off üò≠

The USA bans investments in the Russian Federation and imposes sanctions against Putin&#39;s daughters
The United States, together with the G7 and the EU, are introducing new sanctions against Russian President Putin&#39;s daughters, the largest Russian banks, Alfa Bank and Sberbank, as well as banning all new investments in Russia.
This is stated in a message on the website of the White House.
Sberbank is the largest government-owned financial institution in Russia, and Alfa-Bank is the largest private bank.
The sanctions would freeze any of their assets that touch the US financial system and bar US citizens from doing business with them.
In addition, the States will introduce a complete ban on new investments in the Russian Federation.
To this end, US President Joe Biden will sign a new decree, which includes a ban on new investments in Russia by US citizens regardless of their location.
&quot;This step is based on the decision of more than 600 multinational companies to withdraw from Russia.
The private sector exit includes manufacturers, energy companies, large retailers, financial institutions, and other service providers such as law and consulting firms,&quot; the White House said in a statement.
The third step of the new sanctions from the US was restrictions against large Russian state-owned enterprises in the critical sphere.
This would prohibit US citizens from transacting with these entities and freeze any of their assets in US jurisdiction.
The Ministry of Finance will publish a detailed list the next day, Thursday.
And the last part of the package is the complete blocking of the assets of Putin&#39;s adult children, the wife and daughter of Foreign Minister Lavrov, as well as members of the Russian Security Council, including the former President and Prime Minister of Russia Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin
The sanctions cut them off from the US financial system and freeze any assets they have in the United States.
You can only get to this place, then the road is closed and I will come to you
Vera, can we wash the dishes in the car?
My name is Olga, before the war I worked as a flight attendant for the SkyUp company, my mother is a seamstress of industrial products, my son Makarchyk went to kindergarten.
We lived beautifully, but we didn&#39;t even think that we would be forced to flee, because we no longer had the strength to hide in the cellar.
I was lucky and found a job in Prague, Czech Republic.
Therefore, we hope that someone will shelter us for the first time) We can even pay for a room or an apartment, but only if we can afford it.
We guarantee cleanliness and order.
We have no bad habits.
We will be grateful for such help in such a difficult time for us.
After dinner, I had one English lecture, and after that I went to work in the children&#39;s room.
There I explained to Margarita how to fill out all the documents.
I hope she understood everything and will do everything well.
I also met Mrs. Lena and talked with her about swimming for Ukrainian children.
She brought the announcement from the pool.
It&#39;s free swimming.
You can call the school, Kira does not pick up the phone, does not answer, I do not know if she reached the school

I dreamed of being a teacher
My girls can&#39;t move anywhere right now, so I haven&#39;t written to the owner of the house.
I wanted to ask you that if you hear about housing information, you will let me know.
I would happily rent an apartment with a decent girl.
If you know one, let me know.
From my side - I will not let you down.
Thanks in advance.
Natalya, 54 years old, did not write to you. Please write the exact address and how much the courses cost
I think it is better for you to make copies of our passports, they have all the information.

Is your father the only one who speaks and understands Russian?
On what day does the colleague want to clean the house and how many windows does the house have?
I am ashamed to distract you from your business
Good evening, I cannot but share with you. There is news from Mariupol that his son is alive and in the army.
I advise you to read Joe Dispenza, he scientifically conducts experiments on the influence of external factors and the formation of new neuron connections
On the morning of April 12, the journalist of the TV channel &quot;1+1&quot; Nataliya Nagorna released a video recording that was given to her by the soldiers of the 36th Marine Brigade from Mariupol.
In it, the soldiers say that they have no weapons left to participate in battles, and a mountain of wounded.
They said that &quot;the bill goes on for hours&quot;.
Before that, on April 11, the 36th separate marine brigade, which participates in the defense of Mariupol, published an appeal to Ukrainians in Russian.
The statement said that April 11 could be the last battle for the defenders of Mariupol, and the Ukrainian military command did not contact the fighters for two weeks.
Social networks expressed skepticism that the statement was published in Russian.
The Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valery Zaluzhnyi assured that there is a connection between the command and the defense forces in Mariupol, and the details of the defense operation should not be a subject of public discussion.
The Russians threatened to block Ukrainian fighters on the territory of the Azovstal plant in Mariupol and use chemical weapons against them.
On the evening of April 11, the Russian occupiers dropped a poisonous substance of unknown origin on Mariupol.
As the leader of &quot;Azov&quot; Andriy Biletsky reported, the Russian army used chemical weapons on the &quot;Azovstal&quot; plant, which is held by fighters of the &quot;Azov&quot; regiment.
Thank you, I will adapt to you. It would be very good
The situation is the same, for now we stay here
2 hours of driving )) walks, mom shopping and back)!
It&#39;s not an important matter
She forgot what she was going to do here
A squadron of Czech üá®üáø drones started flying over Ukraine üá∫üá¶ from today.
Almost 50 professional coptersüöÅ will serve for detection, and some of them - for direct destruction of the enemy invaderüí•.
Two Transcarpathian and two Czech brothers &quot;birds&quot; were sent to Ukraine the day before yesterday thanks to Volodymyr Labutenko, a deputy of the Mukachevo City Council.
Today, their intermountain friends, led by the head of the village council and coordinator https://www.facebook.com/examplehere101/ Vasyl Shchur, delivered the drones as intended: they were received by special units of the Ukrainian troops in various cities where hostilities are currently ongoing.
In order to use the copters as efficiently and safely as possible, we will keep their location a secret for the time being.
Four friends who help the Ukrainian army from the Czech Republic do not plan to stop there, they say: in the coming days, many more interesting &quot;gifts&quot; will be sent to Ukraine, which will serve to destroy the Russian occupier and save the lives of Ukrainian heroes.
Don&#39;t worry, everything is fine. I love sweets, but I can do without them
I&#39;m worried we won&#39;t make it. A lot of luggage.
I will return to Ukraine soon, continue to work
Fine. If everything is okay, I will agree
I will try myself, but if there are any problems, I will write to you, if possible?
The main thing is to understand each other
We were in person with the old woman in the village in Jivov, she saw me and that I was pregnant, but said that there was no housing
Maybe she will be happy and her mood will improve
My phone was repaired today.
And I think that today I also froze outside.
I drank medicine and tea, I feel worse, but not critical.
I&#39;m also sorry, but it&#39;s better to meet when I&#39;m healthy.
When you have time, send me the music you like.
I&#39;m curious about your musical abilities üòä
mom and dad must be obeyed
You&#39;ll find it somewhere near your little brother&#39;s stroller.
Today it was cooler and raining here. It should be warm tomorrow.
But it&#39;s not a pity about the destroyed houses, it&#39;s a pity about the people who are mocked by the occupiers
In Kherson, the occupiers mocked the &quot;Glory to Ukraine&quot; memorial in Kherson on Perekopska Street.
Details: It is noted that unknown persons tore down the flag of the European Union, gutted panels with photos of the Heavenly Hundred and those killed in the Russian-Ukrainian war.
The occupiers tore down the portraits of the heroes of the Heavenly Hundred and fallen participants of the Russian-Ukrainian war.
The flag was taken down.
Good morning, thank you to the children for the carol, we don&#39;t have such a custom, that&#39;s why we didn&#39;t know, we only gave the children chocolate and cookies, maybe something else should have been given
There is someone to talk to in Czech, if anything.
Because I live in a dormitory. There will be people here until twelve, and then they go to work
Hello, it&#39;s a little better.
I was already in the nursery today.
Even today he already slept there.
Therefore, we have already made great progress.
I will definitely bring dumplings another time!
I don&#39;t have the strength to do them today
Since I am pushed back from the days and times when there is work to clean the apartments after guests, I can roughly say the month of April because I already have an approximate schedule for cleaning the apartments.
For the month of May - I can roughly say the end of April or the beginning of May.
I just asked if you have anything to say about it..
hello, I&#39;m sorry I haven&#39;t written back for a long time, I was cooking dinner and got some sleep
if you still don&#39;t mind, could I come today?)
or we will meet after your arrival)
He is modest with us, he has been studying a lot lately. He realized that he really needs this in his life
Hello) everything went very well.
I was a little shocked that I work with people in such a high position.
Today I had a lesson with a lady who is the director of the Department of Economics of the Highland Region.
She was very pleased with my work.
Grishko behaved well in the nursery.
On Monday, I have to bring confirmation of employment and cash payment for daycare.

The drain tank does not work very well, it does not wash well. Master needed. Need to fix.
So there is enough of everything
Can you send me the correct email address?
I would like to send you an invitation to the Czech language course you have signed up for.
And children are fed there or do you have to bring them with you?
And now I can come to you for a moment, there is one question
If you still need help, write
If I&#39;m not mistaken, you are celebrating Easter today, right?
From the beginning, we didn&#39;t really want you to fundraise so people wouldn&#39;t think we were speculating on it!
But two points were not enough for me to fill in online:
I will go to rest. Gain strength and energy. Thank you for today&#39;s gift. good night
üòÑüòçwhat a great idea. I will watch the video now. It will be good because the whole family will draw.
Karazin University urges employees and students to carefully check any information, not to trust anonymous sources in messengers and social networks, rumors and gossip.

Staff briefing: Russia is preparing a provocation in Transnistria to blame Ukraine
The Russian army may resort to provocations in the Transnistrian region of Moldova in order to accuse Ukraine of &quot;aggression against a neighboring state.&quot;
Literally: &quot;It is not excluded that the armed forces of the Russian Federation will carry out provocative actions on the territory of the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova in order to accuse Ukraine of aggression against a neighboring state.&quot;
Details: The enemy continues to create an offensive group of troops for operations in the Slobozhansk direction.
Probably, in the coming days, the occupiers will try to resume the offensive.
In addition, the enemy continues to prepare and send personnel, weapons and equipment to participate in hostilities on the territory of Ukraine.
Weapons and military equipment are being trained at the permanent deployment point of the 60th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade (Monastyryshche) of the 5th Combined Arms Army of the Eastern Military District.
Presumably, the specified weapons will be moved to the temporarily occupied territory of the Donetsk region.
Also, in order to restore the personnel losses of the units of the battalion tactical group from the 36th separate motorized rifle brigade (Borzya, Trans-Baikal region) of the 29th combined army of the Eastern Military District, servicemen from the said brigade are being recruited.
The enemy feels a special problem when filling the positions of drivers and driver mechanics.
The departure of the selected personnel from the point of permanent deployment is scheduled for the second half of April this year.
Presumably, the enemy, in order to disrupt the supply of goods to the places of hostilities, will continue attacks on transport infrastructure facilities on the territory of Ukraine with the aim of destroying or disabling them.
Certain units of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to perform tasks to strengthen the protection of the Ukrainian-Belarusian border in the Brest and Gomel regions.
In the Slobozhansk direction, separate units from the 6th Combined Arms Army and the Coastal Forces of the Northern Fleet continue to partially block the city of Kharkiv, and artillery shelling of certain areas of the city continues.
In the Izyum direction, aerial reconnaissance of the area is underway with the aim of identifying the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
For this, the enemy uses the Orlan-10 UAV.
With forces up to two battalion tactical groups, the enemy tried to carry out an offensive in the direction of the settlements of Dovgenke and Dmytrivka, but was unsuccessful and retreated to previously occupied positions.
In the Donetsk direction, the enemy continues to focus its main efforts on taking control of Popasna, Rubizhne, Nizhne and Novobakhmutivka settlements, as well as establishing full control over the city of Mariupol.
The enemy tried to carry out assault operations in the Zolote area, but was unsuccessful.
In the city of Mariupol, with the help of artillery and aviation, the occupiers continue their assault in the areas of the Azovstal plant and the seaport.
With the forces of separate units, the enemy carried out artillery shelling of the positions of Ukrainian troops in the areas of the settlements of Visokopilya, Trudolyubivka and Marianske.
On the territory of Donetsk and Luhansk regions, defenders of Ukraine repelled four enemy attacks over the past day, destroyed five tanks, eight armored vehicles, six vehicles and eight artillery systems of the enemy.
Didn&#39;t understand your thoughts?
We will certainly try to make it, but I doubt it
And you, how can you want to sleep and I&#39;m keeping you
are you sure you don&#39;t mind me coming?
maybe you just don&#39;t want to see each other today, then tell me, I&#39;ll understand everything)
Thank you. We didn&#39;t watch TV at home, let alone 1+1. We don&#39;t need to configure :)
I will turn on the TV here only to listen to the Czech language
My monthly tariff package ends today :)
Can we do it over the phone today?
Buy fabric for embroidery, canvas, threads for embroidery
I understand, then I can prepare material in this area.
I will ask her. I&#39;m a little embarrassed to ask, she already gives us so many pies.
My father and I will meet later, for sure üôèüèª
I read the ad on Facebook, I guess Google wrote something on its own üèµÔ∏è. , I think the phone number is enough
Good afternoon, we took the things you brought, but there are things that are too small for us, can we bring them to you in 10 minutes?
I thought about work.
If it&#39;s okay with the director, then I can start going to work next week, because tomorrow before lunch I plan to go to the labor office to submit documents (if it works out, because the queues are very long) and it&#39;s raining on Saturday :)
I am looking for a team at the beginning, I really liked chemistry at school, I am studying the Czech language in order to know it perfectly, I dream of working for Teva
Old and not so old friends, friends with whom I am not personally acquainted, friends in spirit and mind.
Now hard times have come to you too.
I have been in contact with many of you over the past month.
Your life, which was never easy anyway, turned upside down, just like the life of every Ukrainian.
Many of you are fleeing Russia.
And many of you have admitted that you feel guilty and ashamed about your country&#39;s actions toward your neighbors.
Because of what Ukraine is subjected to on your behalf.
Some of you activists have been under threat for a long time, and you have been preparing for the decisive blow.
At the beginning of March, I wrote to Oleksandr Cherkasov, my very old friend from &quot;Memorial&quot;.
I&#39;ll tell you a little later, - as usual, Sasha answered succinctly. - Now, after the search, we are walking through the ruins.
Others - cultural figures, artists, critics, writers - are shocked by the sudden collapse of your fragile world.
None of you like Putin and his regime of thieves and fascists, most of you hate them.
But let&#39;s be honest: with the exception of a very few of you - those who worked at &quot;Memorial&quot;, at &quot;Novaya Gazeta&quot;, at &quot;Echo of Moscow&quot;, at &quot;Meduza&quot;, Navalny&#39;s organization and in a number of other places - how many of did you do at least something to oppose this regime?
Except for participation in rallies, when they were still taking place.
Read also the Russian journalist&#39;s column &quot;It&#39;s late to hide, it&#39;s late to be silent&quot;
And if so, are you sure that your feeling of shame and guilt is not just an abstraction?
Perhaps they are caused by your long-term indifference to what is happening around you, your apathy and your passive complicity, which now, surely, have laid a heavy burden on your soul and heart?
It wasn&#39;t always like that.
There was a short period in the 1990s when you had a measure of freedom and democracy - messy, even bloody, but real.
But 1991 turned out to be no better than 1917.
Why is it that every time you finally have a revolution, you end up with such a strong fear of turmoil that you seek salvation behind the back of the czar, whether his name is Stalin or Putin?
No matter how many people he kills, you still think it&#39;s safer around him. Why so?
Indeed, mistakes were made.
Instead of capturing and making public the archives of the KGB, as the Germans did with the Stasi, you took away the soul at the monument to Dzerzhinsky - and allowed the KGB to sink to the bottom, renew itself, reform and seize power over the country.
When you were faced with a choice between looting the country and the return of the communists, you did not fight for the possibility of a third option - and meekly accepted the looting.
In 1998, your economy collapsed, and that marked the end of mass rallies for greater social justice or against the war in Chechnya.
Survival became the main concern.
Then Putin appeared. Young, enterprising, aggressive, he promised to deal with terrorists and raise the economy.
Few of you bought it, but you still either voted for him or preferred not to vote at all.
When he started razing Chechnya again, most of you turned a blind eye.
I remember those years well.
At that time, I was working in Chechnya, helping victims of Putin&#39;s &quot;anti-terrorist operation&quot;, and saw with my own eyes the ruins of Grozny, Katar-Yurta, Itum-Kala and other cities.
Sometimes on weekends I would go back to Moscow and have fun hanging out with you, my friends.
We drank, we danced, and sometimes I tried to tell you about the horrors I witnessed: the torture of civilians, the killed children, the soldiers who sold the bodies of the dead to their families.
You told me: &quot;Brede, we are already tired of your Chechnya.&quot; I remember these words very well.
In response, I was indignant: &quot;Friends, this is not my Chechnya, this is your Chechnya.
This is your country, dammit, not mine.
I&#39;m just a stupid foreigner here.
It is your government that is bombing one of your cities, killing your fellow citizens.&quot;
But no, it was all too complicated, too painful, and you didn&#39;t want to know anything.
Then came the economic boom of the mid-zeros, driven by rising oil prices and Putin&#39;s willingness to look down on the fact that some of the stolen money would remain in the pockets of the middle class.
Many of you began to earn well, some became rich, and even the poorest of you bought a new home and found a better job.
Prices were rising, but is that a problem?
Moscow festively shone and glittered with chic.
When several oppositionists were killed - Yuriy Shchekochikhin, Anna Politkovska, Oleksandr Litvinenko and others - many of you were shocked and expressed horror at what was happening.
However, the matter did not go further.
When, after two terms, Putin handed over the post of president to Medvedev, and he himself took the place of prime minister, you, as I see, barely paid attention to it.
When Russia invaded Georgia after a few months of Medvedev&#39;s rule, most of you ignored it or remained silent.
How many of you did I meet in the following years on the mountain slopes of Gudauri, in the foothills of Kazbegi or in the cafes and Turkish baths of Tbilisi, while part of this country was occupied by your army?
I have to admit that we in the West hardly did much, if at all.
A little outrage, a little sanction; but what did it matter that Russia was flagrantly violating international law when the temptation of Russian oil, gas and the domestic market was so great?
It was good to live in Russia.
And after the difficult 1990s, it was the most important thing.
However, at the end of 2011, you, my Russian friends, still woke up.
When Putin switched places with Medvedev again and took the presidential chair, as before, many of you decided that it was too much, and you went to protests en masse.
Navalny&#39;s name became a household name, you did not leave the streets for half a year, and the regime finally felt with horror that it was losing ground under its feet.
After that he struck back.
First, alternative actions were organized, then more repressive laws were passed, and prisons were filled with people.
Thousands ended up behind bars.
Some received huge terms.
&quot;And what could we do?&quot;
I heard it so often and still do.
&quot;The state is so strong, but we are so weak.&quot;
Well, look at the Ukrainians.
Look at what they did two years ago.
Enraged by the pro-Russian president who betrayed their European hopes, they took over the Maidan once - and never left it.
They built a tent city all by themselves and prepared for a decisive defense.
When the police came and tried to break it down, they began to defend themselves with sticks, rebar and Molotov cocktails.
Eventually, the police opened fire.
But instead of fleeing, the protesters attacked.
Many died, but they won.
Yanukovych became a fugitive, and Ukrainians regained their democracy, the right to independently choose leaders and expel them if they do their job badly.
Putin did not like the Maidan very much.
It was a bad example.
Therefore, taking advantage of the general confusion, he seized the Crimea.
Some of you were against it, but it was of little use.
And how many of you were delighted!
As far as I know, 91% of Russian citizens supported the annexation.
Out of nowhere, a new myth was suddenly born, and many of you who despised Putin and his gang suddenly turned 180 degrees and began to adore him.
It&#39;s hard for me to find the reason because we stopped talking immediately after that.
The rest of those who remained my friends were mostly silent.
&quot;We are not interested in politics,&quot; you said.
And you were new hiding in books, movies, IKEA catalogs and parks, as if new after the restoration started by the mayor of Moscow in 2012 - with their binbags, public Wi-Fi and hipster cafes.
In fact, Donbas is far away, and Moscow is so beautiful - and it only gets better.
You just turned your attention to Syria.
There were terrorists, right?
ISIS or something... Even the editor in Moscow, who published my book about Syria, criticized it in an interview at the time, because I didn&#39;t seem to understand anything about what was happening in Syria.
Well, at least I went there and saw for myself how on the streets of Homs government snipers shoot my children&#39;s peers in cold blood.
Among all citizens of Russia, only your soldiers visited there, who in 2015 began bombing thousands of civilians, gaining experience for the next serious war.
Surely many of you are familiar with the words of Pastor Martin Niemeller:
&quot;At first they came for the socialists, but I remained silent - because I am not a socialist.
Then they came for the trade union members, but I remained silent because I am not a trade union member.
Then they came for the Jews, but I remained silent - because I am not a Jew.
Then they came for me, but there was no one left who could say something in my defense.&quot;
How many of you talked about Chechens, Syrians or Ukrainians?
Some of you did.
But the vast majority remained silent.
Some are really speaking now - like, for example, Dmytro Glukhovskyi, Mykhailo Shishkin, Mykhailo Zyhar, Maksym Osypov and others.
Most allow themselves to speak from abroad, some from the middle of the country, like Marina Ovsyannikova, risking getting into a new gulag or making company with Navalny.
As for others, you know best which country you live in.
Therefore, I&#39;m sure you understand: when Putin deals with the Ukrainians - or, which seems very likely, if he doesn&#39;t succeed - he will take care of you.
For all of you, my friends: for those who courageously, but mostly alone, went to the protests and so far met with a minor term, but will soon receive a more serious one.
For the thousands of you who signed petitions, who expressed your disagreement on social networks (even if only with a black square on Instagram) or spoke in private conversations with colleagues at work.
The times when 10 or even 25 years of imprisonment were given just for a joke are not so far gone - and now they are, with a high probability, waiting for you in the future.
Who will speak for you then? Who will be left?
The example of the Ukrainians - even more than in 2014 - frightens the Putin regime: they prove that it is possible to fight it.
And that intelligence, motivation and bravery can stop him, no matter how depressing his advantage may be on paper.
In spite of everything, few people in Russia realize this, as well as the fact that the war is going on at all.
But you, my friends, know very well what is happening now.
You read foreign news on the Internet, you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine with whom you keep in touch.
And Putin knows what you know.
So be ready.
You understand what it&#39;s all about.
The good life in exchange for your silence has come to an end.
Your elections are hochma, your laws, if not repressive, are worth no more than the paper they are written on, your last free media is gone, your economy is collapsing faster than I can write, you have no more credit cards to buy a plane ticket abroad, even if there are still some flights left.
Now Putin will not be satisfied with your silence, he will demand your consent, your submission.
And, if you don&#39;t give him what he wants, you can either try to go some way or get crushed.
I doubt you see any other option.
And yet there remains one more.
Which will eventually bring down this regime.
And perhaps, under the current conditions, less will be required of you than you think.
Think about it.
The spark will not ignite from you: due to the economic collapse that is approaching Russia, it will most likely ignite in the provinces, in small towns.
When prices soar and wages are not paid, those people who voted for Putin all these years because they wanted bread and peace will take to the streets.
Putin knows this and fears these people far more than he fears the intellectuals and middle class of Moscow and St. Petersburg, that is, you, my friends.
But if each city goes to rallies on its own, as it has happened periodically, it will not be difficult for him to suppress them alone.
Organization and coordination will be necessary. The crowd will need to be turned into a mass.
You have this wonderful magic tool - the Internet, which the regime can limit, but which still works and can be fixed under almost any circumstances.
Navalny&#39;s organization was defeated, but it is possible to create other, more informal, more decentralized ones.
There are many of you, millions of you.
The Moscow police can handle 30 thousand people on the streets of the city, maybe a hundred thousand.
If it turns out more than 300 thousand, she will be stunned.
The army will have to be used, but will this army fight for Putin when it comes down to it?
After everything he made them do in Ukraine, everything he made them go through?
Of course, the danger will be very great.
Many of you will feel an understandable fear; those who have children will fear for them.
And it&#39;s natural, it&#39;s normal.
I would also be afraid if I were you.
Using the example of Syria, and now Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what happens to those who dare to ignore their master, who dare not only to demand freedom, but really try to get it.
But even if you do nothing, many lives will still be wasted.
Your son will make a joke in the chat of a computer game - and will be arrested; your daughter will express indignation on the Internet - and will be arrested; your close friend will make a mistake - and die in a dank cell under police batons.
This is what has been happening for many years - and it will only intensify, acquiring larger and larger scales.
So you have no choice. If you do nothing, you know how it will end.
Keep your cool, think strategically, and make it happen.
We went to class on Friday, we were told that we could come on Monday

While working at the prosecutor&#39;s office, I thought I was building a career, and spent a lot of time and effort.
I had a difficult psychological, responsible, mental job in which I was completely disappointed.
Very sorry for the lost time, but this is a life experience.
In my personal life, I am sociable, but I am monogamous and take matters of marriage seriously.
There was one man whom I was supposed to marry, but he died of heart problems.

I went to Natalie&#39;s playroom today to say hello to her.
She had an unpleasant situation.
Because when the children were going home, one mother refused to take the child, because she said that she came to look at things and arrange them in that room with clothes, and yesterday Mr. Valery opened our children&#39;s room to her until 7:00 p.m.
Can it really be like that?
The working hours of the room are until 16:00.
And ultimately it is our responsibility.
But I don&#39;t load or open the page, my internet is very weak
