Police estimate that there are 6,500 participants in the protest in Berlin.
Protests also took place in Paris, Sofia (Bulgaria), Vilnius (Lithuania), Valetti (Malta), Tallinn (Estonia), Edinburgh and Glasgow (Scotland).
About 200 people protested near the offices of large copyright holders in London.
Last month, there were mass protests in Poland when the country signed the TUPK, which led to the Polish government decided not to ratify the deal so far.
Latvia and Slovakia have postponed the process of joining the TUPK.
The Animal Liberation Organization and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Animal Abuse (KTZPP) again call for mandatory installation of surveillance cameras on all Australian slaughterings.
New South Wales CTZT chief inspector David O'Schennessy told the ATC that surveillance and inspection of slaughter sites should become commonplace in Australia.
“The video surveillance system will certainly remind people who work with animals that animal welfare is the highest priority.”
According to the international map of earthquakes of the US Geological Survey, there were no earthquakes in Iceland in the previous week.
Iceland’s Meteorological Office also reported no seismic activity in the Hekla area over the past 48 hours.
Significant seismic activity that led to a phase change occurred on March 10 on the northeast side of the volcano's caldera summit.
At the foot of the mountain, dark clouds were found, not related to volcanic activity.
Clouds brought the probability of confusion as to whether an eruption really occurred.
The moon had 120-160 cubic meters of fuel on board when he crashed, and strong winds and waves threw it on the waver. 
The helicopter rescued twelve crew members, and the broken nose became the only damage received.
The 100-meter vessel was on the road to pick up its standard fertilizer cargo, and officials initially feared that the ship could shed cargo.
The proposed amendment was already adopted by both chambers in 2011.
The change was made by this legislative session when the second sentence was originally removed by the House of Representatives and then passed in a similar form in the Senate on Monday.
The failure of the second sentence, which suggests banning same-sex civil unions, could theoretically open doors to civil unions in the future.
Following this process, a joint resolution under the HJR-3 symbol will be revised again by the next elected legislature in 2015 or 2016, regarding its leaving in action.
Among Votier's achievements, in addition to directing, one can mention the 1973 famine against what he considered political censorship.
French law has changed. His activism returned at age 15, when he joined the French Resistance Movement during World War II.
He documented himself in a 1998 book.

Carno is a well-known but controversial English tutor who taught on behalf of Modern Education and Kings Gloria, and stated that at the peak of his career he had 9,000 students. 
In his notes, he used words that some parents considered rude, and also, as noted, he used profanity in class.
School Modern Education accused him of placing large advertisements on buses without permission, as well as lies as to be the main English tutor.
Prior to this, he was also accused of violating intellectual rights, but were not charged.
A former student said he used slang classes, taught him to go on notes and was just a friend of students.
Over the past three decades, despite China officially remaining a communist state, it has developed a market economy.
The first economic reforms were carried out under the leadership of Dan Xiaoping.
Since then, China’s economy has grown 90 times.
For the first time in all of time, China exported more cars than Germany over the past year and outpaced the United States as the largest market in this industry.
China’s GDP could be larger than the GDP of the United States in two decades.
Tropical Storm Daniel, the fourth storm in the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season, formed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean.
The storm, about 3,000 miles from Miami, Florida, has a maximum wind speed of 40 miles per hour (64 km/h).
Scientists from the National Hurricane Center predict that Daniel will gain hurricane power by Wednesday.
Since the hurricane is far from land, it is still difficult to assess its potential impact on the United States or the Caribbean.
Born in the capital of Croatia, Zagreb, Bobek gained his fame playing for Belgrade Partizan.
He joined them in 1945 and played in their lineup until 1958.
When he was on the team, he scored 403 goals in 468 games.
No one has ever left more times or scored more goals than Bobek.
In 1995, he was elected the best player in Partizan's history.
The celebration began with a special show of the world-famous Circa du Solei.
The example was then taken by the Istanbul State Symphony Orchestra, Janicar ensemble and singers Fatih Erkoch and Muslum Gjurses.
Then the derviers came to the stage, which turned.
Turkish pop diva Sesen Aksu performed with Italian tenor Alessandro Safina and Greek singer Haris Alexiu.
In conclusion, the Turkish dance group Fire of Anatolia performed a dance performance "Troy".
Peter Lenz, a 13-year-old motorcycle racer, died in a car accident on Indianapolis high-speed track.
As he traveled a circle for heating, Lenz fell off his motorcycle, then he was hit by another racer, Xavier Zayat.
He was immediately examined by full-time doctors and taken to a local hospital where he later died.
The son was not injured in the incident.
As for the financial situation in the world, Zapatero continued, saying that "the financial system is part of the economy, the most important part of it.
We are experiencing a financial crisis that has been going on for a year and has escalated in the last two months, and I think that financial markets are now beginning to recover.”
Last week, the Naked News announced that they would greatly increase their requirements for reporting in international languages, with three new broadcasters.
Already broadcasting in English and Japanese, this worldwide organization is launching language programs in Spanish, Italian and Korean for television, the Internet and mobile devices.
Fortunately, nothing happened to me, but I saw a terrible scene when people tried to break the windows to get out. 
People beat the window bumps with chairs, but the windows could not be broken.
"One window glass finally broke and they started to climb the window," said the injured Franciszek Koval.
Stars emit light and heat due to the energy that is formed when hydrogen atoms are drained (or alloyed) together and form heavier elements.
Scientists are working to create a reactor that can extract energy in the same way.
However, this problem is very difficult to solve, and it will take many years before we witness the construction of suitable thermonuclear reactors.
The steel needle is kept on the surface of the water through surface tension.
Surface tension occurs because water molecules on its surface are tied to each other much stronger than to air molecules above them.
Water molecules form an invisible film on its surface that allows objects such as needle to swim on the surface of water.
The blade on a modern slide has double edges and a concaquest between them. Two edges provide better ice grip even during inclination.
Since the lower part of the blade is slightly curved when the blade leans in one side or the other, the edge that has contact with the ice bends.
This allows the skater to return. If the skates are tilted to the right, the skater turns right if the skates are tilted to the left, the skater turns to the left.
To return to their previous energy level, they must get rid of the excess energy they received from light.
They do this by emitting a small particle of light called a "photon".
Scientists call this process "stimuled radiation" because atoms are stimulated by bright light, causing radiation to photon light, and light is a type of radiation.
The following image depicts atoms that emit photons. Of course, in fact, photons are much smaller than in this picture.
Photons are even less than what atoms are made of!
After hundreds of hours of operation, the spiral in the light bulb eventually burns, and the light bulb no longer works.
The lamp must be replaced. When replacing the lamp, you need to be careful.
First, you need to turn off the switch of the lighting device or disconnect the cable.
This is because the electric current, directed to the cartridge of the light bulb where its metal part is located, can cause you a strong blow by electric current if you touch the inner part of the cartridge or the metal base of the light bulb when it is still in the cartridge.
The main organ of the cardiovascular system is the heart that pumps blood.
Blood leaves the heart through the tubes called the artery and returns back to the heart through tubes called veins. The smallest tubes are called capillaries.
Triceratops teeth could crush not only leaves, but even strong branches and roots.
Some scientists believe that triceraptors ate the saga palm palm, a plant common in the Cretaceous period. 
These plants are similar to small palm trees with sharp prickly leaves at the top.
Triceratops could use its strong beak to tear down the leaves before eating the trunk.
Other scientists suggest that these plants are extremely poisonous, so it is unlikely that their dinosaurs were eaten, although even today sloth and other animals, such as parrots (a descendant of dinosaurs) eat poisonous leaves or fruits.
How would Io's gravity affect me? Standing on the surface of Io, you will weigh less than on Earth.
A person weighing 200 pounds (90 kg) on Earth would weigh approximately 36 pounds (16 kg) on Io. Gravity, of course, attracts you less. 
The sun has no crust like the Earth on which you can stand. It is entirely composed of gases, fire and plasma.
The further from the center of the Sun, the layer of gas is thinner.
The outer part we see when we look at the sun is called the photosphere, meaning "ball of light".
About three thousand years later, in 1610, Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei saw Venus, like the Moon, had three phases.
Phases are because only the side of Venus (or moon) is illuminated, returned to the Sun. Venus’ phases support Copernicus’ theory that planets orbit the Sun.
Then, a few years later in 1639, an English astronomer named Jeremiah Horrocks observed the passage of Venus.
After the conquest of Danelag in England, lasting peace came.
However, in 991, Ethelred collided with a Viking fleet larger than any other since Gutrum a century earlier.
This fleet was led by Olaf Truggwason, a Norwegian with ambitions to liberate his country from Danish rule.
After initial military failures, Ethelred was able to negotiate with Olaf, who returned to Norway to try with a variable success to conquer his kingdom.
Hangil is the only specially created alphabet that is in everyday use. Alphabet was invented in 1444 during the reign of King Seghon (1418-1450).
King Sejong was the fourth king of the Joseon Dynasty and is one of the highest appreciated.
He originally called Hanhil Hongmin Yongeum, meaning "the right sounds to control people."
There are many theories about how Sanskrit originated. One of them concerns the migration of the Aryans from west to India, who brought their language with them.
Sanskrit is an ancient language, and can be compared to Latin in Europe.
The oldest of the world’s most famous books were written in Sanskrit. The Sanskrit language disappeared through the hierarchy after the Upanishad was laid down.
Sanskrit is a very complex and rich language that has become the source of many modern Indian languages, just as Latin was a source of European languages such as French and Spanish.
When the Battle of France ended, Germany began preparations for the capture of Britain's island.
Germany called the attack the code name "Operation "Sea Lion". Most of the heavy weapons and food of the British Army was lost during the evacuation from Dunkirk, so the army was quite weak.
But the Royal Navy was still much stronger than the German Navy ("Krigsmarine") and could crush any fleet that could invade the English Canal.
However, very few ships of the Royal Navy were located near likely invasion routes, as the admirals feared that they would be sunk by German air strikes.
Let’s start with an explanation for Italy’s plans. Italy was the “younger brother” of Germany and Japan.
It had a weaker army and a weaker fleet, although it built four new ships before the war began.
Italy’s main goals were African countries. To capture these countries, they would need a springboard for troops so that troops could cross the Mediterranean and enter Africa.
They needed to get rid of British bases and ships in Egypt. Italian warships had no longer done anything but these actions.
Now about Japan. Japan was an island state, as was Britain.
Submarines are vessels designed to move underwater and stay there for a long time.
Submarines were used during the First and Second World Wars. They were very slow and had a very limited range of shooting.
At the beginning of the war, they mostly traveled on the sea surface, but as radars began to develop and become more accurate, submarines were forced to dive under water so that they were not noticed.
German submarines were called U-Boats. The Germans were very well aware of navigation and management of their submarines.
Because the Germans conducted successful operations on submarines, after the war they were not trusted to have them in large numbers.
Yeah! Pharaoh Tutankhamun, sometimes called "Paraon Tut" or "faraon boy", is one of the most famous pharaohs of ancient Egypt today.
Interestingly, in ancient times it was not considered especially important, and was not noted in most lists of ancient pharaohs.
However, the discovery of his tomb in 1922 made him a celebrity. Although many burials of the past were robbed, this tomb remained virtually untouched.
Most of the things buried with Tutankhamun are well preserved, including thousands of artifacts made of precious metals and rare stones.
After the invention of wheels with knitting needles, Assyrian chariots became easier, faster and better prepared for the overtaking of soldiers and other chariots.
Arrows from their deadly crossbows could penetrate the armor of opponents. Around 1000 BC, the Assyrians formed the first cavalry.
Cavalry is a military unit that fights horses. The saddle had not yet been invented by then, so Assyrian cavalry fought on the bare backs of horses.
We know many Greek politicians, scientists and artists. Perhaps the most popular person belonging to this culture is Homer, a legendary blind poet who wrote two masterpieces of Greek literature: the poems “Iliad” and “Odyssey”.
The dramas Sophocles and Aristofan are still popular, and their plays are among the greatest works of world literature. 
Another famous Greek is the mathematician Pythagoras, known mainly for his famous theorem on the ratio of sides of a correct triangle.
There are different calculations of how many people speak Hindi. It is located between about the second and fourth most used languages in the world.
The number of native speakers differs depending on whether closely related dialects are taken into account.
It is estimated that between 340 and 500 million are native speakers, and up to 800 million people can understand it.
Hindi and Urdu languages are similar in vocabulary but are different in writing; in everyday communication, speakers of both languages can usually understand each other.
Around the 15th century, northern Estonia was under great cultural influence in Germany.
Some German monks wanted to bring God closer to the locals, so they invented Estonian literal language.
It was based on the German alphabet, and one symbol " ?/" was added.
Many words borrowed from German later began to mix. This was the beginning of the era of enlightenment.
Traditionally, after graduation, the heir of the throne immediately goes to the army.
However, Charles entered the University at Trinity College in Cambridge, where he studied anthropology and archaeology and then history, receiving 2:2 (lower second grade degree).
Charles was the first member of the British royal family to receive a degree.
European Turkey (eastern Thrace or Rumelia in the Balkan Peninsula) occupies 3% of the country's territory.
Turkey is more than 1600 kilometers (1000 miles) long and 800 km (500 miles) wide, and has an approximate rectangle shape.
Turkey's area, including lakes, is 783,562 square meters. km (300,948 sq. miles), of which 755,688 square meters. km (291,773 sq. miles) are in southwestern Asia and 23,764 square meters. km (9 174 sq. miles) in Europe.
Turkey ranks 37th in the world in size, and is approximately equal to the metropolitan area of France and the UK combined.
On three sides, Turkey is surrounded by seas: from the west - Aegean, from the north - Black and from the south - Mediterranean.
Luxembourg has a long history, but its independence began to count in 1839.
The current territories of Belgium were formerly part of Luxembourg, but came under Belgian control after the Belgian Revolution of the 1830s.
Luxembourg has always tried to remain a neutral country, but was occupied by Germany both in World War I and World War II.
In 1957, Luxembourg became one of the founders of the organization, which is today known as the European Union.
Drukgyal Dzong is a destroyed fortress and Buddhist monastery in the upper part of the Paro area (in the village of Fonda).
In 1649, Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal built a fortress in honor of his victory over Tibetan-Mongolian troops.
Due to the 1951 fire, only some of the relics of Druckgiel-dzong remained, such as the images of Shabdrung Ngwang Namgyal.
After the fire, the fortress was preserved and protected, remaining one of Bhutan's most sensational monuments.
In the 18th century, Cambodia was clamped between two powerful neighbors, Thailand and Vietnam.
In the 18th century, the Thais conquered Cambodia several times, and in 1772 destroyed Phnom Penh.
In the last years of the 18th century, Vietnamese also invaded Cambodia.
Eighteen percent of Venezuelans are out of work, and most of those who have work in the field of informal economics.
Two-thirds of Venezuela’s employed population is working in the service sector, and almost a quarter works in the industrial sector, and agriculture is engaged in a fifth.
An important industry for Venezuelans is oil mining, in which the country is a net exporter, although only 1 percent of the population works in the oil industry.
At the beginning of the country's independence, the knowledge and experience of the botanical garden of Singapore helped to turn the island into a tropical garden city.
In 1981, Wanda Miss Hoakim, a hybrid of orchids, was chosen as the country's national flower.
Every year, some October, approximately 1.5 million herbivores travel from northern hills to southern plains for rains, crossing the Mara River.
And then they return north through the west, crossing the Mara River again, after rains falling around April.
The Serengeti region includes Serengeti National Park, the Ngorongoro Conservation Area and Masva Reserve in Tanzania, and Masai Mara National Reserve in Kenya.
Learning to create interactive media content requires generally accepted and traditional skills, as well as techniques studied in interactive classes (telling, editing audio and video, stories, etc.).
Interactive design requires you to overestimate your ideas about media production and learn to think nonlinearly.
Interactive design requires that the components of the project are combined with each other and at the same time make sense as separate units.
The disadvantage of variable focal length lenses is that the complexity of the focus and the number of lenses of the optical system needed to reach a focal length range are much larger than in lenses with a constant focal length.
This problem gradually disappears, as lens manufacturers reach higher standards of their manufacture.
This allowed zoom lenses to create photos in quality comparable to the one achieved by lenses with a constant focal length.
Another disadvantage of zoom lenses is that the maximum aperture (speed) of the lens is usually lower.
Because of this, inexpensive vario-objects are difficult to use in conditions of poor lighting without flash.
One of the most common problems during the conversion of the film into a DVD format is the border.
Most TVs are made in such a way as to like the general public.
That's why everything you see on TV has cropped boundaries from above, bottom and sides.
This is done to ensure that the image covers the entire screen. It's called a roll.
Unfortunately, when creating the DWD edge, the video is most likely to be cut, and if the video contained subtitles too close to the lower edge, they will not be displayed completely.
The traditional medieval castle has long been an inspiration, causing scenes of matches, banquets and Knights of Arthur in imagination.
Even standing among the thousand-year ruins, it is easy to imagine the long-forgottened sounds and smells of battles, almost hear the knocking hoofs on the paving and feel the fear that rises with the pit of the dungeon.
But is our imagination based on reality? Why were castles built first? How were they designed and built?
Typical of Kirby Maxlo Castle for that period is rather a fortified house, not a real castle.
Its large glazed windows and thin walls could not long resist a decisive attack.
In 1480, when Lord Hastings began its construction, the country was relatively calm, and protection was needed only from small groups of nomadic marauders.
The balance of forces was a system in which European states tried to maintain the state sovereignty of all European countries.
The idea was that all European nations should keep in order to prevent one nation from becoming powerful, and thus national governments often changed their alliances to maintain balance.
The War of Spanish Succession marked the first war, the main issue of which was the ratio of forces.
This marked an important change, because European forces no longer had a reason to wage religious wars. Thus, the Thirty Years' War was the last war called religious.
The Temple of Artemis in Ephesus was destroyed on July 21, 356. BC. e. As a result of arson by Herostrat.
According to this story, his motivation was glory at all costs. The Ephesian, angry, announced that the name of the Gerostrat would never be recorded.
The Greek historian Strabon later recorded a name, so we know it today. The temple was destroyed on the same night Alexander the Great was born.
Alexander as king offered funds to restore the temple, but his offer was rejected. Later, after Alexander's death, the temple was restored in 323 BC.
Relax your hand as much as possible, while still pressing the right keys, so try not to make unnecessary movements with your fingers.
This way, you will get tired much less. Remember that you don’t have to press keys with a lot of effort to get extra sound like a piano.
On the accordion, to reach a larger volume, you need to use miches with greater pressure or speed.
Mysticism is the search for community with, identity from or conscious perception of the highest reality, divinity, spiritual truth, or God.  
The believer seeks a direct experience, sense or understanding of divine reality/dangerdity or deities.
Followers follow certain ways of life or customs aimed at feeding such experience.
Mysticism can be distinguished from other forms of religious beliefs and worship its focus on the direct personal experience of a unique state of consciousness, especially the experience of a calm, insightful, blissful or even ecstatic character.
Sikhism is a religion from the Indian subcontinent. It was founded during the 15th century in the Punjab region as a result of confessional separation from the Hindu tradition.
Sikhs consider their faith separate from Hinduism a religion, although they recognize its Hindu roots and traditions.
Sikhs call their religion Gurmat, which in Punjabi means "the way of guru". Guru is a fundamental concept of all Indian religions, but in Sikhism it has become of particular importance, and forms the basis of Sikh beliefs.
This religion was founded in the 15th century by Guru Nanak (1469-1539). He was followed by one by the next nine gurus.
However, in June 1956, Khrushchev's promises were tested when unrest in Poland, where workers protested against food shortages and wage cuts, turned into a general protest against communism.
Although Khrushchev sent tanks to restore order at the end, he did satisfy certain economic demands and agreed to appoint the popular Vladislav Goulk as the new Prime Minister.
The Indus civilization is a Bronze Age civilization in the northwest of the Indian subcontinent that covered most of modern Pakistan, as well as some areas in northwestern India and northeastern Afghanistan.
Civilization bloomed in the Indus River basin, where its name comes from.
Although some scientists suggest that since civilization also existed in the pools of the now dried Saraswati River, it would be right to call it the Hindu-Sarasvat civilization, others call it the Harappan civilization, called Harappa, the first place where it was found in the 1920s.
The militarization of the Roman Empire contributed to success in the development of medicine.
Emperor Augustus began hiring doctors and even created the first Roman Medical Corps to provide help after the battles.
Surgeons have been aware of a variety of sedatives, including morphine from poppy seeds and scopolamine from grass seeds.
They perfectly mastered amputation to save patients from gangrene, as well as harnesses and arterial clamps to stop bleeding.
Over the centuries, the Roman Empire has made great success in the field of medicine and has formed much of the knowledge known to us today.
Simple origami is a technique that allows you to do only one bend at a time. Complex bends like reverses are prohibited, in addition, all bends must be performed in direct places.
John Smith developed it in the 1970s to help unleavened origami or people with limited motor skills.
Children learn about races and racial stereotypes quite early and such racial stereotypes affect behavior.
For example, children who are racial minorities, who are stereotypes about poor school learning, tend to learn poorly when they learn about such stereotypes.
MySpace is the most popular website used in the United States, and currently has 54 million profiles.
These sites have been paid a lot of attention, especially in the education system.
There are also positive aspects of these websites that include the ability to easily customize a class page covering blogs, videos, photos and other materials.
Access to this page can be easily obtained by entering only one Internet address, making it easy to remember and easily recruit students who may have problems using a keyboard or spelling.
It can be customized so that it is easy to read, and you can also add as many colors as needed.
Attention deficit syndrome is "this is a neurological disorder, the classical triad of symptoms of which includes impulsiveness, distraction and hyperactivity or excess energy." 
It's not a learning ability disorder, it's a learning ability disorder; it "relations from 3 to 5 percent of all children, perhaps as many as 2 million American children."
Children with ADHD find it difficult to focus on things like school tasks, but they can focus on the things they like to do, how to play games, or watch their favorite cartoons, or write sentences without sectional signs. 
Such children tend to get into trouble often because they "take risky behavior, arrange fights and do not obey older ones" to stimulate their brains, since this is not possible to do in the usual ways.
The SDU affects relationships with other peers because other children do not understand why they behave or communicate this, and that their maturity level is different.
As the ability to gain knowledge and learn in the way mentioned above changed, the basic speed of knowledge acquisition changed.
The approach to receiving information was different. There was no longer emphasis on personal recall, but the focus more included the ability to recall text.
The Renaissance has significantly changed the approach to learning and the dissemination of knowledge.
Unlike other primates, hominids no longer use hands to move, carry weights, or pump in trees. 
The chimpanzee's hands and legs are similar in size and length, which suggests using hands to carry weight while walking on four limbs.
The human hand is shorter than the leg, with more straight palangs.
Fossiled hand bones aged two or three million years indicate a functional transition from the ability to move your hands to skillfully control them.
Some people believe that experiencing many artificially caused conscious dreams too often can be very exhausting.
The main reason for this phenomenon is that conscious dreams prolong the time duration between the stages of fast sleep.
With fewer stages of fast sleep per night, this condition in which you experience real sleep and your body recovers becomes frequent enough to make this a problem.
It’s as exhausting as waking up every twenty or thirty minutes for watching TV.
The effect depends on how often your brain tries to consciously see dreams overnight.
In North Africa, things in Italians did not start almost from the beginning. Within a week after Italy declared war on 10 June 1940, the British 11th Hussar regiment captured Fort Capuzzo in Libya.
In an ambush east of Bardi, the British captured General Lastucci's chief engineer of the Italian tenth army.
On 28 June, Marshal Italo Balbo, Governor General of Libya and Mussolini's direct heir, was killed by friendly fire while landing in Tobruka.
Fencing as a modern sport is done at many levels, from students in universities to professionals, as well as at the Olympic Games.
In this sport, mostly play duel format when one fencing player opposes another.
Golf is a game in which players use keys to score balls into the holes.
The usual round covers eighteen holes. Players usually start with the first hole and finish at eighteenth.
The player who makes the smallest punch, or the swings with a hatch to complete the course wins.
The game takes place on grass. The grass around the hole is trimmed shorter and is called Green.
Perhaps the most common type of tourism is what people associate with travel: recreational tourism.
This is when people go to a place that doesn’t look like their life all in order to relax and have fun.
Beaches, theme parks and camping places are most often the places most visited by tourists traveling for pleasure. 
If the purpose of the visit to a particular place is to familiarize yourself with its history and culture, then this type of tourism is known as cultural tourism.
Tourists can visit different places in a particular country, or can simply focus only in one area.
Upon seeing these actions, the colonists also called reinforcements.
The troops that strengthened the forward positions included the 1st and 3rd regiments of New Hampshire, which numbered 200 people under Colonels John Stark and James Reed (both later became generals).
Stark's people took positions along the particle on the northern edge of the colonists' position.
When the spilled up a gap in the Mystic River in the northeast of the peninsula, they quickly expanded the fence with a short stone wall in the direction of the north, which ended at the edge of water on a small beach.
Gridley or Stark placed a pillar of about 100 feet (30 m) in front of the fence and ordered that no one shoot until regular troops passed by it.
The American plan provided for coordinated attacks from 3 different directions.
General John Cadwalder would begin a distraction on the British garrison in Bordentown to close its path to reinforcement.
General James Ewing intended to transfer 700 militias across the river to Trenton across the river, occupy the bridge through Assunpink Bay, and prevent enemy troops from escaping.
A main assault group of 2,400 men crossed the river nine miles north of Trenton and then crashed into two groups — one under Green's command, one under Sullivan's command, in order to go on the offensive before dawn.
With the transition to races from quarter to half a mile, speed begins to play a much smaller role, instead endurance becomes an absolute necessity.
Of course, a first-class runner on half a mile — a person who can run faster than two minutes — should have enough speed, but also you need to develop endurance.
Running in the crossed area in winter combined with upper body training is the best preparation for the running season.
It is just proper nutrition that will not help to achieve good results, but it can significantly affect the overall health of young athletes.
Maintaining healthy energy balance, practicing effective water habits and understanding the various aspects of supplement use can help athletes improve their results and increase their sports pleasure.
Middle-distance running is a relatively inexpensive sport; however, there are many misconceptions about several elements of equipment needed to participate.
If necessary, you can purchase equipment elements, but most of them will either have a small or will have no real impact on the result.
Athletes can choose a product, even if it does not have real advantages.
Atom can be considered one of the main components of all matter.
It is a very complex unit that, according to the simplified Bore model, consists of a central nucleus around which electrons rotate, which is somewhat similar to planets orbiting the Sun - see Figure 1.1.
The nucleus consists of two particles - neutrons and protons.
Protons have a positive electric charge, and neutrons have no charge. Electrons are negatively charged.
Before you look at the victim, first make sure it is safe there.
When approaching the injured person, it is necessary to assess the place and determine any alarming points.
If you hurt yourself trying to help, you will only worsen the situation.
The study found that depression, fear and disasterization acted as intermediaries between pain and disabilities in people suffering from lower back pain.
Only the effects of disasterization, not depression or fear, depended on regular weekly structured physical education.
Those who are engaged in regular physical activity need additional support in terms of negative perception of pain, which allows you to distinguish chronic pain and discomfort from normal physical movement.
Vision, or ability to see, depends on the sensory organs of the visual system or eyes.
There are many different eye designs that differ in complexity depending on the body's needs.
Different structures have different possibilities sensitive to different wavelengths, have different degrees of sharpness, and also require different processing processes to understand the meaning of input information, and different quantities for optimal operation. 
Population is a set of organisms of a particular species within a given territory.
When all individuals in a population have a certain identical phenotypic rice, they are known as monomorphic.
When individuals show several variants of a particular feature, they are polymorphic.
Colonies of traveling ants move and nest at different periods.
During the nomadic period, ant-nominers march at night, and stop in the camp during the day.
When the amount of food available decreases, the nomadic period begins in the colony. During this period, the colony builds temporary nests that change every day.
Each of these nomadic buoys or marches lasts about 17 days.
What is a cell? The word "cell" comes from the Latin word "cella", meaning "little room", and for the first time this term was used by a microscopyer who studied the structure of the crust.
The cell is the main unit of all living beings, and all organisms are made up of one or more cells.
Cells are so basic and important for studying life that they are often called “building bricks of life.”
The nervous system supports homeostasis by sending nerve impulses through the body to support good and unhindered blood circulation.
These nerve impulses pass the body very quickly, which helps protect it from any potential threats.
Tornados hit a small area compared to other unsatiable storms, but they can destroy everything in their path.
Tornados tear out trees with root, tear down boards from houses and throw cars to the sky. The worst two percent of tornadoes last more than three hours.
The wind speed in these hurricanes-monsters is 480 km/h (133 m/s; 300 mph).
People have been making and using lenses to increase over thousands of years.
However, the first real telescopes were created in Europe in the late 16th century.
These telescopes combined two lenses to approach and at the same time increase distant objects.
Greed and selfishness will always be with us, and such a nature of cooperation that when most benefit, there will always be more benefit that can be obtained in a short time, acting selfishly.
I hope most people understand that their best option in the long run is to work with others. 
Many people dream of a day when people will be able to travel to another star and explore other worlds, some people are interested in what is there, some believe that aliens or other life may exist on another planet.
But if it ever happens, it probably won’t happen very long. The stars are so scattered that there are trillions of miles between them that are "neighbors".
Maybe one day your great-grandchildren will stand on top of someone else's world, thinking about their ancient ancestors?
Animals are made up of many cells. They eat food and digest it in themselves. Most animals can move.
Only animals have brains (although not even all animals have; jellyfish, for example, do not have brains).
Animals are found all over the planet. They dig holes in the ground, swim in the oceans and fly in the sky.
The cell is the smallest structural and functional unit of a living organism (things).
The cell comes from the Latin word cella, which means a small room.
If you look at living creatures under a microscope, you can see that they consist of small squares or balls.
Robert Hooke, a biologist from England, saw small cells in a microscope through a microscope.
They looked like rooms. He was the first person to see dead cells.
The compounds and elements can change from one state to another.
Nitrogen in a gaseous state still has the same properties as liquid nitrogen. In a liquid state, it is thicker, but the molecules remain the same.
Another example is water. Water composition: two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.
It has the same molecular structure in a gaseous, liquid or solid state.
Although its physical condition may change, its chemical composition remains the same.
It’s what surrounds us and affects everything we do, but difficult to understand.
For thousands of years, religious scholars, philosophers and scientists have been studying time.
We are experiencing time as a number of events that pass from the future through the present to the past.
Time is also how we measure the duration (length) of events.
You can notice how time goes by watching a cyclical event repeat. A cyclical event is something that happens over and over again on a regular basis.  
Today, computers are used to manipulate images and videos.
Complex animations can be created on computers, and this type of animation is increasingly used in television and cinema.
Music is often recorded using complex computers to process and erect sounds.
For a long time during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, people believed that the first settlers in New Zealand were Maori people who hunted huge birds called moa. 
Thus, the theory confirmed the idea that the Maori people migrated from Polynesia and conquered New Zealand in the seaside, establishing an agricultural society.
However, new evidence suggests that the Moriori were a group of mainland Maori that migrated from New Zealand to Chatham Islands, developing their own distinctive peaceful culture.
There was another tribe in the Chatham archipelago, it was Maori that migrated from New Zealand.
They called themselves a searior, several more clashes occurred, and eventually the seariers were destroyed.
People who have been involved for decades have helped us appreciate our benefits and passions by openly assessing difficulties and even failures.
Listening to how employees share personal, family and organization-related stories, we have gained valuable evidence about the past, as well as some individuals who have had a positive or negative impact on the culture of the organization.
Understanding one’s history doesn’t mean understanding culture, and yet it helps people feel where they are in the context of the history of the organization.
In assessing success and failing, employees and all involved more deeply discover the values, mission and driving forces of the organization.
In this case, mentioning previous examples of entrepreneurial behavior and the success achieved as a result helped people to be open to new changes and a new direction of the local church.
Such success stories have reduced the fear of change by creating a positive setting for changes in the future.
Convered thinking models are methods of solving problems that combine different ideas or industries to find solutions.
This type of thinking focuses on speed, logic and accuracy, and the establishment of facts, the re-application of existing techniques and information collection.
The most important factor in this way of thinking is that there is only one correct answer. You only think of two options for the answer, namely: correct or wrong.
This type of thinking is related to a certain science or standard procedures.
People with this type of thinking have logical thinking and can remember patterns, solve problems and work on scientific tests.
Of course, humanity is the most talented kind that can read the thoughts of others.
This means that we can successfully predict the perception, intent, belief, knowledge, or desires of other people.
In addition to these abilities, it is extremely important to understand the intentions of other people. This allows us to deal with possible ambiguity of physical action.
If you saw someone breaking the glass of a car, you would most likely assume that this person is trying to steal someone else's car. 
It would be necessary to look at it differently if he lost his car keys, and it would be his own car to which he was trying to penetrate.
MRI is based on the physical phenomenon of nuclear magnetic resonance (YMR), which was discovered in the 1930s by Felix Bloch (who worked at Stanford University) and Edward Percell (from Harvard University).
In this resonance, the magnetic field and radio waves force atoms to emit tiny radio signals.
In 1970, Raymond Damadian, a doctor and research scientist, discovered the basis for the use of magnetic resonance imaging as a medical diagnostic tool.
Four years later, a patent was issued, which became the world's first patent obtained in the field of MRI.
In 1977, Dr. Damadyan completed the creation of the first MRI scanner "for the whole body", which he called "Unbridled".
Asynchronous communication encourages time to think and react to others.
This enables students to learn and get information at their own pace and control it.
In addition, there are fewer time limits and there is a possibility of flexible work schedule (Bremer, 1998).
Using the Internet and the World Wide Web gives students the ability to access information at any time.
Instead of waiting for the next personal meeting, students can also ask instructors questions anytime during the day and expect a relatively quick response.
The postmodern approach to learning offers freedom from absolute principles. There is no good way to learn.
There is no good thing to learn. Learning is based on the student's interaction and the knowledge presented.
Our current experience with all events and information, as well as learning-based television shows illustrates this.
Many of us watch television shows that inform us about a process or experience in which we will never participate or apply that knowledge.
We will never do a major car repair, we will not build a fountain in our backyard, we will not go to Peru to explore the ancient ruins, or not to rework our neighbor's house.
Thanks to underwater fiber-optic cable lines with Europe and broadband satellite television, Greenland has good communication 93% of the population with Internet access.
Your hotel or host (if you stay in a guest home or private person) will most likely have a Wi-Fi or an Internet computer, and all settlements have an internet salon or places with free Wi-Fi.
As mentioned above, although the word “eschimos” remains acceptable in the United States, however, many Arctic peoples outside the United States, especially in Canada, consider it disrespectful.
This word can be heard from the mouth of the indigenous Greenlandic population, but it is not worth using it yourself.
The indigenous people of Greenland call themselves inuit in Canada and calaalek (multiple calalit), that is, Greenland, in Greenland.
Crime and ill-kind treatment of foreigners in general in Greenland are actually unknown. There are no “dark areas” in cities.
Cold weather is probably the only real danger for unprepared travelers.
If you visit Greenland in the cold season (the further you move north, then the colder temperature awaits you), you need to take warm clothes with you.
Very long days in summer can lead to sleep problems and appropriate health difficulties.
In summer, also follow Scandinavian mosquitoes. Although they do not transmit any diseases, they can be annoying.
The San Francisco economy is influenced by the fact that the city is a tourist object of a global scale, but at the same time it is multi-industry.
The largest employment sectors are professional services, government, finance, trade and tourism.
His frequent reflections in music, films, literature and works of popular culture helped make the city and its landmarks famous worldwide.
San Francisco has developed a large tourist infrastructure with numerous hotels, restaurants and first-class conference centers.
In addition, San Francisco is one of the best places in the country for other Asian cuisines: Korean, Thai, Indian and Japanese.
Traveling to Walt Disney World is a great pilgrimage for many American families.
"Type" visits include arrival at Orlando International Airport, a bus trip to the Disney Hotel, a visa-free stay at the amusement center for about a week and returning home.
There are many possible options, but that’s what most people mean when they talk about going to Disney World.
Many tickets sold online through auction sites such as eBay or Craigslist are partially used multiday tickets to parks.
This practice is very common, but Disneyland prohibits it: you can not transfer tickets.
Any camping in the Grand Canyon below the ring requires permission to visit remote areas of the state. 
To protect the canyon, there are restrictions on permits that become available on the first day of the month four months before the initial one.
Thus, permission to visit remote areas of the state at any start date becomes available on January 1.
Places in the most popular areas such as Bright Angel Campground Circle Fentom Ranch are mostly filled with the partial requests received on the first day of the booking start.
There are a limited number of permits that can be issued as invitations to enter, which are available on the principle of who came first, the first and is served.
A road trip by South Africa is an amazing way to see all the beauty of the region, as well as visit places outside of conventional tourist routes.
This can be done on a conventional machine if you plan everything carefully, but we are very advised to 4x4, and many places can only be reached by 4x4 with a long wheelbase.
Keep in mind that while South Africa is stable, not all neighboring countries are like that.
Visa requirements and expenses differ from country to country and depend on where you came from.
In each country, there are also unique laws that establish a list of essentials that should be in the car.
Victoria Falls is a town in western Zimbabwe, across the border from Livingston, Zambia, and near Botswana.
The town is located near waterfalls and they are the main tourist attraction; but this popular tourist destination offers both adventurers and tour fans plenty of opportunities to stay longer.
During the rainy season (from November to March), the volume of water will be larger and waterfalls will be more impressive.
You will definitely shut down if you cross the bridge or walk with the trops that stare next to the waterfalls.
On the other hand, just because the volume of water is so large, your own waterfall can be limited — with all water!
Tutankhamun's tomb (KV62). KV62 is perhaps the most famous of the tombs in Valley, the opening site by Howard Carter in 1922 of the almost untouched royal burial of a young monarch.
However, compared to most other royal tombs, Tutankhamun's grave is barely worth visiting because it is much smaller and stingly decorated.
Anyone interested in seeing evidence of damage caused by the mummy during attempts to remove it from the sarcophagus will be disappointed because only the head and shoulders are visible.
The famous treasures of the tomb are no longer in it, but were transferred to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.
Visitors who have limited time are better off to devote it to another place.
Kram 12 km northwest of Siemreap. This temple on top of a hill was built in the late 9th century, during the reign of King Yasovarman.
On the slope should be torn out for the sake of the gloomy atmosphere of the castle and the view that opens to Lake Tonlesap.
Traveling to the place can be conveniently combined with a walking lake in a boat.
On the way to the temple, you need to cross the Angkor Pass, so do not forget to grab your passport, going to Tonlesap.
Jerusalem is the capital and largest city of Israel, but most other countries and the UN do not recognize it as the capital of Israel.
The ancient city on the Jewish hills has an fascinating history that dates back thousands of years.
The city is sacred to three monotheistic faiths - Judaism, Christianity and Islam, and acts as a spiritual, religious and cultural center.
Because of the city's religious significance and, in particular, numerous attractions in the Old City area, Jerusalem is one of the main tourist destinations in Israel.
Jerusalem has many historical, archaeological and cultural monuments, as well as bright and crowded shopping centers, cafes and restaurants.
Ecuador is demanding a letter from Cuban citizens inviting to enter Ecuador through international airports or border checkpoints.
This letter must be drawn up in accordance with certain requirements and legalized by the Ecuador Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
These requirements are designed to ensure an organized migration flow between the two countries.
Cuban citizens who own a “green card” of the United States need to visit the Ecuador Consulate to get exemption from this requirement.
Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months after the dates of the trip. To confirm the duration of the trip, a return ticket or ticket to a third country is required.
For large groups, tours are cheaper, so if you travel alone or with one friend, try to find other people and form a group of four to six people to get the best price per person.
However, this would not really bother you, because often tourists are distributed so that they fill the cars.
In fact, it’s more like a way to make people believe they need to pay more.
Above the northern edge of Machu Picchu rises this steep mountain, and often becomes a background for numerous photographs of the ruins.
Below it looks a little confusing, it's a cool and difficult climb, but most people in good physical shape would have to overcome it in about 45 minutes.
Most of the path is laid out by stone steps, and seats with a steeper slope are equipped with steel cables that serve as additional handrails.
However, expect you to not be able to breathe air and take care of steeper areas, especially when they are wet, as they can become dangerous in a short period of time.
At the top there is a tiny cave that must be passed, it is quite low and somewhat cramped.
Visiting interesting and seeing the wildlife of the Galapagos Islands is best on the boat, taking the example of Charles Darwin in 1835.
More than 60 cruise liners with a capacity of 8 to 100 passengers are cruises through Galapagos waters.
Most people reserve their seats in advance (since boats are usually filled in high season).
Make sure that the agent through whom you make the booking is a specialist from the Galapagos Islands who knows a variety of ships well.
This will ensure that your specific interests and/or restrictions will be consistent with the vessel that suits them most.
Before the Spanish arrived in the 16th century, northern Chile was under Inca rule, while the indigenous Araucans (Mapuche) lived in central and southern Chile.
Mapuche was also one of the last independent American indigenous groups to not absorb Spanish-speaking rule until Chile's independence.
Although Chili declared independence in 1810 (in the middle of the Napoleonic Wars that left Spain without a functional central government for several years), a decisive victory over Spain was not achieved until 1818.
Dominican Republic (Spanish: Rep?blica Dominica is a Caribbean country that occupies the eastern half of the island of Hispaniol, which it shares from Haiti.
In addition to white sand beaches and mountain landscapes, the country is home to the oldest European city in the Americas, now part of Santo Domingo.
Taino and Caribs were the first settlers on the island. The Caribbean were a people who spoke Arawaki and settled here around 10,000 years. BC.
For the few short years since the arrival of European travelers, the Taino population was significantly reduced by Spanish conquerors.
According to Fry Bartome de las Casa (Tratado de las Indias), between 1492 and 1498, Spanish conquistadors killed at least 100,000 Tainos

The Cook Islands are an island country with a free association with New Zealand, located in Polynesia, in the middle of the South Pacific Ocean.
It is an archipelago consisting of 15 islands that occupy 2.2 million square kilometers of the ocean.
Since the islands are in the same time zone with Hawaii, they are sometimes considered to be the "Gawaia of the Southern Hemisphere".
Although smaller, they remind some elderly visitors in Hawaii before obtaining state status, without all these major tourist hotels and other development results.
The Cook Islands have no cities, but consist of 15 different islands. The main ones are Rarotonga and Aitutaki.
Today, in developed countries, the provision of luxury services within the framework of "night and breakfast" has reached the level of kind of art.
After all, B&B hotels are apparently competing in two main things: bed and breakfast.

Unlike larger vehicles, you are probably already familiar with driving your own car and know its limitations. 
Placing a tent on private ownership or in a city of any size can easily attract unwanted attention.
In short, it’s great to go on a trip by car, but it’s not a very good idea when traveling with tents.
Camping in the car is possible if you have a large minivan, ESSUW, sedan or minibus with seats that are lowered.
Some hotels have a legacy from the heyday of steam railways and ocean liners; until World War II, in the 19th or early 20th centuries.
These hotels were home to rich and famous people of that time, and often enjoyed high cuisine and night entertainment there.
Old-fashioned adaptations, lack of modern amenities and some elegant antiquity are also part of their style.
Despite the fact that they are usually privately owned, sometimes there are a visit by the head of state and other respected persons.
A traveller with a lot of money can think about the flight around the world, divided by rest in many of these hotels.
A hospitality exchange network is an organization that connects travelers to locals in the cities they plan to visit.
To join such a network, it is usually enough to fill in an online form; although some networks offer or require an additional confirmation stage.

The participating countries demonstrate artistic and training expositions in national pavilions to show the world's problems or culture and history of their country.
International gardening exhibitions are specialized events that represent flower expositions, botanical gardens and everything else related to plants.
Although theoretically they can take place annually (as long as they are in different countries), in practice this does not happen.
Such measures in most cases stretch for three to six months and take place in places that have an area of at least 50 hectares.
There are many different film formats that have been used over the years. Standard 35 mm film (negative 36 by 24 mm) is the most common.
If it is over, it can be quite easily replenished, and it gives a resolution roughly comparable to the current mirror camera.
Some medium-sized film cameras use the format 6 by 6 cm, or rather negative 56 by 56 mm.
This gives almost four times more resolution than 35 mm negative (3,136 square millimeters against 864).
Wildlife is one of the most difficult motives for a photographer, and requires talent, patience, experience and good equipment.
Wildlife photos are usually taken for granted, but as in the photo in general, the picture is worth thousands of words. 
To photograph wildlife, it is often necessary to have a telephoto lens, however, to take a picture of a pack of birds or a small creature, other lenses may be needed.
Many exotic animals are difficult to find, and parks sometimes have rules for photography for commercial purposes.
Wild animals can be shy or aggressive. The environment can be cold, hot or otherwise hostile.
There are over 5,000 different languages in the world, including more than twenty languages spoken by 50 million people.
Also, written words are often easier to understand than spoken words. This is especially true for addresses that are often difficult to pronounce.
Many whole nations are fluent in English, and even in more you can expect limited knowledge, especially among young people.
Imagine, for example, a Mankunian, Boston, Jamaican and Sydney sitting at a table and having lunch at a Toronto restaurant.
They entertain each other with stories from their native cities told with distinct accents and local jargon.
Buying food in supermarkets is usually the cheapest way to feed. However, without the possibility of cooking, the choice is limited to ready-made food.
Supermarkets are increasingly expanding their choice in departments with ready-made food. Some even provide a microwave or other food heating products.

Make and carry copies of your policy and contact details of your insurer. 
They must provide an email address and international phone numbers of the insurance company for advice/authorization or for filing complaints.
Keep another copy in your luggage and online (mail it to your email address by attachment or download to the "cloud").
If you are traveling with a laptop or tablet, store a copy in their memory or on disk (available without the Internet).
Also provide copies of policies/contracts to satellites and relatives or friends who are at home and ready to help.
The elk themselves are not aggressive, but they will defend if they feel threatened.
If people don’t treat elk as a potential danger, they may get too close and put themselves at risk.
Drink alcoholic beverages moderately. Alcohol has a different effect on everyone, and it is very important to know its measure.
Possible long-term exposure to excessive alcohol consumption on health includes liver damage and even blindness and death. Potential danger increases if you use illegally produced alcohol.
Illegal alcoholic beverages can contain various dangerous impurities like methanol, which can cause blindness or death even in small doses.
Glasses can be cheaper in other countries, especially in low-income countries where wages are lower.
Consider checking your vision at home, especially if it is covered by insurance, and take your doctor’s prescription for presentation elsewhere.

Families with young children may need more preparations, but a day in the fresh air is quite possible, even with infants and preschoolers.
There are about 200 organizations in the world that are engaged in running tours. Most of them work on their own.
The successor of World Running Tours, called Run Tours, unites dozens of jogging organizers into a single network of prominent places on four continents.
Since the organization was associated with Barcelona's Barcelona's Barcelona Running Tours and Copenhagen's Copenhagen's Copenhagen, it was quickly joined by Prague's Prague Running Tours and others.
There are many things to consider before and when traveling somewhere.
Be prepared for the fact that during the trip, there will be a lot of things that will not be like at home. Manners, laws, food, traffic, housing, standards, language, etc. will vary to some extent from those adopted where you live.
This is always to be remembered to avoid disappointment or perhaps even disgust for local ways to do some things.
Travel agencies have existed since the 19th century. Usually, a travel agent is a good option for preparing a trip that goes beyond the previous experience of a traveler regarding nature, culture, language or low-income countries.
Although most agencies are willing to accept the most common bookings, many agents specialize in certain types of travel, budget sizes or destinations.
It is better to contact an agent who often book travel similar to yours.
See what travel the intermediary advertises, either on the website or on the window.
If you want to see the world without spending a lot of money because of necessity, lifestyle, or challenge, there are several ways to do so.

Those who are willing to sacrifice comfort, time and planning in order to bring costs closer to zero, pay attention to travel with a minimum budget.
This advice provides that travelers do not steal, violate, do not participate in cases related to the illegal market, do not begging or otherwise exploit other people for their own benefit.
Immigration checkpoint is usually the first stop when landing from an airplane, vessel or other vehicle.
In some international trains, checks occur when the train is already on the road and you must have a valid ID when you board such trains.
In night trains with sleeping cars, the conductor can collect passports so that you do not have to interrupt your sleep.
Registration is an additional requirement for obtaining a visa. In some countries, you must register your presence and address where you have stopped with local authorities.
You may need to fill out a questionnaire with the local police, or visit the migration office.
In many countries where such a law is in place, local hotels will be registered (do not forget to ask).
In other cases, only those who stop outside the living rooms for tourists should be registered. However, this makes the law even more unclear, so find out ahead.
Architecture is related to the design and construction of structures. The architecture of the area itself is often a separate tourist attraction.
Many buildings are very nice from the look, and a view from a high building or a intelligently located window can be beauty for contemplation.
Architecture is significantly intersected with other industries, including urban planning, civil engineering, decorative art, interior design, and landscape design.
Given how remote many of the pueblo are, you will not be able to find a significant nightlife without going to Albuquerque or Santa Fe.

Beware of small cities are not always good places to spend time by visitors from other states. 
On the one hand, there is a significant problem in driving intoxicating in the one hand, and the concentration of drunken drivers is high near the bars of small cities.
Unwanted murals or indiscriminate inscriptions are known as graffiti.
This phenomenon is far from modern, but people somehow associate it with young people who negates objects of social and private property with the help of balloons with paint.
However, at this time there are recognized graffiti artists, graffiti and "legal" walls. graffiti paintings in this context often resemble works of art rather than indiscriminately painted nica.

The pit is either heated with hot stones from the fire, or in some places geothermal heat makes places on the ground naturally hot.
Hangi is often used to prepare a traditional fried dinner.
In several places in Rotorua you will find geothermal hangi, and other hangi can be tried in Christchurch, Wellington, etc.
MetroReilly has two classes of electric trains that run within and around Cape Town: MetroPlus (also known as first class) and Metro (known as third class).
MetroPlus is more convenient and less crowded, but a little more expensive, although tickets are still cheaper than conventional metro tickets in Europe.
Each train has MetroPlus and Metro cars; MetroPlus cars are always at the end of the train closer to Cape Town.

At home, due to the constant influence of local microbes, there is a very high chance that you have already acquired immunity to them.
But in other parts of the world where bacteriological fauna is new to you, you are much more likely to face problems.
In addition, in warm climatic conditions, bacteria both grow faster and live longer outside the body.
Hence the torment of the Life of Delhi, the Curse of Pharaoh, Revenge of Montezuma and many of their friends.
As well as respiratory diseases are more common in cool climates and intestinal diseases in hot climates. In most cases, they are significantly annoying, but are not really dangerous.
If you are traveling to a developing country for the first time — or just in a new part of the world — do not have to underestimate the potential cultural shock.
Many experienced travelers who travel frequently have been exhausted by the novelty of traveling to developing countries where cultural situations to be adapted can often appear.
Especially in the first days, you should think about spending on Western style and quality hotels, food and services that will help you to acclimatize.
Do not sleep on a mattress or on the felt on the ground in areas of which you do not know.
If you are going to get away, take a clam or hammock with you to stay as far away from snakes, scorpions and the likes as possible.

Antarctica is the coldest place on Earth surrounding the South Pole.
Travel travel is expensive, requiring good physical shape, can only take place in the summer from November to February and are mostly limited to the peninsula, islands and the Ross Sea.
A couple of thousands of staff live here in the summer at about four dozen bases mostly in those areas; few remain wintering.
Inner Antarctica is a deserted plateau that is covered with 2-3 km of ice.
From time to time, special air tours go deep into the country for mountaineering or in order to reach the pole where there is a large base.
The South Pole Travers (or Highway) is a 1600-kilometer route from Macmurdo station by Ross Sea to the pole.
It is tamped snow, the cracks in which were covered and marked with flags. You can only drive on specialized tractors, pulling sleds with fuel and stocks.
They are not too turning, so to get to the plateau, the route makes a long hook around the Transarctic Mountains.
The most common cause of winter accidents are slippery roads, sidewalks (walking tracks) and especially steps.
At least you need shoes with a suitable sole. Summer shoes usually slide on ice and snow, even some winter boots are imperfect.
The pattern should be deep enough, at least 5 mm (1/5 inches), and the material is mild enough at cold temperatures.
Some shoes have spikes and there is additional equipment with spikes for a slippery surface that is suitable for most shoes and shoes, for heels or heels and soles.
The sole should be low and wide. Sand, gravel or salt (calcium chloride) are often scattered by roads or paths to increase friction.
Laves are not an anomaly; steep slopes can only hold a certain amount of snow, and its excess will descend with an avalanche.
The problem is that the snow is sticky, so it should be given a certain initial pulse so that it goes down, and the east of a certain amount of snow can be a trigger for the rest of the snow mass.
Sometimes this is caused by heating snow under the sun, sometimes by falling out more snow, sometimes other natural phenomena, and often a cause is a person.
Tornado is an air pillar with very low pressure, which, rotating, sucks the surrounding air inside and up. 
They create strong winds (often 100-200 miles per hour) and can lift heavy objects into the air by moving them while driving tornadoes.
They begin in the form of vortices descending from storm clouds and turn into a "tornado" when they reach the ground.
Personal VPN providers (virtual private networks) are a great way to bypass both political censorship and commercial IP geofiltration.
It is better than web proxy for several reasons: they forward all Internet traffic, not just http.
They usually offer higher capacity and better quality services. They are encrypted, so it’s harder to monitor.
Information companies usually lie about the goal, claiming it is "to prevent piracy."
In fact, regional codes do not affect illegal copying; an exact bit copy of the disk, like the original, will be perfectly played on any device.

Text translator programs are applications that are able to automatically translate whole fragments of text from one language to another.
Some apps in this category may even translate texts into foreign languages in signs or other objects in the real world when a user directs a smartphone to these objects.
Machine translation has improved significantly, and now often offers more or less correct translations (and less often - tarabars), but you need to be vigilant, because everything may be wrong.

No aviation alliance covers all three ocean crossings in the Southern Hemisphere (and SkyTim does not cover any intersections).
However, Star Alliance covers everything except the southeastern Pacific Ocean from Santiago de Chile to Tahiti, which is a flight of LATAM Oneworld.
This flight is not the only option if you want to jump through the South Pacific and the west coast of South America. (see. below)

In particular, the numbering system in French-speaking Belgium and Switzerland has certain small features that differ from French, which is spoken in France, and the pronunciation of some words is also somewhat different.
However, all French-speaking Belgians and Swiss would have taught standard French at school to be able to understand you even if you used a standard French numbering system. 
In many parts of the world, hand-moving is a friendly gesture, meaning "hello".
However, in Malaysia, at least among Malays living in rural areas, this means "go" similar to the body-flinped gesture of the gesture used in some Western countries and should only be used for this purpose.

In Rugalan and Ander, they are usually called "gei", that is, devoid of trees swampy area, often covered with heath.
Glaciers do not stand still, but slide from the mountain. This movement causes faults and ice cracks that can not be seen due to snow bridges.
The walls and roofs of ice caves can collapse and the cracks close. 
Huge brills on the edges of glaciers break down, fall down or may jump or roll further off the edge.
