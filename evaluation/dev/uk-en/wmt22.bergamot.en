Zelensky: Mariupol is the heart of war, will stop beating - we will have weak positions
President Volodymyr Zelensky believes that the fighting for the east of Ukraine and, in particular, for Mariupol, will determine the course of the war - and if the APU is defeated there, the Russians can leave negotiations and re-occupied territories.
Mariupol is, you know, the heart of this war today.
It is fought, we are strong.
If it stops fighting, we will have weaker positions.
They (the city's defenders) People who have pulled a lot of enemies.
The stronger our position in Mariupol, the stronger our position will be in the east of the state, in the (district) of the JFO, and if they are stronger, then the negotiating table will be closer for us and we will have advantages in dialogue with the Russian Federation.
If we have a weak situation in all these directions, we may not wait to meet.
Because then Russia will take all these steps that could lead to a return even to the cities that we have now de-occupied.
They can go for it too.
Then our situation in the negotiations will be weaker and, perhaps, not even interesting for the Russian side.
Unfortunately, we will state.
We believe in our outcome, in our victory.
Zelensky also said that it is difficult to go to negotiations after the torture of Ukrainians, but “we should not lose the opportunity for a diplomatic solution if they are with us.”
People will accept peace anyway because people want this war to end.
On our terms, the conditions of Ukraine’s independence, but... every family has lost something and I don’t think they will be satisfied with any peace on any conditions.
But if we don’t speak emotionally, war must end in peace, or end in millions of victims.
And even where there are a million victims, everything comes to the end of the war.
Yes, we have to fight, but for life.
You can't fight for dust when there's nothing anymore, there's no people."

Due to the change in the esthesis of Ukrainian literature, new concepts have become needed to describe its new qualitative state.
It is the analysis of the metaphorical space of Ukrainian literature, the study of the state

We promised that when you went to school, we'll surprise you.
It was great, I have money for two months of rent, in Olomowka area doesn't matter, I'll be very grateful.
Most of my acquaintances are deeply shocked by the news of the brutal abuse of civilians north of Kiev.
Photos of tortured and shot people confused the entire civilized world.
Dozens of people are asking each other how this could have happened in the 21st century? How?!
Nothing surprised me at all. It's exactly what I'm sad and waiting for...
I took the children and elderly parents out of Kiev on the second day of the war.
Then the girls-colleagues with children, and only then returned to the capital to work.
Since 2014, I have consistently helped the APU and I have not doubted that in the event of occupation, the suburbs of Kiev my family is not spared.
For I was and remain absolutely sure that the essence of the rotten communist-KDBist regime remained unchanged since 1918.
Without terror, it simply cannot exist, it is built on terror.
In 1937, one of my great-grandfathers was shot in prison in Zhytomyr.
A few years ago, in Zhytomyr SBU, a copy of the great-grandfather was removed from the shooting case: the whole thing is more than a hundred pages, and the sentence for execution is very simple and even more terrible.
The accused was illiterate, and denied guilt.
An ethnic Pole, a Catholic, had five children, was of free people, a poor "one-two-way" noble, never walked in serfs.
The fact that they lived on the hamlets and had several cows was enough to condemn the pakara and the feeder of young children to death.
The family did not even know the burial place.
My grandmother said that almost a hundred people were taken from the village and killed all but two who agreed to give false testimony.
In the criminal case there is the name of the knocker Shariy.
Our former speaker comes from a nearby village.
I believe in genetics and I will not be surprised if his relative was a KGBist informant.
Apple from apple tree nearby, as you know, falls...
The shooting three who doomed to the execution of the peasants were ethnic Russians.
Analyzing the case of the great-grandfather, he became interested in various information resources.
There are excellent (no sarcasm) information resources like the "Besmortal Barak", which qualitatively remind you of the events of those years.
In modern Russia, the descendants of NKVD found ways to punish and exterminate almost all who seriously investigated the crimes of their ancestors 70-80 years ago.
People who found mass graves of victims of Stalinist repressions and publicly wrote the names of the killers, the system first discredited and then destroyed.
It seems that they found files with children's pornography on the computer, for her they were put in prison, and there quickly died.
KGBists are now killing those who are trying to find out the truth about the crimes of the last century.
So why are you suddenly surprised by their actions now?
There are the most vile features of human nature.
On top of a thousand-year Ordinian tradition, slavery and imperial chauvinism of the 16th-19th centuries were imposed.
And then over what happened, did a beast genetic experiment by cutting the intelligentsia out during several waves of red terror.
Watch the 1992 film Chekist, so it was.
You saw my photos in a swimsuit
Can you ask my wife what I can buy from cough?

According to “European truth”, Welt writes this with reference to sources in government circles of Ukraine.
According to the publication, the relevant proposal was sent to the German Ministry of Economy on Saturday.
The cost of 100 howitzers, including the training kit and spare parts, is 1.7 billion euros.
As well as offered howitzers in the version on the Boxer APC for 1.2 billion euros.
While tanks in combat have to be picked up relatively close to enemy targets, Panzerhaubitze 2000 can fire at a distance of more than 30 kilometers.
As reported by Ukrainian government circles, citing KMW’s offer, the supply of self-propelled howitzers will be held according to a circular scheme.
The Bundeswehr will provide Kiev with 100 of its howitzers, and the gaps formed will then be filled with industry in the second stage.
The first new howitzers can be delivered 30 months after signing the contract, that is, earlier than the second half of 2024.
Full supply will not be completed by 2027.
Is it the first half of the day or in the afternoon together?

So you're leaving town for a long time?
Half a year ago, at the Babyn Yar Holocaust Memorial Center in Kiev, we honored 80 years of mass shooting by Ukrainian Jews in Babin Yar by German soldiers.
I had the honor to speak after three heads of state, including the President of Germany.
He spoke of the “common foundation of international law and human dignity, the freedom of people to choose their path and life in territorial integrity, peaceful and safe Europe.
We must protect this foundation, and it is also part of our responsibility related to our history.”
If “the evil demons of the past appear in new clothes today,” he said, “then for us Germans, there may be only one answer for it: never more!
The fight must continue.”
Today, Russia has attacked a peaceful country, bombing and kills thousands of civilians, starving residents of the cities blocked by it and lets them die from diseases.
Russian troops carry out mass shootings of Ukrainians, even visually it resembles shootings in Babi Yar.
For more than a month, Germans have seen this in real time.
Germany is imposing sanctions, providing humanitarian aid, and weapons that were not so long ago impossible to imagine.
Germany is delaying the delivery of heavy weapons needed by Ukraine.
But "Never again!" It doesn’t just mean to oppose swastika.
This means fighting by all possible means against mass killings, genocide, war crimes and atrocities.
There is no easy way without risks and victims to defeat evil and stop the atrocities taking place in Ukraine.

Serhiy Sidorenko: Our NATO membership has ceased to be a distant prospect
9 years ago, Ukrainian sociology showed that 67% of Ukrainians were against joining NATO and only 18% of respondents spoke in favor.
After the Revolution of Dignity, the escape of Viktor Yanukovych, the annexation of Crimea and the beginning of the war in Donbas, the number of NATO opponents began to fall, and supporters, on the contrary, grow.
After the start of a full-scale war with Russia, Ukrainian sociologists recorded a record level of support for Ukraine’s accession among Ukrainian citizens - more than 75%.
Despite support for Ukraine’s accession to NATO and the assistance that NATO is making in the war, there is now much criticism at the expense of the Alliance and member states - for late arms supplies, refusal to close the sky, and the reluctance to “irrit” Russia.
In addition, there is a great risk that Ukraine will be forced to abandon the desire to join the Alliance because of the position of the Russian Federation if it can stop the war, and Ukraine will receive reliable security guarantees, including the military.
In a new episode of the podcast “Clied Questions” along with the editor of European Truth, we are talking about how the Alliance has helped Ukraine since the Russian invasion, for which NATO should be criticized, and for which the Alliance is criticized in vain, why our prospect of NATO membership is closer than ever in history and why the security guarantees discussed at negotiations with Russia can become the second-time.

The Russian army threatens to strike missile strikes on Kiev: they say “before they did not do this”
Konashenkov: “We see attempts at sabotage and the task of strikes by Ukrainian troops on facilities in the territory of the Russian Federation.
If such cases continue, the Russian armed forces will strike decision-making centers, including in Kiev, from which the Russian army had previously maintained.
The Russians have launched missile strikes on Kiev since the first days of the full-scale invasion of the Russian occupation troops into Ukraine.
On February 25, the remains of Russian missiles that were shot down by the Ukrainian air defense system fell on an apartment building in the capital’s Poznyaki.
On February 26, a Russian missile hit a high-rise building on Valeriy Lobanovsky Avenue.
On March 1, the Russians hit the TV tower on Dorogozhychy near Babi Yar, resulting in the death of 5 passers-by.
On March 2, Ukrainian air defense systems shot down Russian missiles flying in the directions of the Ministry of Defense building.
On March 14, the wreckage of the downed missile of the invaders crushed the house and trolleybus on Kurenivka in Kiev
On March 18, a Russian missile hit a residential area on Vinogradar, from which one person was killed, and 19 more people were injured, including four children.
On March 21, Russian missiles destroyed the modern Retroville shopping mall on Vinogradar, killing at least 4 people.
Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko once again said on April 13 that residents of the capital who evacuated from the city are still too early to return.
The military explained to local authorities that the Russians can still strike missile strikes on Kiev, and in addition, there are a lot of mines and unexploded ammunition on the outskirts of the capital.
The Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine warned on April 12 that the Russians are planning to win a series of terrorist attacks on Russia to accuse Ukrainians and justify the brutality of the Russian army against the civilian population.
On April 1, an oilbase exploded near Belgorod in Russia, allegedly as a result of an air attack by Ukrainian helicopters.
In early April, the local authorities of Belgoroda said that a “Ukrainian shell” allegedly fell near the city.
Obviously, the elites in Washington and Berlin throw into the cold sweat from the very idea that NATO fighters will shoot down Russian bombers in the sky in Ukraine.
But Zelensky is not so much talking to them as with their voters and societies in general.
With his speeches in parliaments and in front of thousands of crowds in the squares of Europe’s largest cities, the Ukrainian leader is doing something that has been unavailable to any of his predecessors.
Zelensky does not convince European politicians to do everything for Ukraine, he convinces this the European peoples that choose those politicians.
And these speeches, this sophisticated alloy of strength, touching and sometimes despair, gradually achieve their goal.
While Biden is strongly opposed to closing the sky, 70% of his fellow citizens already support this idea.
Although Paris or Brussels is against accelerating Ukraine’s accession, this process is already underway.

The Foreign constituency of Ukraine (ZVO of Ukraine) is an constituency that unites polling stations located outside the territory of Ukraine and consists of voting premises in embassies and consulates of Ukraine and premises at military bases abroad,[the 1nd list of 1] in which Ukrainian peacekeeping contingents (Kosovo and DR Congo) are located.[1] The role of the district election commission is performed by the Central Election Commission.
Only national voting is held in the Foreign constituency: presidential elections and MPs and all-Ukrainian referendums.
Local elections in the ZVO are not held.

The head of the President’s Office Andriy Yermak said that Russia is starting a “fake operation” on weapons that allies are handed over to us.
Yermak: “They understand that they lose war, see their backwardness and seek to ‘break off’ the supply of weapons by any means.
For example, one of the last fakes is the destruction of S-300 air defenses transmitted by Slovakia.
This information has already been refuted by Prime Minister Edward Heger.
What's going to happen next? We know the scenarios of the Russians. I'll name one of them.
They can launch fakes that Ukrainian soldiers are pretending with weapons from the Allies, and it is massively moving into the armament of the Russian army.
I want to warn you these fakes.
Because weapons in the hands of the soldiers of the Armed Forces exclusively send the enemy to that world.

The international community continues to express shock and outrage after evidence that Russian forces have committed atrocities against civilians in Ukraine, and Moscow rejected these reports as a “provocation.”
“Reports of Ukrainian civilians killed, raped and seriously wounded by Russian troops are worth the condemnation,” New Zealand Prime Minister Jasinda Ardern told reporters in Wellington on April 4.
“Russia must respond to the world for what they have done,” she added, noting that its government would discuss additional measures to support Ukraine in its fight against the Russian invasion.
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kiside called the incidents "a violation of international law".
The statements came after reports that hundreds of civilians had been shot and thrown into mass graves or left on the streets in the suburbs of Kiev, in Bucha by Russian troops who left the area after occupation within weeks.
Photos that allegedly depict the bodies of executed civilians with their hands shocked many and led to calls for increased sanctions against Russia and the criminal prosecution of the perpetrators.
French President Emmanuel Macron said on April 4 that there are signs that Russian troops had committed “war crimes” in Bucha.
“What happened in Bucha requires a new round of sanctions and very clear measures,” Macron said, adding that additional sanctions should be aimed at Russian coal and oil exports.
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said Russian troops could go so far as they had committed a "genocide" in Bucha.
“We will do everything to ensure that those who committed these war crimes do not remain unpunished,” Sanchez said in Madrid.
Speaking on state television late April 3, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova rejected the charges as a "provocation".
She said the United States and NATO had “ordered” the image to discredit Russia.
“In this case, I think the fact that these statements were made in the first minutes after the appearance of these materials does not cause any doubt about who “ordered” this story,” Zakharova said.
Earlier, the Russian Defense Ministry also stated without evidence that Buchi’s image was “another setting of the Kiev regime” and that all Russian troops had left the city by March 30.
Moscow asked the UN Security Council to meet on April 4 to discuss what it called a “provocation of Ukrainian radicals” in Bucha.
The Russian Investigative Committee on April 4 issued a statement announcing a “investigation” on charges of spreading “knowingly false information” about the actions of Russian troops in Bucha.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke on April 3, accusing Russian troops of committing a “genocide” in the city and told Kremlin leaders that they should come to Bucha to see what their military had done.
“I want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are being implemented,” Zelensky said in a video address, moving from Ukrainian to Russian.
And there is a common responsibility.
For these murders, for these tortures... For shooting in the back of the head,” he said.
He said Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian military should be held responsible for the actions of troops in Ukraine.
“When we find people with our hands and beheaded, I don’t understand,” he said of the scenes of victims scattered on the streets of Bucha, a city about 35 kilometers northwest of Kiev.
A correspondent of the Ukrainian service Radio Liberty on April 2 saw bodies like civilians on the streets of a small city.
In just one place, the correspondent saw up to 10 bodies on the street.
AP journalists saw the bodies of at least 21 people in different places in Bucha.
The bodies of one group of nine people — all in civilian — were scattered on the ground near a place that local residents said used Russian forces as a base.
The victims seem to have been killed from close distance.
In total, Ukrainian authorities said the bodies of at least 410 civilians were found in the area of Kiev, which was controlled by Russian troops until last week.
Thank you, we bought everything on the list.
“They said, ‘There’s no Kiev.” How the invaders took Ukrainians to Russia and Belarus
The Russian invasion of Ukraine is accompanied by terrible things: rakeeping, rapes, murders, torture.
In this list there is another item, which currently has much less information - the export of the local population to the enemy's territory.
From about mid-March, Russian invaders have “evacuated” Ukrainians from temporarily occupied settlements to their territory and the territory of Belarus, which the self-proclaimed President Lukashenko actually gave under the Russian military training ground.
Ukrainian Pravda found the exported Ukrainians and their relatives to ask how the same “evacuation” is happening and whether there are ways to return to Ukraine after it.
The heroes of this text came to voluntarily-force evacuation outside Ukraine under psychological pressure and from hopelessness.
Fortunately, they are alive and maintain a connection with their relatives.
However, given the statements of the Ukrainian authorities, many citizens were taken to Russia and Belarus under severe coercion.
So in Melitopol, the Russians kidnapped the staff of the second maternity hospital, took children without parents from there, including 12-year-old Miroslava, the daughter of the deceased champion of Ukraine in swimming Joseph Zatsackensky.
The family of Alexander, Marina and their 10-year-old daughter Vali moved to Gostomel a few months before the war.
Alexander was just given a job at Antonov airport, located 2.5 kilometers from the village.
The family settled in the territory of a military town, although it was civilian.
As true plastuns, Denis and Marina collected alarm suitcases in advance, but in the morning of February 24 they did not have time to evacuate.
They didn’t have a car, and they didn’t take anyone.
At about 12 p.m. on February 24, they saw helicopters with the Latin letter V, following which the first shells flew.
One of them hit the nearby house.
The family then went down in the basement and stayed there for three weeks, until March 17, until the Russian military took them to Belarus.
In total, about 40 people hid in their basement.
Not everyone decided to go.
“At 6 pm on February 24, people who spoke not Russian and not in Ukrainian came to the entrance.
They ask, "Who's what?" - I say so. "Go out!".
They searched me, asked who was in the basement, if there were weapons.
All the men were questioned if they were in the army.
The women were told, "We came to protect you at the direction of Ramzan Kadyrov."
It was a Chechen OMON, not even troops, young boys of 25-35 years old.
They said: “We were helped by Ukrainians, Sasha White in the war (commanded the squad of the nationalist movement UNA-UNSO “Viking”, which fought on the side of Chechens in the first Russian-Czech war - UP), now we came to help you.”
On the third day, they asked what we were missing.
We say there was a big problem with it.
They broke the store, took the goods from there under the pretext of "all the Russian pick" and brought us 6 bottles.
There is still a video on the Internet where children thank Kadyrov for food.
So they brought sausages after the shop looting and saying, "We understand that it's wrong, but we really need a video for Ramzan Akhmatovich."
No one wanted to speak, but they made a beautiful cut.
Our child says, “You have 7 days to give our phones,” they laughed.
They were constantly separated from the Russians.
They said how good it was that they came, because they did not want wars, Ukrainians are supported and good at all: “Putin is a bastard, Kadyrov too, but we can’t do anything, because there is our families.”
And mostly they did not fight, but went to rob shops, looted.
The cousin was brought to himself, one was tied to one leg of the Georgian ribbon, and to the other - their white scotch and called it "polflement".
They came to Ukraine not prepared at all.
I don't know how their intelligence worked... When they were beaten on Bucha, so they didn't even take the killed, they asked us, "Do you have artillery?"
Moreover, we had erected troops - Chechens did not know each other, in the first days they asked passwords to identify their own or someone else.
We had them until March 13, after which the Russian OMON came, and after them - Omsky landing.
They supplied 30-40 units of equipment between the houses - ours constantly got into it from the Bayractars.
But these came and told us that the APU was no longer there, but there is Azov, and, according to them, Azov is so 100 in Ukraine.
The narrative “Kyiv has already surrendered” has advanced since the beginning of March.
One day, a Russian — either a landing officer or a FSB representative — came to us and says there will be evacuation.
And we listened to the radio - there was about Bucha, Gostomel, thought, maybe we were given a "green corridor".
From the very beginning, we handed our lists to Chechens, they promised to contact the Ukrainian command.
But we are told: “You are taken to Belarus, and then, perhaps, in Rostov.”
We say we don't want there or there.
To which they said, "So regret your children's psyche!"
How it worked: they drove us into the basement and started shooting from under the house - or the "Grads" or mortars.
And then it came back... the neighboring houses just burned down, some of them collapsed.
There was a direct hit in our house in the third floor.
Later, they agreed to take us only to Belarus, promising to transfer to the border guards and the Red Cross.
Some did not go, saying that it is for traitors of the homeland - they say, "we are shot there, they will sell to the authorities."
We were taken through Chernobyl, on both sides of the road there were burning, broken down equipment, although Belarusians told that the Russians were immediately taken to them.
There are many caponirs, buried equipment and soldiers.
At the Belarusian checkpoint "Komar" we passed improvised control, many were completely without documents, because they burned.
We were placed in the tents of the Red Cross, given tea.
And here we hear the shots! The missile is fired, and you can see the mark - it worked "Iskander" in Kiev.
Although these from the Belarusian Red Cross said, "But no, these are planes flying, turning around at the border."
But we are from aviation, we have an education, we understand what it is.
We were then loaded into the bus and taken to the sanatorium "Chonki" near Gomel.
His leader, Wenger Vasyl Stepanovich, came, says: "O, I'm a hohol, I'm from Chernihiv.
But I remember that Putin with Lukashenka will not be established, until these your visuals will not do.
The crazy people are grating!
And we have Lukashenko so good!
He's gonna say, so it's going to be."
We offered interviews to Belarusian journalists, but no one wanted to.
The administration of the sanatorium told us, "You are already traitors!"
And people from the Red Cross and the UN (at least so called it) spread misinformation that men could not go to Poland.
Many people believed this and were afraid to leave Belarus.
But we decided to leave, although we had a problem with the documents - my daughter did not have a passport.
We had to get it on Monday and the war began on Thursday.
In the Ukrainian consulate, we were not helped, and in Minsk at the station they said that without passports, no one will take anyone on the bus.
I will say that we were very helped by Belarusian volunteers.
We were settled in Minsk and escorts were carried out.
In the sanatorium, they were not held by force.
Our second group, the migration representative said that you can live here for a week and a half, because Belarus is not Europe, there are no payments here.
We found an internal carrier who volunteered to take us to Warsaw.
Traveling near Mozir (about 50 kilometers from the Ukrainian border - UP), we saw ballistic missile launches in Ukraine: the missile first flies out, glows beautifully, and then extinguishes.
People who took a bus in Mozir said that the Russians are constantly shooting from the ranges there.
But I can say that the Belarusians do not want to fight.
Generals are fired from the army.
One woman told us she would break something to her son if he was called.
However, the northern part of Belarus, where Minsk, is not believed at all.
They say, “You are lying, we are a peaceful people.”
They do not perceive that their ranges are used for shelling in Ukraine.
In Poland, friends were waiting for us who took us to Estonia.
We are now registering, deciding what we will do next.
In Estonia, Ukrainian flags are now, for sure, as much as Estonian.
Marina lived in a military town in Gostomel with her brother’s family, his wife and two children, 18 and 22 years old.
On the morning of February 24, she called her nephews and asked them to collect the most necessary things and documents.
They went to the basement of a nearby house tonight.
Marina herself could not return home and in principle will not be able to - there is no house anymore.
No one knew anything about the evacuation.

On April 1, the mayor of Bucha Anatoly Fedoruk reported a joyful message that the Ukrainian military liberated the city from Russian invaders on March 31.
The next day, the invaders were thrown out of the whole Kyiv region.
However, the joy that Ukrainians should feel at this point was overshadowed by horror and hatred, because at the same time it became known that in Bucha alone, the Russians shot at least 280 civilians.
They were killed just on the street, some were tied their hands and shot at the back of the back of the head, some of the killed are minors.
Killed and followed torture found the star of the village of Motyzhyn Olga Sukhenko, her husband Igor and son Alexander, who were kidnapped on March 23.
Olga and Alexander’s bodies were in mass grave, Igor was in the sewer.
On the side of the route 20 km from Kiev found the bodies of several undressed women wrapped in a blanket.
The Russians tried to burn them.

President Volodymyr Zelensky said that certain types of weapons provided by Western partners came too late.
He said this in an interview with the Associated Press, which was published by the Office of the President, writes “European truth”.
“All the equipment they already send, for some types of equipment it is too late.
So what if we talk about Mariupol, when you lose thousands of people, and what now?
I see 100 percent support from the leaders of some countries, that’s true.
And some European leaders have changed their position, but you see the price of these changes,” Zelensky said.
Asked if Ukraine got enough weapons to make a difference in the war, the president replied: “No more, not yet.”
The President also said that if Ukraine were a member of NATO, this war would not have been, or it would have a different look.
“It would have unfolded differently, we would have the shoulder of close neighbors, we could fight together.
But I am sure that there would be no war,” he added.
The Prime Minister of Great Britain promised Ukraine new military assistance, which includes armored vehicles and anti-ship weapons.
I dream that the war is over and go home.

So far, it's been successful.

“I lived with her in an apartment for 33 days.

But when her girlfriend spoke, I gave her a receiver - she listened 4 hours, then sang for 2 hours.
The radio was always at the bed.
Most of her mother-in-law spends most of her time in her room.
He feels bad, it allowed me to be invisible to her.
If I heard the sound of her "walks", hid in my room.
She hid the receiver and the TV.
Then I called everyone who talked to her. That's 6-7 people.

The British, who defended Mariupol in the ranks of the Armed Forces, says that he is ready to surrender to the Russians
The British, who is a soldier of the Marine Brigade of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, which is involved in the defense of Mariupol, told his friends and family that they would lay down their weapons and surrender to the Russian invaders.
Source: Eidin Eislin's Twitter page, a British who has served in the ranks of the APU since 2018, the BBC with reference to Aislin's family and friends members, Atlas News with reference to the words of the friend Aislin, who spoke with him
Aslin: “We received the message from him: “It’s been 48 days, we tried everything possible to protect Mariupol, but we have no choice except to take captive to Russian troops.
We have no food or ammunition left.
Thank you all, I hope the war is over soon.”
Details: Eislin served in the 36th Separate Marine Brigade of the Armed Forces, which participates in the defense operation of Mariupol.
BBC journalists contacted the mother of the soldier En Wood, and she confirmed that by phone her son reported that they were planning to surrender.
Military friend Brennan Phillips also confirmed to reporters that in his last telephone conversation, Icelin had said of their surrender unit plans.
He said the brigade had run out of ammunition and food.
Atlas News journalists contacted his friend, who said that Eislin's unit intends to surrender to Russian units so as not to get without weapons and bullets into the hands of so-called "cadyrs".
Also in social networks distributed audio recording of a telephone conversation, which allegedly Eislin speaks to his friend, who plans to go to Ukraine.
In a conversation, Eislin said they were trying to get out of the city in civilian clothes, but they failed.
Earlier, the British said that on Instagram he was threatened by representatives of the private military company “Wagner”.
Eislin was a social worker in Newark-on-Trent in Nottinghamshire, but in 2015-2017 he went to participate in battles against terrorists of the so-called “Islamic state” in Syria.
In 2018, he officially joined the ranks of the APU and took the oath.
Eislina friends and loved ones called Johnny, and in social networks he is better known by the nickname Cossack Gundi.

When you can bring things
Very interesting tradition, we go this way at Christmas
Last week, the Verkhovna Rada adopted a bill 7176, which is called “On monitoring of potential threats to Ukraine’s national security in the field of economy.”
It is surprising that in fact the only potential threat to Ukraine’s national security in the field of economy was... the place at whom members of the supervisory board of state-owned companies and state banks are held.
The initiators of the bill believe that decision-making by the supervisory board of the state-owned company in conditional Kiev can somehow solve the problems of national security of Ukraine.
We are aware of a large number of new dangers for state-owned companies, but it is not yet known about any company that had the need to physically hold meetings of the supervisory board at the location.
The potential threat from such a law is clear is the great basis for “distingaching” all gains in the difficult reform of state-owned enterprises after the Revolution of Dignity, including independent supervisory boards, and then establish manual management.
That was until 2015.
Why do government companies have supervisory boards and who should join them?
Moreover, if one harmful bill “flys” under patriotic slogans, then others can take off tomorrow - for example, you can demolish the public procurement system through ProZorro or the independence of the NBU.
There are many things to write off for war.
By the way, this initiative appeared before the war and the bill 7176.
On February 22, this norm was included in the comparative table of draft 5397.
And in general, the desire to disperse the supervisory boards in one way or another circulates among some people's chosen ones for a long time.
Not for the sake of criticism as such, but in order to show the possible consequences of the bill, we will analyze the arguments that explained the need for its adoption.
And then we will provide our proposals on how to solve the issue of managing state-owned enterprises during the war.
First Deputy Minister of Economy Denis Kudin explained the need for such an innovation in the risks of loss of the Internet and other means of communication, which will make it impossible to work of supervisory boards.
In other words, the risk is that the supervisory board will not be able to make the necessary decisions, in connection with which the company’s work can be paralyzed.
We agree that there is such a risk, but will it be able to prevent him from moving members of supervisory boards to Ukraine?
Imagine a rather cynical situation when independent members of supervisory boards (which make up the majority of the entire warehouse) will put their personal security above the interests of the company and refuse to come to Ukraine.
In this case, according to the bill, they can be released.
And then, most likely, this will lead to a loss of quorum required by the supervisory board to make any decisions.
Instead, it will not be possible to quickly appoint new independent members of the supervisory board, since the law provides for the need for competitive selection, which lasts an average of 3-4 months.
So the proposed decision by bill 7176 is likely not able to protect from loss by the supervisory board the ability to make decisions, but rather the contrary will lead to this!
People's Deputy, author of the bill Dmitry Natalukha provides other arguments in his support.
In particular, he notes: “many enterprises, in particular the defense industry (OPK), now need relocation” and therefore “it is difficult to imagine that a person can, for example, from Vienna to Zoom to discuss addresses and other sensitive information.”
To begin with, there are almost no state-owned enterprises of defense defense industry in Ukraine, which have supervisory boards.
The Supervisory Board is in Ukroboronprom, which in fact manages almost all state-owned enterprises of the defense industry.
But even in Ukroboronprom, according to the legislation, the Supervisory Board has quite limited powers, and all its members perform duties not free of charge.
All power in Ukroboronrom belongs to the CEO, who by the way will decide on the need to relocate a particular defense industry enterprise that is part of the concern.
In addition, such an argument does not stand criticism also because the bill 7176 does not make any changes to the legislation regulating the activities of state enterprises of the defense industry at all.
Mr. Dmitry also cites arguments on his Facebook page that can be attributed to the category of "emotional".
Such arguments, as a rule, have nothing to do with improving the efficiency of state-owned companies and state-owned banks, but let’s try to understand some of them: “weighted foreign experts at the first word “war”, leave Ukraine in 2021, but at the same time remain members of supervisory boards in state enterprises of Ukraine with a full salary of several hundred thousand hryvnias, while Ukraine itself is really suffering from war.”
First, this is manipulation - most of these members of supervisory boards have never lived in Ukraine and only periodically came here.
Therefore, to say that they “leave Ukraine”, to put it, is unfair.
Secondly, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, both foreign and Ukrainian members of supervisory boards have long been resorting to the practice of holding online meetings.
This tool is long common in world practice, and in completely different fields: business, education, medicine, etc.
Do not forget that membership in the supervisory board is not a full-time work.
As a rule, such people have other employment, and it is the means of electronic communication that helps them in this.
Third, all these statements are read as claims exclusively to foreigners.
I wonder why Mr. Dmitry does not express identical claims against the members of the supervisory boards that are Ukrainians?
They are not at the location of their companies either.
By the way, this is not the first populist attempt of deputies to remove foreigners from supervisory boards, and the war is only a new convenient opportunity.
Congratulations. I am in Ukraine. I am looking for possible options for temporary shelter in the family. I have two kids.

Details: According to the head of the regional wine, at this time it is strictly forbidden to be on the streets of settlements and other public places, to move by transport and on foot.

The Serbian defense budget grew geometrically for several years.
In total, over the past six years, Serbia has invested more than two billion euros in the modernization of the army, updating military equipment and acquiring modern systems, rising to 22nd place in the list of the most powerful military states in the world.
After the full-scale aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, Western countries took quite seriously the prediction of a possible aggravation in the Balkans.
For Ukraine, this means that the diplomatic solution to the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is complicated and globalizing.

Lukashenka’s regime security forces detained three Belarusians 27 and 28 years involved in the destruction of two relay cabinets of the signaling plant under Osipovichi, which provides traffic of railway trains.
Source: "Radio Swaboda", human rights center "Vyasna", head of the criminal police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Gennady Kazakevich, quoted by the state news agency "Belta"
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus reported that on the night of March 30, with the strength support of special forces “SOBR” was detained three residents of Bobruisk, one was wounded.
According to "Extract", when detained, the men resisted actively and tried to escape.
Security forces used weapons.
One of the detainees was injured and is in a medical facility.
Others were provided with medical care on the spot.
The head of the criminal police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus Gennady Kazakevich said that "acts of terrorism on the RB railway will be stopped" by security forces using weapons.
On April 6, it became known that on March 30, police detained another employee of the Belarusian railway, an employee of the Baranovitsky branch of BZD and the administrator of thematic resources of BZD in VKontakte and Odnoklassyuk.
Where he is now and in what state is unknown, reports ?belzhd_live.
At the end of March, at least 40 railwaymen were detained for sabotage in Belarus.
Recall: The formation of BYpol, declared by Lukashenka regime extremist, continues to call on Belarusians to conduct sabotage at railway transport facilities and infrastructure of Belarus within the framework of the Peramoga plan.
Belarusian “rail partisans” are thus trying to resist Russian aggression against Ukraine.
As you know, through Belarus, Russia is throwing to fight, in Ukraine live power and equipment.

The United States prohibits investment in Russia and imposes sanctions against Putin’s daughters
The United States, together with the G7 and the EU, is imposing new sanctions against the daughters of President Putin, the largest banks of the Russian Federation Alfa Bank and Sberbank, and also prohibit all new investments in Russia.
This is stated in a message on the White House website.
Sberbank is Russia’s largest government-owned financial institution, and Alfa-Bank is the largest private bank.
Sanctions will freeze any of their assets that relate to the US financial system and will ban U.S. citizens from doing business with them.
In addition, the United States will impose a complete ban on new investments in Russia.
To this end, US President Joe Biden will sign a new decree that includes a ban on new investments in Russia by US citizens regardless of their location.
“This step is based on the decision made by more than 600 multinational companies to leave Russia.
The private sector’s exit includes manufacturers, energy companies, large retailers, financial institutions, and other service providers such as law and consulting firms,” the White House said in a statement.
The third step of new US sanctions was restrictions against large Russian state-owned enterprises in the critical sphere.
This will prohibit U.S. citizens from operating with these organizations and freeze any of their assets in the jurisdiction of the States.
The Ministry of Finance will be published the next day on Thursday.
And the last part of the package is the complete blocking of assets of adult children Putin, wife and daughter of Foreign Minister Lavrov, as well as members of the Security Council of Russia, including ex-President and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Michal Mishustin.
Sanctions disconnect them from the US financial system and freeze all assets they have in the United States.

Good night, I can't help but share with you. There is a message from Mariupol for her son - alive and in the line.
I advise you to read Joe Dispenza, he scientifically conducts experiments on the influence of external factors and the formation of new neurons of connections
Journalist of the TV channel “1+1” Natalia Nagorna released the morning of April 12 a video that she was handed over to the military of the 36th Marine Brigade from Mariupol.
The military says they have no weapons left to participate in the battles, and the mountain of wounded.
They said, "The calculation goes for hours."
Before that, on April 11, the 36th separate brigade of the Marines, which participates in the defense of Mariupol, published an appeal to Ukrainians in Russian.
The statement said that April 11 could be the last fight for the defenders of Mariupol, and the Ukrainian military command did not contact the fighters for two weeks.
In social networks, they expressed skepticism that the statement was published in Russian.
The commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valeriy Zaluzhny assured that the connection of the command with the defense forces in Mariupol is, and the details of the defense operation should not be the subject of public discussion.
The Russians threatened to block Ukrainian fighters on the territory of the Azovstal plant in Mariupol and use chemical weapons against them.
On the evening of April 11, Russian invaders dropped a poisonous substance of unknown origin on Mariupol.
According to the leader of Azov Andriy Biletsky, the Russian army used chemical weapons over the Azovstal plant, which is held by the soldiers of the Azov regiment.
Thank you, I will adjust to you. That would be very good
The situation is the same as long as we stay here.
2 hours of ride )) walk, mom in shops and back)!
It's not an important matter
She forgot what she would do here.
The squadron of Czech drones from today began flights over Ukraine.
Nearly 50 professional copters will serve to detect, and some of them will serve to directly destroy the enemy invader.
Two Transcarpathian and two Czech brothers “birds” were sent to Ukraine the day before yesterday thanks to the deputy of Mukachevo City Council Volodymyr Labutenko.
Today, their intermountain friends headed by the head of the village council and coordinator https://www.facebook.com/examplehere101/ Vasyl Shchur delivered drones as intended: they were received by special units of Ukrainian troops in different cities where hostilities are currently underway.
In order to use the most effectively and safely, we will now leave their places secret.
Four friends who help the Ukrainian army from the Czech Republic do not plan to stop, say: in the coming days, many more interesting “gifts” will be sent to Ukraine, which will serve to destroy the Russian occupier and preserve the lives of Ukrainian heroes.
I didn't worry, it's okay. I love sweet, but I can without it.
I'm worried we won't have time. Lots of luggage.
I am going back to Ukraine soon, and then working.
Okay. If it's okay, I agree
I'll try myself, but if I get lost, if I can?
The main thing is that they understand each other
We were personally in the lady of old age in the village in Yivov,she saw me and that I was pregnant but said there was no home
Maybe she will be happy and will rise.
I was repaired my phone today.
I think I’m also frozen on the street today.
I drank medication and tea, I feel worse, but not critical.
I am also sorry, but it is better to meet when I am healthy.
When you have time, drop music that you like.
I wonder what you have musical overcoming
Mom and Dad should listen.
You'll find it somewhere near your little brother's stroller.
It was colder and raining here today. Tomorrow is warm.
But it is not a pity for the destroyed houses, the harm of people who are being abused by the occupiers
In Kherson, the invaders were angry with the memorial "Glory to Ukraine" in Kherson on Perekopska Street.
Details: It is noted that unknown persons tore the flag of the European Union, crushed panels with photos of the Heavenly Hundred and those killed in the Russian-Ukrainian war.
The occupiers broke portraits of the heroes of the Heavenly Hundred and the dead participants of the Russian-Ukrainian war.
They demolished the flag.
Good morning, thank you to the kids for the carol, we have no such custom so we didn't know, gave the kids only chocolate and cookies, maybe something else needed to give
There is someone to talk about in Czech if anything.
Because I live like in a dormitory.
Hello is a little better.
I was in the gums today.
I was sleeping there even today.
We have great progress.
I'm sure to bring dumplings to others together!
I have no power to do them.
Since I push from days and time in which there is work on cleaning apartments after guests, I can say about April a month because I already have an approximate schedule for cleaning apartments.
For May, I can say about April or early May.
I just asked if you were told something about it.
Hello, I'm sorry I haven't written a long time cooking and slept a little
If you haven't yet, could I come today?)
or meet after your arrival)
He is humble, and has been learning a lot lately. I knew he needed it very much in life.
Hi, it went very well.
I was a little shocked to work with people in such a high position.
Today, I had a lesson with a lady who is the director of the department of economics of the region highlands.
She was very happy with my work.
The grin in the gums has done well.
On Monday I have to bring confirmation of employment as well as cash payment for gums.
I've been lazy since Friday.
I don’t do anything just a lot of them and sleep ? (and drink a lot of water ?)
If I go to the doctor tomorrow and went with you if I could
I have to bring another analysis
You don’t have to go again.
A showered tank works very poorly, it washes off well. We need a master. We have to adjust.
That's how everything is enough
Can you send me the correct email address?
I want to send you an invitation to the Czech language course you have signed up for.
And the kids are fed there or should they be brought with them?
Now you can go to you for a moment there is one question.
If you need help, write
If I'm not wrong, then you celebrate Easter today, right?
We didn't want you to raise funds from the beginning so that people don't think we're speculating on it!
But I didn’t have enough two points for online filling:
I'll go to rest. Gain strength and energy. Thanks for today's gift. Nadromorich
What a great idea. I'll watch the video now. It will be good because the whole family will paint.
Karazin University encourages employees and students to carefully check any information, not to trust anonymous sources in messengers and social networks, rumors and gossip.
Focus only on official information.
You can count on me, thank you!
My other brother who stayed in Ukraine also helps the army
I have collected a few works for the portfolio.
After the holidays, the Internet is supposed to be held.
I would like to be your backup designer.
How I'll be credited with the day that I wasn't at work is a pass
Staff construction: Russia is preparing a provocation in Transnistria to blame Ukraine
The Russian army may resort to provocations in the Transnistrian region of Moldova to accuse Ukraine “in aggression against a neighboring state.”
Literally: “It is not excluded to conduct provocative actions by the armed forces of the Russian Federation in the territory of the Pridnestrovian region of the Republic of Moldova in order to accuse Ukraine of aggression against a neighboring state.”
Details: The enemy continues to create an offensive group of troops for actions in the Slobozhansky direction.
In the coming days, the occupiers will try to resume an offensive.
In addition, the enemy continues to train and send personnel, weapons and equipment to participate in hostilities in Ukraine.
Training of weapons and military equipment at the point of permanent deployment of the 60th separate motorized rifle brigade (Monastirishche) of the 5th Combined Arms Army of the Eastern Military District.
It is likely that the above weapons will be moved to the temporarily occupied territory of Donetsk region.
Also, to restore the losses of personnel of the battalion tactical group units from the 36th separate motorized rifle brigade (Borzya, Zabaikal region), 29 combined military army of the Eastern Military District is recruited servicemen from the specified brigade.
The enemy feels a special problem when completing the positions of drivers and driver mechanics.
The departure of the selected personnel from the permanent location is scheduled for the second half of April this year.
It is likely that the enemy, in order to disrupt the supply of goods to combat sites, will continue to strike at transport infrastructure facilities on the territory of Ukraine in order to destroy or disable them.
The designated units of the armed forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to perform tasks to strengthen the protection of the Ukrainian-Belarusian border in the Brest and Gomel regions.
In Slobozhansky direction, individual units from the 6th Combined Arms Army and Coastal troops of the northern fleet continue partial blocking of the city of Kharkov, artillery shelling of certain areas of the city continues.
In the Izyum direction, air reconnaissance of the area is underway in order to identify the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
For this purpose, the enemy uses the Orlan-10 UAV.
By force to two battalion tactical groups, the enemy tried to carry out an offensive in the areas of Dovgenke and Dmytrivka settlements, and did not succeed and withdrew to previously occupied positions.
In Donetsk direction, the enemy continues to focus on taking under control of settlements Popasna, Rubizhne, Nizhny and Novobachmutivka, as well as establishing complete control over the city of Mariupol.
The enemy tried to conduct assault operations in the Golden area, and had no success.
In Mariupol, with the help of artillery and aviation, the invaders continue assault operations in the areas of the Azovstal plant and the seaport.
By the forces of individual units, the enemy carried out artillery shelling of the positions of Ukrainian troops in the areas of settlements of Vysopillya, Trudolyubivka and Mar-yansky.
In the territory of Donetsk and Luhansk regions, defenders of Ukraine during the past day repelled four enemy attacks, destroyed five tanks, eight armored units, six units of automotive equipment and eight enemy artillery systems.
Did you understand your thoughts?
We will try to get it, but I doubt
How can you sleep and I'll keep you.
Don't you mind coming?
Maybe you just don't want to see today, then tell me, I'll understand everything)
Thank you. We didn’t watch TV at home and even more than 1+1. We don't have to adjust :)
I'm here to turn on the TV exclusively to listen to the Czech language
I have a tariff package for a month today :)
Can we do it on the phone today?
Buy fabric for embroidery, canvas, embroidery threads
I know I can prepare material in this area.
I'll ask her. I'm a little ashamed to ask, she gives us so much pies.
I'll meet my father then, be sure to
I read the announcement on Facebook, I guess Google had something in his writing. I think the phone number is enough
Good afternoon, we're the things you brought, but are there things that little things you can bring them on us in 10 minutes?
I thought about work.
If the director is satisfied, then I can start working next week because tomorrow I plan to go to the labor bureau to submit documents (if it comes in, because very large queues) and on Saturday rain :)
Looking for a brigade at the beginning, I really liked chemistry in school, studying Czech to know perfectly, dream of working in Tev
Friends are old and not very, friends I do not know personally, friends in spirit and mind.
Now you have had hard times too.
Over the past month, I have been talking to many of you.
Your life, which has never been easy, turned upside down, as has the life of every Ukrainian.
Many of you are fleeing Russia.
And many of you have admitted that they feel guilty and ashamed because of your country’s actions towards your neighbors.
Because of what they are being exposed to Ukraine on your behalf.
Some of you activists have long been facing, and you have been preparing for a decisive strike.
In early March, I wrote to Alexander Cherkasov, my very ancient friend from the Memorial.
I will tell you a little later, as usual, Sasha answered succinctly. After the search, we walk in ruins.
Others, cultural figures, artists, critics, writers, are impressed by the sudden collapse of your fragile world.
None of you like Putin and his regime of thieves and fascists, most of you hate them.
But let’s be frank: except for very few of you — those who worked in the Memorial, in the New Newspaper, and the Echo of Moscow, in Meduz, Navalny’s organization and in a number of other places — have many of you done at least something to resist this regime?
Except for the rally when they were still happening.
Read also column of the Russian journalist "Wonning, late to remain silent"
And if so, are you sure that your sense of shame and guilt is not just abstraction?
Perhaps they are caused by your long-term indifference to what is happening around, your apathy, and your passive complicability, which now must have fallen on your soul and heart?
That wasn't always the case.
In the 1990s, there was a short period when you owned freedom and democracy to some extent - disorderly even bloody, but real.
1991 was no better than 1917.
Why do you finally have a revolution, you are eventually overwhelmed by such a strong fear of sadness that you are looking for salvation behind the king’s back, if his name Stalin or Putin?
No matter how many people he kills, you still think it's safer near him. Why so?
There were indeed mistakes.
Instead of capturing and publishing KGB archives, as the Germans did from the bar, you took your soul on the monument to Dzerzhinsky — and allowed the KGB to lie to the bottom, re-establish, reshape and seize power over the country.
When you were given a choice between the robbery of the country and the return of the Communists, you did not fight for the possibility of the third option - and humbly accepted the robbery.
In 1998, your economy fell, and this marked the end of mass rallies for great social justice or against the war in Chechnya.
The main concern was survival.
Then came the hon. Young, enterprising, aggressive, he promised to deal with terrorists and raise the economy.
Few of you bought it, but you still voted for it, or preferred not to vote at all.
When he started to align Chechnya with the earth again, most of you closed your eyes to it.
I remember those years well.
I worked in Chechnya at the time, helping the victims of Putin’s “anti-terrorist operation”, and saw the ruins of Grozny, Qatar-Jurta, Itum Kali and other cities with my own eyes.
Sometimes this weekend I went back to Moscow and stood out with you, my friends.
We drank, danced, and sometimes I tried to tell you about the horrors I witnessed: the torture of civilians, about the killed children, about soldiers who sold the bodies of the dead to their families.
You said to me, "Bred, we're tired of your Chechnya." I remember those words very well.
I was outraged, "Friends, this is not my Chechnya, it's your Chechnya.
It's your country, damn it, not mine.
I'm just a stupid foreigner here.
It's your government bombing one of your cities, killing your fellow citizens."
But no, it was all too difficult, too painful, and you didn't want to know anything.
Then came the economic rise in the middle of zero, driven by growing oil prices and Putin’s willingness to look through his fingers that some of the stolen money would remain in middle-class pockets.
Many of you have become good at earning, some have got rich, and even the poorest of you have purchased new housing and found a better job.
Prices are rising, but is it trouble?
Moscow festively shined and bald from chic.
When several oppositionists were killed - Yuri Shchekochikhina, Anna Politkovskaya, Alexander Litvinenko and others, many of you were shocked and expressed horror about what was happening.
But it didn’t go on.
When Putin handed over to President Medvedev after two terms, and took the place of prime minister, you, as I see, barely paid attention to it.
When Russia invaded Georgia after months of Medvedev’s rule, most of you ignored it or were silent.
How many of you have seen in the following years on the mountain slopes of Gudauri, in the foothills of Kazbegi or in the cafes and in Turkish baths in Tbilisi while part of this country was occupied by your army?
I have to admit that we are unlikely to do a lot in the West, if we did anything at all.
A little outrage, a little sanctions; but what was the importance that Russia is blatantly violating international law when such a great temptation for Russian oil, gas and the domestic market?
Living in Russia was good.
After the hard 1990s, it was the most important.
In late 2011, you, my Russian friends, woke up.
When Putin switched places with Medvedev again and took the presidency, as before, many of you decided that it was too much and you massively protested.
Navalny's name became a call, you didn't leave the streets for half a year, and the regime eventually felt with horror that it was losing soil under your feet.
He then hit back.
Alternative actions were first organized, then more repressive laws were adopted, and prisons were filled with people.
Thousands are behind bars.
Some have had huge deadlines.
"What could we do?"
I hear it so often and I hear it so far.
“The state is so strong and we are so weak.”
Well, look at the Ukrainians.
Look at what they did two years ago.
Dispersed by the pro-Russian president, who deceived their European expectations, they once seized Maidan — and never left it again.
They completely built the tent town and prepared for decisive defense.
When the police arrived and tried to destroy it, they began to defend themselves with sticks, fittings and Molotov cocktails.
Police eventually opened fire.
But instead of running away, the protesters went into attack.
Many died, but they won.
Yanukovych became the fugitive, and Ukrainians regained democracy, the right to elect leaders and expel them if they do their job badly.
I didn’t like the Maidan.
That was a bad example.
Therefore, taking advantage of the general confusion, he seized Crimea.
Some of you have been against, but there is little benefit from this.
How many of you were delighted!
As far as I know, 91% of Russian citizens supported the annexation.
From somewhere, a new myth was born, and many of you who despised Putin and his puck suddenly returned 180 degrees and began to adored him.
I find it difficult to find a reason because we stopped communicating immediately.
The rest of those who remained my friends were mostly silent.
“We are not interested in politics,” you said.
And you've been hiding in books, movies, IKEA catalogs and parks, as new after the restoration, which Moscow Mayor started in 2012, with their binbegs, public vifay and hipster cafes.
In fact, Donbas is far away, and Moscow is so beautiful, and it is only getting better.
You barely paid attention to Syria.
There were terrorists, wasn't there?
ISIS or what is there... Even the Moscow editor who released my book about Syria criticized it then in an interview, because I didn’t understand what was happening in Syria.
Well, at least I went there and saw state snipers shoot my children's peers cold-bloodedly on the streets of Homs.
Only your soldiers visited all Russian citizens, who in 2015 began bombing thousands of civilians, gaining experience for the next serious war.
Of course, many of you know the words of Pastor Martin Nimeler:
“First they came for socialists, but I kept silent because I am not a socialist.
Then they came for trade union members, but I kept silent because I am not a member of the trade unions.
Then they came for the Jews, but I was silent because I was not Jewish.
Then they came for me, but there was no one left who could say anything in my defense."
How many of you talked about Chechens, Syrians or Ukrainians?
Some of you did that.
But the vast majority were silent.
Some really speak now - like Dmitry Glukhovsky, Mikhail Shishkin, Mikhail Zigar, Maxim Osipov and others.
Most allow themselves to speak from abroad, some from the middle of the country, like Marina Ovsyannikova, risking getting into a new Gulag or to build a company Navalny.
As for others, you know best in which country you live in.
So I’m sure you understand that when Putin deals with the Ukrainians — or what seems very likely if he doesn’t succeed, he will take you.
For all of you, my friends: for those who are courageous, but mostly alone went to protests and still took place a minor term, but will soon get more serious.
For thousands of you who signed petitions who expressed disagreement in social networks (even if it is only a black square on Instagram) or expressed in private conversations with colleagues at work.
The times when 10 or even 25 years of imprisonment were given just an anecdote, remained in such a distant past — and now they are likely to be waiting for you in the future.
Who will speak for you then? Who's gonna stay?
The example of Ukrainians, even more than in 2014, scares Putin’s regime: they prove that it can be fought.
And that reason, motivation and courage can stop it, no matter how depressing its advantage on paper is.
Given everything, few people in Russia realize this, as well as the fact that the war is going on at all.
But you my friends know what's going on now.
You read foreign news on the Internet, you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine with whom you maintain communication.
And Putin knows what you know.
So be prepared.
You know what everything is going to.
A good life in exchange for your silence came to an end.
Your election is just a hoop, your laws, if not taken into account repressive, are worth nothing more than the paper they are written on, your latest free media is no longer there, your economy is collapsing faster than I write, you no longer have credit cards to buy a ticket abroad, even if any flights are still left.
Now Putin will not be satisfied with your silence, he will require your consent, your humility.
And if you don't give him what he wants, you can try either somehow go or you'll be crushed.
I doubt you see some more option.
And yet there is another one left.
Which will eventually collapse this regime.
And maybe in the conditions that have developed, you will need less than you think.
Think about it.
The spark will not flare up from you: due to the economic collapse coming to Russia, it is likely to burn in the province, in small cities.
When prices rise and wages will not be paid, those people who voted for Putin all these years, because they wanted bread and peace, will go to the streets.
Putin knows this and fears these people much more than he fears intellectuals and middle class of Moscow and St. Petersburg, that is, you, my friends.
But if each city goes to rallies on its own, as it has already happened periodically, it will not be difficult for it to suppress them alone.
Organization and coordination will be needed. The crowd will need to be turned into mass.
You have this wonderful magical tool - the Internet that can limit, but which still works and which can be set up under almost any circumstances.
Navalny's organization was crushed, but other, more informal, more decentralized, can be created.
You are very many, you millions.
Moscow police can handle 30,000 people on the streets of the city, perhaps with a hundred thousand.
If it comes over 300,000, it will be stunned.
You will have to use the army, but will this army fight for Putin when it comes to business?
After all that, what did he force them to do in Ukraine, everything he made them go through?
Of course, the danger will be very great.
Many of you will feel clear fear; those who have children will be afraid for them.
And that's natural, it's normal.
I would be afraid in your place too.
On the example of Syria, and now Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what is happening to those who dare to neglect their master who dare not only demand freedom, but are really trying to gain it.
But even if you do nothing, the lives of many people will still be lost in vain.
Your son will throw a joke in a computer game chat and will be arrested; your daughter will express outrage on the Internet — and will be arrested; your close friend will make a mistake — and die in a raw cell under police dubbs.
That’s what’s been happening for many years — and then only will increase, gaining increasing and larger proportions.
So you have no choice. If you don't do anything, you know how it's gonna end.
Act cold-bloodedly, think strategically and achieve this to become a reality.
We were on Friday at the lesson, we were told we could come on Monday
We will be at home in the evening
What do you see me as a press secretary
How often do you go to an expensive restaurant?
Once a river, I go to dinner at an expensive restaurant.

Working in the prosecutor’s office, I thought I was building a career, I spent a lot of time and effort.
I had a difficult psychological, responsible, mental work in which I was completely disappointed.
It’s a shame for lost time, but it’s a life experience.
I am sociable in my personal life, but I take my fellow love and marriage seriously.
There was one man I had to marry, but he died, heart problems.
I think that to create a family, people must love, respect, trust each other.

Mr. Reihard, sorry I'm bothering you outside working hours.
But I have an important question for you.
I went to the gameroom today in Natalie, and say hello to her.
She had an unpleasant situation.
Because when the children were going home, one mother refused to take the child, because she said that she came to look at things and put them in that room with clothes and Mr. Valerie opened our children's room yesterday until 19:00.
Can that really be?
The working hours of the room are until 16:00.
And eventually it is our responsibility.
But I don't have a long-loading page not opening a very weak Internet.
Good afternoon, we're doing everything well) Kolya works, yesterday filled out the slanks, and I was doing with the elders before the exam at the high school.

The situation regarding the Russian invasion is a briefing of the adviser to the head of the Office of President Alexei Arestovich (10.04.2022)
An adviser to the head of the President’s Office spoke about the heroic act of the senior officer of the docking troops in Mariupol - he was surrounded and wounded, so he blew himself up with the radio station so that it did not get to the enemy.

We live in the Farn-chabry Czech Republic. You need a doctor who is both here in Doln ? Chabry or somewhere near it is possible Brno but not far from the subway so we can get there.
I liked the butterfly exhibition.
Butterflies sat on their children's hands and feet.
