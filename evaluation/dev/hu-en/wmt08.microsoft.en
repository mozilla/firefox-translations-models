European inflation has slipped on food
The accelerating inflation in the eurozone is mainly due to the rapid increase in food prices.
Price increases in November were higher than expected in 13 eurozone countries, with annual inflation of 3.1 percent after 2.6 percent in October, the EU's statistics office in Luxembourg reported.
The official forecast was only 3 percent, Bloomberg reported.
Unlike the American, British and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not cut the base rate, saying that such a cut, combined with rising commodity prices and easing unemployment, would lead to an inflationary spiral.
The ECB wants to keep the inflation rate below, but close to, two percent.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in the trap of twenty-two: it must "talk down" inflation so that it does not have to act on this issue later.
In Germany, inflation in November of 3.3 percent is a twelve-year high; In Spain, it rose to 4.1 from 3.6.
Eurozone inflation has been driven up by soaring food and energy prices.
Wheat futures rose 88 percent and soybean prices hit their highest level since 1973.
Cooking oil and dairy products also had to pay significantly more in 2007.
The world price of crude oil has risen 52 percent this year, and last month a barrel of black gold cost almost $100.
According to the ECB, inflation will jump from 2.1 percent this year to 2.5 percent in 2008, but will fall to 1.9 percent in 2009.
According to analysts, the level of inflation in the 12 months will remain around 3 percent over the next 3-4 months, but the annual average rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, it is expected that the ECB will cut interest rates twice during 2008.
Gallup sees government crisis
After a long period of stagnation, Fidesz's support base grew significantly by early December, making it the largest since 2002, while Gallup had never measured such a low socialist support of 13 percent before.
For certain party voters, the difference – due to the greater determination of opposition voters – would mean more than two-thirds (71 percent) support compared to one-fifth (20 percent) support for the MSZP.
According to the survey, the MDF and the SZDSZ are below the parliamentary threshold: their support among the entire population is two percent.
Among party voters who are sure to vote, supporters of both camps are one percent higher.
Economic sentiment has deteriorated further to its previous low point: 41 percent of those who considered the country's economic situation to be particularly bad, while another 46 percent said the situation was rather bad.
After the more hopeful outlook for spring and summer, families are again more pessimistic about the change in their own financial situation.
For the coming year, the greater half of the population expects further deterioration and only one-tenth of them an improvement.
In December, more than any previous Gallup poll, 71 percent of respondents said the prime minister was doing his job badly rather than well.
Ferenc Gyurcsány is trusted or very trusted by 13 percent, while Viktor Orbán is supported by 38 percent.
54 percent do not trust the prime minister at all, while 27 percent trust the Fidesz chairman.
One of the indicators of the development of the political situation is how much of society believes that dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister can be managed without a change of government.
While after last October's riots, 35 percent preferred the government and the head of government to stay, at present this proportion is only 20 percent, while the relative majority (33 percent) sees the solution only in calling new elections.
It is characteristic of interest in the referendum that 60 percent of respondents answer a question about their intention to participate that they would definitely go, and another 20 percent say that they would probably go.
By comparison, in a "parliamentary election to be held this Sunday," only 55 percent would participate with certainty, and another 15 percent would consider participation likely. The result of the referendum would not be in question on the basis of current intentions.
74 percent of people would say no to tuition fees, 79 percent to visitation fees, and 84 percent to hospital subsistence allowances.
If we look at the same proportions only among those who promise to participate in the referendum for sure, 81, 84 and 89 percent of voters would reject the introduction of tuition fees, visit fees and hospital subsistence allowances, respectively.
The most expensive is Auchan, Tesco has increased by almost a fifth
Hypermarkets in the Budaörs trade triangle maintained last year's average price level increase of 16 percent, except that VAT did not increase this year.
Article by Daily Economy
This year, too, the usual Christmas basket of the Day in the Budaörs retail triangle increased by an average of 16 percent, but in all hypermarkets there was an increase in value of well over a thousand forints.
As prices in supermarkets had already "soared" in December last year, there was no drastic increase in prices compared to the previous high base.
But it is obviously frightening for consumers that what they could get last year for well under nine thousand forints, they cannot now get even for ten thousand.
In the hypermarkets examined, Daily's basket exceeded the psychological limit of ten thousand forints by at least 91 forints.
The highest basket value was HUF 10,573.
(In 2003, the basket cost 6800 HUF.)
The prices of Unicum and live fish remained almost at last year's level, but turkey breast fillets, walnuts and poppy seeds also increased sharply.
The prices of flour and bread followed the data of the Central Statistical Office in stores, although we found a kilogram of bread in Auchan for 139 forints.
The competition did not push the price of the product below HUF 200.
It was also surprising in this store that the price of Coca-Cola in two-liter returnable bottles was under 200 forints, so even with a deposit they only asked for 257 forints for the product.
However, this year Auchan showed itself to be the most expensive in its Daily basket, while Cora was the cheapest.
According to our calculations, compared to last Christmas' prices, Cora increased the prices in its Daily basket by 15 percent, while Tesco and Auchan increased by about 18 percent each.
Comparing last year's most expensive basket value with this year's cheapest basket value, the difference was 12 percent, while last year's cheapest and this year's most expensive were 21 percent.
In forints, the increase was on average 1480.
Last year, the average price increase came to HUF 1206, so that last Christmas the VAT increase had an impact on prices.
It was precisely this process that disrupted trade, apparently stores could not decide how much margin to apply to a given product, as they were unable to calculate what effect the price change would have on consumption.
(If the trading speed of a product is poorly planned by the trader, he can lose a significant profit on the margin adjusted for traffic intensity.)
Due to VAT, last year the price increase of the Daily basket was so extreme that the most expensive one was 1720 forints more than in 2006, while the price difference for the cheapest one was only 844 forints.
This year this extreme did not manifest itself, as the current most expensive was 1630 forints more than last year, and the cheapest one also increased by 1284 forints.
Comparing the two Christmas seasons, there was a catastrophic increase in prices, with daily consumer goods rising by more than 30 percent in hypermarkets in less than 20 months.
(By the way, this does not necessarily confirm the data of the Central Statistical Office: the statistical office measured a price increase of more than 30 percent in 12 months for some basic foodstuffs.
So, for example, in addition to flour, also eggs.)
According to the Daily Basket, this seems almost impossible in the case of the latter, since the price level of the already rather expensive product last year produced a price increase of barely over 10 percent compared to the base, at worst.
Flour suppliers seem to be in a stronger position than egg suppliers, and they have also managed to cheat the drastic price level increase on multinationals.
In the golden triangle of trade, the hypers do not complain, they constantly report a good year.
In our experience, most customers in the three stores we visited are no longer interested in prices.
They buy quantities of everything, they carry durable food on a flatbed.
On Wednesday morning, all three stores had serious queues in front of checkouts because of a sudden increase in visitors.
However, we know that traffic is weaker in rural areas, and several multinationals complain to research companies that revenue is falling short even of their plans, not only in the case of food, but also in the case of durable goods.
In many places, they save on disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand infections have been recorded in hospitals, mainly due to improper use of antibiotics.
Hygienic conditions in hospitals, bed crowding and staff overload are not conducive to stopping infections, according to the chief medical officer of the National Center for Epidemiology.
In many places, they also save on disinfectants.
I was recently diagnosed with MRSA infection in the traumatology department of John's Hospital.
A man admitted after a serious accident was found to have antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
The patient was isolated.
A similar infection occurred at the same site earlier this year.
The injured man in a serious car accident was discharged from hospital but had to return shortly afterwards with an MRSA infection, and an important operation has not been performed since then due to bacteria in his body.
As of December 10 this year, 1,094 hospital infections caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens have been reported to the National Nosocomial Surveillance System, said Karolina Böröcz, head of department at the National Center for Epidemiology.
This means that so many infections caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens have certainly been recorded in hospitals, the rest is unknown.
About two-thirds of infections (683 infections) were caused by MRSA, the methicillin-oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
One third of people carry Staphylococcus aureus (SA) in their noses without causing disease.
Infections caused by SA (e.g. pharyngitis, tonsillitis, skin infections, wound infections) respond well to antibiotics and can be cured well.
However, when antibiotics are used excessively or inappropriately, bacteria that respond well to antibiotics develop into highly antibiotic-resistant bacteria that spread rapidly in inappropriate hospital conditions.
It can cause serious hospital infections, such as wound infections or blood poisoning - sepsis, primarily in case of temporary or permanent malfunction of the immune system in patients with weakened bodies, elderly or low body weight.
According to the medical director of St. John's Hospital, there is nothing special about MRSA infection, such infections are part of the daily practice of hospitals.
The infection should not be confused with the epidemic, but MRSA is not present there, Tibor Nyulasi said, where the presence of the pathogen is not tested.
Resistant to antibiotics
"Such patients are isolated, the nursing staff see the patient in rubber gloves and masks, and we have the appropriate antibiotics to treat them," said Tibor Nyulasi.
Patients admitted to hospital are already tested for MRSA, but infection cannot always be avoided.
Sampling is not fashionable
The vast majority of nosocomial infections caused by MRSA could be prevented, but current hospital conditions and conditions in Hungary are not favourable for preventing the emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant pathogens, says Karolina Böröcz.
Since this infection typically occurs in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should monitor admitted patients and isolate MRSA carriers immediately.
However, microbiological sampling is not in fashion in Hungarian hospitals.
The fact that the National Health Insurance Fund does not finance these tests also plays a role in this.
Most cases come to light when a patient has a detectable MRSA infection, said the chief medical officer of the epidemiology center.
The European Union has strict recommendations for the proper use of antibiotics in human medicine, and there are also domestic guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and pathologies.
Efforts should be made to ensure that antibiotic therapy is targeted, i.e. microbiological tests should be carried out to prevent the development of drug resistance, but hospitals do not always comply with this.
Microbiological sampling is even rarer in outpatient and primary care, Karolina Böröcz said.
Save on disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA is most commonly transmitted from one patient to another through healthcare personnel.
Therefore, hand washing, the use of gloves and masks play a very important role, but there are significant shortcomings in this in hospitals as well.
MRSA is spread by droplet infection and contact, but in domestic hospital settings it is not always possible to isolate an infected patient.
Moreover, wards are often crowded, beds are often very close to each other, even though from an epidemiological point of view patients should be at least 1.5 meters apart.
Unfortunately, Karolina Böröcz noted, it is also possible to experience that hospitals in less favourable financial situation save on disinfectants, there are few nurses and many patients, so there is an even greater chance of infections.
According to Karolina Böröcz, where appropriate precautions are followed, there are demonstrably fewer such infections or the further spread of the pathogen can be stopped.
Government programme against MRSA
Treatment of MRSA infection causes huge costs for health insurers, which is why it is being combated everywhere.
In England, for example, the government has included in its programme the prevention and reduction of MRSA.
The programme appears to be successful, with reported data showing a downward trend in MRSA infections in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) has among its priorities the prevention of the development of multidrug-resistant pathogens (including MRSA) and the prevention of nosocomial infections caused by such agents.
The police captain who caused the fatal accident was not drunk
The official expert opinion on the fatal accident caused by the XXII district police captain has been prepared.
It can be ruled out that the XXII district police captain, who has since resigned from his post, would have been driving drunk or intoxicated, who rammed a pedestrian to death on Tuesday, Attila Morvai, spokesperson of the Metropolitan Prosecutor's Office, informed on Friday after the expert opinion on the matter was prepared.
The expert report confirmed the primary test result, which already established that the former police captain had not consumed alcohol before getting behind the wheel.
The then head of the XXII. district police station hit the 55-year-old man who did not want to cross the road to the other side of the road at the designated pedestrian crossing with his own car while turning on Kossuth Lajos Street in District XXII.
(The latter, i.e. that the pedestrian did not cross the zebra, is not a mitigating circumstance under the rules of the Highway Code, the turning motorist must still give way.)
The pedestrian died after being taken to hospital.
As a result of the incident, the district police chief resigned from his post and asked to be retired, police said, because he was so shaken by the incident.
The case is being investigated by the Budapest Investigative Prosecutor's Office.
Attila Morvai also spoke about the fact that the former police captain cooperated with the investigating prosecutors from the very beginning.
Another €400 million for infrastructure
Three credit line agreements worth a total of €400 million were signed between Finance Minister János Veres and European Investment Bank (EIB) Vice-President Marta Gajecka on Friday in Budapest.
In 2006, the European Development Bank (EIB) approved a EUR 300 million envelope for the Hungarian budget financing of transport and environmental projects financed by the Cohesion Fund, of which EUR 100 million loan agreements have already been concluded by the parties, and the contract just signed concerns the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
The EUR 150 million loan agreement also provides budgetary financing for education-related projects.
The EIB approved a total of €300 million for Hungary for this purpose, with the remaining €150 million to be used later by extending the loan agreement.
In the field of innovation, the parties signed a contract worth EUR 50 million, which is primarily used by the budget for the research and development project of the University of Debrecen.
Metro line 4 was also mentioned at the meeting.
They agreed that when Hungary finalised the details of the financing of the metro with the EU, they would return to whether and how the original treaty should be amended.
According to János Veres, this could happen in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed 113 projects in Hungary with a total of EUR 8.4 billion.
The interest rate on the loans is linked to EURIBOR, with a grace period of 8 years and no availability commission.
Bulgaria is the EU's real estate paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is amazing - the attention of the whole of Europe is focused on the previously little-mentioned Balkan country.
What, where and who buys in the EU's still cheapest but rapidly rising market?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The trendiest real estate destination in Eastern Europe right now is undoubtedly Bulgaria, with cheap ski apartments and beach houses.
Among the mountains the most fashionable are Bansko, Borovets, Pamprovo and Vitosa, while on the coast Albena, the "Gold Beach", the "Sunny Beach", ancient Sozopol and Nessebar, but more and more people are also looking for real estate around Kavarna and Balchik.
According to analysts at Re/Max Bulgaria, sooner or later investors will also be interested in the central part of the country - such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - and more and more people will buy in the vicinity of the extremely cheap Rus.
The capital, Sofia, also offers attractive opportunities, with commercial and office spaces promising the highest return on investment.
Bulgaria is well on its way to becoming one of Europe's most attractive golf paradises, making it a top destination in the other two seasons in addition to the summer and winter seasons.
Forward-thinking investors are therefore already buying big, for example around Bansko.
According to analysts, property buyers in Bulgaria are also seeking to change their lives and lifestyles.
Most customers are English, but they come from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more from Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot investors are also present, and the Black Sea and ski resorts traditionally have many Russian buyers.
Foreign buyers can be divided into three groups, says Georgy Yankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Settlers either buy renovated properties for between €50,000 and €100,000 or dilapidated old houses for €5,000 to €15,000 and then renovate them.
They need good accessibility and communication facilities, they are interested in the proximity of a big city, shops and the local doctor in general.
The second category is that of holiday buyers (Bulgaria was included in the list of the top 10 German holiday destinations in December).
The third group consists of business investors who buy in the hope of medium- or long-term value growth.
The price of real estate in the capital is constantly increasing, as demand is getting stronger.
Bulgaria has the lowest house prices in the European Union, but they have increased by 21% per year over the past five years.
The increase in real estate prices basically exceeds the increase in salaries.
Fodor and the six Hungarian percent
According to Minister of Environment and Water Management Gábor Fodor, the expert meetings will end on Tuesday, and on Wednesday, after the official opening, the discussion of the post-2012 international climate regime will continue with ministers' talks.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world are discussing the Bali Road Map, which provides for efforts beyond the emission reduction period set by the Kyoto Protocol until 2012.
This is currently hotly debated between developing and developed countries.
The United States has also indicated that it does not want to negotiate exact figures at this time, although it is inclined to agree to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25 to 40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990 levels.
The other major question of the conference is whether developed countries undertake, in addition to reducing emissions, to provide both material and technological assistance to countries in need.
An agreement was also reached on aid to developing countries.
The fund, which is provided for in the Kyoto Protocol, will be managed by a 16-member board of directors, expected within the United Nations Global Environment Facility (GEF).
Six percent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Minister of Environment and Water Management Gábor Fodor supports the EU's efforts to maintain its flagship role in global climate protection efforts and to facilitate a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister explained that the EU undertakes to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 compared to 1990 levels, regardless of the success of the conclusion of the "post-2012 agreement", and is ready to undertake reductions of up to 30 percent if other large developed regions of the world and developing countries are also willing to assume commitments commensurate with their responsibilities and capabilities.
Gábor Fodor referred to the fact that in 1997 the countries acceding to the Kyoto Protocol set a total reduction target of 5.2 per cent, within which the EU – then 15 Member States – undertook minus 8 per cent.
Hungary's obligation is a 6 percent greenhouse gas emission reduction compared to the period between 1985-87, which Hungary will meet. - recalls the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
The stakes are high in Bali, as a long-term international climate agreement must be concluded within two years, otherwise its entry into force would surely be delayed until after 2012. In this case, reduction commitments under the Kyoto Protocol would not be immediately followed by another international emission reduction scheme, as the IPCC, the UN Nobel Peace Prize-winning international scientific panel on climate change, has highlighted in its latest report.
This would delay emission reductions and inevitably increase the Earth's average temperature by more than 2 degrees Celcius, which scientists say would have extremely serious and irreversible consequences.
The British army recruits on YouTube
Footage of actions in Iraq and Afghanistan is posted on video sharing by British army units to promote themselves.
The British Air Force (RAF) was the first to get on YouTube, with special forces operating in Afghanistan uploading videos of their actions against the Taliban since March 2006.
These miniature helmet-mounted camera footage is checked at Air Force Operations Command in Kandahar and sent to London, where the home side upload them online.
A political message is inevitable
139 recordings of Air Force soldiers have already been posted online in this form, and their channel has been viewed by more than 75,000 people.
The British Ministry of Defence registered as "defenceheadquarters" in spring 2007 and publishes videos of operations in both Iraq and Afghanistan, while the British Commonwealth Office and the International Peacekeeping Force in Iraq (MNFI) also have their own YouTube channels.
Deployment in Afghanistan
The Air Force originally intended to post the videos for recruitment purposes, and the Department of Defense said it was also a way to educate the public about the true purpose of the military's presence abroad.
Propaganda published in this form costs almost nothing compared to traditional television recruitment advertisements, defence expert Gordon Mackenzie told the BBC, but it inevitably carries some political message, as it justifies military action decided by the government in a specific form.
Americans made a game
Another problem for the military is that, in addition to carefully edited, censored footage, amateur videos are also posted on the platform, which depict, for example, the deaths of soldiers: in the somewhat hypocritical, "official" propaganda films, the officers talk about casualties at most, but do not show the bloody side of the fight.
Several videos from the Iraq and Afghanistan theatres of action have already surfaced online, but the British military has only recently caught on.
Americans recruit in a slightly different way, with America's Army, a free-to-download shooter in which you can take on the role of soldiers in a more or less realistic simulation.
There will be a rampage and a scone Christmas at the ministries
Minister of Labour Mónika Lamperth does not seem sentimental: instead of a Christmas party, she will hold an end-of-year workshop for her colleagues, who will be able to say goodbye to 2007 with scones and coffee.
There are ministries where there will be a party with live music, while others will bring a Christmas spirit to the hearts of officials with raffles and toasts.
Party, Christmas spirit, concerts and buffet - that's how power is fun.
State offices are also preparing for Christmas.
The Ministry of Defence is holding the largest ministry Christmas party this year, but HM is not waiting for ministry employees.
On the Christmas of the Orphans, gifts are given to the children of fallen soldiers, on the Mission Christmas the family members of soldiers currently serving in foreign missions are entertained, and a press reception is also organized.
The ministry allocates 25 million euros to the mood at the end of the year.
The National Development Agency (NDA) and the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport (GKM) are kicking out of harness compared to other ministries.
GKM's party will be held in the House of the Future with a total cost of HUF 4,320,000, and approximately three hundred and fifty guests are expected from the six hundred ministry employees.
The ministry's celebration will stick to the Christmas spirit, but there will also be performers and a raffle.
The NDA's Christmas cost HUF 4,700,000 and was held in the building of the National Council for the Judiciary (OIT) on Wednesday - there were concerts and dinner.
The hall rental cost one million forints, the rest was spent on more than four hundred invitees.
As far as we know, one department of the NDA is also official for another Christmas celebration: this one is organized by a tender management company, the Hungarian Economic Development Centre, with EU money.
For this purpose, the building of the Comedy Theatre was rented.
The information has not been confirmed at MAG Zrt. as we have not been able to reach the person responsible.
No need for a suit
The OIT building hosted not only the NDA, but also the Ministry of Justice and Law Enforcement, which hosted the Luca's Day ball on December 7 instead of Christmas.
He did not ask them for money for the use of OIT halls.
The ball was attended by five hundred people.
The party started with the minister's greeting, and after dinner you could dance to live music.
In response to a question from [origo], they said that evening dress or suit were not mandatory at all.
The ministries of health, labour and local government are set up for a puritan party.
The Ministry of Health organizes shows and celebrations for employees in its own building for HUF 400,000.
However, Minister of Labour Mónika Lamperth is not officially waiting for her colleagues for a Christmas party, but for a year-end workshop.
One hundred and eighty guests are expected, who, the press office said, will receive only coffee and scones, so they will make the party out of HUF 350,000.
Minister of Local Government Gordon Bajnai, on the other hand, will simply toast with his colleagues in the hall of the Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) is hosting a Christmas gathering in its own main hall, which is expected to attract 436 workers.
2500 HUF per guest is allocated for the Christmas party - the amount can fit a buffet reception and a toast.
Since János Veres became the minister, the PM's employees have been celebrating a similar Christmas every year.
However, there will be no party atmosphere, the official feeling will be strengthened not only by the ministerial speech, but also by the afternoon time.
The Ministry of Agriculture will hold a New Year's reception on January 20, and the ministry's Christmas will be cancelled.
The reception will be held in Vajdahunyadvár, in the City Park, and according to the ministry, HUF 1,000 per hundred guests will be allocated.
According to the press office, this will be a very simple standing reception, for which only foreign diplomats accredited to Hungary are official.
These annual receptions begin with a brief ministerial greeting and end with a low-key snack.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture are not holding Christmas parties at all, the relevant press departments told [origo].
The price of the environment ministry's official Christmas could not be stated in the press office.
In any case, more than four hundred people were invited to the party, which will be held in the Museum of Applied Arts.
The forces of the giant strike are accumulating
On Friday, the League of Trade Unions and the National Federation of Workers' Councils will form their strike committees coordinating Monday's indefinite strike.
A protest rally will be held on Saturday and a work stoppage will begin on Monday - the day of the final vote on the health insurance law.
The action will surely cause significant disruption to transport, as rail traffic will almost completely stop, and there will also be a strike at BKV until 1 p.m.
On Friday afternoon, he will present details of Monday's strike organised by the League of Trade Unions in conjunction with the National Confederation of Workers' Councils.
The LIGA-MOSZ strike committee will also be formed, which will coordinate Monday's actions.
A protest rally will be held on Saturday, and from Monday, organizations joining the strike will cease work indefinitely if they cannot reach an agreement with the government.
This means that no date was set - on the day of Parliament's vote on the Health Insurance Act - for the end of the strike that had begun.
If Parliament fails to pass the Health Insurance Act, trade unions will immediately withdraw the call for strikes.
If, on the other hand, the legislation is passed, the strike committees will meet and decide whether to proceed.
Based on Parliament's agenda on Monday, it is also possible that the health insurance law will only be voted on late at night or even at night.
Due to the strike starting on Monday, significant disruptions to transport are expected: work at the railway will cease indefinitely, part of Budapest's public transport and more than half of Volán companies may stop in the morning.
At the same time, there will be half-track road closures in many parts of the country.
Several trade unions and NGOs have joined the call for strikes, and the list of which is constantly updated during League Month.
Some organisations have announced strikes for an indefinite period of time, while others have called for temporary strikes.
Until Thursday afternoon, MÁV and the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (VDSZSZ) could not even agree on sufficient services, even though more and more people travel by rail as the Christmas holidays approach.
According to the announcements so far, BKV will strike from the start of operation until 1 p.m., at Budapest Airport between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m., the LIGA Electricity and Heat Energy Industry Unions will hold a four-hour strike, and the Teachers' Union and the Democratic Trade Union of Teachers have called for a 2 and 2-8 hour work stoppage.
The Hungarian Medical Association is on strike nationwide, at alternate times, and the Democratic Trade Union of Health and Social Sector Workers (EDDSZ), which belongs to the SZEF, is holding a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands made by the League is that the government withdraw the proposal for health insurance reform and submit a new concept for public debate.
The second demand is the gradual introduction of a new pension calculation method due from next year.
The third is to ensure that early retirement is already possible for worthy jobs before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is that the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (VDSZSZ), which belongs to the League Trade Unions, does not accept the offer of the Ministry of Economy and Transport for railway branch lines, expecting another offer.
Political Capital: the Hungarian Guard raised the country's risk
The activities of the Hungarian Guard, founded in August this year with the support of the Jobbik Movement for a Better Hungary, have increased the political risk Hungary and the region in several respects, according to the Risk Analysing Division of Political Capital.
In the company's "risk warning", they wrote that the greatest political risk in connection with the activities of the Hungarian Guard is that "with the aggravation of the ethnic tension already existing between the Roma and non-Roma population in Hungary, violent ethnic clashes may develop even in the short term".
The main reason for this is that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard is presumably aimed at provoking such an act, the research institute added.
As they wrote, all this can be traced back to one of the main omissions of Hungarian political actors: "public figures ceded the public discussion of the Roma issue to representatives of radical and extremist political groups, who could build a political strategy on the Gypsy-Hungarian conflict".
This deepens the problem, makes normal dialogue impossible, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of violent conflicts, they believe.
In addition, according to the research institute, the activities of the Hungarian Guard, as a result of the great domestic and international media attention, "significantly damaged the image of Hungary abroad, especially in terms of faith in the stability and democratic development of the country".
As part of the reorganisation of radical and far-right groups in Hungary, which have gained more and more publicity and momentum since autumn 2006, several organisations calling themselves "national self-defence" associations have been established in Hungary since the summer of 2007.
"The common feature of these groups is that they define themselves as NGOs, while openly proclaiming the preparation of their members, even armed, for defence (disaster management, defence, law enforcement) tasks, moreover, referring to the incompetence of the police, the army, i.e. the state," they added.
They noted that all this is done in accordance with the method which, based on society's anti-political and anti-party attitude, seeks to put various political aspirations in civilian garb.
The emphasis on civility and the form of associations therefore serve not only to avoid the legal pitfalls of court registration in the case of these associations, but also to be a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are also a risk-increasing factor from the point of view of neighbourhood relations.
"In recent months, the Hungarian Guard has been referred to as a potential threat in several neighbouring states, and ultranationalist political actors from certain neighbouring countries want to justify their own anti-Hungarian policy by referring to the formation of the Hungarian Guard.
All this affects the political stability of the region," they added.
According to the research institute, the formation of the Hungarian Guard is not a unique phenomenon in Central and Eastern Europe, so political risks have increased for the region as a whole.
The operation of the Hungarian Guard is similar to, for example, the Bulgarian National Guard, the creation of which was announced in August 2007 by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
The formation of the Bulgarian Guard follows mass Roma riots in a quarter of Sofia (Krasna Polyana).
The BNU took advantage of this to decide to form the Guard, saying that the organization's goal was "national self-defense."
According to them, in the past 17 years there has been "gypsy terror" in Bulgaria, but the state has remained inactive and indifferent.
They added that the initiative had sparked a heated debate among the Bulgarian public.
The increased risk of ethnic clashes is indicated by the fact that some Roma organisations in Bulgaria have announced that they will form their own guards to resist.
As the operation of the Hungarian Guard so far shows similarities with the operation of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be ruled out that Roma in Hungary will react to the threat in a similar way, by organizing their own self-defense, reads the risk warning of Political Capital.
Attila Juhász, research director of Political Capital told Telegram that risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
He said they publish their risk analysis annually, and if they find something that could affect the change in risk, they inform the public, as in this case by issuing a risk warning.
Not everywhere the holiday is red-lettered
In Hungary, the law precisely marks red-letter days, and around the holidays, the rearrangement of working days has already become a common practice, of which there will be fewer next year.
The celebration is not uniform in the EU and America either.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between national and state holidays and public holidays.
Public holidays are mostly associated with church holidays and significant historical events.
We also celebrate the New Year: both the last day of the old year and the first day of the new one are public holidays - the latter if only so that New Year's Eve guests can relax.
By the way, we have a total of eleven red-letter holidays throughout the year.
National holidays are also March 15, commemorating the 1848 revolution, and October 23, the day of remembrance of the 1956 revolution.
On 20 August we celebrate the founding of the state, on 1 May we celebrate work, and on 1 and 2 November we remember our deceased relatives and friends.
In addition, Easter, Pentecost and Christmas are two-day holidays in our country.
Since our state, national or even religious holidays rarely fall on the weekend according to the calendar, it has become common practice to move working days in cases where we would only work for one day before or after the red-letter holiday.
True, the price of extended weekends is that we do not stay away from work or school on the preceding Saturdays.
For many years, the exact time to work the day immediately before or after the holiday has been regulated by the Minister of Labour in a special decree.
The legislation applies to all employers and their employees, civil servants and public service employees.
However, it does not affect service companies and institutions operating without interruption and operating on public holidays due to their purpose.
This year, the work schedule will only change around the end-of-year holidays: from 24 December, life in the country will almost stop, as experience shows that most people "slip" the days between Christmas and New Year's Eve or use their saved holidays for this purpose.
Next year, many of our holidays will fall in the middle or end of the week, so there will be fewer shifts of working days than this year.
First, the calendar changes around Labour Day, so that employees can stay at home for four days straight.
Saturday, April 26 will be a working day so that Friday, May 2 can be a day of rest.
The other relocation is related to the October 23 holiday: you will have to work on Saturday, October 18 instead of the 24th, which falls on Friday.
However, the end of the year may be entirely in the spirit of the holiday next year, as from December 24 almost everywhere there will be a non-stop break, even if New Year's Eve falls on a Wednesday.
Six deterrent little things to annoy your colleagues
E-mails we forget to send, voicemails we never receive, innocent lies we hardly notice anymore: they "color" our everyday life at work.
The question is whether you get used to small inconveniences or take up the gloves and consciously avoid ambiguous situations that cause annoyance to others.
Tips.
"Sorry, I forgot to tell you that you were contacted by the marketing department," says one of your colleagues.
That you missed a meeting because of this?
At best, you'll regret it and reprimand it will make amends, or call the marketing department to tell you that you forgot to get the message across (the less conventional solution).
Most of the time, it's done with an apology.
Before making embarrassing apologies, it's worth thinking about what you can do to make your colleagues uncomfortable, and make a conscious effort to avoid it.
Borrow something that doesn't belong to you?
There's nothing more annoying than reaching for a document, stationery, or phone that's nowhere to be found.
Do you remember that yesterday you put your stapler on the table, but by morning it had a leg?
Or do you discover a lost pen on a colleague's desk?
Do not take anything from your colleagues without asking, because they will rightly be angry with you for riding their property.
Don't put office envelopes or post-it in your pocket, as it can be unpleasant if it runs out prematurely and you need it immediately.
Do you gossip about the private life of colleagues?
There is no good solution on how to stop the rumor that is already spreading.
Who, with whom, did what?
Where and why?
Do not put your information (assumptions) about the private life of your colleagues on everyone's nose!
If one of them shares their innermost secrets with you, don't abuse their trust.
Bury what you hear and don't discuss it with your co-workers in your absence, even if others know about your colleague's things.
Are you reporting unreasonably ill?
When you call into the office and report sick because you feel unwell or feel like you'd rather rest that day, citing a splitting headache; Think about the fact that your work, urgent tasks, work with deadlines must be done for you by someone else.
Don't spot me with your colleagues!
If you know in advance that you won't be in the office the next day, or something might happen that requires you to stay home, let your colleagues and boss know that they don't face your absence the next day.
Banging, giggling, talking on the phone
Have you delved into work, but are rudely dragged out of it by the giggles of colleagues?
Did you unwittingly overhear a phone conversation that would have been better not to have been overheard?
Don't disturb your co-workers by banging, singing, talking loudly (over their heads), pounding your feet, constantly swearing, or loudly discontenting.
All of these can be confusing, even if they don't delve into a project (writing, planning, organizing).
Do you blame others for mistakes?
If you don't have something in time, you forgot to send an important letter or message, don't blame someone else for your forgetfulness!
Don't refer to the chaos or loud colleagues in the office.
Admit when you've made a mistake and someone else has suffered as a result, and eliminate it.
Ask how you can make up for your mistake, make up for it.
Feeling too at home in the office?
Teddy bear trousers and slippers: comfortable to wear at home, but not for the office!
Don't wear comfortable leisure clothes even if your job allows it.
Don't be slammed, honor your colleagues and yourself by going into the office in casual clothes - pretty and elegant if your job requires it!
If you want to meet, you are no longer interesting
Driving the car in the usual morning traffic jam.
A special melody is played from the radio: the sound of a violin, accompanied by electronic effects.
I turn up the volume.
The music changes tempo and the bass arrives alongside the previous sounds, and then a female choir joins in as a real jewel.
Zagar's "Wings of Love" plays on mr2.
For a long time, the Hungarian music scene hardly spoiled us with high-quality electronic pop.
But now it seems like the plug is quite different when you're listening to the new Zagar record.
Yonderboi's appearance, some new and exciting productions emerging from the Hungarian digital underground are slowly changing the overall picture, and despite the fact that guitar-threshing garage rock is fashionable again, Hungarian electropop also proves that there is something new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer started from Pécs and played in Yonderboi's band himself until - perhaps because two bagpipes could not fit in one inn - he set out on his own path.
However, with his project (Zagar) and music, which combines elements of jazz, electronic dance music, pop, he began to break through when he was asked to compose film soundtracks (eg.
Ferenc Török season).
His formations, initially playing in smaller clubs, became known to a wider audience when wan2 magazine ranked their first album of 2002 among the fifty most important Hungarian albums, and Zagar, together with Yonderboi, was proclaimed almost the only Hungarian trendsetters that seemed marketable in the West.
Admittedly, Zagar and his band became "trendy," but no one asked them if they liked to wear the label.
The band responded as they should: they made a new, better record.
The recently released album Cannot Walk Fly Instead may open up new paths for them, although the title itself aims to create continuity with the early years in Pécs.
This was one of Balázs Zságer's old bands there.
With the airy, airy reference, we would be in place, but in addition to the airiness of the music, the influence of the louder guitar, rock and roll, appeared - in accordance with the spirit and trend of the age.
These songs featured singer György Ligeti, who currently works with The Puzzle in England, at the premiere of the album in Millenáris.
The album also produced a real radio hit, mr2 Petőfi, who recently played popular music from morning to night, began to smuggle into the ears the grandiose melodies of Wings of Love recorded with six Hungarian singers ("Underground Divas").
Everything is fine so (?).
The hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new hit song now begs the question: how much layer music is left that you play?
Balázs Zságer: The definition of layer music doesn't mean much to me.
I think there are two types of popular music castes; Not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
So-called alternative, underground music can also be flat, meaningless, and just as made for sale, which makes them commercial.
But a good pop song can also come from sincere motives.
The attitude of the recipient also works in this spirit, regardless of language or national borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of Hungarian and foreign audiences to your music?
B.Zs.: Abroad, especially further west of us, popular music has greater traditions.
Not only teen-twenty-year-olds attend concerts there, but also older people.
They are much more attentive to the changes in popular music around them, because they also consider it part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the audience in your work?
Does it matter who, where, how many people listen to your music?
B.Zs.: Of course, it feels good that more and more people come to our concerts.
But we never made music for market.
For us, music is not born for a purpose, but for some reason.
The role of the audience is more noticeable at concerts, where interaction already works, but this lies only in the elusive changes of the moment.
Still, I've noticed that if you want to satisfy the audience, you're no longer interesting.
hvg.hu: How much do you plan to follow Yonderboi's example?
He works solo and has built his career further west from us.
B.Zs.: We don't really go his way, even though sometimes they try to explain it into our music.
We are more of a team player who trusts each other's musical presence and lets it unfold.
At first, of course, it was inevitable that our work would be compared to Yonderboi's music, as many of us left his band and started down a different path.
hvg.hu: Wings of Love took first place on mr2 Petőfi's chart.
Many people first heard the name Zagar in connection with this number.
Have you consciously opened up with a more popular style to a wider audience?
B.Zs.: We didn't have any plans to write a hit and then sell the record.
This song is about more.
It was intended as the finale of the album, trying to resolve the sound and difficult themes that had been committed on the album up to that point.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why them - what was the guiding principle?
B.Zs.: The idea was to have a gospel-like choir.
It was then that we came up with the idea to assemble this choir from the well-sounding soloists of our own Hungarian music scene.
This is how the six-member choir - Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikő Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - came together, which we later named Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Is this exactly what the girls designed or shaped the song to be?
B.Zs.: The song has existed in instrumental versions for a long time, then when the album material was put together, we thought that we needed something more for this track.
The chord progression attracted him to add a vocal part to it.
Later that night I sang the melody to it, which the girls later learned.
It came almost spontaneously and almost at first.
I remember I was very electrified at the time, but of course I needed the Divas.
With my voice, it wouldn't have worked so powerfully.
hvg.hu: Both on the album and in the concert, the girls seemed to be in the background.
There are no solos (except for Judy Jay's short solo), they have no role of their own, they sing completely together and are no louder than the music, so the music doesn't just accompany their vocals.
They also stood in the back on stage.
Is this intentional?
B.Zs.: The fact that they were standing in the back was purely due to technical problems.
However, it is clear that we did not want to share solo roles.
That's what the song is all about: forgetting your ego a little bit, where you're coming from, where you're going, just letting those wings, those wings of love, lift you up.
I wanted others to feel the euphoric state we felt when the song was written.
hvg.hu: Which one did you have the most work with?
B.Zs.: In the musical creative process, there were really no more difficult pieces than any of them, but rather the mixing.
For example, Dorian Gray's Dilemma, in which I play on a concert piano, or Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where the groove didn't want to work for a long time, and then slowly everything fell into place, like a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite track from the new album?
B.Zs.: This is constantly changing with the concerts and the fact that I have already "let go" of the record.
Now Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
Traitorous broker risked billions due to feelings of inferiority
Disloyal embezzler.
The owner of the Czech Commercial Bank, the French banking giant Sociéte Générale, calls his former employee Jerome Kerviel this way.
He lost almost five billion euros because of Kerviel.
However, it seems that Kerviel, far from being talentless, was more of a big player trying to catch up with his colleagues.
Unlike other banks, he recognized the crisis in the US mortgage market in time.
"He has reduced mental capacity," he told his superiors who alerted police.
However, as reported by France's Le Monde, Kerviel's testimony reveals that he made a profit of €1.6 billion from his business at the end of last year.
Crisis not only in America
"I just wanted to make money for my bank," he claims in his testimony.
In the summer, it was precisely on the American crisis that he managed to earn half a billion euros.
He sensed the opportunity at the beginning of the year.
In February, there were reports that there would be problems with so-called subprime mortgages for low-income customers or customers who had repayment problems in the past.
However, this crisis should not have a negative impact on the entire economy.
Kerviel did not believe in this and put me on a good horse.
Its year-end profit reached €1.6 billion.
"Even when I made the first half billion, I didn't know how to report it," Kerviel admits, adding that he kept nothing to himself.
In his testimony, he admits that he falsified his reports in such a way that it could not be revealed.
He also managed to scam his bosses, even when the Eurex exchange became interested in his dealings.
Risk was reward
Were you afraid that everything would turn out?
I'd rather not.
"I thought that the mere fact that I made $1.6 billion for the bank would reassure them."
Where did he have the willpower to risk so much?
His position was achieved gradually.
After graduating from the University of Lyon, he worked for Société Générale from 2000.
His annual salary was around $51,000.
Two years later, he was already an assistant broker, and became an independent broker in 2005 with a salary of $ 90 thousand per year.
Nevertheless, he knew that he would never earn as much as others.
"In 2005, I knew from my first conversation that I was being looked upon badly.
Because of my education, professional and personal development," Kerviel told investigators.
Soon after his entry came the first great success.
He earned thanks to Allianz shares, as he bet half a billion euros on the fall of these shares during the London bombings.
And this set off an avalanche - he wanted more.
As long as you search, we'll leave you alone
"It's like a snowball," he told police.
But his bosses allegedly knew, or rather suspected, everything.
"While I was making money, they turned a blind eye."
But a blow came earlier this year.
He lost a billion euros in a single day.
One weekend in mid-January, he wanted to cover it up.
When he left for work on Monday, he was no longer working at the bank.
And a few days later, the bank announced that it had lost five billion euros because of it.
And how did they find out?
He became suspicious because of his freedom.
"I've only taken four days off in the past year.
A broker who has no freedom is a broker who doesn't want anyone to see their reports," Kerviel concluded.
Czech Republic has a chance to win 365 billion
Ministers from the Czech government signed a total of nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, of which the Czech Republic could receive €14 billion (approximately 365 billion crowns) in the coming years.
This is roughly half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels between 2007 and 2013.
Around 125 billion crowns from seven operational programmes will go to the regions.
Czech companies will be able to raise around 100 billion crowns from the Enterprise and Innovation programme.
Most of the money, 150 billion crowns, goes to transport.
The Transport Programme is the largest operational programme and represents 22% of the funds available to the Czech Republic.
These funds will increase the State Fund for Transport Infrastructure, which will manage 90.8 billion crowns next year.
The Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme helps entrepreneurs and firms to acquire assets for innovation businesses.
The company should raise funds for the introduction of new technologies, industrial research, but also for the introduction of more efficient organizational methods.
The Czech Republic is one of the least successful countries in obtaining funding from EU funds so far within the framework of the newly admitted countries.
Nicaraguan ex-president approves twenty-year prison sentence
Nicaragua's Court of Appeal on Thursday approved a twenty-year prison sentence for former President Arnold Aleman, who was convicted in 2003 of financial fraud worth $100 million (almost 1.8 billion crowns).
However, he was later released from prison and lived under house arrest in his hacienda near the capital.
Whether the former leader of the Central American country from 1997 to 2002 will be put back behind bars is unclear, according to the AP news agency.
Court of Appeal President Ileana Perez said it would be up to prison officials to decide whether to let Aleman serve his sentence at home or go back to prison.
A court found Aleman four years ago that he regularly transferred government funds to accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
In reality, these fictitious companies and their account numbers belonged to his relatives and closest supporters.
Some of these funds subsequently ended up at a foundation he founded to finance Aleman's 2001 election campaign.
Our budget has been approved
That's right.
The state budget was adopted.
What makes this budget special?
This is the first budget drawn up by this government, adopted by a coalition majority without opposition support.
This was passed last year with the support of the Social Democrats, because Minister Sobotka and the Czech Social Democratic Party could not allow them to accept no.
Unlike the loud debate before the vote about lack of confidence in the government, there was no drama this time.
The House of Representatives passed this generally ignored, though most influential, law.
This is a certain contradiction.
All governance begins and ends at individual headings and items in the budget, whether we like it or not.
The budget is an essential element of politics, but it is hidden behind the struggles of the powers that be of the government and the opposition.
It's more rewarding in the press, which is why it gets a lot more attention in the media.
Politicians' debates are far more interesting to the public than mere numbers.
The state budgets of past Social Democratic governments had three shortcomings that the 2008 budget cannot address simultaneously:
The first of these is the high proportion of the so-called compulsory expenditure law, which means not only pensions but also social benefits, which were approved last year by the silent "coalition" of ČSSD and KSČM before the elections
The second is defficites farming as a consequence of the first deficiency.
The third limit is the deficits of public finances, i.e. the deficits of the budgets of cities and districts.
However, the biggest risk is not the deficit of the state budget.
It is public and relatively controlled.
Time bombs are deficits in the budgets of cities and districts.
Many mayors were able to raise money for investments other than taxes, levies and bank loans, headlessly often issuing bonds that made their town halls disproportionately indebted.
In recent years, these debts have been repaid through mass sales of shares in energy and other distribution networks received from privatisations by the state.
Currently, they no longer have such a source.
If we rely only on official and verifiable facts, we conclude that:
For some years now, our economy, like the rest of the world, has been going through a phase of growth, which the Czech Social Democratic Party continues to boast about.
This was a unique opportunity for his governments to put public funding in order.
Instead, however, the country was increasingly plunged into debt.
The other countries, with two exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, managed much more rationally than the Czech Republic.
This is, above all, a great shame for previous governments.
We belong to the countries least at risk of poverty by global standards.
Therefore, there is no need, for example, for huge social programmes, which, unfortunately, have swelled to gigantic proportions precisely in recent years, completely unnecessarily.
Although this year we managed to eliminate this year's part of the pointless populist spending approved before the elections, even if there is no retirement limit extension and pension reform in the near future, then any politics in this country will effectively come to an end, and whoever governs will be nothing more than bureaucracy.
With a little exaggeration, it can be said that ruling politicians usually turn most of the taxed money into their mechanical distributors of pensions and social benefits.
Therefore, this year's budget cannot be revolutionary, but can only stop the crowding out of normal expenditure by principals.
The planned deficit of EUR 70 billion for 2008 would be completely unnecessary if previous governments had not squandered everything they could in the last decade.
If we do not want the ruling politicians to become mere officials, we must be patient and wish calm in preparing further reform laws for this not-so-powerful coalition government, aware that the state can only give out what it can get from taxes and duties.
Only they will allow a balanced budget to be achieved gradually.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Great Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight together against the crisis in the financial markets.
More than a hundred billion dollars are thus channelled into the financial markets through stock exchanges.
On these exchanges, interest rates are raised at the bank, for which they are ready to borrow money.
For example, the US Federal Reserve puts forty billion dollars on the stock exchange and makes another twenty-four available to the European and Swiss central banks.
For the first time after the attacks of the eleventh of September, national central banks have agreed on a coordinated procedure to prevent or mitigate the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This move should solve the biggest problems facing the economy, namely the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend," Bernard Baumohl of Economic Outlook Group, a consulting firm, wrote in a report.
"Coordinated action by central banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the United States from 65 percent to about fifty percent," Baumohl said in his report.
Banks have already lost sixty billion dollars to unrepaid loans, mainly in the United States.
Analysts expect losses of billions more.
"Central banks may indeed be concerned about what might happen next if they have decided to do so," said Kieran Davies, chief economist at ABN Amro.
It seems that the situation is really bad," he added.
Central banks fear that if banks themselves find it difficult to access loans, they will lend more expensively to their customers.
This would reduce demand and plunge the U.S. economy into recession with possible consequences for global economic growth.
Central banks made this decision after failing to reduce the so-called LIBOR, the London interbank offer rate, which is used to lend money on the interbank market.
This meant that banks were constantly afraid of mutual money lending, even though the central banks of the US, Canada and Great Britain also cut their interest rates a few times during the autumn.
"This will have an effect similar to further interest rate cuts," Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some analysts do not believe that central banks' actions will help avert the crisis because they will not solve the underlying problem: the fall in the US housing market.
Klaus: The incredible debates of ecologists
Global climate change threatens developing countries the most.
President Václav Klaus has once again expressed his opinion on the problem of global warming.
This time he criticised the UN International Conference on Climate Change held in Bali.
His book Blue, not The Green Planet, presented in Vienna, said the debates among ecologists were incredible.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of the conference, which is made up of a strange mix of representatives of governments and NGOs, unacceptable, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric and reality that accompanies it.
"The debate there is absolutely devoid of structure, it's just throwing around words that are a substitute for solving current problems," Klaus said.
During the presentation of his book, the Czech President emphasized that his topic is very important to him, which is why he is so committed to this topic.
He expressed satisfaction that the book would be published in a German translation because, as he said, "I often only encounter caricatures of my opinion".
Now, therefore, interested parties can read his undistorted opinion.
Klaus recalled that although he is not a climatologist, he believes he has sufficient grounds to write such a book.
As an academic capable of monitoring and evaluating professional dissertations, he is experienced in statistics and is also an economist.
He concluded the book by stating that the climate is constantly changing, i.e. its changes are normal, and that not all scientists agree on the warming of the planet, that the consequences of the current changes are not too great and severe, so they do not pose a threat, and that efforts to influence climate development are unnecessary, ineffective and unacceptably costly.
Moreover, as someone with experience in totalitarianism, he finds imposing unproven opinions on others unacceptable, which he perceives as a dangerous restriction on freedom.
In response to questions from those present, he repeatedly explained that "he is not against rational protection of the environment, but against militant enviromentalism, which does not take into account the relationship between costs and benefits ".
Klaus spoke about a similar topic in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600,000 people were unable to exchange their driving licences
Six hundred thousand drivers missed the deadline and could not replace their old driver's license, which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when they can apply for a replacement so that the authorities can issue a new driving licence in time for the end of the year.
However, the ministry is not afraid that after the new year hundreds of thousands of drivers will set off without valid authorization.
According to authorities, the license was not changed primarily by those who no longer even want to drive.
While districts are reporting a sharp drop in interest in license exchanges, metropolitan offices have been flooded with requests for license exchanges, which saw increased interest this week.
The mayor's office receives about 2,000 customers per day.
You have to stand in line for about half an hour.
In Prague, around 140,000 drivers have not yet changed their driving licences.
The issuance of a new driver's license takes twenty days.
However, you can apply for a new driver's license with a shortened deadline of five days.
However, in such a case, the driver will have to pay an extra five hundred crowns.
Drivers who are unable to complete the mandatory licence change by the end of the year and leave with an invalid licence will be threatened with fines from January.
The culprit must pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
However, the police officer may settle the offence by agreement.
In case of administrative offence, the penalty is 2500 crowns.
Based on previous information received from City Hall, even those who do not travel anywhere can be fined.
Allegedly, you can pay up to 30000 crowns.
The ministry has previously called on the authorities to be lenient and impose fines of up to a thousand crowns.
But transport ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka said fines of tens of thousands were not threatening anyone.
According to him, a driver's license is a document where people can decide whether they want it or not.
This is not an ID card that must be valid for everyone.
Those who no longer want to drive should give up their licence.
It is enough to take it or, recommended, forward it by post to the appropriate office.
At the end of the year, driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 are no longer valid.
However, drivers will have to gradually replace other types of driving licences.
Those with documents from 1994 to 2000 can replace it for another three years.
Driving licences issued between 2001 and 2004 will only expire in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, there are about 2.6 million additional documents.
The court reduced the sentences of investigators allied with Berdyc
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, suspected of colluding with David Berdych's criminal network, were sentenced to thirteen and ten years in prison, respectively.
This was decided by the Supreme Court in Prague, which reduced the sentences of one of them by one year and the other by two years.
Investigators from Prague's Organized Crime Subdivision were initially threatened with 14 and 12 years in prison.
Today's decision can no longer be appealed and can only be appealed to the Supreme Court.
Although Berdych is also suspected in the same case, he is awaiting a first instance verdict.
In other proceedings, he has already received a total sentence of more than 16 years.
You can't get more.
In January, the County Court found primarily 19 people guilty of involvement in robbery attacks, of which the Supreme Court heard 16 appeals today.
The majority of defendants dismissed the charges from the start of the investigation on the grounds that they were speculative cases.
According to the Central Bohemian Senate, police officers after reaching an agreement with Berdyc provided criminals with information from police sources, covered up individual robbery attacks and helped the gang avoid criminal prosecution, among other things.
The gang therefore surrendered 30 percent of the robbery to Opava and Koňařík.
The indictment alleges the gang's crimes between 1999 and 2001.
These are primarily robberies whose victims have often suffered serious damage to health, but also abuse of civil servant powers and unauthorised possession of weapons.
Because police found illegally held pistols, steel-core projectiles, laser sights or submachine guns during searches.
The gang is accused of looting tens of millions of crowns through the robberies.
The gang, which numbered less than twenty members, had already been finally found guilty of Berdych's other robberies and many others in these proceedings.
Other members of Berdych's entourage are still testifying in court in other proceedings, some cases have not yet come before the court.
The trial at first instance has so far avoided Tomáš Puta and Maroš Šulei, who are in pre-trial detention in Ireland, where they are awaiting a final decision on their extradition for criminal proceedings in the Czech Republic.
Account for child exchange: 12 million
For the children bartered in the maternity ward, the lawyer for the injured families, Igor Veleba, is demanding from the hospital in Třebíč 12 million crowns in pain fees plus court expenses.
Three million per person for mothers, two million for fathers and one million for children.
The hospital offers up to 200,000 per parent.
The hospital's legal representative, Ondřej Dostál Veleba, fundamentally disagrees with his proposal.
"We reject such a demand because it is too much," Dostál said after today's hearing.
"In order to form an opinion on the counterproposal, we need an expert opinion developed by the opponent.
We determine whether it has usable value at all.
But we maintain our belief that this will be measured in hundreds of thousands for everyone," Dostal stressed.
According to him, the amount should range from 100,000 to 200,000 Kč for the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, the family from Jabloňov wanted one million crowns for every month until they raised their own biological daughter.
Veleba was served by the expert judgement underlying the compensation negotiations, which was developed by Motol University Hospital in Prague.
According to experts in psychology and psychiatry, the parents of the children suffered psychological damage and stress of varying degrees and depths.
The stress situation was better tolerated by men, even if they were met with such reproach that they did not prevent the replacement of the newborn.
Women cope worse with the topicality of the trauma they have experienced and what is happening right now, Veleba concluded.
Veronika and Nikola were exchanged nurses at the maternity ward in Třebíč on 9 December.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola Čermák in Přibyslavice, Veronika Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanova in Jabloňov.
At the end of October, the district manager of Vysočina, Miloš Vystrčil, handed over 100,000 crowns to the families to make up for their expenses caused by the fault of the hospital in Třebíčské, which is managed by the district.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are covered by law with compulsory indemnity insurance.
In case of mistake, they have to reach into the reserve fund, in exceptional cases they can ask for the help of the founder.
So far, courts have granted relatively low compensation to people, calculating amounts based on tables of a few hundred thousand, or in exceptional cases, a few million crowns.
Polivka lost its kingdom in Valašsko
Bolek Polívka lost the lawsuit for the title of Kingdom of Valašsko.
According to the judge of the Ostrava district court, although he first used the name King of Valach, the project was developed by a team around Tomáš Harabiš, who collaborated with the actor, after many years of work.
Polívka did not attend the trial today.
However, according to his legal representative, the case is unlikely to end and the client will appeal.
"The dispute is about Mr. Harabiš and his team preying on the popularity of Bolek Polívka," Polívka's lawyer said after the trial.
According to him, when the words Kingdom of Valachi come to mind, everyone thinks of the actor-comedian.
This opinion is shared by Harabiš.
"We have almost ten years of work behind us.
Finding money and inventing actions," he said.
According to him, the reason for the dispute is money.
"After years, they realized that the project was successful and that they could gain something from it.
They want to live on our work," he added.
Profitable business
According to the court, Polívka first used the title King of Valach in his television program.
He was crowned in 1993 by Radoslav Brzobohatý.
At the time, however, this was not related to the goal of building a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came up with the idea of issuing Valach passports.
The original student pranks action turned into a business and lucrative entrepreneurial activity, on which Harabiš then based the creation of society in the Kingdom of Valašsko.
In 1997, Polívka agreed to include his name and signature on passports and even offered their owners discounts when visiting his farm and theater performances.
Who occupies the throne?
The judge also mentioned today that Harabiš was using the idea itself, which Polívka had made public in the maniss for the sake of his business.
"The popularity of Boleslav Polívka certainly helped the Valachi Kingdom project," she said.
However, he added that the heart of the project was Harabiš and his team, who worked intensively on it.
Cooperation between the now quarrelsome parties continued until 2000, when Harabiš arranged an official coronation for Polívka in Vsetín.
Since then, however, disputes have arisen between Polívka and Harabiš, culminating in the dismissal of "the ever-elected King Boleslav I".
At Harabiš's initiative, Jarmila Šuláková took over the leading role in the kingdom as Queen Mother.
In 2002, Polívka then brought a court action against Harabiš and others, which has now been dismissed.
The battle planned by Harabiš for the throne and half of the princess could bring light to the dispute.
From this struggle should become a new king.
He did not want to reveal the details or date yet.
"We don't want to rush anything.
It should be something like the royal march in Slovacko.
The king should be elected for a fixed term.
Mr. Polívka is also welcome to apply," Harabiš added.
Test of the 207 SW 1.6 VTi Peugeot: vanishing prejudices
Honestly, I've never bought a Peugeot 206.
The driving characteristics are nothing special, the quality of shifting, driving and production can often be described as below average.
But its successor, the Peugeot 207, already present on the market, is significantly better.
And the station wagon called SW goes one step further, so all that's left for me is to think better.
When I tested the classic hatchback of the Peugeot 207, I complained, for example, about the space left for the head in the back seat.
This time, the complaining is over here, because the station wagon's body means that even the two-meter-tall giants no longer suffer in this regard.
Agile in the world
I get through the interior quickly, so as not to repeat myself many times.
It's a relatively well-done design, where my only complaint is for the poor console.
I'd appreciate a bit more designer invention here if the exterior of the car is so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and where are the times when we complained about the short bottom of the seat or armrests.
The side driving has also been significantly improved compared to the 206 model.
As for the space, an increase in body dimensions is also noticeable here.
In the station wagon, after that, the already mentioned little space for the head disappears.
Suitcases in the trunk
The main thing on this vehicle is therefore its luggage compartment.
I have to rate this as very accessible (also thanks to the fold-out rear window) and spacious space.
Empty spaces are equipped with support tires, which are ideal compromises.
They are out of the way, they can be pulled apart and can hold heavier objects in the process.
But let's dwell a little on volume.
Based on the tables, this is 428 l in the basic layout, which is rather an average value compared to the competition.
However, in the Czech Republic it is not the most sought-after vehicle of this class - compared to the Skoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the product of the new generation from Mladá Boleslav, we find that Peugeot lags well behind the noticeably high number of 52 liters.
For a holiday abroad or when putting a stroller, this value is already almost critical.
But if I had to highlight the positives, I should also mention the almost completely straight floor after folding the backrests of the second row or the very low threshold.
120 horsepower in four rows
The car we tested was equipped with a four-cylinder foreign ignition engine with a volume of 1.6 l and a power of 88 kW.
And truth be told, this is what the sixteen hundred that drives the hatchback should look like.
It is quiet, has low power consumption and mainly pulls.
If we compare it to its Škoda counterpart, which often looks like a rag has been stuffed into its exhaust, I can only be happy about that.
Help the price
The price of the car is not cheap.
However, we must remember that we tested a car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The car with a four-cylinder outboard engine still sells for 329,900 Kč.
The car starts from 410,990 Kč, which is already quite a lot.
The equipment of the tested Premium throws the equipment by another 80,000 Kč.
But we also had head airbags, automatic climate control, automatic wiper start, electric remote control of rear windows....
That is, the car with case and tractor costs 531,900 Kč.
That's a lot, but count the additional equipment of the Fabia and you get a very similar result.
So all that remains is to decide on the brand.
The integration of Slovak students in British schools fails
There are an increasing number of Eastern European children in British schools, raising concerns among locals about the further development of local school affairs.
For the time being, the integration of Eastern Europeans faces many obstacles.
British schools have already recorded cases where disputes between immigrants and children of domestic residents have turned violent.
The problems with the integration of children from Eastern Europe are illustrated by an incident in Northern Kent, where disputes between their places and Slovak immigrants are intensifying.
Quarrels and teases between students already characterize the relationships of parents.
The situation escalated to the point that police in Chatham detained a Slovak woman who beat a ten-year-old student with an iron rod.
The culprit defends himself by claiming that the boy insulted him with racist slurs.
The police also had to act after two twelve-year-old girls attacked a Slovak immigrant.
The girls allegedly scolded the man with racist comments and threw stones.
"As we were driving home, a boy climbed onto the bus stop and started spitting on us.
When I told him to stop, he slapped us with apples and pears and then revealed his naked back," the mother of the Slovak students described the latest unpleasant incident to The Times.
There are complaints from both sides.
One local resident described disputes over Eastern European immigrants as a struggle for survival.
The aforementioned cases suggest that the atmosphere between locals and immigrants in British schools is becoming tense.
There are 70,000 registered Slovaks looking for work in Great Britain.
Around 30,000 Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba is the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it is truly an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your vacation, it can be fulfilled if you choose correctly.
The golden and white shores, high waves, or sea, are calm as a fishpond.
Palm trees and all inclusive on the beach with waiters serving pizza, ice cream or heady cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the Caribbean islands, you can find this in a complete and even richer list.
But there's one island where you can find so much more: Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island in the Greater Antilles.
Under the Spaniards, Cuba was a bastion of their American conquests.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place ever seen by a human eye.
Havana became a treasure trove and transshipment site, which were looted by the Spaniards in America and shipped to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The Nacional Hotel was built in the late 20s.
It was built by Lucky Luciano, one of the bosses of the American mafia, since everything that was considered a crime in the USA (primarily Prohibition) was welcomed in Cuba and promoted drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were, for example:
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high-rise buildings were built, cars that became a cult symbol of the 50s of the last century traveled along wide boulevards.
Ernest Hemingway bought an estate in San Francisco de Paula, not far from Havana, and owned his own yacht in Cojímar.
The walls of the Bodeguita del Medio are decorated with the signatures of American showbusiness stars and politicians.
And today?
You can sign the wall of Havana's Bodeguita yourself.
In the bar of the expensive Nacional Hotel, you can enjoy a cocktail of your choice.
And the cult cars of the 50s still drive in Havana to this day, as the once exported zigzags and sons in this salty and humid air have long since rotted.
Although the oldest part of Havana in particular has been significantly degraded, nowhere else in the area are there as many beautiful colonial monuments as there are.
Other places are also getting more beautiful, such as Trinidad.
Given that tourism provides much-needed money, its development has been given the green light.
In the last fifteen years, new hotels have been built not only in Havana, but also in Varader, on the coast of the province of Holguín and on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers yet another unique delicacy in the world, appreciated primarily by train lovers.
From their extensive plantations, sugarcane was transported to the sugar mills by steam and multiple unit trains.
Their engine park has not been renewed for decades, so working machines can be seen there, whose contemporaries can only be seen in museums elsewhere.
Where do we go?
The most well-known places are not avoided by most visitors to Cuba.
So there is no need to write too much about Varader or Havana.
Perhaps, just to remind you that there is a museum on the already mentioned Hemingway estate, and anyone who loves the writer should not miss a visit to this museum.
The Viňales Valley is one of the most picturesque parts of Cuba in the western part of the island.
Lush vegetation grows from lime substrate.
Limestone formations, lime cones and rocks rise steeply from the bottom of the valley, and fertile soil has accumulated in their hollows, thanks to which even the crumbled cliffs are covered with dense vegetation.
The valley is a place where perhaps the best quality Cuban tobacco is grown.
You can see its final form when visiting a cigar factory in Havana.
Some may also find it interesting that the Chilean episode of Major Zeman was filmed there.
Trinidad
It is an ancient city founded shortly after the island colonization of the Spaniards.
Fame and glory were brought by the slave and sugar trade.
The economy was embodied in the beauty and monumentality of the not very large city.
Colonial Spanish architecture, heavily influenced by later French settlers, has changed almost nothing in four centuries.
Trinidad between the Escambray plain and the sea is such a secluded place that even in the 50s of the last century there were no roads connecting this region with the rest of the country.
That isolation helped him remain an outsider.
Nothing was built there, so it was not demolished, everyone was happy to have a roof over their heads.
If you have more than an afternoon to visit Trinidad, it's worth checking out interesting places in the area, such as Playa Ancón Beach or the Valley of the Sugar Factories.
In the evening, it's fitting to go to Casa de la Música, which wakes up after dark, where the music only quiets down until morning.
Baracoa
Located in eastern Cuba, this small town is considered by some to be the most beautiful city.
Surely this opinion is influenced by the journey itself.
Both roads from Guantánamo have to overcome high and indented mountains, passing through nature hardly affected by human activity.
Cuba's eastern headland has been inscribed on UNESCO's World Heritage List due to its pristine nature.
This is where his best chocolate is made, in the church there is a cross of Columbus (in reality it was made a hundred years after Columbus' sailing) and from the hill where the former castle stood and today stands the hotel El Castillo, you can see some table hills, the best known of which is El Yunque.
Coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Meastro plain, the Bay of Pigs and the island of Isla de Pinos, the Tropicana cabaret, the Cuban patron saint Caridad del Cobra, Santeria, the African religion professed by the descendants of former slaves, all this has a lot to write about.
That is, as they rightly say, it is better to see once.
Afghanistan allies are passive, Americans say
Few troops and a lack of necessary equipment are also affecting the course of the U.S. mission in Afghanistan.
Defence Secretary Robert Gates said NATO should draw up concrete plans for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not going as planned, the leaders of countries with units in the south of the country agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland.
In addition to growing opposition from the Taliban movement, the eight participating countries are also discussing further plans and coordination by the Allies.
While the United States, assisted by Defense Secretary Robert Gates, called for greater activity by NATO troops this week, Britain's priority is to strengthen the Afghan government and strengthen development assistance.
"The progress in Afghanistan is palpable, but military power can only be part of the solution.
The other is to enable the public to start developing the economy and security themselves," British Defence Secretary Des Browne told the BBC.
Ninety percent
Afghan rebel activity is at its strongest in five years, according to U.S. government data.
The number of violent incidents increased by 27 percent compared to last year and by 60 percent in the southern province of Helmand.
NATO countries have about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, roughly a quarter of them in the south.
However, according to the United States, the Allies have also reached their limits in the organization and equipment of troops.
Specifically, additional helicopters, soldiers and experts were requested to train Afghan troops.
"We need to think seriously about concrete goals for the future and ways to achieve them," řekl Gates.
In a similar vein, NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop spoke today.
"I'm not happy about what's on the ground and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about ninety percent of the troops and equipment that we need, and that's not enough," De Hoop told Reuters at the end of a three-day conversation with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
There have also been debates among participating countries in recent months about whether all Allies are delivering their maximum in Afghanistan.
Germany, for example, has been criticized for its passivity.
"The Germans have a relatively large presence in Afghanistan.
However, they have been deployed in areas with the least violence and combat standards, so they are not as high as they are against us in the south and east of the country," Gates said.
The British tabloid Sun this week called German soldiers lazy.
"Afghan loafers exposed: The Germans play while our boys fight," the Sun wrote in a photo of German soldiers playing table tennis.
Germany's Bild counterattacked and published a photo of a British team playing rugby in southern Afghanistan.
Public debt to reach one trillion in 2009
For every Czech there is a national debt of 84,000 crowns.
Total debt reached 842.7 billion crowns by the end of September.
The government plans to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
However, by early December, the ministry had reduced this plan by 152.8 billion crowns thanks to improved development of the state budget.
The Czech Republic's public debt reached 842.7 billion crowns at the end of September.
In the nine months of this year, this has risen by 40.2 billion crowns.
However, as of June, it decreased by 13.4 billion crowns.
The Ministry of Finance has today verified its government debt figures from early October.
Each Czech is in debt of more than 84,000 crowns.
Last year, the state was in debt by more than 11 billion crowns.
"For the time being, it seems that thanks to next year's lower deficit, the one trillion crown mark could only be exceeded in 2009.
Next year, debt will be around 900 billion and one trillion crowns," Patria Finance analyst David Marek told iHNed.cz Server.
Next Finance analyst Vladimír Pikora sees it similarly: "In 2009 we will cross one trillion.
Exactly when depends on the next budget, which is still unknown.
If it were proved that the situation in the political field were to change, politicians would be prepared to save more, and this could be delayed until 2010.
But I don't assume that change," he said.
Increasing debts
Government debt is formed by debts of the central government, which is formed primarily by accumulating deficits in the state budget.
Public debt is financed by treasury notes, government loan bonds, direct loans or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
So far this year, the state's internal indebtedness has increased by 38.5 billion crowns to 719.4 billion crowns.
So far, the state's foreign debt has increased by 1.7 billion to 123.3 billion crowns.
The so-called marketable government debt reached 803.3 billion crowns by the end of September and decreased by 13.7 billion crowns from June.
The average maturity of government debt increased to 6.5 years.
"Full-year debt rose 13 percent in the first quarter, which is really quite a lot compared to the progress of the economy.
Interestingly, the increase is mainly generated by loan bonds, where the increase is 20 percent.
It's bad that debt is rising, but on the other hand, it shows that there will be something to trade when pension reform is here," Pikora commented on the data.
Better than expected
The financing strategy and the management of public debt in 2007 reveal that the government planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
However, by early December, the ministry had reduced the plan by 152.8 billion crowns thanks to improved development of the state budget.
The amount is mainly made up of the deficit of the state budget, which is likely to reach 76 billion crowns this year instead of the assumed 91.3 billion crowns.
These also include the planned maximum resources of 13.3 billion crowns for the Czech Consolidation Agency, a reserve of ten billion euros for the payment of pensions, the financing of 43 billion crowns of state loan bonds and the repayment of loans from the European Investment Bank worth 1.8 billion crowns.
The teacher appears today before a court in Khartoum over a name given to a teddy bear
A court in Khartoum sentenced the British teacher in Sudan on Thursday evening to 15 days in prison and expulsion from the country for insulting Islam, her lawyer said.
The British woman was accused of allowing her 6- to 7-year-old students to name a teddy bear Muhammad. However, Islam forbids any depiction of its prophet.
Such an act is punishable by lashing.
The 54-year-old British woman, a teacher at Unity High School in Khartoum, was arrested in her apartment on Sunday. He was charged under Article 125 of Sudan's Penal Code with insulting Islam and sedition after the students' parents filed multiple complaints against him with Sudan's Ministry of Education.
The story began in September when the teacher asked her 6-7-year-old students to choose a name for the class's teddy bear.
"The children suggested a total of eight names: Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed, among them were Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed," says the school's principal, Robert Boulos.
In the end, 20 out of 23 children voted for the first name Mohammed.
Muhammad is, of course, the name of the Islamic prophet, but it is also a very common first name in Sudan.
The children then made a joint diary with a photo of the teddy bear and the inscription "My name is Muhammad."
The teddy bear itself was not labeled with this name. Rather, the problem lies in the fact that any depiction of the Prophet is considered an insult to Islam.
A Muslim colleague of Gillian Gibbons, who teaches at the same school, said she knew him well and that she would never have done anything that offended any religious beliefs. According to him, it was only an "innocent mistake": "I only regret that he made the children vote for the name".
Many of the teacher's students agree with this opinion. According to them, the teacher "treats children very well" and "never talks about religion in class."
Keep in mind that Mohammed is also the second most popular given name in Britain, and there are 14 different spellings in English.
This first name, so often chosen by Muslim families, is a way of showing respect for the Prophet. (This name is often given to the firstborn child of the family.)
But what are the rules for using a first name?
Can a game get this name, for example?
This is obviously a matter of interpretation.
No agreement was reached at Wednesday's final meeting in Vienna on the future status of the province.
The end result is failure.
Without any convergence of positions, the sixth and final talks between Serbs and Kosovo Albanians on the future status of the separatist province ended Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria.
"It is regrettable that the parties have not reached an agreement on status," EU diplomat Wolfgang Ischinger said at a press conference in Vienna.
U.S. Ambassador Frank Wisner stressed that peace in the region was "at stake" and urged Belgrade and Pristina to keep their promises to maintain peace and dialogue after the talks.
"There is no fear of violence in the near future, but there will be a very difficult period," he added, stressing the "existence of obvious tensions."
Broadcast ends on December 10
On Monday, the mediation troika comprising the European Union, the United States of America and Russia will visit Serbia and Kosovo for the last time.
The future of the 90% Albanian province could become clear after Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Bocan-Kharchenko submit their reports to the United Nations Security Council by December 10.
The meeting in Baden, near Vienna, marked the sixth and final meeting of negotiations since the UN mandated another mediation for the troika last August.
Americans and Europeans expect their mediation task to end on December 10.
The Russians, who have already thwarted Kosovo's independence in the Security Council, insist that negotiations continue beyond the deadline.
"Russia has been and remains committed to a negotiated solution, to compromise," Bocan-Kharchenko said.
Unilateral declaration of independence?
After 8 years of Kosovo under UN control, Western powers believe that independence under EU supervision is the only viable solution.
Pristina said it was ready to declare its independence unilaterally if the Security Council did not rule in its favour.
Belgrade would continue to advocate greater autonomy.
"Unfortunately, we have not been able to reach an agreement," Kosovo's independent province president Fatmir Sejdiu announced at a Baden hotel where "last-chance talks" had been ongoing since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo uprising and future prime minister of the province, also expressed regret.
He added, however, that Belgrade's vision of autonomy would be "a continuation of a past that ended in killings and deportations."
"Domino effect"
Serbian President Boris Tadic believed a compromise was still possible and warned Kosovo's Albanian majority about the consequences of unilateral independence.
Belgrade fears a "domino effect" in a region still unstable due to the wars of independence of the nineties.
"For Serbia, this does not exclude the possibility of compromise," Tadic said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation reiterated that the decision should rest solely with the Security Council, where its Russian ally has veto power.
"Kosovo's Parliament will have the last word"
"Only a solution approved by the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia," Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
"The negotiations lasted two years.
They must end where they began: in the Security Council."
Fatmir Sejdiu told reporters that "Kosovo's parliament will have the last word." He added that the unilateral declaration of independence by Albanians is based on "consultation" with Western powers.
Bush calls for a deal between Israel and Palestine
President George Bush announced Tuesday, at the opening of his international peace conference in Annapolis, Maryland, that Israel and Palestine had finally agreed to sign a joint declaration.
According to Bush, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas agreed to immediately begin negotiations to finally settle the 60-year-old dispute between their peoples.
In the presence of the two presidents, Bush pledged to support them in every way possible so that they could sign the "peace treaty" in 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians must dismantle "terrorist networks" and Israel must stop its colonial activities, Bush said, reminding both sides of their obligations under the "peace agenda" agreed in 2003.
The White House chief stressed that the goal of the talks between the Abbas-led Palestinian Authority and Israel is "to sign a peace agreement that resolves all pending issues, including central issues."
The latter concern three sensitive issues at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute: Palestine's future borders, the situation in Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees displaced during the 1948 conflict who lived on the territory of what is now the state of Israel.
Speaking after the US president, Abbas insisted that future negotiations should be "global and profound" and cover all regulatory areas, including "Jerusalem, asylum, borders, colonies, water and security."
Olmert, who then took to the stand, pledged that future negotiations would be "direct and ongoing" and that he would strive to "conclude them in 2008."
Bush set a goal of the end of 2008 to realize the "vision of two states" of Palestine and Israel.
Saudi Arabia said it had received a promise from Bush before deciding to attend the conference.
Saudi Arabia (whose participation in Annapolis was hailed as a success by Washington), with the support of all Arab countries, has initiated a plan to guarantee Israel peace in exchange for withdrawing from all Arab territories captured during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis "represents a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it tackles the problem at its root and focuses on central issues," the Saudi prince said in an interview with the Saudi-owned Arab daily.
According to the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As is usually the case with this kind of news, the official position and rumors contradict each other.
How did the accident happen?
According to initial data from an investigation launched by the National Police's General Control Body (IGPN), a police car was driving along Louise-Michel Street in Villiers-le-Bel a few minutes after 5 p.m. on Sunday.
"The car was on patrol, so it wasn't in action. He was driving at 40-50 km/h without sirens," police sources said.
The two helmetless youngsters drove at "high speed" on a green Kawasaki-branded engine "not registered in official registration and therefore not for use on public roads" (see below).
"Because the right-hand rule was not followed, the engine collided with the left side of the police car," says one police officer.
The vehicle occupants tested negative for alcohol.
The impact was illustrated by the fact that the front of the car was dented, the windscreen cracked like a star and the bumper was torn off.
Pontoise's public prosecutor, Marie-Thérèse de Givry, said in an emergency announcement yesterday morning that she had entrusted the IGPN and the Val-D'Oise County Public Safety Directorate with the investigation, which was opened for "negligent homicide and failure to render assistance."
Earlier in the afternoon, the prosecutor told a press conference that at this stage of the IGPN investigation, police liability could be ruled out.
The prosecutor said three witnesses to the accident interviewed on Sunday evening confirmed "the officers' report that the scooter arrived relatively quickly from the left side of the police car."
Yesterday, a strip that was undoubtedly pulled by footrests on the roadway showed that the two vehicles collided and drove together for a while until the police car managed to brake.
The vehicles were seized for roadworthiness testing.
The bodies of the two victims underwent a forensic examination yesterday.
What happened immediately after?
Yesterday, rumours spread like wildfire in Villiers-le-Bel that police had left the scene quickly without providing assistance to the two youths.
The IGPN is cautious about this, but rules out that the police officers made "any serious mistakes".
"This is the most difficult part of the investigation, which requires an even more thorough investigation and increased caution," a police source said.
Libération met an eyewitness who described a few minutes after the accident.
One of the windows of his apartment faces exactly the scene.
"My cousin, who is a hospital nurse, immediately went down to try to revive them," the witness said.
"There was nothing we could do anymore."
He then noticed "a policeman who was completely confused and limping.
The other two tried to revive one of the youths and the fourth called."
Tension among those present increased as the hopeless situation of the two young people became apparent, so the arriving police officers removed their colleagues from the scene by car.
We also know from the eyewitness that the ambulance arrived "about 20 minutes after the police left."
Heart massage was also used, but to no avail.
"I wouldn't say the police didn't try to help the youth.
Young people did get help.
Firefighters immediately arrived at the scene.
They did everything they could to save them," she said.
Tensions rise in Pakistan
On Monday, Pakistani police blocked the first protests since a state of emergency imposed by General Musharraf two days earlier.
According to eyewitnesses, around two thousand lawyers protesting against the state of emergency measures in the east of the country were wounded by tear gas bombs used by law enforcement forces, according to eyewitnesses.
They responded by throwing stones at police, several of whom were injured.
At least 350 lawyers were produced.
Similar incidents took place in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police attacked lawyers and injured them.
Several individuals were produced.
In Islamabad, Supreme Court registered lawyers have called for a general strike and announced protests over the weekend arrests of some 500 opposition members, human rights fighters and lawyers.
On Monday morning, streets leading to the Supreme Court were closed to prevent the gathering.
There were also several protests in Multan in the central part of the country and Peshawar in the northwest.
Since Monday, the lawyers' movement has also been supported by the huge Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance of religious parties. Its leader "urged the people to send flowers to judges who disagree with the state of emergency and rubbish to those who took the oath before Musharraf."
'Musharraf's promise no longer valid''
Pakistan's Supreme Court is directly affected by the exceptional measure announced on Saturday evening.
The Court is due to rule in the coming days on the legality of President Musharraf's re-election by indirect vote on 6 October.
The President of the Court, Mr Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was removed from office and replaced.
"What we are witnessing is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the decisions of the Supreme Court," he told The News.
President Pervez Musharraf's promise to step down as head of the military to serve as civilian president has "expired" after the state of emergency was imposed, Deputy Information Minister Tariq Azeem announced Monday.
Musharraf had to abandon his military uniform by November 15, the end of his first term as president.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed the news of the postponement of the January elections.
The Pakistani government has also denied rumours circulating across the country that President Musharraf has been given forced residence by his deputy general.
More than a third of pregnancies are unplanned
This result includes unwanted (24%) or inadequately planned or not planned pregnancies at all.
Even today, more than a third (36%) of pregnancies are unplanned, according to a study by France's National Institute of Demography (INED) forty years after the passage of the Neuwirth law liberalizing contraception.
This result includes unwanted (24%) or inadequately planned or not planned pregnancies at all.
Ined estimates that contraceptive methods such as pills and uterine spirals still fail 5-6% of the time.
Nevertheless, according to the institute, liberalization of contraception has made "birth control" more effective. The study notes that in 1970, only 5% of women between the ages of 20 and 44 were taking birth control pills, but today the figure is 60%.
Today, 8 out of 10 pregnancies are planned.
Every fifth plans with an accuracy of a couple of months, and if possible, for spring, since this is the most favorable season for receiving a child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and the crew of the International Space Station (ISS) had to work more than seven hours in space to carry out spectacular repairs to a torn solar panel essential to the station's scientific activities.
This dangerous spacewalk turned out to be a record in several respects: the repair took a very long time, there was very little time to design it, and it had to be carried out far from residential modules, using tools "DIY" by astronauts.
The problem arose Tuesday when astronauts detached the Harmony module from Discovery. This is a giant cylindrical element that will soon become the site of scientific laboratory activities in Europe and Japan (see box).
This module is a kind of gateway to laboratory modules.
However, their power supply must be taken care of.
The crew's second task was to move one of the modules that generated electricity using 17.5-ton solar panels that was already on the ISS to its final location.
The crew then began opening the module's 76-meter-wide solar panels.
One of the accordion-like folding boards was damaged by a jammed cable about 1 meter long.
To avoid further injury, the opening of the board was not continued.
The astronauts were originally tasked with taking a test walk of the Space Shuttle Discovery and then repairing another solar panel with a failed rotation system. Instead, they had to devote their entire time to repairing the damaged solar panel.
Scott Parazynski was chosen to perform the stunt by hanging from the shuttle's 30-metre robotic arm attached to the station's crane.
He is one of NASA's best "space walkers".
He is tall, strong, extremely skillful, has a muscular upper body and long arms.
The 46-year-old man with a medical degree had to "operate" on the "damaged" solar panel.
After carefully assessing the damage caused, he cut the faulty cable and fixed the damaged area with some "rails".
He was assisted in his work by another "space walker" who remained near the safe passage, as well as by other astronauts inside, including crew captain Peggy Whitson.
The tool he used, a mini hockey stick insulated against hundreds of volts of solar panels, was invented and "crafted" by the station's astronauts.
After completing the operation, Scott Parazynski waited for his companions to fully open the board, before packing up his tools and returning to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts took a half-day break, and today seven returned to the Space Shuttle Discovery to begin their planned return home on Wednesday.
EADS share price falls
EADS shares plunged on the Paris Stock Exchange after the aircraft and defence equipment maker announced that delays in development of the A400M aircraft would result in additional costs of €1.2 billion to €1.4 billion.
After a 4% decline, EADS shares are now trading at €21.96.
The company has been forced to revise its 2007 operating profit forecasts due to delays in engine development of the A400M, which will obviously delay deliveries of the aircraft.
The delay in the delivery of the tactical transport aircraft, announced in October, "will cost between €1.2 billion and €1.4 billion, of which more than €1 billion will concern Airbus," the parent company of the European manufacturer EADS announced.
As these expenses arise, EADS will have to report new 2007 operating profit figures next Thursday when it announces quarterly results, the company added, but did not provide further figures.
The group also indicated that it had taken into account the six-month delay in preparing its new cost estimate.
In 2006, EADS' operating profit fell by 86%, largely due to delays in the development of another program, the A380 megaplane, which also placed a heavy financial burden on the company.
The company originally planned to deliver the A400M aircraft to the French Army in October 2009.
Staying in the status quo
Sunday's elections do not promise any big surprises: a large majority of Russians will vote for President Putin's United Russia party.
This reflects the Russians' need for stability, one might say arbitrary governance, after a heavily manipulated campaign.
Today, three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin is addressing voters via public service channels in a televised message that has already been recorded but whose content is still secret.
Putin leads the list of candidates for the Kremlin-supporting United Russia party, which is expected to win a landslide victory in the elections.
At yesterday's reception of foreign ambassadors, the head of state's behaviour did not reveal anything: he merely launched another outburst against the interference of Western countries, which was a favorite topic during the campaign.
"We know the cost of true democracy, so we want honest, absolutely transparent and open elections without any violations," he added.
However, according to the opposition, this is far from the case.
The opposition condemns the campaign, which they say put pressure on voters.
The leader of the Communist Party, Gennady Zyuganov, claims that "there was no such dirty election in Russia, not even in Yeltsin's time."
After the crackdown on protests last weekend, former world chess champion Garry Kasparov was sentenced to five days in prison for unauthorized demonstration and his lawyer said he was still not allowed to visit.
"Russians still think of it as 'homo sovieticus'"
Predictable election results raise two more obvious questions:
Who will succeed Putin as head of state?
The date of the first round of presidential elections, which will be 2 March 2008, was published in the Official Journal yesterday, and candidates have until 23 December to indicate their intention to run.
Since Vladimir Putin was elected in both 2000 and 2004, his mandate cannot be extended any longer.
However, no other successor is on the horizon.
What role will Putin play from March?
Will he become prime minister?
Or, as leader of the almighty United Russia party or parliamentary majority, will he decide the government and the president?
Be that as it may, the outgoing power will triumph in both parliamentary and presidential elections.
This has now become a tradition.
"Russians still think like 'homo sovieticus': they don't feel they can control their destiny," said sociologist Lev Gudkov, director of the independent Levada Center.
Nikolai Koposov, a historian at St. Petersburg University, goes even further: he theorizes that the country became Christian five hundred years later than in Europe, so the development of civil society is delayed. The traditional community spirit hindered the development of individualism.
After liberal reforms in the 90s, "Putin went back to the paternalistic model, which suited the people perfectly. All the more so because this new paternalism was not associated with intimidation, but with a certain economic prosperity," says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, Russians "voluntarily reject personal responsibility," which quickly became apparent after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.
"Why should we think?"
The phenomenon affects all sectors of society, including the business world.
The administrative elite is interested in maintaining the current situation: the local lists of United Russia are headed by 65 governors who are made up of the leaders of 85 Russian regions.
And freedom imported from the West often embodies chaos, as happened in the 90s.
Public opinion prefers stability.
In this spirit, Russians do not vote for extremist parties either.
Tamara Cherednichenko, a 54-year-old teacher, concludes: "Why should we think?
Those in power aren't that bad, so why should we replace them?"
Depressing memories
After more than 60 years of encryption, the Bad Arolsen archive documenting the fate of 17 and a half million victims of Hitler's regime has become public.
The 47 million archival documents, which occupy 27 kilometres of shelves in Bad Arolsen in Hesse, have so far only been searchable for "humanitarian" purposes, i.e. they have only provided unique and named access to former victims or their descendants.
The eleven countries managing the archives, including Germany, France, Israel and the United States, agreed in May 2006 to open the archive to researchers and historians.
After all states ratified the convention, the archive was opened yesterday.
Confidential information
The opening of the archives in Bad Arolsen will allow historians to conduct research "on the relocation of prisoners, the inhabitants of the camps and the health of forced laborers," explains Reto Meistern, director of the archive managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross.
Until recently, several states, including Germany, have opposed the disclosure of documents because they contain names and thus confidential information.
This may include, for example, the alleged homosexuality or mental disability of some deported victims.
Lists of concentration camps and arrest warrants issued by the Gestapo began to be collected after the war for practical reasons. The aim was to track down civilians who had been deported or sentenced to forced labour and possibly provide evidence of their internment so that they could obtain compensation.
In Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees are already working on tens of thousands of individual requirements.
However, part of the scientific community does not consider the opening of the archive in Bad Arolsen to be of paramount importance.
"These documents basically contain nothing new," said Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Centre for Research on Antisemitism at the Technical University of Berlin, in 2006.
EU and India to sign a free trade agreement in 2008
The annual turnover of bilateral trade in Indo-Europe is already close to EUR 60 billion.
The EU is India's number one trading partner and accounts for 18% of its external trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and Indian Trade Minister Kamal Nath have announced.
As early as April last year, EU foreign ministers approved the European Commission's opening of negotiations for free trade agreements with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). The annual turnover of bilateral trade in Indo-Europe is already close to EUR 60 billion.
The EU is India's number one trading partner and accounts for 18% of its external trade.
The EU is also India's main foreign investor, but India is only the EU's 9th most important trading partner, according to European Commission figures.
Peter Mandelson explained that "a free trade agreement can be a stimulus for both parties" and that "India could increase its presence in a thriving market of 450 million people".
Europe is the primary or secondary importer of the ten most important products exported by India, the European Commissioner added. Every year, the two giants, Europe and Asia, exchange "€47 billion worth of products" and "€10 billion worth of services," European Commission delegation chief Danièle Smadja said this week in New Delhi. At the same time, it regretted that bilateral trade "has still not reached its full potential". The EU and India will meet in New Delhi on Friday for the eighth diplomatic summit, in the presence of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and European Commission President José Manuel Durao Barroso.

Responding to concerns: Bank of England pledges £10bn to financial market for five-week term
The Bank of England announced on Thursday that it would pump £10 billion into the money market at a base rate of 5.75% and an unusual five-week term.
"We want to alleviate concerns that financial market conditions will be particularly bad at the end of the year and give banks greater certainty about their liquidity positions over this period. Therefore, the Bank will offer a significant part of its reserves on the international financial market in a five-week open market operation from December 6," the bank said in a press release.
The bank said £10 billion (€14 billion) would hit the market on December 6 at 12:15 local time. The offer is subject to the central bank base rate, and the repayment deadline is January 10.
This is the first time that the Bank of England has issued liquid funds in an open market operation for five weeks.
The term of such operations is usually one week.
In a press release, the Bank of England said it was "ready to take further measures" to align interbank loans with the central bank base rate.
The current interbank rate on Wednesday was 5.829%.
The three-month rate was above its September 18 level and now stands at 6.6%.
Since the beginning of the summer financial market crisis, the Bank of England has charged significant penalty interest on funds pumped into the money market, which has discouraged banks from using them.
According to rumours (amplified by the evolution of the pound against the euro), many people would have preferred the funds offered by the European Central Bank, which they could have obtained at better interest rates and with greater discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to examine socialist proposal on purchasing power
The UMP and the Nouveau Centre group on Thursday refused to discuss articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, tantamount to rejecting the text itself.
The text negotiated at the meeting initiated by the Socialists contained about ten measures, which were adopted on Tuesday by the National Office of the Socialist Party. These included, for example, a 50% increase in employment allowance, the reinstatement of variable fuel tax, the introduction of travellers' cheques and restrictions on rents.
As the UMP and NC voted 180 to 115 against examining the articles, discussions between the ruling party and the opposition, which sometimes ended in heated arguments, were eventually interrupted. This happened just hours before President Nicolas Sarkozy's televised speech on purchasing power.
The head of the socialist delegation, Jean-Marc Ayrault, announced that he would resubmit all his group's proposals as part of an amendment to the corrective finance bill, which will be on the agenda of the National Assembly next week.
A new festival is born
There have been many rumors about a new music festival in Philadelphia hosted by C3 Presents. Now, however, the company that organizes and promotes the event has announced that Melvin Benn's British producer company Festival Republic will be partnering with the Vineland music festival in New Jersey.
"We're honored to work with someone who started today's American festival movement," Charlie Jones of C3 told Billboard.com.
C3 also hosts Chicago's Lollapalooza Festival and Austin City Limits Music Festival.
The Vineland festival in New Jersey will take place in the summer, so there will be opportunities for camping.
The festival will take place August 8-10 on a 500-acre private property about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Festival Republic director Melvin Benn, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the world's most respected festival organizers.
In 1989, he began organizing the British Reading Festival, which attracts around 80,000 visitors each year.
In 1999, Melvin Benn expanded his range by organising the Leeds Festival, and in 2006 Festival Republic launched the Latitude Festival at Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn has been co-owner of Glastonbury Festival production, licensing and organisation. This festival can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
C3's Charlie Jones called Glastonbury Festival "the most inspiring event" he has ever attended. He added that his company and Melvin Benn's company are working in parallel to enrich the region with a European-style festival event.
"The Philadelphia venue has already been selected, and we've worked hard with the Fairmount Parks Commission to host this festival in central Philadelphia," said Charlie Jones.
"We have had discussions with the city and the Commission has shown great enthusiasm for our plan.
Unfortunately, due to the political maneuvers of the city government, the organization failed," continued Charlie Jones.
"Luckily, we were able to talk to Melvin Benn about it, and now we're preparing to host a huge festival in another unique venue that ultimately serves the people of Philadelphia."
C3 Presents revived the Lollapalooza festival in Chicago's Grant Park in 2005, having already demonstrated his exceptional talent as a festival organizer in 2002 with the Austin City Limits music festival.
The two events grossed $9.8 million and $11.3 million respectively in 2007.
Both festivals took place in urban locations.
"Melvin Benn's European concept is based on the rural festival, whereas our festivals usually take place in urban green spaces," says Charlie Jones.
Our goal is to combine the two models in some way, creating both the European rural atmosphere and the urban feel of America."
Vineland is located about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The people of Vineland, and even the mayor himself, are enthusiastic about supporting the event," says Charlie Jones.
While he doesn't elaborate on the details of the agreement, he does say that "the conditions are favorable enough to allow investment in an event of this size at a venue that will hopefully host the festival for a long time."
Charlie Jones said the festival will be "huge" in size, roughly equivalent to the 80,000-seat capacity of Tennessee's Bonnaroo music festival.
The bands have already received invitations to the event, but nothing is final at the time of press release.
"Vineland is basically going to be a rock festival, but we're planning a diverse selection of music so everyone can find something to their liking," says Charlie Jones.
Jones and his partners, Charlie Walker and Charles Attal, form C3, which was named "Best Independent Event Manager" at the recent Billboard Touring Awards.
Montreal takes on the Terminator
It's not easy to lure Hollywood directors to Montreal when it comes to battling the Terminator itself...
"Seduction" is one of the duties of the Montreal delegate.
The mission promises to be "politically difficult" as California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger opposes filming his own productions abroad.
Is it really hard to fight the "Terminator Governor"?
"We have to be careful because the film industry decides for itself which is the best location for it.
If you find that conditions are favorable in Montreal, you will go there.
Our job is to offer the best possible conditions on the basis of which they decide for us," says Schwarzenegger.
Competition for festivals
However, Denis Turcotte is now mostly focused on promoting Canadian films.
The race for the Oscars has begun.
The goal is to show and promote as many Quebec films as possible at every American film festival, be it the Sundance Film Festival or the Denver, Seattle or San Francisco Film Festival. Efforts should also be made to ensure that directors hold auditions.
The film L'Âge des ténèbres was well received a few weeks ago at the 30th anniversary. Mill Valley Film Festival.
It will also be screened at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil premiered in Santa Monica and was released at the 30th Annual Film Festival in November. It is also screened at Starz Denver Film Festival.
Québec was also represented by four short films and four feature films at American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be a year-end rally in the stock market? Experts divided on subprime crisis
With just five weeks to go before the end of the fiscal year, investors are already rubbing their palms and looking forward to the usual year-end rush.
This year, however, it is not clear to experts whether this will actually happen.
According to Banif, "statistically, in December the stock market generally behaves positively.
However, purely statistical forecasts are not necessarily correct, and in the current situation there is uncertainty in the market, at least in the short term."
Experts are far from in favor of a year-end surge in the stock market, although they state that "the stock market is sustained by the presence of liquidity, which provides opportunities for investment, as there is a lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially fixed returns, which are negatively affected by the flight towards quality securities, both in the long and short term".
As a result, the stock market will be characterized by more lateral movement that is not free from volatility, "especially since the impact of the Fed's interest rate cut is still unknown, as crude oil prices are high and inflationary tensions are looming."
Javier Barrio, BPI's sales manager for Spain, agrees, saying it would be risky to say there will be a rally.
According to the expert, "the situation is not rosy at all."
Ibex's loss is nearly 4 percent from its highest recorded on Nov. 8, when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
However, not all experts are so pessimistic.
According to Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, Ibex 35 could end the year closer to 16,000 points due to portfolio reorganization and contributions to the usual pension fund.
However, the expert adds that some changes are expected this year, as the rally is pushed to the second week of December, the week after the long weekend of Constitution Day.
The analyst considers it unlikely that volatility will affect market trends.
According to Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banco, we are close to the technical level and "as a result, we may see a decline in the stock market index, which may rise depending on the news coming from the US regarding the consequences of the credit market crisis."
The analyst is confident that they will be favorable.
Analysts agree on which securities will be aimed at reaching Ibex's new maximum quotas.
Solana, from Intermoney, emphasizes that "this year it's the turn of the big securities."
The expert wants to add the two big banks and some construction companies to the list, "because by then the electrical sector will be very expensive."
Federico Olucha of Inversis Banco states that the rise is due to the banking and industrial sectors.
For construction companies, the rally could also be positive, if at all.
"ACS has been trying to regain its positions for several months and we hope that construction companies Ferrovial and FCC will follow suit," he says.
Cyclical consumption will be the protagonist for the rest of the year due to the increase in sales during the Christmas sales period.
On the other hand, according to the expert, technology companies can also benefit, although there is not very high representation in this area in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, there have only been two December price falls.
The real end-of-year rally was observed in 2003, when stock markets recovered from the crisis caused by the bursting of the technology bubble.
This year, when the Ibex 35 corrected 28.17%, a jump of 6.68% was recorded in December.
It remains to be seen whether 2007 will be the fifth consecutive profitable year (Ibex is up 8.36% since January) and whether a rally at the end will occur.
Banco Popular Español 200 opens a branch open 12 hours from Monday to Saturday
Banco Popular Español has decided to renovate most of its branches.
This affects a total of 200 branches located in the most commercially affected parts of Spain.
The mentioned accounts run under the Popular Max name and make a big difference for the bank.
But also for other Spanish institutions, as this is the first group whose branches are open continuously until 8.30 p.m. and even from 10 a.m. to 8.30 p.m. on Saturdays.
The other group, BBVA, which has also repeatedly said it plans to extend the opening hours of its branches, has not yet taken the necessary action.
But he's about to reach an agreement with unions to close 75% of his branches in exchange for opening one afternoon, though not to the public.
The experience of Banco Popular Español will be decisive for other institutions to decide whether or not to join the initiative to promote better opening hours for stores.
This is precisely the objective of Banco Popular Español's project.
These locations are aimed at individuals, small and medium-sized businesses, sole proprietorships and local businesses.
The bank wants to operate 200 branches across Spain for 18 months with the aforementioned opening hours, as it is not a new opening hours, but a restructuring of the existing one.
To do this, the institution modernizes its branches located in commercial zones according to the needs of customers of each street.
In this way, the extension of opening hours is accompanied by a new concept of the nature of the branches, a more modern and colorful design.
Ángel Rivera, responsible for commercial banks, points out that the restructuring does not require a large investment, but that they will have to employ more employees, which means eight or nine employees per branch instead of the current six.
The branches, which even include meeting rooms for SMEs, will also sell non-financial products.
Positive experiences
Banco Popular Español has already implemented the initiative in three branches in Madrid.
According to Ángel Rivero, the experience has been positive.
The branches on Madrid's Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía streets were chosen, and Rivero said the decision was the right one.
Banco Popular Español currently has 2,500 branches.
Another 60 operate under the name Mundocredit, specialize in immigrants, and also have very favorable opening hours, even opening on Sundays and holidays.
The mentioned units of PopularMax do not use BBVA's model, where some branches offer a wide range of non-financial products.
"We don't want to create competition for our customers," Rivero points out.
At the moment, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica and will sell mobile phones by employing external staff.
Telecinco doubles the stock value of rival Antena 3 for the first time
"We did it".
This was the sentence Paolo Vasile, Telecinco's acting consultant, expressed his satisfaction yesterday at the close of the market when it was revealed that the TV station he runs had doubled the value of his rival Antena 3.
But one thing overshadowed his joy: "The only thing that hurts is that it's not because we rose more, but because we fell less," he said.
Even so, he emphasized that we "fell less" in a weak market.
Telecinco closed yesterday up 2.54 percent.
This increase puts its annual loss at 15.66 percent.
Mediaset owns 52% of the company and Vocento 13%, giving it a stock market value of 4,488.88 million euros, according to Bloomberg.
Its rival Antena 3 lost 1.52 percent yesterday and has fallen 40.5 percent since January, reaching half as much yesterday at 2.193.46 million.
The other listed communications companies are worth 3.571 million for Sogecable; 2.518.53 million for Prisa (publisher of Cinco Días) and 1.779 million for Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 is due to the similarity between the two companies.
The only question is how much we can deliver in the same market, at what cost, and how it pays off in terms of viewership.
Telecinco announced last week that it would become the first TV channel with gross advertising revenue exceeding $1 billion this year, said Giuseppe Tringali, acting consultant to Telecinco and Publiespaña. The latter is the group's advertising subsidiary.
If the reported fact materializes, the TV channel would increase its advertising revenue by 3.6 percent this fiscal year, up from 965.4 million in fiscal 2006.
Antena 3's net sales increased by 1.6 percent in the first nine months of the fiscal year (to 734.4 million), while television net sales increased by 0.7 percent (630.4 million).
According to analysts, one factor contributing to Telecinco's stock market momentum is the high pay out it has maintained so far: in 2006, the company, led by President Alejandro Echevarría, distributed 100% of its returns to shareholders.
Vasile said that although it is too early to decide, that proportion could change after buying 33% of Endemol in partnership with its parent company Mediaset.
"We officially guarantee a minimum payment of 50%, although we have always allocated much more.
I hope our shareholders will be satisfied with us this year, as we have already benefited them with the acquisition of 33% of Endemol."
According to analysts, the market is currently experiencing some slack.
Lehman Brothers recently cut its earnings estimates for Telecinco by 4 percent in 2008 and 7 percent in 2009.
According to them, this is due to the estimated decline in sales growth from 10.5 percent to 8.4 percent in 2008 and from 5.5 percent to 5.1 percent in 2009.
The same company forecasts that Antena 3's profits will fall by 4.5 percent in 2008 and 7.5 percent in 2009.
3 reviews
1.
Ibersecurities: recommends buying both securities, mainly due to their high profitability and long-term sustainable potential from dividends.
2.
Caja Madrid: sees Telecinco as more favorable (acquisition) than Antena 3 (retention) due to its "multiple attractiveness" and business strengthening.
3.
JPMorgan: in both cases, it recommends underweight due to "similar risks" (saturated market and less favourable economic climate).
Congress approves adoption of MiFID, which went into effect on November 1
In parallel with parliamentary proceedings, which concluded today with a congressional vote approving the Senate's amendments, the government initiated a public dialogue on the legislation on which the law is based, so that both can come into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the various groups unanimously highlighted the efforts of representatives and senators in negotiations and agreements aimed at establishing the most favourable normative for investors and the detailed regulation of companies' activities in order to ensure efficient market operation.
Mifid, which amends the Securities Market Law, will allow financial markets to be modernised while strengthening investor protection, broadening the supervisory powers of Spain's National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promoting cooperation between the various supervisors of the European Union.
The new directive allows financial advisory services for specialised firms, but also for natural or legal persons, and creates a new financial services company form (ESIS), namely financial advisory companies (AFIs), alongside securities distribution companies, securities agencies and portfolio management companies.
In addition, the law increases the number of systems capable of carrying out operations involving funds, thereby adding multilateral trading platforms and order internalisation systems to regulated secondary markets which compete with current stock exchange participants.
Furthermore, the Act obliges investment service providers to provide market information on key aspects of their business profile, risk-taking and risk management methods, and to facilitate the monitoring of the CNMV, they must keep records of all operations carried out.
The Congressional Economic Committee introduced a number of amendments. Of paramount importance, securitised debt is treated as "complex" funds because of its high risk to investors. This has been proven in the case of US high-risk mortgage lending (subprime).
On the other hand, the transposition of the directive has also been used to legally outline the scope of activities of economic and entrepreneurial graduates. This comes 30 years after the Royal Decree defining professional functions that can only be performed by economists came into force in 1977.
And the Senate proposed the creation of new players in the financial sector, such as an intermediary agent who works for someone else's account, does not need permission from the CNMV and can distribute products or acquire clients to several investment companies at once.
The Consumer Price Index increased by 0.5 points in November to reach 4.1%.
This indicator, which Eurostat takes into account for calculating the inflation rate in the European Union, shows the evolution of prices in Spain for the month of November.
Its publication is in line with the strategy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank to provide data that are comparable to those coming from the United States, both in terms of time of generation and nature.
The preliminary indicator uses the same calculation method as the Standardised Price Index, but the statistical modelling method differs for estimating information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The Statistical Office highlighted that the preliminary indicator is purely indicative and may therefore differ from the final data, which will be published on 14 December.
"The Consumer Price Index remains relatively high."
Pedro Solbes, a government vice-president and economy minister, said the increase in the CPI to 4.1% in November was only "temporary", but at the same time predicted that the price index was expected to remain "relatively high" in the coming months.
In Parliament's corridors, Solbes confirmed that "although the indicator is not very favourable", Spain's inflation rate within the monetary union has remained more or less at the same level in recent years.
He added that the month of November "brought fewer surprises" than the previous month, when the Government did not expect such a large increase.
"We expected a figure of around 4%", the Minister of Economic Affairs admitted in relation to the figure published today.
Northern Rock aims to raise €42 billion over three years.
Northern Rock's deposits have fallen by more than 50% and now stand at just £12bn (€16,800m) since it hit a crisis in mid-September and had to borrow urgently from the Bank of England.
At the time, it still had a record number of deposits in excess of £25 billion, the number of which has gradually decreased over the last two and a half months due to a loss of customer confidence, despite the government's promise of one hundred percent guarantee to the bank until the end of the crisis.
Virgin will operate this unit under its own financial trading name, Virgin Money. Virgin will need to raise around a quarter of British banks' revenues over the next three years to raise the remaining £18bn to reach its £30 billion target.
Richard Branson's group, known in England for his high-profile advertising campaigns, intends to spend around £50 million (€70 million) a year on advertising and marketing to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock this week highlighted the Virgin consortium's bid as the best way to avoid bankruptcy. In addition to Virgin, three other companies make up the consortium.
Mayor of Totana arrested over alleged corruption case
The Gendarmerie arrested the mayor of Totana in the province of Murcia (People's Party) in the early hours of this morning on suspicion of involvement in the city's corruption scandal that erupted this week.
In addition to him, a secretary of the City Hall and the chief of police of the municipality were arrested.
José Martínez Andreo, a former city councillor, replaced EPP MP Juan Morales in May, who officials interviewed by SER radio station suggested may have been the head of the corruption network.
Police continue to investigate at city offices and the City Development Council, and it cannot be ruled out that further arrests are expected.
Juan Morales' lawyer has also been investigated as the main suspect in the corruption scandal that erupted this week.
According to SER radio station, the lawyer for EPP member Juan Morales was arrested as he was leaving Morales with corruption documentation in his bag.
According to police sources, the subject of the investigation is the alleged commission Morales received in exchange for signing an urban development agreement with a Galician construction company to reclassify 200 hectares of land.
Eight people are currently under arrest.
Bono accepts the PSOE's nomination in Toledo and the presidency of Parliament if they win the election.
Former defence minister José Bono accepted an offer from Prime Minister and General Secretary of the Socialist Party, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to lead the PSOE's Toledo list in the next parliamentary elections and to become president of parliament if the Socialists win the elections.
This was announced by PSOE Organisational Secretary José Blanci at a press conference and confirmed by Bono himself at the party's federal headquarters at noon today after a meeting with Zapatero.
The Prime Minister justified his choice of the former minister by saying that "we have to reckon with the best" in politics, and Bono is "among the best".
He added that the Mancha politician would "probably" be the Socialist Party's candidate for the presidency of Parliament if the Socialists win the next election.
Bono would replace current parliament speaker Manuel Marín, who announced on November 15 that he had no intention of running in the next election and would give up his political career to fight climate change in academia.
The former minister admitted that the Prime Minister had been constantly besieging him to return to politics since he left active politics two years ago.
He added that since voters know who will be vice-president for economic affairs if the Socialists win, the party also wanted to inform them about who will be the President of Parliament "in the spirit of transparency".
If Bono does take the post, he wants Parliament to be "a place of respect, not insults or shouting" and more like citizens' homes.
"Unfortunately, at times it seems that Parliament is the only place in Madrid where you cannot talk calmly, and there have been times when the Prime Minister's speech in the Senate has been interrupted 26 times."
At the same time, he praised the current president, Manuel Marín, for his "excellent work", but did not want to present himself as president already, lest his opponents consider him "superior".
Climate campaign
Since the climate change movement relentlessly persecutes both those who are skeptical of their predictions and those who prefer political or social battles, it must be very strong.
He must even bring a political leader like Prime Minister Zapatero on his side, saying the movement is more important than fighting Islamic terrorism and proclaiming that "we must make a new deal with our planet."
However, this comment raises the question of the extent to which the activity or inactivity of its government contributed to Spain leading the way within the EU in non-compliance with the Kyoto Protocols.
Who is responsible for non-compliance with the Convention, which sector is affected and why has the Government not sought to avoid it?
It should also clearly explain to the Spaniards what measures it intends to take to curb climate change.
Which companies will be affected by these measures, what habits will the population have to change, what individual and social energy saving will we have to expect and what will be the economic consequences of this?
In other words, who should sacrifice and who should pay to save our Earth?
But we have not received and will not receive an explanation for these issues.
Precisely because it is about sacrifice and money.
Measures brought about by climate change, actual measures are always unpopular.
They are costly, inconvenient and costly for both companies and the public.
Even a PSOE petrol price increase would have made it so unpopular before the election that Zapatero quickly withdrew it.
In other words, we must save the Earth from scratch, with mere propaganda texts, empty slogans without real consequences.
Conventions, commissions, protocols, new posts.
With the agreement with Earth, as the Prime Minister says, who speaks so beautifully in the election campaign, he does not demand, he does not attack, he even beautifies election rallies and awakens tenderness in us.

Totana mayor and police chief arrested over alleged corruption case
The Gendarmerie has arrested the mayor of Totana in Murca province, EPP member José Martínez Andreo, the local Police Chief, the secretary of City Hall and a catering contractor for crimes related to urban development, police sources said today.
The mayor was arrested at his home and transferred to City Hall and is currently there with several police officers, many of whom are investigating the Urban Development Council and the municipal body responsible for managing industrial sites and housing.
The three arrests follow the arrest last Monday in Galicia, Madrid and Murcia of six people in connection with a case in which 2 hectares of agricultural land were reclassified as buildable land to allow the Galician company Nuaria to build 4,000 apartments after illegally paying commissions to managers during their previous mandate.
Two other people have not yet been arrested but are under investigation, according to Totana Court No. 1.
The six people arrested first were handed over to the court.
According to official sources, the former mayor of Totana is Juan Morales, who is now an independent member of parliament for the People's Party, also under investigation.
The ex-wife, who owns a real estate agency registered in Totana, is also under investigation, as is the former mayor's current girlfriend, who lives in the provincial centre of Murcia.
The director and owner of Nuaria Group, lawyer and entrepreneur Manuel N.A., was arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), together with the director of Suelo de Inmonuar, Pablo José M.G. The latter company also belongs to the Nuaria Group and was responsible for bribery.
The investigation is being carried out by the Municipal Crimes Unit of the Gendarmerie's Operational Central Unit, whose members, in addition to the arrests, conducted eleven searches, mainly at companies linked to the arrestees operating in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
Only one person was arrested in Totana: the owner of a well-known poultry company in the area, who may have acted as an intermediary in the case.
The Nuaria Group would have created the largest residential complex in Totana with 5,000 apartments, a golf course and two wellness hotels.
The company acquired 2.2 million square meters of land in Totana, which was reclassified. The project would have doubled the population of the settlement, which currently has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group includes companies such as Autesa e Inomonuar, a real estate broker, Conycase, which manages the parking lots of Coruna, Venezuela streets and Catholic Ferdinand Square in Vigo, Hogartel, which specialises in direct marketing, and Preconiza, which sells, promotes and installs building elements.

If they agree, we'll put the Book of the Month aside for a while and see if we can learn some philosophical knowledge and wisdom.
I've already equipped myself with one.
People, life is a constant change.
Of course, everyone can come up with something for themselves.

Our correspondent in Finland found this commentary in one of Finland's largest newspapers: Helsingin Sanomat (probably at the head of the PISA report on world literacy), referring to the one published on November 18 at the same time as the critique of Blackburn's book.
"The philosophical teachings came to the public after the tragedy of the Yokela gymnasium.
The killer, a student about to graduate from high school, quoted the writings of Plato and Nietzsche in his messages.
The Education Councillor in charge of teaching philosophy, Pekka Elo, demanded in the pages of the daily Helsingin Sanomat that teachers examine Plato's teachings with a critical eye, adding that knowledge of Nietzsche is not necessarily important in compulsory basic philosophy classes in secondary schools.

One of his colleagues informs us that the Criminal Code includes an offence related to Internet downloads:
A. Downloading a song is considered a misdemeanor and is punishable by six months to one year.
However, stealing a disc worth less than €400 in a shop is an offence (Article 623.1).
B. If you steal €1,000 in a shop, theft is already a misdemeanor, but the penalty is still less than the penalty for downloading via the Internet (Art. 234 BTK).
C. If you steal a car but return it after 40 hours, the penalty is still less than the penalty for downloading it over the Internet (Article 244.1).
D. You will be penalized less for getting into a fight than for ripping CDs.
If you take part in a mass brawl, you can be sentenced to three months to one year (Article 154 BTK), but for copying CDs you can get a sentence of six months to two years
(Article 270 BTK).
According to Article 184.2 of the Criminal Code, sexual harassment in the workplace is not as serious as downloading a DVD movie.
F. The distribution of copyrighted films without the consent of the authors is punishable more severely than the sale of pornographic material to minors (Article 186).
If my colleague is right, someone has gotten things out of hand.

My GP gave me an article about strange research titled "Money causes brain activity, especially when others have less."
That is, the feelings of employees on payday depend on how much the others received.
The experiment was conducted at the University of Bonn using magnetic resonance tomography measurements and was published in the latest issue of Science.
According to study author and head of the Neurocognition Group at the Life & Brain Institute in Germany, Bernd Weber, "The strongest activity was measured when the participant answered correctly and the partner made a mistake."
The researchers found that if they both gave the correct answer and received the same amount of cash reward, brain activity was moderate, but if one of them received double the amount, activity was also increased.
I have no idea why it took so much science to reach such a simple conclusion.
Balkan Prosecutor General
For eight years now, Carla del Ponte has been ruthlessly prosecuting Balkan war criminals from the Prosecutor's Office of the Criminal Court in The Hague investigating crimes committed in the former Yugoslavia.
Her mandate ends at the end of the year and Carla leaves with a bit of a bitter taste in her mouth as those responsible for the massacre in Srebrenica, in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims were slaughtered, meaning General Ratko Mladic and Serbian Bosnian leader Radován Karadzic remain at large.
Their names are on the list chosen by Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach as the title of his documentary: Carla's List (2006, not yet released in Spain). Like a true crime story, the film follows the Swiss attorney general's work from Belgrade to New York as she tries to put pressure on the governments involved to tighten the noose around the fleeing criminals.
What insurance suits me?
Car insurance, which provides security for the car owner against various types of damage, involves significant expenses and depends on several factors such as age, gender, date of obtaining a driving licence, marital status, type of car to be insured and type of use.
Getting a car is only the first step.
Moreover, choosing the right insurance is often more difficult than deciding what kind of car you want.
First of all, we need to be clear about what we are talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between the insurance company and the insured.
This agreement takes the form of an insurance contract, which stipulates that the insurance company undertakes compensation in return for a fixed premium in the event of a loss occurring.
An insurance premium is practically the amount paid for insurance, which is determined taking into account various factors such as age, gender, date of obtaining a driver's license, marital status, type of car to be insured, its use, and more.
Insurance companies set the insurance premium on the basis of statistics, i.e. a higher amount is paid by someone who has a higher risk of accidents.
This is why people over 25 or women pay less, because statistics show that they are at lower risk because they are more cautious.
Similarly, based on the reports, insurance companies concluded that married people also cause fewer accidents than lonely people.
For the type of use of the car, frequency is decisive.
With more frequent use, the possibility of an accident increases.
When setting the insurance premium, many factors are taken into account by insurance companies.
Therefore, the owner should carefully research it in order to choose the most suitable form of insurance for his profile.
In the following, we present the most important factors when choosing, so that the best adaptation to the needs of the insured can be achieved and a reasonable price can be established.
When concluding an insurance contract, people under the age of 25 have to take into account a number of disadvantages, such as lack of driving experience and freshness of driving license.
Although it is best to be insured against all hazards, there are also more economical solutions.
More cautious drivers can take out complete insurance with a deductible, so they will be insured against all hazards and the price will be affordable.
In this type of contract, the insured pays part of the damage.
'The deductible payable by the insured depends on the premium; the higher the premium, the lower the deductible," says Luis Noguera, head of First Europe, an online insurance broker in Spain.
Another option is third-party liability insurance, where the customer insures himself against damage caused to others, but not against damage to his own car.
In addition, it will be insured against theft, fire damage and loss of the car.
One piece of advice.
If you are under 25 years old, be careful and avoid accidents if possible, as this will affect your bonus and you may be able to reduce the amounts you have to pay in the future.
Discounts compared to the basic tariff of the insurance company are called bonuses.
And the penalty charged compared to the basic tariff is called malus.
"The amount of bonus and malus depends on the insurance company and its profit.
If the company has had a good year, it can afford to increase the bonus rate," explains Noguera.
Once the age limit of 25 years has been exceeded, it is easier for owners to take out adequate insurance, as the risk of accidents is reduced thanks to the experience gained over the years.
At this time, we advise you to take out complete insurance with a deductible.
"In general, young people are not yet able to properly apply their experience in an accident or even when driving," says the director of the European insurance company in Spain, adding that the majority of accidents occur in the second year of driving, when drivers have already overcome beginners' fears.
If the insured person is already married but does not yet have children, it is best to take out a complete insurance, of course, if your financial means allow it.
Insurance companies consider married couples with children to be the least risky customers, so the premium payable in their case is also lower.
In this case, it is best to have complete insurance with a deductible (it can reach 300 euros) or, if they have a higher bonus, from the third year of the vehicle, they can extend the insurance to damage caused to someone else.
"They drive more relaxed, but at the same time they have more purchasing power and can afford a higher deductible," confirms Luis Noguera.
For pensioners, we recommend complete insurance with a deductible (which is around 150 euros), or in case of a higher bonus, it can be extended to liability insurance.
Car insurance is very important, not only because it protects the owner in the event of damages, but also because it is a large expense, so it is essential to choose the right form of personalized insurance.
Celtic want to score in Milan to reach the eighth final.
Milan and Celtic will face off at the San Siro stadium on Tuesday to pick up the missing point at the conclusion of the Champions League. The Italians can thus be first and the Scots can qualify.
The Italians have a total of ten points and already secured qualification in the fifth round with a draw with Portugal, while Celtic have nine points, but one more would be needed to prevent the six-point Shakhtar, who will face four-point Benfica, from overtaking him.
The two matches in Group D will be held a week before the end of the sixth round, as Milan will have to play Japan at the Club World Cup, where they will try to fight their way through to the final on the 16th in the semi-finals on the 13th.
This concludes Group D sooner than the others, and although the most likely result at the Giuseppe Meazza stadium will be a draw, the two teams will be aiming for a win, as the Italians do not want to fall behind at home and Celtic can start the eighth round from a better place first.
For Gordon Strachan's team, even a defeat is enough to qualify if Shakhtar do not win, but you cannot be sure of this, because if there is a tie on points, the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1) but won the next clash (2-0), will advance.
The Italians will try to make the evening bitter for the Scots, who want to reach the eighth round of the restructured Champions League twice in a row after losing to Kaka by one goal in extra time (1-0) following a 0-0 draw there last season.
Shakhtar would be most pleased with the victory of the "Rossonerik", because if they lose, Celtic will reach the eighth finals and stay in UEFA.
Because Benfica, despite currently being in last place and with no chance of staying in the European league, can still secure third place with a win to play in UEFA.
20,000 people went to Vancouver to attend the first concert of the Spice Girls tour.
The Spice Girls began their tour in Vancouver, Canada, in front of 20,000 spectators for the first time since disbanding in 2000.
"Posh Spice" (Victoria Beckham), "Scary Spice" (Melanie Brown), "Baby Spice" (Emma Bunton), "Sporty Spice" (Melanie Chisholm) and "Ginger Spice" (Geri Halliwell) announced minutes before the concert at GM Place in Vancouver that the band was "in great shape."
Around 20,000 people bought tickets to attend the concert, which included a video about the history of the band, which became hugely successful in the 1990s.
To coincide with the band's reunion and tour, EMI released a new album in Spain, featuring major hits and two new songs, "Headlines" and "Voodoo".
The five members of the Spice Girls took to the stage in bracelets given to them by "Posh Spice", British footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was also present in the packed auditorium at GM Place, although Victoria had forbidden him to do so a few days earlier.
Announcing the show, Victoria Beckham said the British football star "hasn't seen our dress yet, so I'm nervous what she'll think of the show".
Sporty Spice was the reason the band broke up two years after leaving the band in 1998 "because the members didn't understand each other". He also appeared nervous during the press conference, which was held two hours before the concert.
"I was scared.
I was nervous, but I could see that people's feelings about the Spice Girls had changed.
I thought, why not? Now I'm glad I made that decision," Chisholm said of the band, which had broken up nine years earlier because of him.
The singer added that in the meantime, "things have settled down and we love each other very much."
But a lot of things have changed since the Spice Girls last performed in 1998.
According to CTV television, the band arrived in Vancouver on a Virgin Airlines special plane.
A group of baby-sitters were waiting for them at the airport.
The five have a total of seven children.
After the concert in Vancouver, the band will perform in California (USA), then in San Jose (December 4) and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7)
They will perform in Madrid on December 23.
New fears about the Russia-Ukraine gas dispute
The gas price dispute between Krajna and Russia has reignited, which could also affect Russian fuel to be shipped to Western Europe.
Most of the Russian gas exported to the European Union (EU) is routed through Ukraine, and disputes between the two nations have always attracted a lot of attention.
Kyiv has said that if Moscow raises the price of gas paid by Ukrainians, they will also impose higher transit costs on Russia.
An earlier dispute between the two countries last year led to a reduction in supplies to EU countries.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow concerns an attempt by the Ukrainian government and Russian state-owned natural gas monopoly Gazprom to reach an agreement on the price of gas that Ukraine will pay to Russia in 2008.
Gazprom has stated that it should increase gas produced from neighbouring Turkmenistan by 50% compared to the price agreement reached with Ukraine for 2008.
According to analysts, this could mean a 40% increase in the price of shipments from Gazprom for Ukraine.
"It is important to argue in accordance with one of the most important natural gas transit states during the negotiations," Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinah told Reuters news agency.
"Changes to gas prices should definitely be linked to our discussion on the level of costs for transit through Ukraine (and to Western Europe)."
As a result of the recent major gas price dispute between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom turned off the gas tap to Ukraine in January 2006.
This resulted in a domino fall in exports to Western Europe, which also pushed up prices significantly.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the European Union's gas supply.
Russia has the world's largest reserves of natural gas, but most of them remain unexplored.
As a result, Gazprom replenishes its own gas supply with natural gas from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet states in Central Asia.
NHS 'obligation to check foreign workers'
Scottish NHS committees must improve their control of criminal records of workers from outside Europe, a watchdog has said.
The proposal came after Robert Black, the chief auditor general, was linked to a doctor of foreign nationality in Scotland in the June attack on Glasgow airport.
Black also expressed concern that NHS Scotland does not have accurate figures on the number of overseas workers.
However, in its report, it also pointed out, through a sample of five health authorities, key controls that had been properly carried out.
Following the attack on Glasgow airport, the auditor general checked the list of staff recruited outside the European Economic Area.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi-born doctor at Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after a jeep rammed into the building's main terminal.
Abdullah was one of three doctors questioned by the Old Bailey court via video link in October on charges of attempted car bombing in the UK.
NHS committees must check the qualifications and work experience of the workers concerned and their possession of permits to work in the UK for their staff from overseas countries before taking up employment.
Although Scottish health commissions use Disclosure Scotland to verify criminal records, the agency is not authorised to obtain such information from outside Great Britain.
Among other things, the Auditor General's report recommended that committees introduce a Criminal Records Office Guide to facilitate the employer's audit processes with various overseas countries.
"Although we found evidence of such inspections in staff records, they are not carried out systematically," the report states.
Mr Black said the Scottish NHS was performing its own pre-employment screening process at a high level, adding: "Our report highlights areas for improvement in the system to ensure we have up-to-date information on NHS staff numbers from overseas."
Dr Peter Terry, chairman of BMA Scotland, said it was "extremely unrealistic" that pre-employment checks could be used to identify potential NHS employees who could commit terrorist acts in the future.
"According to the report, current pre-employment checks are working well in NHS Scotland and the value of the proposals is not yet transparent," he added.
According to Scottish health authorities, the current number of overseas employees, mostly doctors and nurses, stands at 1161.
However, the auditor general pointed out that the figures are likely higher, which can be partly explained by the fact that committees have problems identifying staff on indefinite leave.
The investigation also showed that the control procedures put in place by NHS authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian are largely harmonised.
These procedures included checking passports, work permits and professional qualification papers.
The Scottish Government is currently examining a policy and guidance on pre-employment checks for NHS employees from overseas countries.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: "I was delighted that this task was carried out following the attack on Glasgow Airport.
He added that the Scottish Government, in cooperation with health committees, would take into account the recommendations contained in the report and ensure that an updated guide on pre-employment inspections for all staff, including those from overseas, reflects best practice. An updated version is planned to be published next month.
Joy Division hosts the film awards
The biopic "Control", about the late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis, won five awards at the British Independent Film Awards – including Best Picture.
Awards also went to lead actor Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse before portraying Curtis, director Anton Corbijn and supporting actor Toby Kebbell.
The award for Best Actress went to Dame Judi Dench for the thriller "Details of a Scandal."
The Variety Award for bringing British film into the international spotlight went to Daniel Craig, who played Bond.
The awards were presented at a ceremony held at London's Roundhouse.
The film "Control" chronicles Curtis' rise within the Joy Division until 1980, when he committed suicide at the age of 23.
The black-and-white film, featuring "The Killers", David Bowie and "New Order on the Soundtrack", cost just £3 million to make.
Dutch photographer Corbijn - previously known for creating the cover for U2's "Joshua Tree" album - won two awards; with awards for Best Director and Best Novice Director.
Another award winner at the ceremony focused on rock music; Julien Temple's film about Clash singer Joe Strummer won Best Documentary.
The award for Best Actor went to Viggo Mortensen for his performance as the driver of the mafia boss in David Cronenberg's London-based thriller "Killer Promises".
Ray Winstone, known for his hardcore roles, received the Richard Harris Award for his outstanding contribution to the British film industry.
The fifty-year-old actor, whose name is associated with films such as "Scum", "Hungry" and "Sexy Hot", is currently taking part in the filming of the film "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull".
Winstone is proud to receive the award, named after "Camelot" and "Harry Potter" star Harris, who died in 2002.
"For people like me, people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney opened the door," Winstone added.
"I feel really fortunate to have met Richard Harris more than once.
Richard Harris' style is close to me, he was a great actor of his time and I have a lot of respect for him."
The selection of independent film awards, known as Bifa, is decided by a group of film directors, actors and festival organisers.
Bifa supporters and patrons include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia arrests 208 people arrested in connection with terrorist conspiracy
Saudi Arabia said yesterday that it had arrested 208 militants involved in terrorist cells who planned an imminent attack on an oil facility and several strikes on clerics and security forces.
State television of the world's largest oil exporter said one of the cells was trying to smuggle missiles through.
Al-Qaeda supporters have launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been an ally of the United States since the 2003 invasion of Iraq.
According to the television report, an eight-person cell led by a foreign national planned to attack an oil facility in the eastern province.
Following an al-Qaeda-organized attack on the world's largest oil processing facility in Abqaiq in 2006, Saudi Arabia began building a 35,000-strong rapid reaction force to protect the facilities.
According to the report quoting the interior minister, 18 of those arrested belong to a cell run by a "person specializing in rocket launches" who illegally crossed the border.
The report also reported that fighters tried to smuggle eight projectiles into the kingdom.
22 of those detained plotted attacks on church leaders and security forces.
The government has called on church leaders to take tougher action to curb the flow of Saudis joining al-Qaeda fighters into Iraq who are fighting allied forces and the US-backed Shiite Muslim government. The latter is considered heretical by Saudi hardline Sunnis.
Al-Qaeda fighters see many of Saudi Arabia's cleric leaders as being recruited by authorities to support the policies of the royal family that controls the government.
The group's fighters, inspired by calls by Saudi-born al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden to target the pro-Western Saudi government, have set out to attack foreign settlements, government buildings and energy facilities.
"Security forces have made enormous efforts to... five months," an interior ministry spokesman told state television.
During the arrests, a 16-person "media cell" was also caught in Medina with the aim of spreading "takfiri thinking". Takfiri thinking is the ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals that advocates violence against Muslims labeled disloyal and apostate.
Those arrested also included 32 people accused of providing financial support to militants.
Venus' climate could provide a glimpse into Earth's future
Scientists found yesterday that Venus may once have provided pleasant living conditions.
Data from a European orbiting spacecraft suggest that this planet is more of Earth's whimsical twin than previously thought.
Venus is Earth's closest planetary neighbor.
The two planets are almost the same in size and orbit similar, although Venus is slightly closer to the Sun.
Scientists know that billions of years ago, Venus may have had very similar living conditions to Earth, and even habitable conditions.
However, due to the extremely high carbon dioxide greenhouse effect, atmospheric erosion caused by solar radiation, and the planet's lower rotational speed, Venus has embarked on a completely different evolutionary path.
Today, the planet has evaporated water, its surface temperature is hot enough to melt lead, and it is devastated by hurricane-force winds and lightning storms.
The findings of the European Space Agency's Venus Express spacecraft, based on a year-long study of the planet, paint a sobering picture of how similar catastrophic climate changes could occur on Earth.
Fred Taylor, a professor in the Department of Physics at Oxford University and one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: "It is beginning to emerge why Venus' climate is so different from Earth's, despite the fact that the two planets are otherwise very similarly structured.
"Our new data has enabled us to develop a scenario of Venus forming billions of years ago, when it might have habitable conditions similar to Earth.
"Enriched uranium" seized by police
One kilogram of radioactive material - reportedly enriched uranium - was seized yesterday by Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman said three people had been arrested and the material had been examined.
The spokesman did not confirm whether it was enriched uranium, but said the material could have been sold for $1 million (£480,000).
Wide open doors
Mitt Romney says he is not worthy of a presidential candidate to answer questions from a snowman.
Still, Republican candidates for the presidential election agreed to participate in a debate streamed on YouTube, in which ordinary voters videotaped their questions and forwarded them to candidates.
None of the questions cast Wednesday night, Nov. 28, turned out to be as ridiculous as the snowman who asked Democrats about global warming in the other party's debate streamed on YouTube.
This time, however, the Q&A reflected the situation of the Republican Party approaching next year's election.
It is not yet known exactly how CNN's production executives, which co-financed the dispute, selected the YouTube clips submitted to the candidates.
The longest issue that took up the first half hour of the debate concerned immigration.
This topic is one of the Republicans' hounds.
CNN asked some undecided voters to dial a number if they were told something promising: the mediator found outstanding consensus when candidates were tough on the border issue.
The liveliest and longest debate was between Rudy Giuliani, the national leader, and Romney, who was advancing in crucial primaries in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani is trying to change his perception of being too frivolous on illegal immigration during his mayoralty of New York.
He accused Romney of hiring illegal immigrants to build his house by the former Massachusetts governor.
The war of words between the two became particularly heated when questioners asked about support for an "amnesty" (which would grant illegal immigrants permanent status and citizenship).
Some candidates with fewer votes, such as Rep. Duncan Hunter of California and Tom Tancredo of Colorado, managed to dig deep into the subject.
And although none of them are considered contenders for the nomination, their stay on the race track may be explained by the fact that they began ringing the immigration bell earlier and louder than the others.
At least on the issue of immigration, there is broad agreement among the candidates: strengthening borders and cracking down on illegal immigrants.
This theme, as well as fears of toxic games in China and other disturbing factors from the outside world, is helping Republicans to forget or minimize divisions between libertarians and Christian conservatives.
However, when other topics came to the fore, the debate became very unpleasant.
Giuliani was faced with the question of why he had previously supported gun control.
John McCain and Romney debated whether simulated drowning should be considered torture.
Another questioner asked if the candidates believed every word of the Bible.
Giuliani stumbled upon this issue, eventually clinging to the view that, although he considered the Bible his favorite book, he might not take the story of Jonah and the Whale literally.
Another question was whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee, who won first place in the recent Iowa election and owed his victory to his steadfast Christian conservatism, responded by saying that the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When asked if Jesus would receive enough support, he laughed and said that Jesus was wiser than to run for election.
The competition remains unusually open.
Huckabee's booming rise in Iowa coincides with libertarian Ron Paul's fundraising campaign and the enthusiastic cheers surrounding him at Wednesday's debate.
The sudden emergence of the two candidates can be explained by the fact that the two wings of the party have not yet managed to launch a joint candidate from among the more well-known and traditional aspirants.
In 1980 and 2000, there was a candidate who united the party, who trumpeted the victory message for America in time and convincingly, and who found common ground with both wings of the party.
Now, however, the party is divided, and the consequences of this are still unforeseeable.
Labour Party pains
Another chasm is gaping for Gordon Brown; The way out remains unchanged
Compared to British political scandals, this one does not seem too piquant.
No one sold his honor, no politician's Paris hotel bills were recovered, no one committed an extramarital scandal.
But the discovery that a wealthy businessman had covertly contributed more than £650,000 ($1.3 million) to Britain's ruling Labour Party for more than four years under the names of others, and that the party failed to report it, is one of the things that the entrenched Gordon Brown would have done without.
Two months ago, when the Prime Minister escaped the election, and when he recklessly questioned the intellectual capacity of the British people with his statement that opinion polls did not influence the outcome of the decision, people were still hoping that Brown would ensure a strong and effective government.
Instead, as Vince Cable, the increasingly witty deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats, noted, the once dreaded Brown has transformed from Stalin into Mr. Bean.
The misstep to bail out Northern Rock, a failing bank, has exposed regulatory weaknesses and lack of judgment.
Sick proposals to change the tax law have encouraged business interest groups to unite against the government.
The loss of personal data of 25 million people by the tax authorities revealed an unimaginable degree of administrative clumsiness.
In the House of Lords, riots were instigated by three retired generals protesting against cuts to the army's budget, declaring that the post of Secretary of State for Defence was a part-time occupation.
And now here are David Abrahams' mysterious gifts; Peter Watt, general secretary of the Labour Party (formerly head of administration), has already resigned.
These accidents don't mean Brown can't turn back on the way to the exit.
At the same time, governments may reach a point after which control becomes impossible.
People don't like politicians and don't trust them, but when a new group comes to power, they usually suspend their disbelief.
However, once it becomes clear that the Prime Minister is unlikely to be fit to move things forward, and perhaps will not remain in his post for long, the suspended disbelief is over: civil servants begin to leak, cabinet ministers begin briefings, the press looks for bad taste news; And the government will go on the defensive and unable to focus.
In a way, Brown is in a particularly difficult position because, unlike other political leaders, he is not considered "fresh blood."
As much as he would like to deny his relationship with Tony Blair, he was his right-hand man.
The problems surrounding Northern Rock and IRS records, for example, relate to decisions Brown made when he was Treasury Secretary.
And while he has not been directly involved in Blair's missteps, such as a protracted investigation into the link between the "nobility for money" issue and political party funding, voters have reason to assume the opposite.
While Brown's situation is indeed unpleasant, it is not as embarrassing as it seems.
The blunders committed are not as frightening as the Toris portray them to be.
As with Mr. Bean, no one died, no one was directly tricked.
And the compensation, however painful it may be, may be the establishment of the trends that Stalin in Brown has always promised: reliable, firm and somewhat heavy-handed government.
A good example is the fuss about political giving.
The turtleneck Abrahams, who compares his donation to charity, said he did not want to reveal his good deed to the public.
Perhaps so, but the decision was not within his competence.
The law prohibiting the anonymity of large political supporters is clear and clearly justified: the population has the right to know who is knocking on the door of the country's rulers.
Watt, who claims to have known about Abrahams' actions but was unaware of its illegal nature, will certainly be sweated during interrogations; as did Jon Medleson, the Labour Party foundation leader, who learned of the muddled donations in October.
But Brown hasn't been linked yet: there's no indication that he knew about these convolutions, not even that the huge sums of money were paid after Brown took office in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has fulfilled half of his duties.
Although he soon condemned the wrongdoing committed by his party, his firmness was diluted by his use of a familiar instrument; For safety's sake, he appointed a committee headed by a retired bishop and a judge to investigate the case.
In this story, the "lesson to learn" is not too complicated.
In case of violation of the law, the police are responsible.
Brown also needs to sort out other things, such as appointing the chair of an independent commission negotiating administrative rules, which has been without a leader for six months, and advancing effective reform of political party funding.
That would require the hard-hatted Labour Party to cooperate with the Tories and break with special financial ties linked to associations - a tough wall for party loyalists Brown.
But he would have to face some facts about the party.
According to polls, the Conservatives currently have a significant lead; Brown has two years to win voters back; The only way to achieve victory is through impeccable integrity and strong competence.
Card sharks
Will the secondary market mortgage crisis threaten America's credit card market?
If blood gets into the water, it is natural for sharks to appear nearby.
Now that the U.S. housing market is weak, predators are focusing on the country's credit card market.
Goldman Sachs analysts believe that if the mortgage crisis infects other forms of retail credit, the credit card market could lose up to $99 billion.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
Both the write-down rate, which shows the rate of bad loans, and the default rate, which indicates the rate of late payments over 30 days, have increased.
HSBC last month announced a $1.4 billion loss in its U.S. consumer finance segment, partly due to financial weakness for cardholders.
At the same time, panic is still early.
The rates of write-offs and late payments remain low.
The 3.89% late payment rate calculated by rating agency Moody's for the third quarter is one percentage point lower than the historical average.
The decrease in rates can be partly explained by technical factors.
The amendment of US individual insolvency rules in 2005 resulted in a sharp decline in the number of insolvency filers and, at the same time, caused large losses in the credit card market; The number of bankruptcy applications (and thus the write-off rate) is expected to increase again, regardless of whether the overall conditions for borrowing deteriorate or not.
The payment rate, which shows the rate of monthly loan repayments of consumers, is also solid in the market.
In addition, confidence in credit card-backed securities is also quite strong, despite paralysis in other areas of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of research firm TowerGroup estimates that emissions in 2007 will be 25% higher than last year.
The signs of the impact of the mortgage crisis on the credit card market are clear: consumers are adding to debt on credit cards to repay home loans.
At the same time, card issuers primarily monitor money flows rather than asset values, so falling house prices do not necessarily trigger changes in borrowers' creditworthiness.
Creditors may even benefit from this situation.
If the property is worth less than the value of the mortgage, the incentive for consumers to repay the loan is reduced; As a result, the repayment of debts on credit cards moves up in the priority ranking.
By changing interest rates or lending limits, card issuers can adapt to changing conditions faster and more flexibly than mortgage lenders.
Theoretically, this should reduce the risk of sudden asset repricing.
"It's unlikely we'll wake up one day to completely revalue loans," says Gary Perlin, chief financial officer at Capital One.
If a subprime-like sudden crisis in the credit card market is less likely, the risk of a gradual downturn is much more present.
If falling housing prices and a decline in lending plunge America into recession, the industry will undoubtedly face a bleak future.
It is worth keeping an eye on those predatory fins.
British bankers pleaded guilty in Enron case
Three British bankers who were tried to investigate their role in the fraud linked to former Enron CFO Andrew Faston pleaded guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew initially pleaded innocent to the charge of fraud allegedly collaborating with Fastow on a secret fraud in 2000 to get rich at their employer's expense.
Their trial began in January.
But at a court hearing before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., each of them pleaded guilty to one count of fraud.
Three former employees of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group's Greenwich NatWest division became known in Britain during the two-year extradition process.
The investigation into the case launched after the collapse of Enron in 2001 has yet to be completed in the United States.
His first indictment against them in 2002 warned Fastow that he was one of the targets of a government investigation into Enron's bankruptcy.
The three brokers, dubbed the "NatWest Triad," are accused of traveling to Houston in 2000 to prepare the scam along with Fastow and Michael Kopper, Fastow's right-hand man at the time.
Fastow, responsible for plotting the numerous scams that bankrupted Enron, also controlled the Enron subsidiary in which Greenwich NatWest invested.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank was unaware of any of its holdings in the subsidiary, but the three British men were well aware that the interest was very large.
A company controlled by Kopper bought the bank's $1 million stake in the subsidiary.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 to acquire a stake in the company.
According to the indictment, Fastow falsely informed Enron that the energy company was buying the $20 million subsidiary stake from Greenwich NatWest.
But in reality, the $20 million went to British bankers Fastow and others.
The lawsuit claims bankers received $7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others received $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty to two counts of his role in the Enron crash.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is currently serving a six-year sentence in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is serving a three-year and one-month sentence in a Texarkana prison.
The three British men were allowed to travel to the United States on $1 million bail each, where they are staying during the trial.
Enron, the seventh-largest U.S. company ever, filed for bankruptcy in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks could no longer cover up millions of debts and businesses that were pretended to be profitable but actually loss-making.
The collapse has destroyed thousands of jobs, reduced market value by more than $60 billion and reduced the value of pension funds by more than $2 billion.
Kenneth Lay, founder of Enron, and former CEO Jeffrey Sizing were convicted last year of complicity in the company's bankruptcy.
Skilling is currently serving a more than 24-year prison sentence.
The conspiracy, fraud and other charges imposed on Lay ceased with his death last year.
No poverty in Moscow
A Gulfstream G550 aircraft equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine that will make the uninterrupted journey from Moscow to Los Angeles with one tank starts at $54 million.
But for some Russian rich, this amount is only small money.
"It can hold 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a representative for Gulfstream.
"But no one orders so many seats because the machines are purchased for private families or business leaders."
Mr. Firer was expecting visitors to attend the four-day, exclusive Millionaires' Fair, which took place in a huge exhibition hall around the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury goods suppliers rented booths at the show, hoping that Russia's new rich would be interested in everything from mahogany-clad yachts to diamond-clad radiator grilles worth 50 cents.
Mr. Firer watched carefully at the bright orange Porsche on display at the booth next to him.
"It's a nice car, but it doesn't match our products," he said.
"Russia has the largest market for private jets after the United States."
The Russian capital seems to be swimming in money like Dallas did in its heyday when oil prices exploded.
"We went through a similar process in the 1890s when some American millionaires went to Europe. These Americans were seen here as materialistic," said Marshall Goldman, a senior fellow at Harvard University's Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies.
Like the gamblers in Saudi Arabia in the 1970s and Japan in the 1990s, Russians have now emerged as the world's most spectacular spenders.
The most exclusive luxury brands are claiming their share of the gold rush.
At another conference organized by the luxury industry at another Moscow location, Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, president of LVMH, shared their views on how to sell high-value products in markets like Russia.
(The conference was organized by The International Herald Tribune, owned by The New York Times.)
According to Forbes' list of the richest people, there are 53 billionaires living in Russia with a total of $ 282 billion.
In addition, the number of second-class Russian millionaires reaches 103,000 with a total of $670 billion, according to a study of personal well-being developments in the former Soviet Union conducted by economists at the Center for Economic and Financial Research.
(According to World Bank data, in 2005 the number of people living below the subsistence level in Russia was 15.8 percent.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow, that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative at London's David Morris jewellery store.
Nicole participated in the fair for the first time with the brand's Russian distributor, Soho Jewelry Group.
"Women are all impeccably groomed, and men are a veritable treasure trove."
Two real estate agents in evening dresses, 21-year-old Evgenia Yumatova and 26-year-old Svetlana Turovtsova, who wandered around the halls on Sunday evening, attributed both themselves and their clients to millionaires.
"I've been looking at cars and trying to decide between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said the young Yumatova, who cheekily wore her custom-designed outfit, as if she had become accustomed to this hype.
The fair was primarily for the newly-rich, for brand-oriented Russian shoppers willing to wander around a draughty, fancy decorated venue after several hours in traffic, where they can find Cadillac Escaleds, platinum pocket knives, Mövenpick ice cream, ordinary billiard tables, Dubai apartments and Gund teddy bears all at once.
For average people, an entrance ticket costs €30 ($44.57).
"Russians like to know which brands are the most expensive and the best," said Mr Gijrath, who took a patriotic seat at the stand of Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft, opposite a wall-sized, hand-decorated imitation Rembrandt painted on blue tile.
"Of course, Russians are more interested in striking things."
Indeed, sellers here have said that long-time wealthy Russians (10-15 years by Russian standards) have already switched from blatant logos to small, limited-edition brands that wouldn't make it to a trade fair.
Yet thousands of people, including millionaires, millionaire trustees and tourists, packed the town every day.
And some of them bought.
On the first day of the show, last Thursday, Roman Ershov, director of King Koil bed company, said he sold two mattresses made of silk, cashmere and cotton woven with gold thread worth $70,000 each.
Also on the evening of the first day, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales associate at A1 Moto, a company engaged in providing high-quality cars with modern alarms, reported that his company sold the bright orange Porsche to a Russian millionaire for $ 170,000.
Andrei Karapetian, president of custom-made luxury car maker L.A. Connection, sold three grilles for Rolls-Royce Phantoms by Sunday afternoon. The grilles resemble interconnected chain bracelets and cost $ 55 thousand each.
He also showed reporters a wheel made for a Russian casino owner, which he said Swarovski coated with crystals to make it look like a roulette wheel.
The price of a set of four pieces: 22 thousand dollars.
"A Russian millionaire who wants wheels made of ostrich skin or a picture of his wife's face made of zirconium cubes will not necessarily use these items," Karapetian said.
"Instead, he will keep them in his garage with 30 to 40 cars."
Despite the fact that many of his Russian clients are wealthy, Karapetian says the term "Russian millionaire" is not a privilege nowadays, given the rapid rise in real estate prices there.
"Anyone who bought real estate in Moscow four or five years ago is now most likely a millionaire, if not in money, then at least on paper," he said.
"There are more of them than you think."
Those who are not millionaires could at least give the appearance of wealth in front of the stand of Russian asset management company Alliance Continental.
The company built four English-style telephone booths that were littered with millions of counterfeit dollar bills.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing manager, said his team printed 500,000 counterfeit banknotes for the Millionaires' Fair.
Many of the visitors stopped to play with the money. Many people had photographs of themselves with mobile phones lying around in the pile of money or just pocketing a few million.
"You see, everyone in Moscow can feel like a millionaire," Karryev said.
Surgical malpractice suspected behind death in New Jersey
The day before Thanksgiving, Ronald Livingston looked out the flat-glass window of "Just a Little Healthier" and saw an ambulance stop on Cape Cod two doors down West Scott Avenue.
A short time later, a police patrol car arrived.
Then another.
"Then I saw the doctor's car stop," Mr Livingston, one of the restaurant's supervisors, said Wednesday.
"That's when I knew someone had died."
Authorities learned that the dead woman was 41 years old and her name was Olga Arroyo. The woman previously worked as a senior assistant to the director of the Newark Police Department.
An investigation is ongoing to determine whether the death was caused by an intervention performed by an unlicensed cosmetic surgeon working at 212 West Scott Avenue who has not been identified by police.
Authorities have not yet been able to determine what caused Arroya's death, but they hope toxicology test results, which will be available in a few weeks, will shed light on this mysterious death that has left senior Newark police officers deeply painful.
Arroyo, whose voice was known to many in the department, had worked as an assistant to police director Garry F. McCarthy since September 2006.
"He was loyal, hardworking and reliable," McCarthy said of Arroyo in a telephone interview Wednesday.
". He was my watchdog.
He was my protector."
McCarthy said Ms. Arroyo was married to Jimmy Arroyo, a former New York police officer and now serving on the Liquor Control Commission, leaving behind two boys, 14, 11, and a stepdaughter.
Union County Attorney Theodore J. Romankow's spokeswoman Eileen Walsh said investigators are working to determine whether Ms. Arroyo was the victim of an unlicensed surgeon's procedure.
"There's a possibility," Walsh said.
"The investigation is ongoing."
According to authorities, they arrived at the house around 3 p.m. in November
On the 21st, he and Mrs. Arroyo were found on the couch.
He was pronounced dead already at the scene.
More than a week has passed, and police have revealed very little about the investigation and the owner of the house, Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh did not say whether Castro had been interviewed by investigators.
Study participants are researching whether part of the house functioned as a doctor's office.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door to Castro's home, where a wilted rose bush stood in the narrow front garden and a Dalmatian barked from the back of the house.
Next to the door leading to the cellar, in the driveway, stood a blue container with the inscription "Ethyl Vanilin", which is used as a substitute for vanilla in food and perfumes.
Two mountain bikes hung from hooks turned sideways.
McCarthy recalled that when he first arrived in Newark after 25 years in the New York Police Department, Ms. Arroyo was an invaluable help to him by helping him navigate the new city's unusual and unpolished political culture.
"He always said, 'You'd better be careful with this and that!'" he remembered.
"He was always here when I arrived in the morning and he was always inside when I left in the evening.
It was embarrassing."
Expectations of a Fed rate cut will lead to a surge in world stock markets
Stock prices on both sides of the Atlantic jumped yesterday after reassuring statements by the US central bank deputy governor boosted hopes that the Fed will seek to ease investment opportunities by cutting interest rates further.
Stock markets in London, New York and across Europe rallied after Donald Kohn, who is Fed Chair Ben Bernanke's right-hand man, said leaders needed to respond "flexibly and pragmatically" to the ongoing turmoil in financial markets.
While Kohn had a clear goal of calming markets amid signs of a resurgent credit crunch, he stated that the current turmoil "partly hindered the market progress made in late September and October."
He said that if the heightened turmoil continued, it could increase the possibility of further cuts on credit conditions for households and companies.
The statements were interpreted by investors to mean that the Fed was ready to inject fresh capital into US markets or even further rate cuts to stabilize credit conditions.
The statements also calmed Wall Street, which has recently received some bad news for the US economy. Such was the case with the negative record of U.S. home sales.
The side effect of the financial turmoil was compounded by the announcement by investment bank Bear Stearns that it would lay off 650 workers or 4 percent of its global workforce as part of cost cuts to offset losses in the U.S. secondary market home loan sector.
A total of 20 workplaces at the London headquarters, which employs 1500 people, will be affected by this measure.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average index rose 331 points, or 2.55 percent, to close at 13,289.40 points, while the broader S&P 500 index rose 2.65 percent.
London's FTSE 100 index rose 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent, to close at 6,306.2, adding more than £39 to British blue-chip companies.
Germany's Dax rose 2.6 percent and France's CAC40 rose 2.3 percent.
The turmoil in the credit market was renewed after a high-demand auction organised by the European Central Bank sent three-month securities to European banks at a price of 4.7%, the highest since April 2001.
After the UK interbank interest rate, Libor, reached its highest level since September at 6.59%, after a steady increase after Nov. 12, the Bank of England came under increasing pressure to follow the Fed and ECB and release additional capital into the London money market.
England demands decision between Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Given two dilemmas, one more complicated than the other.
Who should own the England team six shirt in Kandy, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And in indirect connection with the first test against Sri Lanka, it is no less important who makes the decision.
The latter question is topical in part because David Graveney, chairman of the selectors, who will take on this particular role on an interim basis, is assisting head coach Peter Moores and captain Michael Vaughan in making a decision. On the other hand, because the desk drawer of England managing director Hugh Morris is starting to fill up with applications for a national, or at least one-off, selection post.
Of the two players, the one that does not get the sixth batting place draws the shorter, but as is well known, life, and especially sports, is often unfair.
It is never easy to say what makes someone reach the pinnacle of their profession when others cannot even reach a lower level. Many times this depends more on luck than talent.
It is not only characteristic of cricket that it is difficult to select, often on subjective grounds.
Is it time for Bopara to move forward?
Is it fair to Shah if this happens?
The same question could arise in other areas of life, for example, if John Edwards and "Tubby" Banerjee, two smart, highly educated young executives with a good knowledge of the business, were put in front of decision-makers, while there is room for only one of them.
Who can tell which level a cricketer belongs to without being thrown into deep water in a more serious competition?
Of course, data greatly influences the decision, but equally important are the options.
In a team, a player must catch the captain's gaze in the cricket goal at the right moment, and a batsman must regularly get a chance if he wants to become a great player once.
Catching the gaze of pickers is much more complicated.
James Anderson, for example, played better than several players last season, but he is still a solid member of the team in the first test, despite Stephen Harmison saying he is in good shape and hitting very well.
Anderson earned his place on tour with 32 first-class goalposts and 33 runs.
Chris Tremlett has only knocked down 29, but both have had successful moments at the highest level and hope to continue to do so in the future.
Whether Shah or Bopara will play at Asgiriya Stadium will be decided based on the opinions.
This decision could disrupt or disrupt anyone's career, but it might not have a particular impact on the future.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every test and performed well with five goals and 40 useful runs, but it was the then-emerging Paul Collingwood who stood out and became a defining test cricketer who is perhaps still underestimated today, despite scoring a double hundred against Australia against Australia.
It is likely that in their meeting at Asgiriya Stanion during today's game, Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, listening to their conservative intuition, will opt for Shah's greater experience over Bopara's young vitality and dynamism.
There are arguments in favour of both.
Shah is supported by his bright and successful debut in the quarters of the '88 Bombay test. Compared to Bopara six, 22, who is seven years younger than him, and who is also excellent at twisted throws, he scored 32 first-class hundreds.
But the fact that Middlesex player Shah only ran ten in two quarters in a test at home in Lorda in May, and the fact that Vaughan, who was fighting for him again in the next game, faced immediate resistance from selectors, seems to have diminished the tenacity that was clearly visible in Bombay.
In contrast to him, Essex's universal talent is a lively and unsurpassed player.
Nothing can upset him on the cricket ground, but his off-track attitude was well illustrated when he overturned a four-wheeler of the team's car sponsor, Volkswagen, at an exhibition.
He sustained minor injuries and was presumably shocked. However, the first thing he did afterwards was pick up his (sponsored, of course) Vodafone phone and call teammate Alastair Cook, who was watching him from a distance, to ask, "Did you see that?"
Bopara is a better sideline player with class. With his sliding medium steps, he creates an advantageous throwing angle, and his strokes are confident and skillful.
Choosing the right person is one thing, and choosing the right moment is another.
Perhaps this is the real art of selection.
Personally, I would give Bopara a chance now, which is not to say that I don't think Shah wouldn't excel if, as Ceylon tea leaves suggest, he was the one who plays on weekends.
Buses are used to transport refugees home to work and fight al Qaeda
Since yesterday, the first buses have arrived in Baghdad from Syria with Iraqi refugees who have run out of money or have expired visas, or even those hoping that order has been restored in the city.
Some of them returned to fight the soldiers who drove them out of their houses.
The Mansour bus station was already full of refugees returning from Syria and Jordan before a government convoy of 800 people from Damascus loaded dozens of buses arrived.
"I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad," Sunni doctor Sabah al-Qubaisi said.
"I came back today because I saw on TV and in the newspapers what happened in Baghdad and that the city is now safe.
"They say the Mahdi army has stopped killing people," he added, referring to militia pastor Moqtada al-Sadr, who has now shut down his Shiite army.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite teacher from the predominantly Sunni city of Amariyah, returned home with her two children after failing to renew her Syrian visa and because the regime there prevented Iraqis from working.
Amariya Shia's neighbors phoned him urging him to return home, saying U.S.-backed troops helped push al-Qaeda out of their bastion west of the capital.
One of the first to arrive from Jordan was a Sunni and Shiite tribal leader who fled his home in Sleikh, northern Baghdad, after a grenade attack after inciting fellow citizens to fight al-Qaeda.
He came back to fight.
"Two days ago, my friends called me and told me that they had set up an anti-al Qaeda militia in Sleikh and needed my support and that of my sons.
That's why I came back today," said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many spoke of how peace in the capital has strengthened since the entry of US troops and armed civilian forces cooperating with the Americans have lured them home.
But even more were forced to return home from Damascus due to visa and financial problems.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51, a mother of three, voiced a widespread view among refugees that Shiite Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki asked the Syrian government to reject visas, forcing them to return home.
More than two and a half million people are believed to have fled death squads operating in the country.
"Everything was fine until al-Maliki visited Syria and pressured the government to stop issuing visas to Iraqis so that they could move home," the Sunni pensioner said.
"I can't trust a government that supports criminals who burned down my house after I fled."
One reason for the easing of violence is that Sunnis have been driven out of Shia areas, while Shias have also left Sunni-populated areas. As a result, tensions have decreased in many areas.
Many fear that the sudden appearance of refugees will upset things again, which could lead to new fights.
Little Saarland - high-quality training
The smallest federal province is a leader in vocational training, and its higher education is internationally accustomed.
Only in one area of training do Saarlanders struggle with the same deficiency as the rest of the country.
"Yesterday I explained for the fiftieth time to a non-Saarland that we are not French," is the self-ironic slogan he proclaims on his posters on the occasion of the 50th birthday of the smallest federal province.
At the same time, France and Luxembourg play an important role in the education system of the Saarland, which boasts fifth place according to surveys by the German Economic Institute (IW) in Cologne.
In this way, higher education institutions work closely with neighbouring countries, if only because of tradition.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded by the French in 1948.
To this day, students here can complete their studies with a double or even triple degree.
Accordingly, with 15.6 percent, the proportion of foreign hearers is high.
However, Saarland colleges and universities are also above average for those who want to study in the Saarland, many of whom do not have a secondary education.
"In the Saarland, vocational training is being exploited," explains Axel Plünnecke, an education expert at the German Economic Institute.
More than a fifth of young people qualify for further education at vocational schools, putting the Saarland more than seven percent above the federal average.
The possibilities of combining vocational and higher education are also well developed.
The infrastructure for dual studies ranks second in Germany in terms of population.
However, despite practice-oriented training and growing interest, the number of graduate engineers has decreased by a third in recent years.
The Saarland Ministry of Education has therefore ordered higher education institutions to launch a marketing campaign focused on engineering.
"We have initiated a number of reforms in primary schools following the first Pisa study," a spokesman for the education ministry said.
Therefore, the government has introduced comparative tests nationwide.
To help children start learning earlier, the last year of kindergarten is free of charge. This is a model that has since begun to be copied by other federal provinces.
Whether pupils' performance improves permanently will only be answered by future comparative studies.
According to the Pisa survey conducted in 2003, the proportion of pupils at risk fell from 29% to 20%.
Overall, however, the Saarland's performance has not improved as much as that of other Länder.
Bavarians count better.
Much to the annoyance of the Saarlanders, foreign language skills are not taken into account in the Pisa survey - otherwise they could otherwise reap laurels in this area.
After all, the languages of neighbouring countries are compulsory subjects in grammar schools - even if Saarlanders are not French.
Chavez changes the clocks
In the near future, classes in Venezuela will be different than in the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chavez turns back the timers by half an hour in the Latin American country.
Meanwhile, Chavez was ridiculed in Spain.
According to Venezuela's official newspaper, a new law will turn clocks back four and a half hours compared to Greenwich time.
In this way, the South American state becomes part of a time zone that is not used in any other country in the world.
The anti-US Chavez justified his decision on the grounds that time zones based on whole hours were imposed on the world by the United States.
Chavez also announced on Wednesday (local time) that he was severing ties with neighboring Colombia over a hostage incident.
The left-wing nationalist politician stated that as long as conservative Alvaro Uribe remains president of Colombia, he will have no contact with either the head of state or the Colombian government.
"I can't do this out of my own dignity," said Chávez, who is pushing for constitutional reform that the oil country's citizens will have to vote on in a referendum on Sunday.
With the reform, he would significantly build up his power in the country.
The controversy stemmed from Uribe's decision to revoke Chávez's mandate to negotiate the release of hostages with Colombian Marxist rebels.
Uribe "spat in the face" of Venezuela with his decision, Chavez said in his criticism on Sunday.
In Spain, too, everyone is talking about Chávez.
A new mobile ringtone has caught the eye in the country: "Por qué no te callas" (Why Don't You Shut Your Mouth) - this is the phrase that more than half a million people have already downloaded for themselves from the Internet.
The phrase comes from John Charles, King of Spain, who at the last Latin America summit was so upset by the constant interjections of the populist politician from the left that he cut him off.
In 2007, Germans threaten to fall in wages
According to one forecast, German workers are threatened with a fall in real wages this year, despite strong economic activity.
Experts have backed up their pessimistic forecast with a host of reasons.
According to the calculations of the Hans-Bröckler Foundation, employees will actually receive less pay in 2007 than in the previous year.
"This is due to modest wage developments, increased value added tax and rapid increases in food and energy prices," Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomic and Economic Research told Bild.
Unemployment insurance may also place additional burdens on workers.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told the newspaper "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" that it is right and reasonable to reduce unemployment insurance to 3.3 percent at the start of the new year.
In any case, the German Federal Labour Agency should not be put in such a difficult position to apply to the federation for loans or subsidies, the politician of Germany's Social Democratic Party (SPD) was quoted as saying.
On Tuesday, it became known that the explosion in food and mineral oil prices resulted in the highest inflation in 13 years.
On a year-on-year basis, prices increased by a total of 3 percent.
Venus is Earth's diabolical twin
Despite Venus' harsh atmosphere, it is more similar to Earth than previously thought: In its atmosphere, the European "Venus Express" spacecraft discovered lightning, and in its polar circles wind vortices similar to those that form on Earth in winter.
For nearly three decades, scientists have assumed that Venus is thunderbolted.
Europe's Venus Express spacecraft has provided evidence - it has discovered electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere: Lightning on Venus travels from cloud to cloud at an altitude of about 56 kilometers, reports Christpher Russell of the University of California, Los Angeles in the journal Nature.
According to the famous "primordial soup theory", the formation of life on Earth was caused by lightning: According to the theory, thunderstorms triggered reactions in the ocean that led to the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
Not so on Venus: "If life ever existed there, it must have been in very early times," explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington, D.C.
At present, hardly any living organism can exist on the surface of Venus: The atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, and temperature values sometimes reach 500 degrees.
"Venus may be Earth's hellish twin, but it's still her twin," Russell said.
The main question of the ESA mission is why Venus, so similar in mass and size to Earth, is on a completely different evolutionary path.
The launch of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milestone in Venus exploration, because since the early nineties, no probe has been on its way specifically to search for this planet.
The latest findings, presented in several Nature articles, prove not only Venus' uniqueness within the solar system, according to the researchers.
"They also point out that the similarity of the neighboring planet to Earth is greater than first assumed," Esa said.
In addition to the known Arctic whirlwind, the researchers also discovered an even faster moving cloud vortex at the South Pole.
The phenomenon is reminiscent of air currents in Earth's winter hemisphere, according to a team led by Giuseppe Piccioni of Italy's Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second innermost planet in the solar system has almost the same mass as Earth, and at 12,100 kilometers in diameter, it is almost the size of Earth.
Also called the Evening Star, it orbits the Sun in just 225 days.
however, it turns around its own tenge much more slowly: One Venus day lasts 243 Earth days.
Although Venus' surface temperature of 460 degrees Celsius coupled with a pressure of 92 bar is barely reminiscent of Earth, scientists assume that both planets formed under completely similar conditions.
Both of them accumulated water, which remained on Earth as an ocean, while on Venus it left for the universe.
And while on Earth carbon dioxide is trapped in carbonate rocks, on Venus it makes up a large part of the atmosphere.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama
German President Köhler is demanding an end to the cross-party dispute over the reception of the Dalai Lama in the chancellery.
He indirectly criticised the SPD for attacking the chancellor after the reception in September.
German President Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany's prestige and has called on the grand coalition to end the controversy surrounding the reception of the Dalai Lama.
"On this issue, we should not present ourselves to the outside world as a divided nation," Köhler told the Handelsblatt newspaper.
At the same time, Köhler expressed his understanding that Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) received the Dalai Lama in September.
"For me, human rights are universally valid, even if I respect intercultural diversity," Köhler said.
Everyone is aware that Germany must pay attention to the delicate balance in foreign policy, the President stressed; but Merkel came to Merkel's defence against accusations that the chancellor would pursue a new China policy.
"The Federal Chancellor has not broken with the traditional 'One China' policy.
China is aware of this," Köhler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) has indirectly expressed his displeasure with the Dalai Lama's reception and has therefore come under attack within the ranks of the EU.
Among other things, Steinmeier complained about the EU's "window policy" in foreign policy.
Following the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellery Office, German-Chinese relations were seriously disturbed.
Thus, the Chinese leadership not only cancelled the invitation of German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but also, according to SPIEGEL's information, froze the so-called Strategic Dialogue between the foreign ministries of the two countries.
Chinese President Wen Jiabao has now called on Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel to admit that receiving the Dalai Lama was a mistake.
China refuses to allow European politicians to accept Tibetans' religious leaders in their official capacity, Wen Jiabao reaffirmed China's position.
The actions and words of the Dalai Lama showed that he was trying to separate Tibet and other Tibetan territories from China, including present-day provinces.
Schäuble warns against riots similar to those in France
Street clashes with police, gunshots, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against riots similar to those in France.
Everything must be done to prevent social unrest in Germany from turning into street violence, demands the Federal Minister of the Interior.
Barricades ablaze, rioters fired shotguns at police: After serious riots among young people in France, Federal Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears similar developments in Germany.
"We have to make sure that social explosives do not accumulate in our country and do not turn into violence.
We have to take it seriously," he told the Neue Presse, a newspaper published in Hanover.
Not all young people are navigating the rapid changes in social reality.
Associations, provinces and communities are currently working intensively to resolve problematic cases, Schäuble said.
This does not only concern the integration of immigrants.
"From the Integration Summit to the Islamic Conference, we are already seeing the first successes."
However, it is still too early to resolve the emergency.
At the same time, Schäuble pointed out that the German suburbs do not have the same problems of urban design and sociology as in France.
In the northern suburbs of Paris, young people have engaged in heavy street fights with police in recent nights.
In Toulouse, too, cars and public buildings were ablaze.
With this in mind, Kenan Kolat, head of the Turkish Communities in Germany, demanded greater activity from the federal government in terms of integration.
In connection with the unrest in France, Kolat warned of the "dangers of imitation".
Although the situation in Germany is not as delicate as in France,
Still, action is necessary.
Kolat pointed out that the unemployment rate among young people under 25 from immigrant families is "higher than average".
First and foremost, more educational places should be provided.
Kolat emphasized: "We need to provide perspective for young people."
However, the leader of the Turkish Community added that "social supervision within the family" is much more present in Germany than in France.
In addition, many young people from immigrant families do not want to destroy what their parents built here.
Kolat warns: "Nevertheless, we must be on our guard."
Young people "must be given the opportunity to have a job and an education as quickly as possible".
Meanwhile, in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel, complete calm prevailed during the night.
Hundreds of police officers were ready for action, and a helicopter scanned the area with its headlights.
Competent authorities reported three arrests and some burning bins and cars.
Since the report, a security unit of around 1,000 people has provided peace of mind.
Police will be ready to intervene for as long as necessary, Home Secretary Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after a visit to the suburbs.
During the night of Tuesday, around 80 police officers were wounded as a result of riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The next night, the riots spread to Toulouse.
The riots erupted in connection with a traffic accident in which two young people lost their lives on Sunday.
According to initial findings from the state prosecutor's office, the police were not responsible for the deaths of the youth.
Cloud walker in Angela's realm
The Chancellor's unrealistic stance is proof that the coalition is coming to an end - and nothing can be expected of him either.
In which country does the Federal Chancellor actually live?
Following his bleak, content-neutral and meaningless action in the general debate of the Bundestag, it must be stated that he does not live here - not in the country whose government it is his job.
Angela Merkel rejected the accusation that she was too focused on foreign policy with a very commanding sentence.
This is provincial, he replied, expressing only that he does not want to understand what his critics are talking about.
At the Federal Assembly, he made it clear to everyone how apt the reproaches were.
Meanwhile, there was neither concrete interest nor empathy for the country's problems.
Instead, Angela Cloud Walker emerged: a politician who is far removed from reality and flees into foreign policy, where uncertainty is her own.
The example of climate protection: He praises himself unbridled for the Heiligendamm Resolutions, but is silent about how climate goals should be achieved in the country.
At all, as far as self-praise is concerned, such immodesty would not have been allowed by the CDU president two years earlier.
Now he clings to the phrase that prosperity has a positive effect on people.
In doing so, he damages his reputation as a pragmatic personality who provides solutions to problems instead of word flowers.
In Angela's realm, however, domestic political problems are only incidental.
Child poverty and the problems of low-income people?
He praises this for only a few half-sentences.
It is telling from this point of view how often he slips his tongue when it comes to child benefit.
Merkel has to make three starts to come up with a sentence that is half-sane.
When it comes to specifics, he stumbles into foreign territory.
Seizure Department
During the debate of the Republican presidential candidates on YouTube, there was a tough exchange of blows between the two favourites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney - and now they also have to fear an outsider candidate.
The tension of the candidates surfaced over the first topic.
Mitt Romney accuses his opponent, Rudy Giuliani, of turning New York into a "haven for illegal immigrants."
For his part, he contradicts serious facts: "I would say that his own house was a refuge for illegal immigrants," Giuliani retorts, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of privately employing undocumented immigrants.
Candidates go on a run: With the Republican camp still lacking a uniformly supported favorite, the eight presidential contenders are using the CNN debate primarily to undermine their opponent's credibility.
The self-shot 30-second videos submitted by internet users via Youtube are little more than short summaries.
"This is the kind of isolationism we are using to bring Hitler to power," John McCain rubs under the nose of his opponent, Ron Paul, who is the only one in the circle to demand an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney is also thoroughly washed by the Vietnam veteran when he is reluctant to condemn so-called "Waterboarding," a method of interrogation simulating drowning, as torture.
That the campaign's important themes lie beyond Iraq and the torture debate is demonstrated by the reaction of the audience in St. Petersburg, Florida.
There is loud applause in the Chamber praising conservative values and rejecting future tax increases.
Meanwhile, the weaknesses of the two candidates are becoming more and more apparent.
"I was wrong at the time," Romney says remorsefully, apologizing to supporters and television viewers for opting for abortion back in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, falters when asked for his opinion on a literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf governs as civilian for the first time
A day after his resignation from the army, Musharraf, who wields power in Pakistan, was sworn in as president.
This marks the end of eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf was sworn in for a further five-year term on Thursday.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live from the capital, Islamabad's presidential palace.
Musharraf swore an oath to the constitution and to act for the good of his people.
On Wednesday, he handed over his military leadership office to his confidant, Ashfaq Kiyani, yielding to international pressure, particularly from the United States.
Eight years after coming to power in a military coup without bloodshed, the former general is ruling as a civilian head of state for the first time.
By stepping down as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf has fulfilled a fundamental demand of the West and the opposition.
Another important demand is the lifting of the state of emergency, which Musharraf declared on November 3.
Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum said Musharraf would lift the state of emergency shortly after he was sworn in, fulfilling another demand by the West.
The country's Supreme Court, which Musharraf installed sympathetic lawyers in early November after declaring a state of emergency, rejected any protests last week over the president's controversial re-election on October 6.
Meanwhile, an attack on a military convoy in North Waziristan, a tribal area in the north, killed five soldiers and injured four others.
According to an army spokesman, the bomb exploded on a road near the border with Afghanistan.
The fathers of krautrock return
The German supergroup of the seventies is playing again: Three band members of Harmonia dusted off their instruments again for a concert in Berlin.
The re-reunion will feature a cut from their heyday, "Live 1974".
Already at that time they were much better known abroad.
The announced sensation is embodied in the person of the three settled gentlemen sitting around the dinner table.
In front of each is his own instrument, his own cable and, above all, his own buttons.
At 63 years old, Dieter Moebius is enthroned in a snow-white shirt in the middle.
From the left, Michael Rother, 57 years young, provides accompaniment with a laptop and guitar.
Seen from the audience to the right, 73-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius crouches down and concentrates on the console.
Each of them produces some kind of noise, while also creating a rhythm once in a while.
And sometimes all this comes together into traditional music as if by accident.
However, all this does not seem to particularly bother the gentlemen themselves.
It was a great excitement for fans of krautrock music that the band Harmonia is playing again.
What we can tell you here: After proper research, we can conclude that the name has slipped through the collective pop memory, but it has by no means left such a lasting mark that we will miss this band painfully after 32 years.
But why shouldn't Germans also celebrate the living legends of their seventies?
Especially since what we misleadingly call krautrock has always been valued more in England and America than in its own country.
When the music industry awarded the Echo Award for lifetime achievement to surviving members of the Cologne-based band Can in 2003, German pop figures sat in the hall with puzzled faces.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers lauded La Düsseldorf and Neu! He also thanked bands, and the amazement was boundless.
At the concerts, Michael Rother sat on stage with the Red Hot Chili Peppers as an old pal.
Domestic rejection and foreign acceptance are two sides of the same coin.
Harmonia overwhelms memory because the trio only existed for two years, during which time it had far less impact than others subsequently attributed to it.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously played with artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster.
Initially, they played in the basement under Berlin's Schaubühne theater.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons, to a record company funded by the Church.
Rother briefly helped Kraftwerk, along with perhaps the most radical German band at the time, Neu! He made a name for himself as a guitarist.
Around 1973, however, Rother followed the Cluster musicians into exile in Forst, Weserbergland.
There, in Alter Weserhof, they lived in a 16th-century Ruin as communards who had fled the city.
Less ideologizingly than in Commune I, where Roedelius was still babysitting.
Their life is rather idyllic being an artist.
Allegedly, the flag of the Harmonia Ottenstein song spear was recovered from the rubbish and this is how they found a name for their art.
Some of these things were recorded by Harmonia.
The first album is called "Musik von Harmonia" and the next is called "De Luxe".
Despite its laid-back and modest music, the band was in financial need.
Collecting deer alone did not ensure self-discovery.
The CD, titled "Live 1974", was recorded at a concert in Griessem in front of a record audience of just under 50 people, as one remembers.
Forcing Harmonia and practicing occasionally was Rother's idea at the time.
For Roedelius and Moebius, this is an immoral demand.
The band announced their dissolution in 1975.
Rother ended up in esotericism and supported himself from albums such as "Flammende Herzen".
Cluster was revived in the eighties, which has since become more successful than Harmonia ever was.
The live album from Grissemi is thanks to Herbert Grönemeyer.
His record company, Greenland, set out to nurture krautrock as a unique German addition to live music.
As part of this, Neu! was dug up in the same way as Roedelius's solo work.
The resurrection of Harmonia takes place in Berlin's House of Cultures.
From public funds, within the framework of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope, British proto-spunk and author of the manual "Krautrock Sampler", is also present.
Loveparade's creator, Dr. Motte, is also present.
All of this roughly outlines Krautrock's influence on the next pop music era.
In this regard, Harmonia fills the vacant space reserved for the superteam.
Brian Eno's statement floats around the room with the most unusual sounds: "The only true music, he owns the future."
There are pictures depicting the producer in a room of a farmhouse with Harmonia.
Further black-and-white photographs of tangled wiring equipment are projected to build legend.
In the foreground, the three veterans are back to improvising.
This simply means attaching microphones to the organ and drum kit with the intention of extracting sound effects that have not yet been heard using devices that produce sound effects of their own making.
Today, electric music looks like electric music.
Three DIYers with a deep understanding of technology.
Even the cottage choir doesn't change that.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, they cough and kiss and, at one beautiful part, empathize with "Aaaaaaaaah!" is sung.
After all, krautrock has always been a very anglicized concept.
It was never about rock.
Roots were less sought in blues than in music colleges (Can), technical skills (Kraftwerk), or escape from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
If someone here is "'68!" , he's not completely on the wrong track, and even now Harmonia won't let itself be shaken out of its calm.
Even the most self-evident thing is carefully thought out on stage.
Where does music begin and where does it end?
This can grind you nervously or give you fleeting moments of exceptional luck.
Richard Gere is simply not cynical enough
Through "The Hunt" and "Mörderischer Frieden", two films repeatedly deal with the Balkan war.
However, none of them are convincing.
The basic idea is either too focused on action and shooting, or too sentimental.
Even Richard Gere himself can't help this in "The Hunt."
First, the good news: Although war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the Balkan mountains, it was there, in the dark hinterland of the Bosnian War, that actor Richard Gere was found again.
Lately, we've lost sight of the most beautiful man of the eighties, as his many good-guy-to-nothing roles in emotional films for women and the many press conferences on Buddhism have discouraged us from even looking at him.
And lo and behold, Richard Gere is suddenly the most compelling argument for watching "The Hunt" after all.
He gives a wonderful, smiling performance: Basically, his role as war correspondent Simon Hunt is exactly what Gere could have become if fate and the film industry hadn't been so kind to him: A man who had long since left his best years behind, but still retained much of his former appeal as a ruined monument to his decline.
However, even with this trump card, the film "The Hunt" and the German production "Mörderischer Frieden", which began screening this week, continue only an endless series of failed films about the Balkan war.
The film "Mörderischer Frieden" does not need to waste many words: The film is about two German soldiers serving in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who rescue a Serbian woman from snipers in Kosovo, and one of them suddenly falls in love with her.
While it is welcome that for once Serbs are not portrayed as the sole cause of all evil, the film with the shallowness of TV movies gets lost too quickly in shooting and eventful scenes.
It has the character of "Cobra 11" - with war instead of highway.
In contrast, in the case of "The Hunt", it is exemplary why no really good film about the Balkan war has ever been made.
The story of three U.S. war correspondents who set out to track down a Serbian war criminal named "The Fox" with a different director and screenwriter (both in Richard Shepard's personal union) might have become a new "Apocalypse Now" in a different era.
After all, the stories have a striking similarity: In both cases, small groups set out into the woods to accomplish what the army can't do — and in both cases, this leads to a journey to madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunt" is that he simply doesn't let Simon Hunt be the depraved cynic he portrays him to be at the beginning.
No, and in the script, he even spends a romantic affair with a Muslim Bosnian woman who was later murdered.
"The Hunt" finally slips away when, in the final five minutes of the film, reporters achieve in accelerated footage what NATO, the CIA and all the bounty hunters around the world have not been able to do in five years: They capture the war criminal and hand him over to the Muslim Bosniaks for just revenge.
This is so bad that one would prefer to go to the International Criminal Tribunal in The Hague for a crime against the logic of cinema.
Yet the purpose of the film is profoundly human.
He intends to pillory the fact that Karadzic and Mladic are still at large, and accuse the Americans and French (in which they are reportedly still exceptionally united) of not pursuing the persecution intensively enough because of secret political deals.
But good and evil are sometimes so similar that one thinks of a famous Brecht poem.
In it, the poet writes of the wooden mask depicting the Asian demon on his desk: "I stare with compassion at the bulging vein in his temples, which reveals how tiring it is to be bad."
Movies like "The Hunt" have the same oversized masks shaped like human heads, but they show how tiring it is to be good.
This prolem is not limited only to the genre of films about the Balkan war.
It was recently reported in the newspaper that all Hollywood films about Iraq were miserable failures.
We can add: There hasn't been a single good film about South Africa yet.
It's almost always valid: When a star wanders the world's hotspots or minefields, it turns out something like "On the Paths of Freedom" with Patricia Arquette, "Without Borders" with Angelina Jolie, or "Blood Diamond" with Leonardo Di Caprio.
It is possible that these conflicts are simply too close in terms of time.
After all, it took decades before Hollywood was able to make a good film about the Holocaust with the film "Schindler's List."
Some films are likely to mature - after all, even now-classic films about the Vietnam War, such as "The Deer Hunter," "Apocalypse Now," or "Full Metal Jackett," were unanimously hailed as masterpieces in their time.
But it is possible that today, when every mass murder arrives in our homes in real time, right through two screens, we simply know too much about the world's conflicts.
And that deprives screenwriters of the reality they need to tell good stories.
After all, "To be or not to be" or "The dictator" did so well because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how terrible the Nazi regime really was.
Perhaps one should not strive for the good if one wants to make a good film.
Perhaps we should adopt the sarcastically detached artistic vision of novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallels between his historical novel The Lemprière Lexicon and the Balkan War, he replied: "It just depends on the fact that certain things never change.
Big cities will always be terribly dangerous, people will always be murdered in horrific ways, and Yugoslavia will always be at war."
Von Beust is fiercely criticized for cancelling the Olympics
The mayor's distancing from Hamburg's bid to host the Summer Olympic Games provoked fierce criticism in political and economic life.
Many want to keep fighting for the hosting of the Water Games.
Von Beust, however, emphatically warns of reality when taking chances.
The chief executive of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, on Wednesday described the withdrawal as "unfavorable for the economic environment".
No other project in recent times has unleashed such enormous motivational forces in the city as the Olympic idea.
"Without this goal, we would not be able to maintain the momentum of sports policy at a steady pace."
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury the project, but to develop a long-term initiative "based on modified time coordinates."
Mayor Ole von Beust has stood by his earlier statements that Hamburg's ambitions for the Olympic Games are unrealistic until at least 2028.
"It is not Hamburg that decides on the Olympic bid, but the German Olympic Sports Federation," von Beust told WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the Sports Federation's decision, expected in early December, on the Munich bid for the 2018 Winter Olympic Games.
"For us, prioritising this means that we will not have a realistic chance within the period until 2028 that we have envisaged so far."
However, we will not give up on the dream for good, von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regretted von Beust's statements.
This gives the impression that Hamburg has no intention of bidding for the Olympic Games for the next 25 years.
"It's too early to squander an opportunity by burying our plans now," HSB President Günter Ploß said on Wednesday.
Moreover, the withdrawal from the application is contrary to the statement made by the President of the Senate at a reception held at the General Assembly of the General German College Sports Association.
There, von Beust's bid for the 2015 Universal was described by the city of Hamburg as not serving as a substitute for the Hamburg Olympic Games.
Only last week did the College Sports Association launch Hamburg as a participating city.
The SPD civic faction criticised the Senate for leaving valuable time unused in Hamburg's housing development.
"The development of Kleiner Grasbrook has been delayed by the Senate for years because it voted for the Olympics and did not build housing," said two SPD MPs, Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD has consistently advocated an integrated plan for Olympic and future housing use with regard to Kleiner Grasbrook, the CDU has unilaterally focused on the "event factor".
The bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics sparked great enthusiasm in Hamburg at the time.
Nevertheless, Hamburg failed at Leipzig.
These are not Warhol's chests
Anyone who links Sweden and wooden crates is thinking of Ikea, not Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Currently, wooden crates made in Sweden cast a dark shadow over the list of Warhol's works.
Most of the ninety-four "Stockholm type" Brillo Boxes listed in it are fake.
After the Swedish newspaper Expressen questioned the authenticity of Andy Warhol's 1968 Brillo Boxes a few months ago, an internal investigation by Stockholm's Moderna Museet has now come to a sobering conclusion: The six "Brillo Boxes" donated to the Moderna Museet in 1995 by former museum director Pontus Hultén - and most likely most of the hundreds of other "Stockholm-type" Brillo Boxes circulating on the international art market.
The prequel is long and complicated, an embarrassing chain of artistic and board stunts.
Warhol created his first "Brillo Boxes" in New York City in 1964 - painted wooden crates based on the red-blue-white design of the cardboard box of soap powder "Brillo".
At an exhibition of his work at the Moderna Museet in 1968, with Warhol's consent, hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard were exhibited: These (for cost saving reasons) did not come from Warhol, but were shipped directly from the Brillo cardboard factory.
It was not about works of art, but about their templates, simple exhibits.
However, in 1968, Warhol granted permission to manufacture some Brillo wooden crates in Sweden, which were not exhibited at the Moderna Museet.
Witnesses of the era now speak of about fifteen boxes that rightly entered art and auction history as authenticated Original-Andy-Warhol-Brillo-Box under the designation "Stockholm Type".
Some of them were auctioned off for more than $100,000.
The problem, however, is that legendary museum director Pontus Hultén later falsely claimed that around a hundred wooden crates were produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol left to him.
In fact, Hultén's 105 chests were produced only in 1990 in Malmö for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
However, by this time, Warhol had already been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, chief monument keeper at Moderna Museet, examined the six Brillo Boxes owned by the museum, as well as three Swedish privately owned boxes, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: The pressed chipboard was first primed and sanded, then the white oil paint was applied with a brush.
The structure of the copies from 1990, on the other hand, shows that the paint was applied directly to the chipboard with a paint roller without priming - moreover, it is not oil paint, but acrylic paint.
"These boxes were not certified by the artist and should be removed from Andy Warhol's official list of Brillo Boxes," says Lars Nittve, director of Moderna Museet: "Unless the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board in New York decides otherwise, Moderna Museet will classify the six boxes in its collection as copies/exhibits."
The Authentication Board announced in June that it was investigating "serious allegations" over soap powder boxes.
Since then, however, they have been shrouded in relentless silence.
Manila rebel soldiers give up
Soldiers who barricaded themselves in a hotel in Manila and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo gave up the rebellion in the Philippines.
He cannot take responsibility for the bloodshed, their manager, Antonio Trillanes, told reporters at the hotel, accusing her of corruption and electoral fraud.
Before that, soldiers loyal to the government using tear gas stormed the hotel.
The two dozen soldiers had barricaded themselves inside the building for hours.
Half of the team stood trial Thursday over a failed coup attempt in 2003 — including Trillanes.
He used the trial to suddenly untie a wheel with 30 sympathizers.
The military police charged with guarding the man apparently switched to him and joined the riot.
They broke into the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Units loyal to the government sealed off the area around the upscale hotel.
The President invited the Security Cabinet to an extraordinary meeting.
Security adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the soldiers' actions.
"People are fed up," Trillanes said.
"We call on people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, a former commander of the elite Scout Rangers, said other units of the army wanted to join the march at short notice.
Critics of the administration called for a strong protest against the president on Friday.
His government has been overshadowed by corruption allegations for several months.
Manila's financial district was already the scene of an attempted riot against Arroyo organized by around 200 members of the army in 2003.
The uprising failed less than 24 hours later when the army was reluctant to join.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven coup attempts against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes major shareholder in Versatel
United Internet secured a more than 20 percent stake in telecommunications company Versatel.
As announced by the company on Wednesday evening, the average price per share is 14.46 euros.
This represents 20.05 percent ownership of the authorized capital.
Even before that, speculation about the takeover had been circulating.
The possibility of increasing the stake in Versatel remains open.
The move is intended to help consolidate Germany's DSL market, United Internet said.
Speculation of a possible involvement surfaced on Wednesday after Berenberg Bank increased its stake in the Düsseldorf network operator by a further 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
The financial institution reserves the stake only to a third party, rumors are it in the financial market.
The day before, United Internet had already owned a narrow 10 percent of mobile phone company Drillisch.
As part of a capital increase, Drillisch placed 17.4 million new shares worth EUR 106.4 million.
United Internet bought 5.15 million shares for €31.4 million.
In addition, the companies initiated a dialogue on cooperation in bringing DSL and mobile phone products to market.
"We are strengthening our partnership," a spokesperson for United-Internet said.
The two companies jointly formed the MSP joint venture to take over rival Freenet.
The two companies will initially settle for a good ten percent stake in Freenet and will not exercise their right to take over another 18.49 percent of Freenet, United Internet said Thursday.
However, the two companies leave all options open, especially with regard to increasing their stake in Freenet AG, the news goes.
Negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership were concluded in mid-November.
The poker game around Freenet, which has been going on for months and is now only a matter of affairs, is part of the consolidation of the German telecommunications market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million contracted mobile phone customers and 1.27 million DSL and fixed line customers.
The holding company, made up of United Internet and Drillisch, has so far held a direct 6.01 percent stake in Freenet.
Now it has been agreed that the Drillisch will bring in an additional round four percent.
The right to buy 18.49 percent of the Vatas investment company was agreed back in August.
