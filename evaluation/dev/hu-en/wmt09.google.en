The Prague stock exchange was in the red by the end of trading
The Prague stock exchange corrected its losses after the sharp fall in the morning.
Transactions with the shares of the Czech Energy Company (ČEZ) reached almost half of the usual daily trading.
The Prague stock market continued its Monday decline right from the start of trading on Tuesday, when it fell by almost six percent.
This time, the fall in Wall Street stocks is behind the decline.
Here, too, the market&#39;s reaction to the result of the vote of the American House of Representatives, which refused to support the stabilization plan for the financial sector there, is manifested in this way.
Shares fall in Asia
Stocks in Asia saw a dramatic fall on Tuesday, although indices eventually erased some of the losses later in the day.
Hong Kong&#39;s Hang Seng stock index lost almost four percent during trading, but later pared some of the losses and reduced the decline to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which monitors Chinese stocks on the Hong Kong stock exchange, fell 3.8 percent, and markets were closed in Shanghai.
Shares on the Sydney stock exchange lost more than five percent, but losses eventually narrowed to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwanese stock market fell 3.6 percent, according to the index there.
&quot;The timing of the US bailout is uncertain and will affect the world&#39;s financial markets,&quot; said Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Financial Council.
Although Hong Kong is part of China, it determines its monetary policy independently, that is, independently of the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are at the same level as in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, American lawmakers should immediately resume negotiations and accept the proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, there is a danger that other countries will also feel the consequences.
A bloodbath for US stocks
On Monday, the US House of Representatives rejected the draft to support the financial system, for which 700 billion dollars (almost 12 trillion crowns) should have been spent.
In doing so, lawmakers ignored President George Bush&#39;s call to support the plan.
According to Bush, the draft would solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
On Monday, American stocks experienced a bloodbath and the leading stock indexes registered the biggest drop in 20 years.
The Dow Jones fell by almost seven percent, the last time it experienced a similar decline was in 1987.
The index fell before the vote, but as soon as it became clear that the proposal was not accepted in the House of Representatives, the index began to free fall.
Congress backed down: The US government can thus pump 700 billion dollars into the banks
The top leaders of the US Congress and the administration of President George W. Bush agreed on the broader form of the agreement and the financial assistance to be provided to the US financial system.
This will be voted on early next week.
US lawmakers have reached a breakthrough in negotiations to approve the rescue plan in the form of financial assistance to the US financial system in the amount of 700 billion dollars (about 12 trillion crowns).
But no victory yet.
Congress must finalize some details of the agreement before they can make public the final form of the law and their vote.
The support draft for the financial system will be discussed in the House of Representatives on Monday.
Barney Frank, chairman of the Financial Institutions Committee, informed the Reuters news agency about this on Sunday.
According to Senate sources, the draft will probably be voted on Wednesday at the earliest.
According to economists, there should be an announcement that the bailout plan will be approved, which is the first important psychological factor in the revival of financial markets.
However, due to the complexity of the mechanisms, &quot;sobering&quot; takes place afterwards.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
&quot;We have taken a big step.
We have resolved our differing views on what the package should look like to stabilize the market,&quot; Democrat Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg.
According to him, the final vote can take place on Sunday.
Representatives of the legislators met with Henry Paulson, the US Treasury Secretary, on Saturday night to give a final form to the government fund.
This should buy the unsalable mortgage assets from the financial companies, which lead the financial companies to heavy losses and threaten the stability of the entire system.
&quot;We are close to final agreement on a design that will work and also be effective in the market.
There&#39;s still work to be done on the remedial plan, but I think we&#39;re there,&quot; Paulson said.
A signal to trade in Asia
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on stock markets, which are falling sharply.
According to Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid, the lawmakers are therefore trying to reach a final agreement in Congress on Sunday.
This is because they want to reassure investors before the start of trading on the Asian financial markets, where, due to the time zone, the decision of Congress could be the first to influence Monday&#39;s trading.
For now, however, it is not clear when the two chambers of the US Congress will vote on the law, nor is it clear whether the trial might get stuck at the last minute due to some problem.
Lawmakers hope to pass the law in the coming days.
However, the law is still undergoing many changes.
The total amount intended to help the system must be divided into two parts.
According to President George Bush&#39;s request, the first 350 billion dollars should be available as soon as possible.
But Congress can block the release of the remaining amount, set at another $100 billion and later at $350 billion, if it feels the program isn&#39;t doing its job.
Bush praised the progress in the negotiations
Although the president can veto this decision, Congress can override his veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the program remained, which was to acquire financial assets for the purchase of bad mortgage securities that have lost their value, as hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to repay their mortgage loans.
&quot;We worked everything out.
The House should be able to vote on the bill on Sunday and the Senate on Monday,&quot; Republican Sen. Judd Gregg said.
American President Bush is also satisfied with the progress achieved in the negotiations.
Bush spokesman Tony Fratto said the president was pleased with Saturday&#39;s progress and appreciated the &quot;bipartisan efforts to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy.&quot;
Restrictions on severance pay
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, who led the negotiations, said lawmakers agreed on responsibility for the financial program, protecting taxpayers from losses, ending benefits, and the timing of the funding bill.
The new law requires directors participating in the program to also limits busás&#39;s severance pay and establishes a committee to supervise the fund.
The fund should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
&quot;We&#39;ve worked very hard on this, and we&#39;ve made great strides toward an agreement that will work and benefit all Americans,&quot; Paulson said.
The plan also provides assistance to homeowners who are having trouble making repayments.
The government should negotiate new repayment installments for the mortgages it buys, with the aim of reducing debtors&#39; monthly repayments and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: Spiritual help
According to David Marek, chief economist of Patria Finance, the proposed draft is a good idea, but it will be very difficult to implement.
&quot;All this is because it is impossible to know by what mechanism and at what price the problematic assets will be acquired.
This will determine how the financial sector and the government distribute the losses among themselves,&quot; Marek told iHNed.cz website this week.
According to Marek, it is not so important that the plan is approved now or at the beginning of next week.
&quot;It is much more important that Congress decide this week that they support the plan and give their blessing as soon as possible.
The spiritual importance of reaching an agreement that the plan will be approved is the most important thing at this moment,&quot; Marek emphasized.
Victory of right-wing populists in Austria, they have a total of 29 percent
According to the first preliminary results, Austria&#39;s early parliamentary elections on Sunday brought about a perceptible weakening of the two parties of the grand coalition and a significant strengthening of the right-wing populist parties.
The Austrian People&#39;s Party (ÖVP), where the position of the current president, Wilhelm Molterer, was seriously shaken, suffered a particularly strong loss.
On the other hand, Jörg Haider, president of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), regional leader of Carinthia, is preparing for a victorious return to national politics.
Based on the preliminary results, the Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) remains the strongest party in the country with 29.8 percent of the votes, but compared to the last elections in 2006, it lost 5.5 percent of the votes.
The ÖVP fared even worse, losing almost nine percent of the votes with 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results achieved by both major parties in Austria&#39;s post-war history, and the result is literally catastrophic, especially for the People&#39;s Party, which called for early elections.
At the beginning of July, when the ÖVP left the coalition, the People&#39;s Party had a significant advantage over the SPÖ, according to opinion polls.
However, the voters clearly punished him for letting the government fail.
Already in the first reactions to the results, there were speculations about the possible resignation of Wilhelm Molterer, party president and current vice-chancellor.
Observers believe that this could happen as early as Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the party presidency.
This development would probably facilitate the increasingly likely way out of the election result, i.e. the renewal of the SPÖ and ÖVP grand coalition.
Given the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties - the Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ) initially won 18 percent of the votes and the BZÖ 11 percent of the votes - however, the social democrats at the same time voiced their fear of a repeat of 1999, when the People&#39;s Party in a joint government agreed with the populists (the FPÖ was still united at the time, it separated from the BZÖ in 2005), which even caused sanctions from the European Union.
Haider, who has already declared that he is ready to cooperate with any party, and I assume that he can return to Vienna in national politics, is obviously counting on this solution.
The Green Party also made it to the parliament, but it lost some of its popularity and dropped from third to fifth place among Austrian political parties.
None of the other parties exceeded the four percent limit and did not enter the parliament.
Duel at the edge of the blade: MP3 players versus mobile phones.
We&#39;ll help you choose
While almost all mobile phones can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can make phone calls.
From this it seems clear that it is better to just buy a phone.
That being said, there are many reasons to get a dedicated MP3 player.
The choice depends entirely on the way of use and the needs of the future owner.
You probably have a hard time getting a top-of-the-line, expensive record player for your home to listen to the latest Maxim Turbulenc record on.
On the one hand, such musical products do not appear on vinyl records, but there is no objective reason for this in terms of quality either.
However, if your shelves are full of art rock, jazz or blues vinyl records, you probably dream of such a turntable.
This is similar to MP3 music intended for travel, that is, compressed - simplified.
There are also price and quality categories here.
It may be unacceptable for some to spend eight thousand kroner for a player, just as a Pink Floyd fan probably finds it difficult to accept a twenty kroner market earphone.
Two extremes, between which there is enough space for everyone.
The selection is wide.
Battery life also matters
Some of the top quality music players can do much more than just play music, but also do things that most mobiles don&#39;t even happen to be able to do.
No device today is as universal as the telephone.
In addition to the primary functions, calling and sending SMS, it can also play music and video, record both, has a better or worse camera, and can even navigate.
And if you consider smartphones and communicators, you will also have a small computer in your pocket.
This is a bit of a miracle, since no refrigerator can grill and no television can take photos.
However, multi-functional mobile phones also have disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your mobile, the more often the display sends it to the charger.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy guzzlers.
Few mobile devices can play music for more than ten or twelve hours, usually much less.
In this regard, music players (especially the simplest ones) are significantly more powerful.
With cheap mobile phones, therefore, expect that they won&#39;t play for you for more than a few hours.
If you also make calls here and there, get another charger for safety at work - this also applies to more expensive devices.
You won&#39;t have this problem with MP3 players, even the worse ones can last at least 9 hours of continuous operation on a single charge.
The next problem arises when uploading music to mobile.
Unfortunately, only a limited number of devices have a universal USB connector, and not all of them can be connected directly to a computer without special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but only a few card readers can cope with the miniature memory cards used in mobile phones without an adapter.
With a few exceptions (iPod), you don&#39;t need any special software for players.
It is enough to load the device with music from the computer via USB.
The majority of mobile phones and players already create their own music library sorted by the name of the artist, album, genre, or, for example, the user&#39;s rating.
Some devices only show a tree structure like Windows Explorer, and some know both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with OS).
Players are easier to handle, mobiles know more
When choosing a specific device, inquire primarily about battery life, memory capacity, quality and type of sound output, and of course the comfort of use.
If you mainly use music as a background and you only listen to it for a short time a day, for example on the tram, any mobile phone that plays MP3 is suitable for you.
Any mobile phone can do this.
You don&#39;t even need to pay particular attention to what music formats your mobile or player supports.
Everyone can handle MP3, and the vast majority of the music you receive will be in this format.
MP3 is one of the most common, and the vast majority of devices also handle music in WMA format.
AAC (the format used by Apple and its iPod) is less common.
Better mobile phones also make it possible, for example, to buy music online.
It is enough to visit the respective pages of the service provider (or other service provider) and buy the song or album via the mobile Internet.
This service in itself can be a strong argument for purchasing a music mobile.
Unfortunately, the offer of the service providers is lousy and usually limited to only one year&#39;s radio hits.
The prices are not the lowest either.
In general, however, it can be assumed that this kind of way of selling music (whether via GSM, Internet, or wireless Internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people keep their mobile devices with them all the time.
Whenever he feels like listening to something, he fumbles with his mobile phone in his pocket, while the forgotten MP3 player is lying around at home.
However, it also depends on whether you always carry the earphones or at least the speakerphone.
If not, you can use the built-in speaker, which almost all mobile phones have, but few MP3 players have.
For many, the biggest advantage of music mobiles will probably be the price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than three thousand crowns.
Between three and four thousand crowns you can already get a pretty decent walkman.
However, you are mostly limited by the lack of a traditional headphone output.
The best and most technically equipped phones with traditional 3.5 mm hole earphones can cost up to fifteen thousand crowns.
At the same time, the advantage of the players, among other things, is the simple handling.
The simplest - by no means necessarily the cheapest - players (see our selection) can really be handled by everyone.
Minimal functionality, handling similar to a conventional cassette recorder or gramophone is obvious.
There is no danger of a crash in the form of accidentally switching on the mobile internet, nor of the huge bill for data transfer that follows.
Which device should we choose?
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for replaceable memory cards (M2, microSD type, etc.).
With the purchase of the appropriate card, you can get a maximum of two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
Basic types only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2GB.
Only the most expensive ones know what to do with memory cards of up to 8 GB.
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy a cheap MP3 player, choose Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Based on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you don&#39;t have to spend more than 1,100 kroner.
If you belong to the more demanding listeners, choose special mobile walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokias and Samsungs).
These devices also have a separate MP3 control button, so the comfort of operation is similar to that of an MP3 player.
The furthest in the industry is Sony Ericsson, whose Walkman series mobile phones have the same user interface as MP3 players sold separately.
MP3 players of the above-mentioned brands can provide the same service in the same price range up to four thousand crowns, but with a larger memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (usually 15 hours, maximum 35 hours).
The first virtual service provider will reach the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is relatively developed and our service providers offer practically the same services as their Western European partners.
Nevertheless, we are missing something here - a virtual service provider forcing the classic service providers to significantly reduce their prices.
Maybe it won&#39;t be like that for much longer.
We have written many times on the Mobil.cz website that Czech service providers are among the most expensive in Europe.
This was also confirmed by ČTÚ, which drew attention to the fact that the price of SMS in the Czech Republic is more expensive than in other EU countries.
After the European Commission&#39;s latest move to regulate roaming charges, this may lead to a controversial situation - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, text messages sent from abroad will be cheaper than domestic ones.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competition that really wants to fight.
This may sound contradictory, since we have three mobile networks and our penetration is well over 100%.
On the contrary, mobile service providers are happy to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
Pavel Dvořák, the chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Authority, often agrees with this, as he has stated several times before that there is no room for new service providers in the Czech Republic.
It is perhaps true that the classic service provider with its own network probably does not have much of a chance (however, it would probably be difficult to find a frequency).
However, there is another option - the virtual service provider.
It was precisely the entry of virtual service providers into the mobile market that brought about a significant price reduction, to which classic service providers also had to respond.
Meanwhile, even before the entry of big fish such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile into the market, voices similar to ours were heard in Great Britain.
However, it has been proven that such providers have a place and can indeed be successful.
However, we don&#39;t have to go far for an example.
In February this year, we informed you about the launch of the Mobilking virtual service provider in Poland.
This service provider managed to acquire more than 100,000 customers in less than half a year and become the fifth largest service provider there.
Meanwhile, Mobilking is backed by the Penta financial group, which in the Czech Republic owns U:fon among others.
The advantage of virtual service providers is the ability to focus on a much narrower target group.
In order to operate effectively, you need far fewer customers than a traditional service provider.
It does not involve relatively high construction, mobile network operation and maintenance costs.
Virtual service providers in the world are thus generally seen as low-cost - they offer cheap calls and SMS, which, however, are often offset by fewer services.
Thus, for example, Tesco Mobile in Great Britain offers text messages at least fifty percent cheaper than its competitors.
But as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can be quite a good move to bet on a so-called target group.
This service provider focuses specifically on men.
&quot;Real men choose the Mobilking service provider - who they like, who they can trust,&quot; says David Seibert, CEO of Mobil Entertainment Company, which operates this virtual service provider.
It is difficult to say whether an idea similar to the one in Poland can work here.
Miroslav Čepický, Vodafone&#39;s spokesperson, doubts this: &quot;The Czech market is relatively small for the segmented approach on which the majority of virtual operators are based.
In addition, it is relatively satisfactory in terms of the range of services.&quot;
There is no chance in the Czech Republic, the mobile service providers claim
However, it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual service provider in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
&quot;We are talking about the successful expansion of this project, but the negotiations in the Czech Republic do not seem very promising.
The launch of Mobilking will take place in other countries of our region,&quot; said Jana Studničková, spokeswoman of the Penta financial group, in a telephone interview with Mobil.cz.
This indirectly proved that the existing mobile service providers in the Czech Republic are not overly sympathetic to this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do everything in their power to ensure that no potential competition can arise.
For some time now, the GTS Novera group has not been hiding its interest in launching a virtual service provider, thereby taking another step towards making Telefonica O2 a real competitor in the field of corporate customers.
&quot;We are very interested in being able to provide our customers with not only fixed but also mobile telecommunication services.
The sooner the better.
We have repeatedly discussed this possibility with all Czech mobile service providers.
We have already made progress in negotiations with some of them,&quot; says Pavel Kaidl, the group&#39;s spokesman.
Maybe better times are coming.
From unofficial information, it seems that we may be lucky with the first virtual service provider by the end of the year.
However, his birth is surrounded by an impenetrable wall of silence.
&quot;At this moment, we do not think that there is a place for a full-fledged virtual service provider on the Czech market.
The Czech market, unlike other markets, is very special.
Until now, we have not been contacted by a unique entity offering a complex and serious project in this field,&quot; Vlastimil Sršeň from Telefónica 02&#39;s press department told Mobil.cz.
Other service providers also refer to the special situation of the Czech market.
Martina Kemrová, T-Mobile&#39;s spokeswoman, exceptionally agrees with O2 and adds: &quot;So far, we have not registered any viable and mutually beneficial business projects that could be further based on.&quot;
And he added: &quot;It is unlikely that any virtual service providers will appear in the T-Mobile network until the end of the year.
At this moment, we should have a concrete agreement on our table to be able to think in such a short term.&quot;
Vodafone is turning its attention to fulfilling its own 3G license requirements.
Miroslav Čepický adds: &quot;We are open to negotiations with possible virtual service providers, primarily in the area of sharing costs and infrastructure.
We consider this to be the most rewarding from the customer&#39;s point of view.
Vodafone&#39;s main strategy in this area is to find partners to build shared networks for fast mobile internet.&quot;
Responsible offices - on the same page as service providers
The procedure of the mobile service providers is easy to understand, the entry of another service provider would mean an increase in competition, would lead to a drop in prices and thus a decrease in their profits.
So why facilitate the entry of such competition?
When something is important to service providers, they are able to cooperate, as evidenced by the tug-of-war surrounding the birth of U:fon.
The greatest pressure on ČTÚ was probably around the birth of the T-Mobile company U:fon.
This is evidenced by the publicly available information from the ČTÚ website.
But now U:fon comes in handy as an argument why we should not allow the entry of the virtual service provider.
Martina Kemrová added to this: &quot;The competitive environment of the mobile market was recently strengthened by the entry of the fourth mobile service provider into the market.
Given the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that the entry of another player into the market and its services would place high demands.&quot;
Considering this attitude of the mobile service providers, however, the complete lack of interest of the Czech regulatory bodies is truly amazing.
In the meantime, it is not only the attitude of ČTÚ, which unfortunately - unlike Great Britain and other developed countries - does not have the right to intervene in economic competition in the Czech Republic.
Only the Economic Competition Authority is entitled to this.
However, the office has a typical approach to the whole problem.
&quot;The entry of the virtual service provider into the mobile market would only be possible after the contract between the mobile service provider and the virtual service provider on the rental of the necessary infrastructure is concluded.
So far, no such contracts have been concluded, as the range of possible interested parties was probably not sufficiently interesting for the traditional service providers,&quot; said Kristián Chlapua, from the External Relations Department of the Economic Competition Office, in response to our question.
A statement formulated in this way from the representatives of the service providers would probably not surprise anyone.
However, from the office that should represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, ensure that no one can abuse their market position, this is more than strange.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: &quot;Abroad, where virtual service providers usually operate, we can observe that their entry into the market has contributed to the reduction of the price of mobile phone services.&quot;
However, it is probably not in the interests of ÚOHS to put pressure on the correct functioning of the market environment and the reduction of prices.
In this case, the striking harmony revealed by the reactions of the three mobile service providers is truly shocking.
The question, whether it is really just a coincidence, is almost self-explanatory.
Just like the completely identical gasoline prices at gas stations, they are probably just the result of chance and fierce competition.
&quot;The office did not discover any signs of anti-competitive proceedings in this case, so there is no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the service providers has a leading position, i.e. they do not have a proportionally greater responsibility for their market actions.
The telecommunications regulator probably also lacks the necessary tools to open the mobile market of virtual service providers,&quot; said Chalupa.
The presentation of the market leading position is one of the many points of contention.
Of course, there is an analysis of relevant markets developed by ČTÚ, based on which telecommunications is the only market from the point of view of economic competition.
Of course, no Czech service provider is in a leading position in such a market.
However, some legal experts offer a different approach - the creation of a virtual service provider always requires the approval of the network operator.
And the mobile operator - relatively logically - has a monopoly on its own network.
So it is necessarily dominant in a certain segment.
But even if we do not accept this argument, it should at least be a warning to ÚOHS that three mobile service providers act in a strikingly similar way.
Meanwhile, complaints from a number of interested parties (including the aforementioned GTS Novera company) show that they encounter very similar obstacles during negotiations with all service providers.
Shifting the responsibility to ČTÚ is a relatively common trick in telecommunications, with which ÚOHS takes its hands off the whole matter.
We have already encountered this in a few similar situations.
Unfortunately, in the text of the recently adopted telecommunications law, the extension of ČTÚ&#39;s powers in the field of economic competition in telecommunications was not implemented, even though many experts hoped that the situation would improve.
The representatives of the ÚOHS should know this well, but they probably have different interests.
This works when no one is watching
In the meantime, the operation of some kind of pseudo-virtual service providers, of which many are already operating in the Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
These are companies that issue their own mobile phone service price lists, which are, however, only partially public.
Because we are talking about companies dealing with multilevel marketing.
For example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile phone services.
The price lists of these companies are usually only available to selected people.
The magic lies in the fact that the company acts as a classic corporate customer vis-à-vis the service provider, which orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As a priority customer, you will then receive special price offers (and other discounts).
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile service providers prohibit similar prepayment.
&quot;If the cases you are talking about were to arise, it would be a breach of contract terms, which we would deal with and which could lead to the termination of cooperation with the given company,&quot; answered Martina Kemrová to our question about this problem.
But it is quite unlikely that the news about this kind of activity would not have reached the responsible people of the mobile service providers.
Primarily, in the case of the three mentioned companies, there may be thousands of customers.
Meanwhile, no service provider defends itself against such a procedure.
These companies make a significant profit from their activities, and unlike real virtual service providers, they are not particularly threatened by their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický warns of possible problems: &quot;The law allows for similar speculations, however, the services of these companies are used only by a negligible percentage of customers.
In addition, they have to accept that the SIM card in their phone is not in their name, so they cannot have full access to it like general customers of mobile service providers.&quot;
But ČTÚ should at least be surprised by this.
In addition, another question arises for the ÚOHS.
If mobile service providers turn a blind eye to a similar procedure, why are they preventing the birth of a virtual service provider?
It should be added that the ÚOHS has relatively strong powers to uncover this kind of activity, and if it does not want to, it does not have to be satisfied with the explanation of the service providers that they did not suspect anything of the sort and that their terms of trade forbid it.
When we will not be the most expensive
As it was already mentioned a few times in the text, the entry of virtual service providers into the mobile market brought about a perceptible drop in the price of services.
Meanwhile, in practically all countries where virtual service providers have been established, classic service providers have tried to more or less prevent their establishment.
The arguments they used were practically the same - too small, perhaps too satisfied market, problems with the quality of services, etc.
In developed countries, however, the regulatory bodies intervened precisely at these moments, which did not protect the interests of the mobile service providers, but of their customers.
Then, either through formal measures or informal pressure, they achieved the creation of the first virtual service provider, which others followed.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies are handing the whole case to each other.
Based on our experience, we cannot get rid of the impression that unclear competences come in handy for them in these cases.
But let&#39;s not give up the fight.
If the background information is good and the virtual service provider really appears in our country soon, the Czech mobile market might start moving again.
If a service provider were to allow the creation of a virtual mobile service provider, the ÚOHS could hardly remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of additional interested parties.
And compared to the rest of Europe, we may no longer be more expensive to call.
There are four new versions of the new Czech national anthem.
Choose the best one
Listen to four arrangements of the new version of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek ceremoniously presented Where is my country? new recordings of the national anthem.
The anthem was recorded by the orchestra of the National Theater led by Jiří Bělohlávek.
Four versions are available - with male or female solo vocals, choir or instrumental.
Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka sing.
The authors of the modification of the anthem are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
You can listen to all four versions on the iHNed.cz website.
Bělohlávek considers the Czech national song one of the most beautiful anthems.
He previously told Czech Radio that he deliberately chose young singers with representative voices who are expressive and popular to sing the solo variations.
&quot;Right from the beginning, I tried to ensure clear diction, easy comprehensibility of the text, and harmony with both of them, and later with the band as well,&quot; he mentioned.
The Czech national anthem celebrates its 175th anniversary next year.
Where is my country? The song was first performed at the Rendi Theater in 1834 in Josef Kajetán&#39;s play Tyl Fidlovačka, supplemented by the music of František Škroup.
It became popular and people spontaneously claimed it as their own.
And the first verse of the song became a natural part of the national anthem after the founding of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
Even after the establishment of the independent Czech Republic, it remained one of the seven state symbols.
What is the &quot;new&quot; anthem
On Wednesday, the Prague transport company will also deliver with a chip card for the first time
Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will enter the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date when the first passenger who will have an electronic coupon in his pocket instead of a paper line ticket gets on the subways, trams and buses.
The coupon can currently be obtained by approximately one hundred thousand people who have the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can buy 30-day, 90-day and annual coupons (which will be valid from January 1, 2009) and save them on their chip cards at the information centers and branches of the Transport Company in Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka metro stations.
The coupons can be purchased online from yesterday via the website of the Transport Company www.dpp.cz.
The service was used by more than four hundred customers by the afternoon.
Those who start using internet trading can once and for all forget the ticket windows of metro stations, where they had to regularly stand in long lines for line tickets until now.
The coupon can be purchased online and saved on the Opencard card in one of the thirteen branches of the City Library.
&quot;At these places, passengers have a desk with trained servers available to them, who help those interested in online shopping and also save their purchased coupons on their card,&quot; said Martin Opatrný, the project&#39;s spokesperson.
In addition to the libraries, electronic coupons will also be able to be saved to Opencard in the self-service machines installed in some lobbies.
What do these machines look like?
They are red, reminiscent of ticket agents and passengers may have already noticed them at the Roztyly, Budějovická, IP Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská metro stations.
&quot;Currently there are five of them in the city, but by the end of the year there should be eighty,&quot; Opatrný added.
The coupon is checked by a machine instead of the driver
It is easy to manage the machines that will start operating tomorrow.
All you have to do is insert the Opencard chip card and the previously paid coupon will automatically be saved.
Starting tomorrow, electronic coupons will be valid not only in the capital, but also in the surrounding area.
So, on the trains and bus lines around the city from 300 to 499, which mainly the residents of the districts of Central Bohemia travel to the capital.
&quot;On the trains included in Prague&#39;s integrated transport, the conductors were equipped with card readers, with the help of which they can also determine the zone validity of the coupons,&quot; Filip Drápal from the Ropid organization, which compiles the Prague public transport timetable, explained the check of line tickets.
In buses around the city, card readers are installed near the driver at the cash desk.
When boarding, the driver must not only show the chip card, but also place the Opencard in the designated place on the side of the cash register.
This is how the driver checks the validity of the coupons.
&quot;If, for example, the passenger needs to check the validity of the coupons, the easiest way is to ask the driver for this,&quot; added Drápal.
Passengers who do not travel by buses around the city and do not remember when their coupon expires can go to the self-service machines that save coupons to cards again.
Information about the validity of their documents appears here on the device&#39;s display.
The Sudetenland wanted a referendum from the USA
The Sudeten Germans requested the annexation of Šumava to the United States in 1945.
This is clear from the letter that is in the collection of the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we at least want to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
It is said that in 1945 some groups of Sudeten Germans approached the President of the USA with this wish.
This can also be seen from a letter from a private archive, which is currently kept in the collection of the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
In the letter, the Germans from Česky Krumlov ask the American president not to allow the return of the &quot;Šumava County&quot; to the Czech Republic, which was still occupied by Hitler under the Munich Agreement.
&quot;We interpreted the situation correctly and we really want to be sure of the words according to which the American troops are not coming to the German territories as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators,&quot; says the letter, signed with the words &quot;People who carry the fate of Šumava in their hearts.&quot;
Since annexation to Czechoslovakia can supposedly give the Sudeten Germans - in addition to the knowledge of the Czech national character - only hope for brutality, ruthlessness, lack of understanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American president to take over the protectorate over Šumava &quot;now and forever &quot;.
&quot;We cannot believe that, regardless of the opinion of four million inhabitants, he would judge this territory as a foreign country for us, which oppresses and enrages the minority, and would contribute almost nothing to the victory of the Allies,&quot; the letter states.
The reason why the authors could not sign is said to be the fear of revenge by the &quot;Czech oppressors&quot;.
So, if the president of the USA allegedly doubts the opinion of the Germans in Šumava, it would be enough for him to hold a referendum in the county of Šumava on whether its residents wish to become part of the USA and live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the wording of the letter may appear somewhat naive with current knowledge of post-war history, some historians believe it accurately portrays the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at the time.
Even if the Czech Germans had a minimal idea that they would be evicted from the country, only a few of them recognized the possibility of this.
Some expected the United States and Great Britain to agree to some kind of autonomy for the Sudetenland.
Still others hoped to simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed by Gustav Chalupa, an Austrian journalist born in České Budějovice.
Chalupa served in the Baltic Sea as a German from Budějovice during the war.
When he was captured by the British at the end of the war and thrown into the Holštynsko prison camp, dozens of other Czech Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
&quot;They believed that when they return home, the Czech language will come in handy,&quot; said Chalupa.
According to him, none of the German prisoners living in Czechoslovakia before the war expected to be deported from the country based on the Beneš decrees.
You don&#39;t think - you pay!
The emotional campaign attacks the leaders
The most expensive road safety campaign in Czech history.
This is how the emotional media campaign that the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday could be characterized.
The office of Minister Aleš Řebíček hopes this campaign will deter leaders from dangerous behavior behind the government.
The campaign, which will cost 150 million, will be on television, radio, in the cinema, on the Internet, and will also appear in leaflets.
It should discourage drivers from speeding and drinking alcohol.
And you should also remind them to fasten their seat belts before they leave.
First of all, it wants to appeal to the conscience of young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
And what appears in the advertisements?
The stories that attack emotions are primarily human stories.
This is evidenced by the &quot;bloody&quot; slogan of the entire campaign:
You don&#39;t think - you pay!
The phrase &quot;you don&#39;t think&quot; is written in large letters on the license plate.
And the word &quot;you will pay&quot; is written in the pool of blood.
This should symbolize that one can pay with one&#39;s life for a moment of inattention.
Viewers were &quot;terrified&quot; by commercials until 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where drastic pictures of accident victims can be viewed regularly.
They hope that this will reduce the number of accidents and deaths on Czech roads.
The advertising spots were created by the Euro RSCG agency.
Tighten it, loosen it for the drivers
&quot;The &#39;tighten it, loosen it&#39; system applies to drivers.
&#39;Give it up&#39; for them is when, for example, they go through the red light, thereby saving time.
&#39;Pull it&#39; is the danger of punishment or accident.
The driver must be reminded of the risk,&quot; says Martin Kořán, traffic psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital.
And that is why the information campaign in the press is needed, primarily the negative campaign, the psychologist believes.
According to him, signs drawing the driver&#39;s attention to the danger are less effective.
&quot;If the hazard warning sign is installed, it will probably quickly blend in with the environment and the drivers will not pay attention to it,&quot; warned Kořán.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
Ehud Olmer, the president of the interim Israeli government, talked about the return of practically all the territories occupied in 1967, i.e. the West Bank of Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and Syria.
He said this in an interview published on Monday by the Jediot Achronot daily.
&quot;We have to make an agreement with the Palestinians, which means we have to return almost all, if not all, of the (occupied) territories,&quot; Olmert told the daily.
&quot;We will keep a certain percentage of these territories, but we must give the Palestinians a similar percentage of the Israeli territories, because without this there will be no peace,&quot; he added.
He acknowledged that the eventual return would include East Jerusalem.
&quot;Anyone who wants security in Jerusalem and above all wants tractors and bulldozers not to run over their feet, as happened to one of my best friends, has to give up a part of Jerusalem,&quot; Olmert said, referring to the attacks on two cities in July that left some people dead. killed and several dozen injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find &quot;a special solution for the Temple Mount, sacred and historical places&quot; in the Old Town.
&quot;Whoever wants to preserve Israeli sovereignty over the entire city must integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It won&#39;t work,&quot; he stressed.
Withdrawal from the Golan Heights
Olmert also expressed his opinion on the withdrawal of the Israelis from the Golan Heights, which, according to him, is an essential condition for the peace treaty to be concluded with Syria.
However, this would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
&quot;I do not recommend making peace with Syria solely on the basis of withdrawal from the Golan,&quot; he warned.
&quot;The Syrians know very well what they have to give up in order to get the Golan.
They must give up their current relationship with Iran; they must give up their relationship with Hezbollah (a Shiite movement); they must give up the regular support they provide to the terrorism of Hamas (Shia movement), Al-Qaeda and Jihad (holy war) in Iraq,&quot; the Prime Minister clarified.
Schwarzenberg: Indian relations may cool
According to Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, if the problem of the Czech scientists reported for illegal collection of beetles could not be solved, a certain estrangement could occur in Czech-Indian relations.
The minister announced this after his meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee in New York today.
&quot;If this is not resolved, then yes, a certain estrangement would occur,&quot; he stated after the meeting, which took place at Czech instigation.
After the hearing, Mukherjee said that it is difficult for the executive to intervene in court cases.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was acquitted and fined, the central government can negotiate with the Darjeeling local government, whose legislation the case falls under.
&quot;His problem could be solved,&quot; said the minister.
According to Mukherjee, however, it would be best for Emil Kučera, who was sentenced to three years in prison, to appeal to a higher court.
Then he could apply for release on bail and wait freely for the verdict, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner expressed himself similarly during the trial.
&quot;He proposed an appeal to the Supreme Court, then it would be possible to acquit him,&quot; said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can intervene in the whole case is to provide &quot;competent legal support&quot; to the convict, the Indian minister mentioned.
However, he said that the Indian side is already providing them with such assistance.
&quot;Our main interest is to preserve the best relations with India with many years of tradition.
The Indians also recognize this,&quot; Schwarzenberg mentioned.
At the same time, as he told ČTK, he emphasized to his partner that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
&quot;We consider the imprisonment and prosecution of these Czech scientists to be a serious mistake indeed,&quot; he declared.
When asked whether he received a promise from the Indian side to deal with the matter, the minister evaded the answer.
&quot;I&#39;ve already received quite a few promises,&quot; he noted.
Questions after an accident: Are bus attendants illegal?
The law does not recognize them, they are not allowed on a long-distance bus
In connection with the tragic bus accident of the Student Agency company near Padua, Italy, the question arose as to whether the attendants and passengers could travel in the bus during the journey.
&quot;If we wanted to follow the law strictly and formally, the activity of the flight attendant would be in conflict with the law on transport activities,&quot; says Karel Hanzelka, a spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
Last week, a 22-year-old passenger was killed, possibly caused by the driver of a lorry crossing the path of the bus.
Unfortunately for her, at that moment she was sitting next to the driver, in the least safe place on the bus, even though there were two more seats reserved for her.
The bus may crash or brake suddenly at the moment when the attendant is serving coffee or offering a newspaper.
Whether the bus has a parking space according to the traffic permit plays a role.
If it is not homologated in the bus, passengers must sit.
The long-distance buses of the Student Agency do not have standing places; which was also confirmed to Aktuálně.cz by Radim Jančura, the director of the company.
&quot;We tried to find a solution to this with the ministry, and at first the movement of passengers was not allowed.
However, this was withdrawn, and we came to the conclusion that passengers can go to the toilet during the journey, as long as they have their own seat,&quot; he stated his position.
The law does not recognize the flight attendant
&quot;There is no clear legal definition of the role of a flight attendant - no legislation regulates this position.
However, the carrier is not prohibited by any law from providing the services.
The law on road traffic only recognizes the concept of vehicle attendant; it does not define your rights and obligations,&quot; spokesperson Hanzelka adds less clearly.
On the contrary, Josef Pokorný, director of the Ministry of Transport&#39;s road vehicle operation department, believes that the law adequately addresses the problem.
&quot;It depends on whether the bus has a parking space in its license.
And that&#39;s it,&quot; he says.
According to their distinction, buses can be urban, with standing places and a limited maximum speed, and intercity buses with standing places and a permitted higher speed, and long-distance buses without standing places and a permitted maximum speed, with seats with seat belts.
Like on an airplane, says the expert
Jaroslav Hořín, BESIP&#39;s traffic safety expert, does not see a fundamental problem in the movement of the attendants on board the bus.
&quot;During continuous progress, there is not much danger, the situation can be compared to service on an airplane.
Here, too, it is not certain when there is turbulence and the flight attendant could hit his head.&quot;
&quot;However, if the bus suddenly brakes, of course the laws of physics apply.
Just like in city buses or trams.
The safety of the flight attendants must be solved by the carrier with internal rules,&quot; he says, and he also believes that the problem has not been solved from the point of view of the law.
Jančura is ready to terminate services
The Student Agency is the only bus carrier that offers passenger services.
It employs two hundred flight attendants.
Even after the accident, the director does not consider their occupation to be risky.
&quot;However, as soon as I get the impression that the occupation of flight attendants is risky, I will terminate them.
Passengers can receive coffee and newspapers upon boarding.
It would also save costs,&quot; he says.
Alexej Litvin, director of Asiana, which operates a fraction of flights compared to Student Agency, justified the lack of flight attendants in its vehicles with safety interests.
&quot;We don&#39;t have flight attendants, we&#39;ve been against this from the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end in some kind of fatal injury,&quot; he told Týden.cz just a year ago.
An incredible tragedy happened
A young flight attendant from Pilsen, who had been working for the company for two years, died during a scheduled flight to Naples.
The Slovenian truck probably turned out of the stop lane without using a turn signal and blocked the path of the bus.
The bus driver tried to avoid it with a sudden maneuver, but the right front part of the bus hit him.
Jančura denies that the two seats reserved for the rest of the flight attendants were also sold.
&quot;These seats cannot be booked on long-distance flights, they are blocked.&quot;
The company wants to sue the truck driver.
By compensating the girl&#39;s family, the agency does not wait for the court&#39;s verdict, but also expects financial compensation from the guilty party.
A change in the law?
In the distant future
The amendment to the law, on which the Ministry of Transport&#39;s 30-person expert group has been working for more than a year, could clarify the movement of the attendants on board the bus.
&quot;However, the group did not reach any concrete results.
Buses not so much, rather the point system deals with the maximum permitted speed on the highway and the use of mobile phones while driving,&quot; says expert Hořín.
&quot;The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of the attendants to be something that would fundamentally threaten the safety of the passengers,&quot; concludes spokesperson Hanzelka, adding that the control of the safety of buses is the responsibility of the police and labor offices.
Czech judges in the battle for the seabed
He walks over to the wall-mounted electronic map showing Australia and the adjacent marine areas.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but in a point disappearing in the blue of the ocean.
&quot;The island belongs to Australia, along with the adjacent seabed.
The area, meanwhile, is as big as the continent itself,&quot; says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the UN Division&#39;s 30-member team on ocean and maritime affairs.
His boss, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, director of the division, monitors the explanation, which he sometimes adds to it.
Work force and enthusiasm reign here.
The seabed is rich in natural resources and hides a hitherto little-known world.
Crude oil, ore and other minerals can be found here, as well as hitherto unknown living organisms, which could, for example, be the key to the development of anti-cancer medicine.
Sea floor larger than land
Today, coastal states are intensively applying for new underwater territories.
They assert their rights according to the UN convention, which was agreed upon in Montego Bay, Jamaica, in 1982.
It is primarily the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often extends up to a few hundred kilometers from the coast of the given country.
Such a country has exclusive rights under the Convention to all resources of the continental shelf.
&quot;Simplified, we consider the continental shelf to be the part of the seabed and the layer lying below, which is the natural continuation of the land under the sea.
At the borders of the coastal sea, often two hundred nautical miles, the so-called it also extends beyond the border of the exclusive economic zone,&quot; explains Mikulka.
The application that the given country submits to the Committee for Designating the Outer Limits of the Continental Shelf must be supplemented with extensive scientific and technical documentation based on numerous costly researches and measurements.
This is the result of many years of preparatory work.
&quot;One of our tasks is to provide legal and professional-technical assistance to the committee.
So far, the committee has discussed five applications, from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the last three mentioned countries have been successful,&quot; adds Mikulka.
The success of Australia, which was the first to significantly expand its underwater country, has recently caused a stir in the world.
But New Zealand also won - the area of the seabed awarded to it by the commission is about 1.6 million square kilometers, that is, six times larger than the country&#39;s territory.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in research.
The profits from the future use of the seabed, they hope, will be priceless.
Other countries are constantly submitting their applications.
They can do so within ten years from the moment of ratification of the &quot;Montego Bay Convention&quot;.
Where the continental shelf ends, the area of the ocean floor declared by the convention as the &quot;common heritage of mankind&quot; begins.
No country has an exclusive position here.
The right of extraction in this area is given by the international institution established by the convention.
&quot;However, the seabed is not Klondike&quot;, exaggerates director Mikulka, saying that &quot;some of its areas are legally clearly demarcated and their regime is fixed in a contract&quot;.
Czechs in the Pacific Ocean
Part of the seabed also belongs to the Czech Republic today.
It shares this with other countries of the former Eastern bloc in the framework of the joint &quot;Interoceanmetal&quot; organization.
Based on the convention, this organization received the so-called &quot;pioneer investor&quot; status.
It is authorized to produce in the ClarionClipperton zone in the Pacific Ocean, located between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area inspected by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The sea floor is divided there, it is a kind of underwater copy of the Tatras.
&quot;This can be mined in a total area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich deposit of polymetallic ores containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese,&quot; mentions another lawyer, Hindu Pakshi Rajan.
Rober Sandev, Macedonian colleague of the division, presents another example of concretion.
It resembles a potato or, with a little imagination, parchment with magic words that bring the Golem to life.
Dusseldorf&#39;s hopes rest on Frankfurt
The letter of the WestLB board of directors to the bank&#39;s employees is not lacking in big words.
&quot;The central capital market organization of the savings bank financial group&quot; could be created from the merger of the units of the Düsseldorf financial institution and Frankfurt&#39;s Deka-Bank, says the letter published on Monday.
WestLB would bring a permanently profitable &quot;competency block&quot; into such a business.
Such a relationship could give the decisive impetus to further mergers in the provincial banking sector.
This is the reading of when a board wants to prove its ability to act in difficult times.
After all, there is still enormous pressure on the precarious WestLB bank.
Not only from the EU Commission, but also from the Federal Financial Services Authority, which recently informed the state government of North Rhine-Westphalia that the deadline for finding a lasting solution is pressing.
For savings bank customers, however, a kind of relationship between Deka-Bank, famous for its investment funds, and WestLB has been a topic for quite some time - also on the Frankfurt side.
Franz Waas, the head of Deka-Bank, announced at the end of August, when presenting the half-year data, that the merger of the bank located on Mainzer Landstrasse and a provincial bank such as Helaba or WestLB does not make sense.
Nevertheless, Deka&#39;s board of directors, which is made up of representatives of one half of the provincial banks and the other half of the savings bank associations, instructed the board to continue negotiations with WestLB on joint business activities.
During this, the capital market business or certain parts of it may be discussed.
However, financial circles claim, the negotiations have only just begun.
With its 3,000 employees, Deka-Bank, one of the most important employers in the financial sector in Frankfurt, is not the first to be mentioned in connection with the consolidation of the savings bank sector.
For a moment in 2003, it looked like Deka-Bank would merge with Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba.
However, nothing came of this triple alliance.
As soon as the plans were made public, the Hessen provincial government spoke out against Helaba&#39;s interest.
After that, the other two banks did not find each other either.
Instead, the Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz was transferred to the Stuttgart-based Landesbank Baden-Württemberg.
However, the idea of a relationship between Deka-Bank and provincial banks was raised again and again.
Recently, however, Günther Merl, the chairman of the board of Helaba, spoke out against the merger plans with his bank.
Regardless of this, there is a realization that there is a need for the various banks in the commercial sector to approach each other.
Now, after the state assembly elections in Bavaria, the first thing expected is the relationship between BayernLB and Landesbank Baden-Württemberg.
This is not necessarily good news for Helaba.
If the pressure for further mergers increases, it may gradually run out of potential partners.
In southern Germany, it could only be a junior business partner, even though it has weathered the financial crisis significantly better than the Munich and Stuttgart banks.
The merger with WestLB was ruled out at the beginning of the year by Giroverband Hessen-Thüringen, which has an 85% stake in Helaba.
For lack of a better name, it remains NordLB.
However, such geostrategic considerations are only one side of the coin.
On the other side, the question arises as to how the different business models of each bank fit together.
Merl stated in June that the German Association of Savings and Credit Unions has not yet given an answer to the crucial question of what business model should be used to ensure the future of provincial banks.
Finally, the dismemberment of WestLB is also conceivable, which, however, they do not want there as a matter of course.
Thus, the letter from the board of directors there states that they are definitely striving for a &quot;complete solution&quot;.
How this can be reconciled with the merger of the individual units with Deka-Bank is still the music of the future.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as the &quot;Italian weekend&quot;.
This is the first time for Elena, and the third or fourth time for Luca.
But now Elena is here as his girlfriend, and so everything is completely different, says Luca.
Behind them, next to the Kaiser brand five-liter keg, a strong bearded man stands and proves to the approximately 200 people traveling to Oktoberfest what deep sounds he can coax out of his throat.
Elena first caresses Luca&#39;s face, then kisses him.
They arrived in Verona from Bologna.
From here, from the bus parking lot next to the Puorta Nuova train station, four buses depart at 11:45 p.m. with the destination &quot;destinazione Monaco, festa della birra&quot;, expected arrival at 6:30 a.m.
Three buses are reserved mainly for Italians, and the fourth is exclusively for Brazilians.
In one corner of the parking lot, the South Americans were already singing next to their flag, and had already started celebrating during the night.
And so loud that it&#39;s not for Italians - says Marco Guarda.
The buses are owned by Marco, who wears a long, faux-fur-lined coat and wide, silver-rimmed glasses.
He has been traveling to Oktoberfest for five years, this year alone he organized three trips.
There at night, Oktoberfest during the day, home at 10:30 p.m.
Accommodation would just be an unnecessary expense, says Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, which includes a welcome Kaiser beer brewed in accordance with the Bavarian beer purity law, accident insurance and a German-speaking guide - Marco completed a German language course in Frankfurt.
And the buses are already plunging into the night on the highway in the direction of &quot;Brennero&quot;.
No beer, not yet.
The bus soon falls silent, the passengers are asleep.
That&#39;s fine, they&#39;ll still need their strength.
They take a break in Brixen and Holzkirchen, where many Italian buses on highway 8 also take a short break before Munich.
When Marco&#39;s group arrives at the parking lot near the Theresienwiese at 7:30 p.m., there are already nearly 50 other buses that have arrived from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco gives one last briefing, explains the war plan.
First: Everyone put on the yellow hat.
On the left side of it is the inscription &quot;Oktoberfest&quot; written in fractured letters, next to it is the internet address of Marco&#39;s travel agency: &quot;conoscersiviaggiando.it&quot;.
Second: &quot;When the beer tent gates open, run,&quot; Marco shouts into the morning.
&quot;Running!&quot; Running and occupying the places in the back of the tent.
&quot;Not forward, because we&#39;ll get stuck, and don&#39;t all the yellow caps sit at the same benches, but let&#39;s spread out in the tent!&quot;
A one-liter pint costs €8.25, shouts Marco.
And don&#39;t forget the tip.
&quot;Show the security guards that you behaved well!
As you leave your seats, they will be taken!&quot;
Third: &quot;Be here again at half past eleven tonight!&quot; Did you understand?
And it&#39;s time for Wiesn.
Along the way, one of the men ties yellow caps to trees, signs, and even to the election poster of one of the large Bavarian people&#39;s parties as road signs.
You have to prepare for retreat.
This is the second weekend of Oktoberfest, known as the &quot;Italian weekend&quot;.
There are no exact figures; They talk about 50,000 people who cross the Alps and rush into the beer tents, ten percent of all the visitors of the weekend are said to come from Italy.
The Munich police are reinforced by seven South Tyrolean policemen, Italian volunteers help the Bavarian Red Cross, whose national statistics show that the Italians occupy the first place with about 200 medical cares, ahead of the Austrians (about 80) and the British, who are at the bottom of the ladder (about 60 ).
The Hofbräu beer tent is particularly popular among Italians.
Sleepless nights for Hypo Real Estate lenders
The German banking system is relatively stable, Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück emphasized just last week.
It is fortunate that the politician used the word &quot;relatively&quot; and even included in his speech that the German banking sector is not spared by crisis-like developments.
Because this happened this weekend.
Daxon-listed Munich-based real estate financing company Hypo Real Estate (HRE) received a billion dollar loan from a consortium of German banks to protect itself against market turbulence.
A person with knowledge of the situation told Reuters on Monday that the loan subsidies amount to 35 billion euros.
Hypo Real Estate only has to pay interest on the part used.
The money comes partly from private and partly from public banks.
The background lies in the losses of the Depfa subsidiary.
According to a newspaper report, Depfa, which carries out state financing, lent money for long-term projects and refinanced itself for an extremely short term - which is now not possible due to the distrust prevailing in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank&#39;s cash reserve decreased by 95 percent to 2.37 million euros, and the share of equity decreased moderately, from 1.6 to 1.45 percent.
Current income and net income from financial transactions fell to zero compared to the same period of the previous year, and income from credits for receivables and specified securities, as well as from the liquidation of loan business provisions fell by more than 70 percent to 5 million euros.
Only thanks to the higher income from the reimbursement of the subsequent settlement costs of the transformation of the former Depfa group, as well as the reimbursement of interest according to the levy decree and the business brought to the companies belonging to the concern, the revenue deficit of around 16% was relatively moderate.
After privatization in 1990, the former state financier first speculated with corporate real estate loans, which were later segregated in Aeral Bank.
Since there was little to be gained with classic state financing, Depfa threw itself more strongly into infrastructure projects and joint projects between private investors and the state (private-public-partnership, PPP), and expanded its activities internationally.
Hypo Real Estate must now write down the value of its subsidiaries that has a &quot;significant impact&quot; on the group&#39;s income statement, they said quite generally.
It is a fact that no dividend was paid.
By 2007, the dividend had already been reduced to a third.
Since taking over Depfa, Hypo Real Estate has become a major state and infrastructure financier.
Compared to other financial institutions, it is more dependent on interbank market refinancing, as it does not have customer deposits.
With the collapse of US investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, lending between banks has dried up as banks conserve liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term assets every year to refinance a part of Depfa&#39;s loan portfolio - about 50 billion euros.
According to Hypo Real Estate&#39;s statement, the group&#39;s financing needs are covered by the loan for the foreseeable future, and the company is protected &quot;from the influence of the currently largely dysfunctional international financial markets.&quot;
According to other sources, thanks to the money, the refinancing is secured until the end of 2009.
On the other hand, Georg Funke, the chairman of the board of HRE, stated that the Hypo Real Estate group will not have to use the financial markets for the foreseeable future.
The German Bundesbank and the Federal Financial Services Authority (BaFin) consider that the marketability of the Hypo Real Estate group is now secured.
This gives hope to the bank&#39;s shareholders and creditors.
But due to the dynamics and immeasurable nature of the crisis, they cannot be certain.
It is not even inconceivable that the financing will not be used in full.
But the opposite cannot be ruled out either.
According to the late Saturday evening news, the bank was on the verge of bankruptcy, even its temporary rescue could not calm the mood.
The share price fell by 75 percent to EUR 3.30.
In contrast, bond prices are holding up quite well.
While the debts ranked first hardly change, the prices of the bonds ranked further down have fallen significantly.
The crisis particularly affects the bonds of the former subsidiary, Württemberg Hypo, and apparently the maturities beyond 2009.
While Hypo Real Estate bonds were previously seen as a speculative investment alternative, their stability in value must now be considered dependent on the stability of the international financial system following the intensification of the banking crisis and the fact that the financial institution almost brought the crisis home with the takeover of Depfa.
As long as the central banks, governments and less vulnerable commercial banks are still ready to support the system, the starting point is the repayment of the annuities on time.
Or what happens, which almost no one dares to hope for at the moment, is that the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, seeing the reports related to partial nationalization, the probability bordering on certainty has now turned into a mere legitimate hope.
For long-term lenders, the decision to part with their investment can cause sleepless nights.
However, short-term investors can use the sale to build a reserve for taxes on future years&#39; capital gains.
German special forces were present at the hostage rescue
The Egyptian government asked Germany for help in solving the hostage crisis - and the experts came.
When the situation became serious, the special units were ready, but they were not deployed.
More and more details are coming to light about the rescue of eleven European tourists kidnapped in Egypt.
According to data from the Ministry of National Defense and the Ministry of the Interior, German special forces were also indirectly involved in the rescue operation.
According to this, in addition to the specialists of the German Federal Army, the employees of GSG 9, the flying squadron of the German Federal Police, and the Federal Criminal Office, as well as the logistics experts of the German Technical Service, were also at the scene of the rescue.
German forces were not needed, however, as the hostage-takers let their captives run and then fled when they recognized the signs of a violent hostage rescue, according to ministry spokesmen on Monday evening.
The Egyptian government accepted the help offered by Germany in order to enlist it as a support force on the ground.
&quot;Fortunately, this did not happen,&quot; said the spokesperson of the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
The attackers kidnapped the tourist group consisting of five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian woman, and their eight Egyptian companions on September 19 in the southern part of Egypt.
After the kidnapping in the desert area of southern Egypt, the hostages were dragged back and forth across the borders of Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hostage takers remains unclear, as do the details of the release of the hostages or possible ransom payments.
In the meantime, the survivors arrived safely in Cairo.
Steinmeier announced that the freed hostages were under the protection of the German embassy.
He did not comment on the details of the release.
So far, no information has been provided in Berlin about when they will return to Germany.
According to the &quot;Bild&quot; daily newspaper, the five tourists and the special forces will arrive in Germany on Tuesday in an Airbus plane of the German Air Force.
Sylvanas and the secrets of the bento box
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop has to introduce herself to Tachibana High School on her first day of school, the girls start giggling: The German girl is totally &quot;kawaii&quot;!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from the manga - she talks about Japan in her new exchange student blog.
&quot;The first day of school in Japan.
I was very nervous.
I was on my way to school already.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo, towards Kawasaki, and I travel 40 minutes by train to Tachibana Highschool.
I had to find the way alone, luckily I didn&#39;t get lost.
It seems that the beginning of teaching is not taken as seriously at Tachibana as it is back home in Lower Saxony.
The students start filing in at eight o&#39;clock until a short conversation with the teacher, the &quot;home room&quot;, begins at 8:40 a.m.
But before the class started, it was my turn to introduce myself.
I&#39;m not the type who enjoys talking to people, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
Since I didn&#39;t have my school uniform yet, I put on an old skirt from my landlady, a blouse, blue knee-highs and black leather shoes.
So I stood in front of the chair in this outfit and tried to pronounce everything correctly: &quot;Sajonara, vo se Sylvana...&quot; - My name is Sylvana, I&#39;m from Germany, and my birthday will be in a week.
At this moment, I was very happy that I had already started learning the language two years ago.
All 31 girls were whispering, giggling and waving and I kept hearing the word &quot;kawaí&quot;.
I already knew this from my manga.
It belongs to the basic vocabulary of Japanese girls and means &quot;cute, sweet.&quot;
Then I quickly slid into place.
The girl sitting next to me smiled widely, she felt honored that the exchange student was seated next to her.
The rest of the class was fairly quiet, but when the bell rang, they duly rushed.
Everyone was talking and laughing and digging holes in my stomach with their questions - and it&#39;s quite difficult to understand the Japanese&#39;s English.
During the break, everyone unpacked their bentos.
My host also prepared such a lunch for me - it is completely different from the boring German ten o&#39;clock sandwiches.
I got spicy rice, small sausages, a salad made of cucumber and algae, fruit and a kind of meat wrapped in tofu.
Most of the time I have no idea what I&#39;m eating here in Japan.
The food looks strange and tastes completely novel.
In fact, everything is very delicious.
Well, yes, except maybe the salty plum jam, brrrr!
In Japanese schools, bento is more than just lunch.
It happens that a girl gives a boy a handmade bento, which she puts together in a particularly artistic way - in the hope that she can get to know the boy better during the lunch break.
I read about it in my manga comics.
I wonder if I can observe this here as well.
&quot;Why Japan?&quot; - asked my friends when I told them that I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I always answered:
&quot;Because it simply fascinates you.&quot;
After all, I&#39;ve been reading manga for years now.
And in order to better understand the comics and the culture described in them, I started learning Japanese at some point.
So it was quite clear to me that I would have to travel here at some point.
Because I am attracted to tradition and customs.
And these are highly valued here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest techniques and trends - on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I&#39;ve never felt lost, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I&#39;ve ever seen.&quot;
The US House of Representatives rejects the bailout.
The lower house of the US Congress defeated the proposed $700 billion rescue package for the financial markets by a small majority.
The Dow Jones plummeted.
The US House of Representatives rejected the government&#39;s rescue package for financial markets by a vote of 227 to 206.
Despite the appeals of US President George W. Bush and leading politicians of both parties, the program, which was intended to curb the chaos prevailing on the financial markets, did not receive a majority.
Supporters desperately tried to convince critics of the need for the $700 billion package in a dramatic move.
Barney Frank, one of the leaders of the negotiations of the Democratic Party, called on the representatives to support, even if the plan is unpopular.
&quot;It&#39;s hard to get political support to avoid something that hasn&#39;t happened yet,&quot; he admitted.
The Dow Jones plunged more than 6 percent or 600 points during the voting.
Investors were worried that the state rescue package might fail.
The index rose shortly before the end of the vote, only to fall again after the failure became public.
Experts expect further serious turbulence on the international financial markets.
The approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate is required for the program to enter into force.
Rats have feelings too.
A rat or a moth flees in case of danger. Does this mean you feel fear?
Neurologist Joseph LeDoux is convinced: Animals have emotions too.
But how can we check if they feel the same when they behave like us?
Famous scientists have been publishing their articles in the Internet journal &quot;Edge&quot; for years.
In one of SPIEGEL ONLINE&#39;s series, &quot;What do you think is real, without being able to prove it?&quot; select from the answers received to the question.
I believe that animals have emotions and other states of consciousness, without me or anyone else being able to prove it so far. It is true that we cannot even prove that other people have consciousness.
In this case, however, we can at least hope that the basic configuration of all human brains is the same.
However, as soon as we look at other species and dissect issues of perception or consciousness in general, we get into difficult terrain because the hardware doesn&#39;t match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same thing as many other animals: It pretends to be dead, runs away or attacks.
People behave in similar ways, from which some researchers infer comparable subjective experiences.
However, I do not believe in this.
Two aspects of brain structure make it difficult to transfer our own subjective experiences to those of animals.
On the one hand, circuits associated with human consciousness almost always include the lateral prefrontal cortex (due to its role in short-term memory and executive/control functions).
This broad area is more highly developed in humans than in other primates and appears to be entirely absent in other organisms.
At least for those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, such as the awareness of who we are, or the ability to plan and make decisions, it is reasonable to assume that humans differ even from other primates.
Another dramatic feature lies in the linguistic nature of man: Because a significant part of human experience is related to language, it is often claimed that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals may be excluded.
However, even if consciousness did not depend on language, language would certainly influence it, so animal consciousness, whatever its nature, is likely to be very different from most of our states of consciousness.
Therefore, it is difficult to establish what consciousness might be like in the case of other animals.
If consciousness cannot be measured as an internal and subjective thing, and because of the special hardware it cannot be analyzed based on our own experiences, then your research presents us with serious problems.
Most of my explanations concern the content of conscious experience, but there is also another aspect of consciousness that is probably more accessible to science.
The conscious processes of animals could be examined regardless of their content, and this is exactly what happens in experiments on primate short-term memory, especially in the example of visualization.
However, during this assumption, also examined by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, they rely more on the neural connections of consciousness than on causal mechanisms: Both may or may not be the same.
Interestingly, this assumption also emphasizes the importance of the prefrontal cortex in the creation of visualization.
What does this mean for emotions?
I attribute this to the fact that an emotional system, like that of fear, is activated in a brain that is aware of its own activity.
What we call &quot;fear&quot; is therefore the mental state we are in when the activity of the defense system localized in the brain (or its consequences, such as bodily reactions) occupies working memory.
Examined in this way, emotions are closely related to those areas of the cerebral cortex that are characteristic of primates and especially humans.
In addition to language, perception is divided into subtle degrees, because with the help of words and grammar, we are able to distinguish and categorize states in order to describe them to others as well as ourselves.
In contrast, Antonio Damasio, for example, is of the opinion that emotions arise from the simpler activities of the body perception areas of the cerebral cortex and brainstem, as does Jaak Pankseep, who, however, focuses more on the brainstem.
Since this network has not changed much during human evolution, it could easily play a role in emotions across species.
I cannot refute this purely theoretically, but I consider it unprovable.
Pankseep believes that what appears to be fear in rats and humans is likely to be felt in both cases: How could one verify that rats and humans feel the same thing when they behave similarly?
A cockroach runs away in case of danger, does it also feel fear?
In my opinion, mere similar behavior is not proof of the same experience.
Although the neural comparison helps further: rats and humans have similar brainstems, while cockroaches don&#39;t even have a brain.
But is the brainstem responsible for emotions?
And even if this could be proven in humans: how could we prove it in rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even cockroaches (who knows?) have emotions.
However, I don&#39;t know how to prove this.
And since their emotions are suspected to be fundamentally different from ours (since human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I research the emotional behavior of rats rather than their emotional feelings.
In any case, progress in this area is promising at the neural level, if we measure the same thing in rats and humans.
Just as I do not research language and consciousness in the case of rats, neither do I research emotions, since I do not know whether they exist.
To others, this may seem like a short-sighted attitude, but I&#39;d rather move forward than keep hitting a wall.
After all, I am a practical emotionalist.
Platini, UEFA president: Grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Vashyunik announced that the preparations will soon come under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
&quot;The government sees UEFA&#39;s decision in Bordeaux as a sign of trust in Ukraine and a proof that they believe that Ukraine can organize the European Championship together with Poland,&quot; Vasyunik said.
&quot;However, this does not mean amnesty for our country.
The work has only just begun, and there is still much to do in both countries.&quot;
Both host countries are behind in the construction of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports.
It is possible that the number of EC stadiums will be reduced from eight to six.
&quot;We can&#39;t waste any more time.
We have to work at top speed now,&quot; said Grigoriy Surkis, president of the Football Association of Ukraine.
&quot;UEFA will keep an eye on us.&quot;
In Poland, they decided to take an even more radical step.
After several scandals, the National Olympic Committee suspended the leadership of the Polish PZPN federation, which was replaced by independent supervisory commissioner Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission met at the initiative of the Minister of Sports Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is a &quot;serious danger that the PZPN will not be able to operate according to the rules,&quot; Drzewiecki told the Polish PAP news agency.
&quot;We have assured Michel Platini, the president of UEFA, in a letter that this will not adversely affect the preparations for the 2012 EC.&quot;
Only last season, several first league teams had to be relegated to the lower division due to manipulation, and finally the start of the league had to be postponed.
Directors are registering more and more bookings.
It promises to be a good winter for German tour operators.
According to a study, the turnover of travel reservations for the following months increased significantly compared to the previous year - by more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite the weak economic outlook, Germans&#39; desire to travel has not waned, according to the study.
In terms of bookings for the winter season, travel agencies recorded a 31 percent increase in traffic compared to the previous year, the German Travel Association (DRV) announced on Monday in Berlin.
According to an investigation by the GfK market research institute, the number of bookings in the autumn months is even higher.
The turnover of travel agencies in October exceeded that of October 2007 by roughly 11 percent, the DRV announced.
These results are based on data from GfK, which evaluates the monthly booking data of 1,200 German travel agencies and then extrapolates it to the entire market.
The institute took into account trips booked until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak dollar exchange rate, trips to the USA are in particular demand, DRV said.
Here, the rate of bookings increased by around a third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as the domestic landscapes, are particularly popular destinations for Germans.
Organized trips are the most popular, said Klaus Laepple, president of the DRV.
Due to rising energy and food costs, the costs for organized trips &quot;are more calculable for passengers than for individually organized trips.&quot;
Among other things, passengers can save money with pre-booking discounts or all-inclusive offers, Laepple added.
The booking rate for the summer months was also very good, so it will be possible to record an increase in traffic compared to the previous year - although according to another study, fewer German tourists undertook to travel compared to the previous year.
An outraged Dennis Quaid fights back
The actress wanted to promote a new film, in the interview she talked about her private life - and now she has problems with her ex-husband. Hollywood star Meg Ryan described her ex-husband Dennis Quaid as an adulterer.
He who scolds - and fights back
Belated war of roses for the ex-couple Meg Ryan - Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors are having an ugly fight with each other - in public.
In an interview with the American magazine InStyle last week, Meg Ryan spoke for the first time about the reasons for the divorce: &quot;Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, which caused a lot of pain.&quot;
It wasn&#39;t until after the divorce that Meg found out how many women Dennis had cheated on her with.
The mental strip came about because of Ryan&#39;s press work for his new film, &quot;The Women,&quot; which tells the story of an adulterer.
Dennis Quaid reacted strongly to his declaration of an unfaithful husband: &quot;It&#39;s terrible,&quot; the 54-year-old actor told the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;, &quot;that Meg repeats and retells the story of our relationship over and over again.&quot;
It is also &quot;unfortunate&quot; that their 16-year-old son, Jack, is repeatedly &quot;publicly reminded of the pain and change that divorce causes a child.&quot;
While Ryan has been single since his divorce, Quaid has remarried and recently became a father to twins.
Therefore, his answer ends with the following aside: &quot;My life goes on anyway.
I can consider myself happy that I have a wonderful family in which everything is in perfect order.&quot;
The prices of plane tickets and hotel rooms are reduced
In the first half of 2008, European flights and accommodation were cheaper than the previous year.
According to a current study, flights in Germany are no less than 50 percent cheaper.
The prices of flights and hotel rooms have become more favorable again - this is how the results of a study by the travel and financial service provider American Express can be summarized.
The company analyzed its booking data for the first half of 2008 and found a significant price drop in the second quarter after the first quarter price increase.
After years of rising prices in the hotel market, accommodation has already become cheaper in many places.
Between January and March, prices rose by an average of 6.9 percent compared to 2007 in 41 of the 48 surveyed European cities.
However, in the period from April to June, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than the previous year.
This trend was most clearly shown in Paris and Rome, where guests had to pay 30-37 percent less than a year earlier.
American Express sees the reason for this in the low exchange rate of the dollar, which has led to &quot;the waning appetite of American tourists to travel&quot;.
The drop in hotel room rates affects financial centers such as Frankfurt or London more than industrial cities such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
The 26.3 percent increase in hotel prices in the Norwegian city is a European record.
Air ticket prices also showed an upward trend in the first quarter.
Due to the increase in the price of kerosene, passengers in economy class had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, and long-haul flights with high fuel demand rose by 29.2 percent.
Between April and June, the prices of economy class plane tickets fell by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but the prices of business and first class only showed a much more moderate change.
In Germany, prices fell even more than in other European countries.
Between January and March, prices rose by 11.9 percent, and fell by 23.6 percent in the second quarter.
According to the study, the price of domestic flights in Germany has halved.
The reason for the price drop lies, on the one hand, in the declining economic growth, the company claims.
Demand weakened in many segments of the air travel market.
On the other hand, due to the Open Skies agreement liberalizing air travel between the USA and Europe, the pressure exerted by the competitive situation is increasing.
The tense situation is confirmed by the airlines canceling their unprofitable flights, and many airlines declared bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - 24 airlines in Europe alone.
HSV beats Gladbach 1:0
Hamburger SV topped the table with one goal and simple methods.
At Borussia, Luhukay is still unable to find a functional team.
Kristoffer Klein zoom Deep flight for the national team Marko Marin.
The Gladbach player only came on late and his lift bounced off the post.
His precisely worded message left his lips convincingly.
He just knew he was right.
&quot;We need the second goal,&quot; Hermann Rieger hissed in the corridor leading to the cabins of the Hamburg arena.
Not much was happening in the catacombs, recess was over and most people were back in their seats.
Rieger was HSV&#39;s physiotherapist for nearly three decades, and enjoys more prestige than some former players.
Thus, his request was heard in the competent place.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and gave a thumbs up in agreement.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg head coach Martin Jol.
His order could have been similar: Here with the second goal!
The command failed to execute.
&quot;It wasn&#39;t always a pretty sight today,&quot; admitted Marcell Jansen later.
Bastian Reinhardt also &quot;imagined&quot; the matter more loosely.
The 1: 0 (1: 0) result was thanks to a header from Hamburger Mladen Petric (11th); and to the circumstance that the very weak Gladbachians could not inflict pain on the weak Hamburgers.
&quot;It was a dirty victory,&quot; summed up Martin Jol.
Hamburger SV will be 121 years old this Monday.
Already on Saturday afternoon, the spectators celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the table displayed on the projector, which showed their team as the league leader.
It will be a birthday without a party.
&quot;We know where to put it,&quot; said Marcell Jansen.
He guesses that the intermediate certificate of the table indicates the unpredictability of the league rather than the dominance of HSV.
Although the team is slowly finding its way thanks to its late signings - Neves and Silva from Brazil, goalkeeper Petric and Jansen acquired from FC Bayern - it is not yet brilliant.
&quot;We need more flair and trickery,&quot; Jol demanded.
My first Oktoberfest
Non-stop ballermann hits, pints of beer and celebrities wearing designer dirndls.
Debut at Wiesnen.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I don&#39;t actually have much in common.
She is blonde, a TV presenter and wears a tailored dirndl.
My hair is dark, I&#39;m a student, and I bought my dress at the thrift store.
However, we have one thing in common: We are barely three minutes into the Wiesen and the photographers are already rushing us and filling up their memory cards - very flattering, and all this on my first visit to the Wiesen.
This is how we make friends.
The cheap dirndl seems to serve its purpose.
As a Wiesn tourist who lives north of the equator made of white sausage, my sense of comfort is still limited by the national costume.
But upon arriving at the Theresienwiese, things are not so dire anymore.
Almost everyone wears dirndls or leather pants; no one looks cross or awkward - everything is perfectly fine.
My dirndl apron is the only thing that gets strange looks at the chocolate banana stand.
A woman from Munich draws my attention to the fact that I tied the apron wrong: &quot;Tied to the left you are free, in the middle you are a virgin, to the right you are sold, in the back you are a widow.&quot;
I secretly tied the bow from the back to the left.
&quot;That&#39;s good,&quot; he says and laughs.
Others make less of a fuss about subtle flirting techniques and wear simple felt hats with the words &quot;I&#39;m too drunk to dress up&quot; and unsolicited bare behinds.
The young man with exhibitionist traits is called Bob, and he also visited Oktoberfest for the first time.
Which he finds very awesome, stretching out the &quot;aaaaa&quot; for a long time.
He tells me all this after getting rid of the contents of the pint he drank earlier.
Right next to one of the hydrants that everyone sees as a trash can.
So Bob is one of the infamous &quot;forbidden peeers.&quot;
Others are not so lucky to get rid of alcohol in this way.
At around eight o&#39;clock in the evening, the ambulances march through the scene in droves and take care of the poor couples.
Nurses always appear in teams - four at a time carry a covered stretcher from tent to tent.
It works like most Wiesn visitors: Arrive empty, leave packed.
It is not visible who is lying in the alcohol coffin under the tarpaulin.
&quot;These are the ones who are completely ready,&quot; one of the paramedics shouts to me in response to my question, then in the whirlwind.
After the vote
Fear is running through Wall Street.
As a result of the first news about the failure of the rescue package, the Dow Jones temporarily fell 700 points.
It was the largest loss of points in one day in its history.
Later, the Dow rallied somewhat.
At 8:30 p.m., the world&#39;s most important stock market barometer was down by a good 5 percent and stood at 10,579 points.
The Nasdaq, which trades in technology papers, fell by more than seven percent to 1,548 points.
The Dow&#39;s biggest loser at this point was American Express with a 14% loss, followed by Bank of America with 12 percent.
Not a single paper has been strengthened.
Goldman Sachs bank shares fell nearly 10 percent.
Just a few days earlier, the big investor Warren Buffett bought a stake in the bank.
As part of the rescue operation, funds are planned to be made available for the purchase of so-called doubtful mortgage securities.
However, they do not want to pay the amount all at once, but gradually.
In exchange, the state would receive stock option vouchers from financial institutions, which could be redeemed if the exchange rates were appropriate, reducing the burden on the state coffers.
European and American stock prices are on the decline
The multibillion-dollar aid granted to European and American banks does not dispel investors&#39; doubts.
Major German bank Hypo Real Estate&#39;s share price falls and drags Dax down.
The American Dow Jones index is declining despite the planned rescue of the financial market by the state.
The spectacular exchange rate losses of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank pushed the German stock index (Dax) deep into the red.
The value of the Munich real estate financier&#39;s share fell by a quarter despite the rescue action of the federal government and private banks, Commerzbank weakened by more than 20 percent.
The Dax sank below the psychologically important 6,000-point mark and recorded a 3.7 percent loss of 5,839 points.
Stock markets around the world were brought to their knees.
In New York, Wall Street opened with a significant loss.
Investors fear that the US government&#39;s $700 billion bailout will not be enough to boost financial markets.
In the first hour of trading, the Dow lost 334 points, or 3.3 percent, to 10,809.25 points.
The US House of Representatives wanted to vote on the rescue plan, the Senate vote could take place on October 1.
The other European stock markets also knew only one direction: in London, the FTSE index showed a 3.2 percent decline, and in Paris, the CAC 40 lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, the Japanese Nikkei index fell by 1.26 percent to 11,743.61 points after the initial gain.
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index fell by 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.
The Indian Sensex index fell 506.43 points, or 3.9 percent, and closed at 12,595.75 points.
On the Mdax stock exchange, Arcandor&#39;s shares weakened after the announcement of the capital increase.
The scarf. Private bank Oppenheimer subscribed 23 million new shares.
The trade and tourism group also said that the Thomas Cook shares would not be sold.
Dark matter affects the flight of space probes
A mysterious phenomenon has puzzled researchers for years. Dark matter affects the speed of spacecraft during the so-called swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein&#39;s general theory of relativity may not be entirely correct.
The &quot;Ulysses&quot; spacecraft flew in space for almost 18 years.
He is in danger of freezing to death due to soon-to-freeze fuel lines.
A mysterious phenomenon, the swing-by anomaly, has been causing confusion among scientists for years.
Swing-by refers to the gravitational swing maneuver of spacecraft, during which they gain additional momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, for example, Earth.
Thus, the probes can save a large amount of fuel.
The European-American Cassini-Huygens probe, like the Ulysses solar probe, also used this physics trick.
However, what has amazed researchers for years: Flying objects do not behave completely as expected based on the ancient law of gravity.
Instead, abnormalities in speed occur.
Probes speed up or slow down unexpectedly.
Physicists have not yet found an explanation for this effect.
The phenomenon was dubbed the swing-by anomaly.
Some experts fear that even Albert Einstein&#39;s general theory of relativity, which conceives the mass attraction of matter as the curvature of space, may not be entirely correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler of Princeton&#39;s Institute for Advanced Study remains adamant that Einstein was not mistaken and tries to explain the swing-by anomaly with the so-called dark matter that astronauts have discovered in the universe.
&quot;The anomaly may be caused by dark matter, which may even be found close to Earth,&quot; writes Adler.
Space researchers learned about the existence of dark matter only ten years ago.
It apparently exerts a gravitational force that can be observed to affect other celestial bodies.
However, the material itself is completely invisible, that is, it does not emit or reflect any kind of electromagnetic radiation, especially visible light.
According to scientists&#39; calculations, a good fifth of the total mass of the universe consists of dark matter.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt have been released
After spending ten days in the captivity of their captors, the tourists abducted in Egypt are free again - confirmed the Italian foreign minister.
The Sudanese kidnappers demanded a ransom of several million euros.
In the shootout before the release of the hostages, six hostage takers were reportedly killed.
Five German citizens were kidnapped in southern Egypt.
Negotiations on the ransom are already underway.
Again and again, Germans become the target of kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE reports on the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are free.
This was reported unanimously by the Egyptian state television, the Arabic TV station Al-Arabija and the Italian media.
According to the reports of the Italian television station Sky TG 24, the Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the fact of the release: &quot;Our compatriots and the other hostages have been freed.
We are currently investigating their state of health,&quot; Frattini said.
The five Germans, five Italians, and one Romanian citizen, as well as their eight Egyptian companions, are safe and sound, Egyptian state television reported.
The 19 participants of the desert expedition are said to be already on their way to Cairo.
The reason for the shooting before the release of the hostages remains unclear: An Egyptian security official said the hostage-takers had already expressed their willingness to release the hostages when the Sudanese army unexpectedly killed six of them.
&quot;The problem is solved.
They accepted the ransom,&quot; the official said.
&quot;The discussion was only about taking over the hostages,&quot; when &quot;the surprise&quot; suddenly occurred.
Sudanese soldiers shot dead six kidnappers and arrested two on the border between Sudan, Chad and Egypt on Sunday.
The hostage takers demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money was supposed to be given to the German wife of one of the hostages.
The &quot;al-Masri al-Jom&quot; daily reported, citing a German mediator, that the release of the hostages is being delayed because the kidnappers are worried about their own safety.
According to the report, the hostage takers will release the female hostages after paying the ransom.
The men are held by the kidnappers until a safe escape route is found.
The German embassy in Cairo declined to comment on the report.
The police named the victim of the accident
Police have named the 63-year-old woman who was hit by a vehicle in Essex County and died in hospital.
Brentwood resident Carole Paulson of Chelmsford Road was involved in the accident on Shenfield Road in the town on Friday afternoon.
He was taken to Queen&#39;s Hospital in Romford, but later died.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of careless driving.
He has since been released on bail.
The stepfather&#39;s violence &quot;led to suicide&quot;.
It was heard in court that a woman committed suicide because her stepfather had abused her for years.
Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithians, Cornwall, spent six years in prison after pleading guilty to eight counts of attempted rape.
Truro Crown Court heard he regularly tied up his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle between the ages of five and seven.
In one of Trerise&#39;s confessions, she wrote: &quot;I feel responsible for his death.&quot;
At the trial, it was said that Randle committed suicide at the age of 34, in his home in the Mutley district of Plymouth, on April 1, 2007.
As a child living in Coventry, Trerise bound and blindfolded herself before intercourse while her mother worked in a pub.
Trerise separated from his wife in the 1980s and returned to Cornwall.
Her stepdaughter moved to Plymouth.
However, the court heard that Miss Randle, who spent a lot of time volunteering with the National Trust, was haunted by twice-weekly nightmares of the violence.
In 2006, prosecutor Ramsey Quaife told the court that Miss Randle, who used to be passionate about surfing and cycling, was said by friends to be &quot;emotionally dead&quot; and &quot;had given up on life&quot;.
In April 2007, her father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her Plymouth apartment.
He probably suffocated himself with a bag.
Mr Randle clashed with his daughter&#39;s stepfather, who ended his testimony in a letter saying: &quot;I always bound and blindfolded her.
I didn&#39;t sexually harass you.
I feel responsible for his death.&quot;
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: &quot;You are an extremely strange fetishist and it must have been horrific for your victim, especially when she was only seven years old.
This unpleasant family affair ended with the victim committing suicide.
However, what is even more thought-provoking is the fact that if he had not done so, the case might never have come to court.&quot;
The judge added: &quot;I would like to draw your attention to the impact that Stephanie&#39;s parents believe your crime has had on their daughter over the years.
Had this not happened, she would probably have been a hopeful, successful and happy young woman.&quot;
The official who lost the important data was charged
According to the BBC, the government official who left top secret documents on a train in June has been charged with breach of official secrecy.
The man was on an expert mission from the Ministry of Defense when he left two top secret documents on a train to Waterloo.
The documents were passed on to the BBC before being handed over to the police.
This is the least serious charge of breaking the law and there is no suspicion of intent.
Frank Gardner, the BBC&#39;s correspondent for the Ministry of Defence, said the move had surprised many in Whitehall.
&quot;They thought the Ministry of Defense and the government would handle the case as an internal matter,&quot; he said.
The employee, who cannot be named, is defined in Article 8.1 of the law. was indicted on the basis of point This paragraph is about information retention.
The Crown Prosecution Service recommended that the Metropolitan Police prosecute the official because of the highly sensitive nature of his work with the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he lost included secret assessments of al-Qaeda and the capabilities of the Iraqi military.
He was informed of the decision on Monday, and was then moved from his home to an unknown location.
The housing cooperatives pay the bill for the B&amp;B
Britain&#39;s housing associations face a bill of more than £80 million after the bailout of Bradford &amp; Bingley bank.
The government spent £14 billion protecting the deposits of 2.6 million account holders at Bradford &amp; Bingley.
The interest on this loan will be paid by all the companies that use depositors&#39; money, including 59 housing cooperatives.
Building Societies Association (BSA) chairman Adrian Coles said it was &quot;annoying&quot; that societies and their members had to pay.
The £14 billion loan will eventually be repaid after Bradford &amp; Bingley&#39;s mortgages have been repaid.
However, the interest accumulated in the meantime is charged annually to the 700 financial companies that use the loans.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 housing cooperatives are among them.
It is annoying that the institutions that have been acting cautiously until now ... have to pay the bills of those institutions that were much less careful.
Adrian Coles, BSA
We learned that each company must pay in proportion to the amount of deposit it holds. The companies share 18% of the costs among themselves.
According to the estimates of the Ministry of Finance, the amount of the loan will reach 450 million pounds in 2009.
This means the companies will need to set aside £81m to pay interest in the first year.
Adrian Coles, chief executive of the housing association union, told the BBC that he thought the measure was unfair.
&quot;It is outrageous that those institutions have to pay the bills of much less prudent institutions that acted prudently during the boom in the housing market.&quot;
According to the BSA, no company has gone bankrupt since they began operations in 1945.
&quot;We need to look at all aspects of this case over the next few weeks to decide how we can protect housing associations and their members from a significant bill,&quot; Cole added.
The interest due in 2009 covers 7 months from the end of September to the end of March of this year.
In 2010, a full year&#39;s interest will have to be paid, which may be twice the current rate.
Since housing cooperatives are self-help organizations without shareholders, the members will eventually have to foot the bill, either through higher fees or lower interest earned on their deposits.
Turkey&#39;s expanding diplomatic horizons
Long before Turkey intended to join the European Union, European powers were eager to penetrate deep into the Turkish hinterland.
On the eastern side of the Bosphorus, perhaps only 20 paces from the European border, stands one of the grandest relics of a failed imperial aspiration.
The Hydarpasha railway station was designed by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu, in the Neo-Renaissance style.
At least that&#39;s what the guidebooks say.
The building wraps around the end of the platforms, with a tower at the front corner of each, and looks like a German country town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building is a bit run down.
However, looking at the interior of the vaulted ticket office, it is obvious what a large-scale enterprise this westernmost gate was.
The station was opened in August 1908 by the German consortium Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, the &quot;late future&quot; of conquests, wanted to realize its ambitions to conquer the Middle East with the help of this railway leading from Damascus through Baghdad to today&#39;s Saudi Arabia.
German conquest efforts collapsed during World War I.
Its railway lines were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arab partisans.
The relative isolation from the surrounding regions caused by the frozen borders of the Cold War has disappeared.
The British colonial army withdrew from Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
Hyderpasha station did not fare any better.
In 1917, an ammunition train exploded and destroyed the building&#39;s elaborate roof.
According to Turkish sources, a sabotage action took place.
Since then, it has slowly fallen into disrepair and has been well overrun by history.
At the same time, today, as the railway gate to Anatolia and the entire eastern region, it serves - at least in a symbolic sense - as Turkey&#39;s expanding diplomatic horizon.
The ruling Justice and Development Party - the AKP - developed a completely new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from the surrounding regions caused by the frozen borders of the Cold War has disappeared.
The new policy is characterized by commitment.
It is noteworthy that the Turkish government maintains good relations with Israel and Syria, the Palestinian groups of Hamas and Fatah, Iraq, Iran, and, of course, the European Union and the United States.
I wanted to gauge the parameters of the new foreign policy, so I boarded the night train to the Turkish capital, Ankara, to visit one of the AKP&#39;s leading foreign policy experts, Turkish parliament member Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning, approx. after ten and a half hours of jostling, which at the time provided the rhythm of the famous documentary about the old world, &quot;The Night Mail&quot;, I arrived in the Turkish capital. The new city is intended to be a symbol of the new, secular state, turning its back on the Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, which is known to have Islamic roots, represents a paradigm shift in the Turkish consensus.
This raised some suspicion in the West, especially in Washington.
I took a taxi to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern, purpose-built stone and steel building - located in a developing suburban area, between half-finished shopping malls and coffee houses. In the latter, middle managers in suits - both men and women - meet to make deals early in the morning.
Suat Kiniklioglu would have fit in as a centre-right politician in any other European country.
He wore a suit and tie and I&#39;m sure he even had a Blackberry.
&quot;The party&#39;s foreign policy goal is to help Turkey reintegrate into its immediate environment.
The Cold War overturned the order,&quot; he said.
Turkey is isolated from its hinterland.
Today he had to turn east and west at the same time.
He couldn&#39;t choose between the two.
It had to open both ways.
&quot;But is it possible that sooner or later he will be forced to choose?&quot; - I asked.
&quot;Turkey never wanted to be at a crossroads.&quot;
He then emphasized what almost everyone I spoke to here repeated almost mechanically: Turkey&#39;s relations not only with the Middle East, but also with the countries surrounding the Caucasus and the Black Sea, benefit Europe and the United States just as much as Turkey itself.
It&#39;s as if they want to convey the message that - figuratively speaking - all of Europe, together with Turkey, can reach Asia and the Middle East on those eastward railway lines.
When I was back at Hydarpasha station, after another mostly awake night, I thought of Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, the two German gentlemen who oversaw the construction of this ornate structure 100 years ago.
How surprised they would be to learn that Europe&#39;s Middle East ambitions are now largely in Turkey&#39;s hands.
And as I waited at the port for the ferry to take me back across the Bosphorus, I remembered that at the time Turkey was called the &quot;sick man of Europe&quot;.
At least at that time, there was no question as to which part of the world would lay claim to this exciting country.
The price of milk will rise by five pence per litre
In Jersey, people have to pay more for milk.
The Jersey-based dairy company has announced it will increase the wholesale price of milk by a further five pence per liter from Monday.
This is the second price increase this year since a two-pence rise in February and follows a survey carried out by a consultancy firm.
Resellers decide themselves whether to pass on the price increase to consumers.
Before the increase in February, the wholesale price of Jersey milk last changed in 2002.
A request by a former member of parliament from Bangladesh to be allowed to defend himself at large has been rejected
A Bangladeshi court has rejected former parliamentarian Sheikh Hasina&#39;s plea to be granted bail, meaning she could be arrested when she returns to the country.
His lawyer said the court denied him a free trial on charges that he extorted 50 million taka ($729,700) from a businessman during his time in parliament.
This case is just one of countless corruption charges brought against him.
Sheikh Hasina&#39;s longtime political opponent Khaleda Zia was released on bail this month.
Sheikh Hasina is due to return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but her party, the Awami League, is demanding full freedom from the country&#39;s military-backed interim government first.
According to reports, although he has been paroled to go abroad for medical treatment, the terms of his release do not make it clear whether he will retain his freedom when he returns to the country.
His lawyers say he will now appeal the appeal court&#39;s decision to the Supreme Court.
&quot;The appeals court rejected Sheikh Hasina&#39;s bail application saying that it is not necessary, as she has already been temporarily released and is receiving medical treatment abroad,&quot; we learned from lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
&quot;We will appeal against the decision of the Court of Appeal.&quot;
According to his lawyers, he needs to defend himself at large so that he can return to the country and prepare for the elections in December.
An Awami League party leader said on Sunday that Sheikh Hasina is expected to return home after October 17.
He was detained last year after the army-backed interim government took power, but was released from prison in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all the allegations against them.
Concerns about the polio vaccination program in Afghanistan
Almost 200,000 Afghan children missed out on a recent polio vaccination program because of Taliban-related violence, according to the United Nations.
Last week, the UN organized a vaccination campaign in six provinces.
However, they said they were unable to reach children living in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
According to a UN spokesman, all this happened despite the fact that the Taliban had promised that they would not attack or obstruct the work of the thousands of vaccination personnel.
BSkyB appeal against ITV rejected
BskyB&#39;s appeal against a Competition Commission decision ordering it to reduce its stake in rival broadcaster ITV has been rejected.
The Competition Appeal Court ordered BSkyB to reduce its stake in ITV from 17.9% to 7.5%.
Earlier, the commission found that BSkyB&#39;s shareholding hindered competition and gave the company unfair influence over ITV.
BSkyB bought its stake in 2006, effectively preventing NTL - which has since been renamed Virgin Media - from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority reported that BSkyB&#39;s purchase of a stake in ITV threatened ITV&#39;s independence, prompting the Competition Commission to launch an investigation.
Virgin chief executive Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and watchdog Ofcom have all opposed the takeover.
BSkyB argued that the forced reduction of its ITV stake was meaningless and disproportionate compensation - particularly given that BSkyB had said it would be willing to give up its voting rights.
Another investigation into the case by US Attorneys
The US attorney general has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the 2006 impeachment of nine US attorneys general.
The move followed a report on the case prepared by the inspector general of the Ministry of Justice criticizing the decisions of government officials.
The report criticized White House officials, lawmakers and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was ordered because it was feared that the state prosecutors were dismissed for political reasons.
Special prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether officials interviewed during the investigation tried to obstruct justice by lying.
&quot;Serious allegations of possible criminality have not yet been investigated or resolved,&quot; said Inspector General Glenn Fine.
One of his main proposals was to appoint a special prosecutor with the power to subpoena witnesses.
The series began with the removal of nine state attorneys general by the US Department of Justice in December 2006.
At the time, state prosecutors were said to have been dismissed for poor performance.
However, it later turned out that the sacked public prosecutors were rated no worse than many of their colleagues. Because of this, many people concluded that there was a political consideration behind the dismissals.
Some state attorneys general have participated in criminal prosecutions of high-ranking Republican members of Congress, while others have refused to participate in investigations of election fraud allegations against Democrats.
U.S. attorneys conduct investigations and conduct court cases on behalf of the government.
They can be fired at any time, but cannot be removed from their position for political reasons.
The head of the Department of Justice at the time, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, came under fire for the firings and eventually resigned.
Several other Justice Department officials also resigned.
The inspector general&#39;s report was highly critical of Gonzales&#39; role in the case. According to him, the chief state prosecutor bears &quot;primary responsibility&quot; for the dismissals, he &quot;relinquished&quot; his controlling role and &quot;remarkably removed himself&quot; from the process.
He criticizes other officials, including Karl Rove, a former aide to Bush Sr., for not cooperating with the investigation.
Meat Loaf&#39;s Epic Gets Acclaimed
Rock star Meat Loaf will be honored at the Q Awards for his epic anthem &#39;Bat Out Of Hell&#39;.
The singer, who will receive his special gold award at a ceremony in London next week, said he considered the recognition an honour.
The nine-minute, fifty-five-second song was the title track of Meat Loaf&#39;s 1977 hit album.
Coldplay received the most nominations for this year&#39;s awards, they were nominated in four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: &quot;There are few songs that transcend time or genre, and &#39;Bat Out Of Hell&#39; is like that.&quot;
The song Jim Steinman scored required a very big voice, and that voice was Meat Loafé.
The song began with an almost two-minute instrumental section.
It was released as a single in 1979 and reached number 15 in the charts.
However, Meat Loaf&#39;s &quot;Bat Out Of Hell&quot; stayed on the charts for almost nine years, selling more than 40 million copies.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has been struggling with health issues lately. Among other things, in 2003 he underwent surgery for a heart arrhythmia after collapsing on stage.
In 2007, he had to cancel some concerts due to acute laryngitis.
It was later discovered that he had a cyst on his vocal cords.
An unknown metropolitan street that is often forgotten and may soon be sold
New York City has thousands of boulevards, boulevards, and other byways. Some of them are famous, others have a purely practical function.
However, many experienced taxi drivers and long-time locals would struggle to tell where Extra Place is, mostly because they&#39;ve never heard of it.
The small street is in the East Village and runs north from First Street - without reaching Second Street - between Bowery and Second Avenue.
It is about 9m wide and 36m long and looks more like a dusty alley than a main thoroughfare.
There are no street signs.
It is practically impossible to find on a standard map.
However, the street has its admirers.
There is, for example, Avalon Bay, the developer of the recently built luxury buildings on First Street.
He wants to repave Extra Place and ensure a cleaner route to the shops and boutiques in the new buildings.
Admirers of the street include neighbors who have lived here for a long time, who were drawn to the truncated street by the fact that it was the only remnant of the neighborhood&#39;s past before the renovations.
However, it is not in the interest of the owner of the street, the city&#39;s building preservation and development department, to insist on it.
At a meeting of the district council&#39;s land management committee this month, representatives from the city and Avalon Bay presented a proposal that would see the developer buy the street.
However, the commission would prefer the street remain under the city&#39;s control and has asked for a new plan to be submitted next month, reported Susan Stetzer, Municipal Board No. 3 district manager.
&quot;There is very little land that the city owns anymore, and we want Extra Place to remain in the city&#39;s hands,&quot; he said.
&quot;There are proposals for its renovation and management that Avalon can do, but we also want to make sure it remains accessible to the public.&quot;
A few months ago, Avalon Bay announced plans to repave the small street and add seating. Some of them would be used by a cafe, to which the developer is expected to lease an area.
The idea that Avalon Bay would buy the street was first floated at this month&#39;s meeting.
Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman for Avalon Bay, said that while the company wants to use the street, it does not insist on owning it.
&quot;Avalon Bay&#39;s main concern is to renovate this run-down alley and turn it into a pleasant public space,&quot; he said, adding that the city has proposed to buy it.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Building Preservation Office, said the city really wanted to sell the street, noting that the office&#39;s job is to develop buildings, not manage them.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, the Bowery, Extra Place has little historical significance.
According to some, it got the name &quot;no man&#39;s land&quot; in 1802, when Philip Minthorne&#39;s large estate was divided among his countless children, and no one claimed the narrow strip of land.
The back exit of the punk-rock monument CBGB, which closed in 2006, opened onto Extra Place, and the street is perhaps most famous for being the location where the photo on the cover of the Ramones&#39; &quot;Rocket to Russia&quot; album was taken.
&quot;It was a great venue,&quot; said Ramones manager Danny Fields, who took the photo in November 1976.
&quot;It was littered with rubbish, scraps of clothes, bits of barrels and posters, as well as leaves and ropes.&quot;
Some residents, including bloggers who write about how the middle class has taken over the East Village, oppose the sale of Extra Place. They argue that this piece of public property, however modest, should remain in the community&#39;s possession.
Others refer to Extra Place as a rarity, a piece of the city that has remained virtually unchanged and should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, author of the blog &quot;Jeremiah&#39;s Disappearing New York&quot; (subtitled &quot;A Book of Lamentations: A Bitter Nostalgia for the City&#39;s Decay&quot;), blogged part of a story about Extra Place that &quot;The New Yorker&quot; was published in 1952 in the &quot;Town talk&quot; section of the weekly newspaper.
Author Brendan Gill wrote: &quot;Extra Place is a narrow, small cul-de-sac, dark even during the day, bordered by rusty iron warehouse doors and slatted windows, where the wind carries a week&#39;s worth of newspapers in the gutters.&quot;
The street, with a few exceptions, looked the same a few nights ago.
A rat ran across the end of the street, past the back door that used to lead to CBGB&#39;s and now belongs to the upscale clothing store that has taken its place.
There was graffiti on the walls and an empty 0.75 liter beer bottle lay next to a pile of discarded fresh newsprint.
Some passers-by said that they rarely think of Extra Place, but they think it could use renovation.
Fields said he thinks some people underestimate the appeal of the street in its current state.
&quot;I spent the best years of my life in dark, dank and unpleasant places,&quot; he said.
Bilingual education debate: Continuous exposure to the English-language environment
In this episode of the Education Monitor, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the candidates&#39; views on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, Senior Research Fellow and Senior Director of Education Research at the Pacific Institute for Public Policy Research, is the co-author of &quot;It&#39;s Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs School Choice.&quot;
It is not easy to please voters from Spanish-speaking areas.
Barack Obama&#39;s proposals on education are also included.
According to the Obama campaign, &quot;African-American and Hispanic students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students,&quot; and that&#39;s true.
To combat such achievement gaps, Obama&#39;s education plan specifically supports, among other things, &quot;transitional bilingual education&quot; for English learners.
At the same time, the question for Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes non-English-language schooling, outweighs his interest in closing wide achievement gaps.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, a charter elementary school in east Los Angeles County.
Most of the school&#39;s students are Hispanic and low-income.
More than a third of the students - many of whom are recent arrivals - are learning English.
Despite this, 100% of fourth graders achieved excellent results on the 2008 state math exam.
Equally impressive is the fact that 93% of fourth graders did well on the English language and literature test.
This incredible achievement was not achieved through the means Obama would have preferred.
Sixth Street emphasizes repetition, practice, continuous assessment of skills, and rejection of objections.
Also, and this is something Obama should consider, Sixth Street principal Linda Mikels said, the school&#39;s educational philosophy is to &quot;fully immerse&quot; English language students in the language environment.
The essence of the immersion method is the almost exclusive use of English during the teaching of other subjects.
Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, said: &quot;We&#39;ve had overwhelming success that if someone walked into a classroom, they wouldn&#39;t know who the student was who had just arrived from Mexico 12 months before.&quot;
&quot;It works,&quot; he concluded, &quot;It works for us.&quot;
Would Obama hold schools like Sixth Street Prep up as an example to other schools with significant numbers of Hispanic and English language learners?
The results achieved by the school should make the answer clear, however, due to the education policy of his own party (the National Education Associations have long supported bilingual education), and since he himself consistently supports bilingual education, we cannot be sure of Obama&#39;s reaction.
While he agrees that immigrants should learn English, Obama recently played down the issue when he said people shouldn&#39;t worry so much about the &quot;all-Englishness&quot; of the legislature.
Instead, he said, &quot;they should get their kids to speak Spanish.&quot;
If Obama really wants to close the gap in outcomes, he should seriously study the models that work instead of looking down and ignoring them.
Oil prices fell sharply due to renewed concerns about the economy
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday amid concerns that America&#39;s bailout plan for financial markets will fail to revive the economy.
Crude oil fell seven percent to $99.80 in the morning on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Prices are down more than $20 a barrel since last Monday.
Over the past two weeks, commodity markets have been rocked by the financial turmoil on Wall Street and some powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching $145.29 a barrel in July, prices fell to almost $90 a barrel earlier this month before falling back under the weight of immeasurable uncertainty in financial markets.
Investors were again worried on Monday after congressional leaders announced that they had agreed to an economic bailout deal, the largest in history, over the weekend.
The news was overshadowed by concerns that the financial crisis would not end for a long time.
As the latest event in the unfolding crisis, Citigroup will buy the banking business of Wachovia Corporation, the government announced on Monday.
In the meantime, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments partially nationalized the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
According to the analysts of Barclays Capital, as a result of the desperate negotiations over the weekend, &quot;it seems that the rescue operation did not succeed in reviving the stock market trading spirit.&quot;
As the economic situation worsens, it is expected that the demand for commodities, such as oil, will also decrease.
&quot;The future of common stocks, interest rates and currency markets around the world has become uncertain,&quot; a Deutsche Bank analyst wrote to investors.
&quot;We believe that the &quot;epidemic&quot; will not escape the goods market either.
From the point of view of the commodity exchange, the biggest question is to what extent the &quot;disease&quot; of the USA infects the whole world, especially China.&quot;
As oil consumption decreased due to the slowdown in economic growth, bank analysts cut their expectations for next year, reducing their forecasts for oil and gas prices for 2009 by 20%.
With the feat of the second quarter, the team set its record
After spending more time in a Jets uniform than anyone over the past eight-plus seasons, defensive end Shaun Ellis thought he&#39;d seen it all.
But then he watched the second quarter unfold Sunday as the Jets turned a scoreless game into a sensational game.
&quot;I&#39;ve never seen anything like it,&quot; Ellis said.
The second quarter began after a sluggish game between the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals came into full harmony with the dark clouds towering in the sky.
Quarterback Brett Favre threw a 12-yard touchdown pass to Laveranues Coles. This was the perfect precursor to an afternoon in which their burgeoning collaboration developed significantly.
Favre threw two more touchdown passes to Coles in the quarter, including when two cornerbacks went down in a row with 10 seconds left in the half.
&quot;I didn&#39;t regret the effort,&quot; Favre said of all the passes he made to Coles.
&quot;He&#39;s a hell of a player.
So far, we&#39;ve been able to communicate well with each other, regardless of what people think.&quot;
While Favre and Coles were running the ball, the defense stopped Cardinals running back Kurt Warner.
Cornerback Darrelle Revis caught a fumble and returned it 32 yards for a touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith reached for another pass and caught the ball.
Linebacker David Bowens managed to knock the ball out of Warner&#39;s hands.
This last turn could have been the most amazing moment of the match.
However, when the Cardinals lost the ball with 10 seconds left and the Jets recovered, Jay Feely kicked a 20-yard field goal to make it 34-0.
It was the Jets&#39; best score in a quarter so far.
When asked to describe the mind-blowing nature of the game, Jets coach Eric Mangini said, &quot;The second quarter or the third quarter?&quot;
When told he did both -- the Cardinals scored 21 points in the third quarter to none by the Jets -- Mangini said, &quot;I&#39;ve got to say I enjoyed the second quarter a lot more than the third quarter.
We scored a lot of points in a short time.&quot;
A rested Gebrselassie breaks his own world record
Ethiopia&#39;s Haile Gebrselassie showed again why many consider him the greatest middle and long distance runner who ever lived when he broke his own world record in Berlin on Sunday. With this, he became the first to run the 42.2 kilometers in 2 hours and 4 minutes.
Winning in a time of 2:03:59 on a comfortably flat course, Gebrselassie improved by 27 seconds on his previous time of 2:04:26 set in Berlin last year.
By the age of 35, Gebrselassie had set the 26th world record of his career in such a wide variety of events that he had won world championships or set world records in almost every distance from the 1,500 meters to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie skipped the Beijing Olympic marathon, fearing - which in retrospect may have turned out to be over-cautious - that air pollution would further aggravate his asthma problems.
Instead, he entered the Berlin Marathon.
In almost perfect conditions - sunny weather, 9 °C at the start and 13 °C at the end - Gebrselassie won on Sunday with an incredible speed of 2 minutes 56 seconds per kilometer.
Since runners who have not started the marathon before, such as Gebrselassie and Kenya&#39;s Paul Tergat turned to the longer distances, with the marathon record dropped by more than two minutes in the past decade since Brazil&#39;s Ronaldo da Costa won in 2:06:05 in Berlin in 1998.
After Sunday&#39;s victory, Gebrselassie told reporters that two weeks ago he had sprained his calves and was unable to train for two weeks.
It is clear that during the forced rest it was refreshed and not rusty.
&quot;I am so happy,&quot; Gebrselassie told reporters.
&quot;Everything went perfectly.
I started training again a week ago and today I had doubts, but in the end everything turned out fine.&quot;
He has received some criticism - particularly from Kenya, Ethiopia&#39;s East African rival - that he uses too many aids in his races, generally avoids many world-famous marathoners, relies on his sprinters as if he were running on a track, and puts world records before competitive spirit.
However, this criticism hardly detracts from Gebrselassie&#39;s greatness in long-distance running.
Gebrselassie reached the halfway point in 1:02:04 on Sunday with the help of four Kenyan sprinters.
Two top Kenyan runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, set the pace for Gebrselassie after the pacers tired.
With just over 4.8 kilometers to go, Gebrselassie made a final sprint to overtake Kwambai, who finished second in 2:05:36, 5 minutes off his personal best.
Kamathi finished third in 2:07:48.
In the women&#39;s race, Kazakhstan-born Irina Mikitenko, now a German citizen, capped off a remarkable year with the seventh-fastest time of 2:19:19.
The world record is held by the British Paula Radcliffe with a time of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko surprisingly won the London marathon with a time of 2:24:14.
He was unable to participate in the Beijing Olympics due to an alleged back injury, but he quickly recovered and won the Berlin Marathon, beating his personal best by five minutes. This was the third marathon distance race he participated in.
He won the race with a smart calculation: first he allowed a group of four Ethiopians and Kenyans to break forward and gain a significant lead, then approx. After running 30 km, he followed them.
Ethiopia&#39;s Askale Tafa Magarsa finished second with a time of 2:21.31, while Kenya&#39;s Helena Kiprop was third with a time of 2:25:01.
A segregated city, black pride and tribulations
Nestled in the theme park of Greater Orlando - a few miles from all that is glittery, loud and huge - lies a quiet little town where the pride and intricacies of the African-American life experience was born.
Eatonville, the first all-black town to integrate in the country and the childhood home of Zora Neale Hurston, is not as simple today as she described it in 1935: &quot;the five lakes, three croquet courts, 300 brown skins, 300 good a city of swimming, lots of guavas and two schools, no prison.&quot;
It is now a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have already visited the annual Zora festival. The Eatonville series of celebrations honor Hurston, the most famous female writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
Yet, in many ways, the city he described and turned into a tourist attraction - which is also featured in the Florida guidebook published by the Crisis Era Alliance Writers Project - stands apart from its surroundings.
It is as independent, dignified, and self-absorbed as it was in the 1930s, when, Hurston wrote, urban blacks in Florida often refused to share their true thoughts with white people who &quot;know so little about us that they don&#39;t know what they&#39;re missing.&quot; .&quot;
Even in a year when black presidential candidate Barack Obama is encouraging an open exchange of ideas about the issue of race, many here distrust the views of outsiders.
&quot;We are very careful about how our story is told,&quot; reported Hortense Jones, 59, who has lived here all her life and is a member of the city&#39;s oldest church.
&quot;It must be said correctly.&quot;
Eatonville has long been characterized by the paradox of victory and struggle.
At the same time, it is a historically significant model of black advocacy, but at the same time, it is a community of almost 2,400 people, where poverty rates are twice the national average.
It is partly a literary hub and partly an example of the sometimes looked down upon, sometimes praised, southern, urban, black culture that flourished in the shade of oak trees as a result of American slavery.
It is therefore not surprising that the residents here are both proud and defensive.
And the image of Eatonville has been important since Zora (everyone calls Hurston that way here).
In books like &quot;Mules and Men&quot; (1935) and &quot;Their Eyes Were Watching God&quot; (1937), written in an honest, strong dialect, he introduced his hometown to the world.
Five paragraphs from the Florida guidebook transformed the town, which lies along Route 17. This road leads from the long-forgotten center of Florida to one of the sites of black history and human drama.
Hurston, who was brave as a drumbeat in both life and literature, introduced her readers to the business of Eatonville&#39;s first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then peeked into the more intimate spheres.
He wrote: &quot;To the right of the road we find the modern public school, brown ground with white border, carefully kept yards and playgrounds, tended by Howard Miller, though he can hardly read or write.&quot;
Mentioning Widow Dash&#39;s new husband, she wrote that Lee Glenn &quot;sells all kinds of liquor and anything you might need at the temporary quarters.&quot;
Thus, in a few hundred words, Hurston associated Eatonville with autonomy, but also with illiteracy, remarriage, and sex.
Clearly, Fodor&#39;s guidebook presented it differently.
This description really did not please everyone.
&quot;Zora told it like it was,&quot; reported Ella Dinkins, 90, one of the Johnson girls. Hurston immortalized them by quoting from the slick songs men sang about their beauty.
He added: &quot;Some people didn&#39;t like that.&quot;
Hurston is still remembered here as the vivacious eccentric who often visited home after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that when Hurston stormed into town, he usually arrived unannounced in a rumbling Chevrolet, smoking a cigarette and wearing long pants in a town where people still pride themselves on their dignified dress.
Most people were charmed by it, Franklin said, but many were circumcised.
&quot;People were always happy to see Zora,&quot; Franklin said.
But on the patio overlooking Sabelia Lake, where Hurston was most likely baptized, he added, rocking in his chair, &quot;He never stayed too long.&quot;
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were never republished.
Eatonville, along with most of the world, seemed to have forgotten about him.
Although she was once a popular writer, a contemporary of Langston Hughes, and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she had previously lived.
There were no major commemorations or large public readings in Eatonville.
&quot;I don&#39;t think they understand how much she enriched the world, or what she left us at all,&quot; said Valerie Boyd, author of the 2003 Hurston biography, Wrapped in Rainbow.
The turning point came in 1980.
Orange County officials wanted to build a five-lane road through the city instead of the two-lane main street, Kennedy Avenue, which played an important role in the life of the community.
The expanding Orlando has already encroached on the Interstate 4 highway connecting the states on the western border of the city.
The proposal came as Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Among other things, forced integration put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, fights over racial mixing gave the community a taste of hatred.
&quot;At that time a group of white boys came over and threw oranges and other things at the people sitting on the side of the road,&quot; Franklin said.
&quot;There was a lady who died of it.
They threw a watermelon out of a car.&quot;
In a 1955 letter to &quot;The Orlando Sentinel,&quot; Hurston questioned the Supreme Court&#39;s decision to mandate forced integration. This is what he said about the Brown v. Board of Education decision: &quot;it insults rather than respects my race.&quot;
Today, residents say that school desegregation, while positive in some ways, weakened the cohesion of Eatonville residents and undermined the confidence of young people.
&quot;Black kids were used to being hugged - I remember that - you would hug your teacher in the morning and at night,&quot; reported NY Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins, executive director of the nonprofit Save the Eatonville Community.
&quot;It took as long as the students and teachers came from the same place,&quot; he added.
&quot;We didn&#39;t hug our white teacher because he was a white teacher — I mean there were cultural differences between us,&quot; Nathiri said.
However, human rights helped to rise many other Zora Neale Hurstons—black writers, actors, and artists who rose above prejudice, as she did, with such sanguine confidence and lines like, &quot;How can anyone deprive himself of the pleasure of my company!
This is unfathomable to me.&quot;
In 1975, Alice Walker made a pilgrimage to Hurston&#39;s unmarked grave and began to fight to restore her reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed biography of Hurston, written by Robert E. Hemenway, hit the bookstore shelves and elevated her once again among America&#39;s role models.
The road construction project was about to begin just as Eatonville&#39;s most famous daughter was thrust back into the spotlight.
And this time, Hurston&#39;s old neighbors saw her as a savior.
The community started organizing a Hurston Festival in 1988 to show what the county would destroy with its highway.
Thousands of fans attended the inaugural event two years later, and many have returned to the festivities every January since then.
Several years later, the county abandoned its road construction proposal.
&quot;The five-laning of the main road has revitalized the community and put it into full gear, which is a real sense of civic pride,&quot; Nathiri said.
Boyd put it more simply, &quot;Zora saved Eatonville.&quot;
The victory over the road construction project helped change the city&#39;s image of itself.
People living outside the city appeared in increasing numbers, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who started attending church here in 1993, and locals began to reevaluate the past.
Eatonville was placed on the National Historic Register in 1998.
In 2006, the new one-story library (named after Hurston, of course) opened on the resurfaced and beautified Kennedy Avenue.
Eatonville has remained Florida&#39;s cuckoo&#39;s egg: it is only ten kilometers from the center of Orlando, but sometimes it feels like a suburban side street during summer rain; as small as when it was founded by 27 black families in the 1880s.
(Today, 90% of the population is black.)
Outsiders who come here looking for Eatonville&#39;s history and stories are still treated with caution.
Most interviews require prior permission, and some things, such as Eatonville&#39;s oldest mural, painted by a white man and depicting blacks working in the fields, are not allowed to be photographed.
Many people in Eatonville - including the confident teacher Jones, who is particularly attracted to bright red - fear that their segregated community will be misunderstood.
And yet, as the Hurston Festival grew in scope, so did hometown pride.
Young people in particular increasingly see Eatonville as Hurston saw her own race: wonderful, problems and all, no better and no worse, just as proud, creative, industrious, foolish, and confused as any other racial and ethnic group in America.
Franklin&#39;s nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who plans to return after college to take a job at the local government or police department, which he says needs help, echoes a sincere sense of civic engagement.
And the younger ones, like 11-year-old Winter Park twins Alondra and Alexia Kenon, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
&quot;Most people who are just passing through here think this town is nothing compared to the others,&quot; Alondra Kenon said after a service on a recent Sunday.
&quot;But if you stop and take some time to learn about its history, it&#39;s a very beautiful city.&quot;
Here in New York, we all speak the language of finance
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If tourists didn&#39;t mind the newsstands and giant television projectors in Times Square, they wouldn&#39;t realize they were in the middle of a storm.
They would never realize that with the glass-walled, beehive-shaped offices above their heads, the bankers and venture fund managers who hold New York in their power are living through the hardest days since 1929.
Couriers still rattle their metal tea carts down the sidewalks, delivering trays laden with muffins to morning meetings.
Spanish-speaking men still shuffle between blockhouses, carrying fifty or so ironed shirts like human mules, which hang from yoke-like loops over their shoulders.
Office workers still line up for their morning sweet pastries at sidewalk food carts, and it&#39;s still impossible to get a taxi between 4 and 7 on weekdays.
I didn&#39;t feel like there was any kind of crisis until Thursday afternoon, despite all the bad news, I decided to open a new bank account.
Although I had deliberately planned to do it during the afternoon lull at my local JP Morgan Chase bank branch, there were already about 20 people in line ahead of me.
Not at the teller window, where you can withdraw or deposit money, but at the customer service desk, where older customers order checkbooks, tourists ask for directions to Macy&#39;s, and where new customers open bank accounts.
Many people in front of me - I learned later from Starr, the banker &quot;assigned to me&quot; - had lined up with the same intention as me.
However, unlike me, they have already withdrawn their money from smaller banks where they live, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They took money out of so-called savings banks (which are like housing associations), credit unions, and small-town savings banks that operate in only one state and supposedly treat their customers like family.
In the past year, 15 such banks have quietly gone bankrupt.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in capital, went into receivership, and as New Yorkers headed home for the weekend on Friday night, another bank, Wachovia, with $440 billion in savings, was seeking a bailout buyout.
The office and shop workers in front of me, fearing another crash, moved their money to what seemed like a safe haven, the bank that does most of the capital injection buyouts on Wall Street.
Ordinary people in New York have become experts in finance over the past few weeks.
A woman in the local Chinese department store spoke on the phone about the failed Lehman Brothers bank and its powerful-looking CEO Dick Fuld as if complaining about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the uniformed caretaker of my apartment block in her fifties, changed the subject, now we weren&#39;t talking about Brad and Angelina or my grocery delivery like we used to.
This is what he said to me after I went to the bank: &quot;I invested all my savings in money market instruments.
I switched, I&#39;m not taking any chances.&quot;
Memorable Lives: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: Since 1962, as Guildford&#39;s music director, Vernon &quot;Tod&quot; Handley (obituary, Sept. 11) has led the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
Based on his musical plans for the neighborhood, he founded his wonderful youth choir, Proteus, the following year.
In principle, only people under the age of 21 could be part of the choir, but when Proteus sang its finale in 1979 - many of us were already in our late 20s - we simply refused to part with the choir.
The name &quot;Proteus&quot; (the name of the mythological shape-shifter) was in keeping with the choir&#39;s determination and ability to tackle whatever score was put before it - be it a madrigal or a Messiaen piece; unaccompanied or accompanied by a large orchestra.
The musical versatility of such a young choir was often astonishing and always exciting, and we owe it to the man whose inspiration our enthusiasm for music has remained unchanged over the years.
How often has Tod told us to &quot;let the music speak for itself.&quot;
He always said: &quot;The composer knows what he wants.
Everything is in the sheet music.
So sing it!&quot;
His conducting technique was always completely understandable and precise, but never dictatorial or exaggerated.
Whatever the musical standard, he always raised it.
John Frayn Turner wrote about him:
If ever there was a captain who should have been knighted, it was Vernon Handley.
I got to know him well during the two decades during which he conducted the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
I&#39;ve written reviews of more than 100 of his concerts over the past forty-odd years, but he&#39;s never disappointed me with a single one, and often enthused me with them.
Tod Handley had both greatness and modesty, which is very rare.
He hated those commanders who, in his words, simply &quot;galloped around the world with one or two well-known fighters.&quot;
He will be missed by many of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
According to your obituary of William Woodruff (September 25), &quot;In 1946 he continued his studies in economic history at Oxford and in 1950 became a fellow at the Houblon-Norman Research Institute...while steadily preparing for his bachelor&#39;s degree, master&#39;s degree and PhD. &quot;
This is from the author&#39;s notes of Woodruff&#39;s &quot;Beyond Nab End&quot;, but it is wrong.
Between 1946 and 1953 he taught economic history at the University of Nottingham, and in the meantime, under the guidance of Professor JD Chambers, he completed his PhD dissertation on the British rubber industry, which he published in 1958 under the title &quot;The British Rubber Industry&quot;.
In 1950-51 he was actually in the USA on a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and in the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, New York and Harvard.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for good and moved to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff embellished this period of his career.
Muslim graves desecrated as Austria tilts to the right
Heinz-Christian Strache of the right-wing Austrian Freedom Party and Filip Dewinter of the Belgian right-wing party Vlaams Belang took part in a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday, January 17, 2008 to present the &quot;Cities Against the Islamic Conquest&quot; organization.
They marched with signs imitating traffic signs that depicted mosques crossed out with a red line.
Police say far-right extremists are responsible for the desecration of Muslim cemeteries in Austria, the same weekend that far-right parties made significant gains in national parliamentary elections.
More than 90 graves were seriously vandalized at the Traun cemetery near Linz sometime between Friday night and this morning. According to the police, it is an organized action.
The perpetrators spray-painted Jewish symbols such as the Star of David on some of the graves, but investigators say this was an attempt to hide their extremist motives, which stem from hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is somehow related to the elections.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were &quot;deeply shocked&quot; by the desecration, which came shortly before the end of the Muslim religious month of Ramadan.
Meanwhile, Austria is having an examination of conscience following yesterday&#39;s parliamentary elections, during which the political balance tipped to the right.
The two far-right parties, which won almost 30% of the vote, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, campaigned for a strong anti-immigration law and some of their slogans were branded xenophobic by their critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party, which won more than 18% of the vote, also expressed his displeasure with the campaign against headscarves and burqas and with foods allegedly associated with Islam.
At the party&#39;s final assembly in Vienna, he spoke of &quot;European brotherhood&quot;, with the help of which the strengthening of Islam can be prevented.
Both parties want to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they are political symbols of the ongoing Islamization of Austria and Europe.
According to polls and analyzes conducted immediately after the far-right victory, the change was largely due to the young voter base, who are worried about their future in the European Union.
Garry Glitter has been banned from traveling abroad
Garry Glitter, a well-known rock star convicted of sexually abusing children, has been banned by the court from traveling to France and Spain.
The judges decided to hand Glitter a six-month ban after he notified the authorities who were checking him of his intention to travel to Spain via France.
Kent Police obtained the travel ban on Thursday after presenting evidence to the court about Glitter&#39;s child abuse convictions.
Glitter, real name Paul Gadd, did not attend the trial at Ashford Magistrates in Kent and was represented by lawyers from Corker Binning.
A court spokesman said: &quot;On Thursday, September 25, Kent Police applied to Ashford Magistrates Court to prevent Paul Gadd&#39;s planned trip to France and Spain on March 25.
&quot;Paul Gadd did not appear in person.&quot;
The 64-year-old Glitter notified the authorities of his intention to travel abroad because he is required to do so by the law on persons on the register of sex offenders.
You must notify the authorities if you intend to travel abroad for more than three days.
You are also obliged to notify the police at least seven days before your planned departure.
If you don&#39;t notify the authorities, you can be sentenced to up to five years in prison.
Kent Police said they did not want to discuss any specific cases of Glitter within the county or his possible whereabouts.
We learned from the spokesperson of the Kent police: &quot;The Kent police do everything to protect children within the country and abroad.
&quot;In our view, it is easier to control someone without leaving the UK because we have a comprehensive system here to manage potential risks more effectively.
&quot;The most important task of the Kent police is to protect the people of Kent. Through close cooperation, we constantly monitor the behavior of people on the register of sex offenders and people living in the county, in order to minimize possible risks affecting the population.&quot;
Glitter returned to the UK last month after serving 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for raping a 10- and 11-year-old girl.
After his release, he flew to Bangkok, where he was supposed to catch a flight to London.
However, he claimed to be unwell and refused to fly to London.
The local authorities did not allow him to go through passport control, so he finally flew to Hong Kong.
He was also refused entry by the Chinese authorities, so he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and immigration officials insisted he return to Britain.
He finally arrived at Heathrow Airport&#39;s Terminal 3 on August 22 and remained there until his lawyer, David Corker, went to Uxbridge Magistrates&#39; Court in west London as he was taken in under a court order at the request of Scotland Yard. to the register of sex offenders.
Glitter previously spent four months in prison in the UK in 1999 for possession of child rape photographs.
A Home Office source said Jacqui Smith, the Home Secretary, was relieved and delighted that Glitter was not allowed to travel to France and Spain.
&quot;I don&#39;t take the photos on stage, because I want to present the artist from a personal perspective&quot; Photographer Günther Bauer
No scenery, no frills, no dancing shoes.
The great masters of flamenco up close, without the excitement of the performance: so that we can also get to know the everyday faces of the dancers.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other hand, the ordinary person.
And these two sides cannot be separated, except in the intimate moments, far from the audience, when we can observe a personal movement, grasp the depth of a caught gaze, or marvel at the beauty of the idle but expressive hand of an artist who is not yet preparing to perform on stage.
In his photo series Flamenco-people, the German Günther Bauer combines the theatricality of singers, dancers and guitarists with this lesser-known everyday side of the masters.
Through the photos, he presents the specific iconography of flamenco from different perspectives.
The exhibition, which is part of the Month of Flamenco Photography, &quot;reflects the growing international importance of flamenco every day&quot;, the creator believes, adding that anyone could be the protagonist of Flamenco-people, since the observer realizes that these are images depict artists in a non-typical way.
These people captured on the street are artists who can bring passion, sadness, joy to the stage... and captivate the audience.
At the same time, stage photography is not suitable for capturing their personality.
Their personality and character reside in the deepest part of their being.
I wanted to create an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to use the camera to capture the personalities of the flamenco greats.&quot;
Inspired by the Cante de las Minas festival, Bauer started his long journey in 1997, during which he took portraits of flamenco singers, guitarists and dancers with a plate camera.
Thanks to the camera and the choice of subject, these portraits evoke classical photography.
However, the use of different stylistic devices breaks with traditional pictorial representation and suggests modernity. The following thought faithfully reflects Bauer&#39;s vision of flamenco: &quot;It is a music with traditional roots, but which changes from day to day and is always fascinating.&quot;
It is not the dance, nor the singing or the music per se, but rather the artist&#39;s personality and character that enchants the audience.
The guiding motif of the works that can be viewed in the El Fotómata gallery these days is the search for an encounter with the essential, the artistic charm, which becomes visible through the way of perception, being and display.
The names of well-known figures of flamenco, including Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, are the hallmarks of this photo collection featuring about sixty artists.
The project has also become a flamenco anthology, of which an album including the portraits presented at the exhibition will soon be published.
Bauer&#39;s passion for portraits prompted him to repeat the idea two years ago with the &quot;Portraits of Veteran Athletes&quot; series (&quot;SportARTproject&quot;).
Although the concept of Flamenco-people is slightly different from this, the photographer adds: &quot;I really like photographing people, getting to know them and entering their lives for a longer or shorter moment.
In my opinion, the most difficult genre of photography is portraiture.
Fate brings you together with people you meet, with personalities you sometimes don&#39;t even know, or who only spend a few minutes taking photos.
But despite these circumstances, as a photographer I always try to realize my ideas.
The exhibition entitled Flamenco-people, a selection of contemporary flamenco portraits, can be viewed at El Fotómata Gallery, located at calle de la Mata 20, parallel to Alameda de Hércules, until October 16.
According to Vargas Llosa, the novel he is working on is &quot;complete recklessness&quot;
The location and plot are still unknown to him, but despite all this, Mario Vargas Llosa is busy writing his new novel. The protagonist of the novel is an Irish nationalist, Roger Caseman, who lived in the Congo for twenty years and also visited the Amazon.
The writer, who is also a candidate for the Nobel Prize for Literature, admitted yesterday at the Hay Festival Segovia that his current work is &quot;complete recklessness&quot; and that &quot;all signs point to the fact that the novel should not be written&quot;.
&quot;If I were smarter, I wouldn&#39;t do it, but I&#39;m going to do it and I hope that at some point I&#39;ll be able to put an end to it&quot; - with these words he concluded his presentation at the festival of exchange of ideas, thoughts and opinions, which was hosted by writers, historians and writers for four days in the city of Aqueduct hundreds of journalists and thousands of visitors.
The author of &quot;The City and the Dogs&quot; was one of the most prominent participants in the celebration of literature, and he lived up to the expectations placed on him.
Vargas Llosa won the participant-voted Hay Festival prize for an old edition of Dickens&#39; novel &quot;Our Mutual Friend.&quot; His performance filled the Juan Bravo theater.
After Félix Romeo&#39;s greeting, he was received by a devoted audience. The hour flew by quickly for the audience, during which the Peruvian writer, with an amazing memory and a great deal of humor, told how his writing profession developed from the special adventure of his passion for reading and his desire to live life; how to bridge the lack of inspiration with a disciplined writing method, diligent documentation, lots of corrections and rewrites; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas influenced his writing profession, and what memories his stories are based on.
The Latin American novelist admitted that it is impossible to measure or prove whether books change our lives, but added: &quot;I don&#39;t think that literature is just entertainment or a yew-life experience&quot; because it affects people and makes them think. , therefore he asked the writers not to give in to the temptation of lightness and to be responsible for their profession.
Due to the inclement weather, the farewell in Pozoblanco is shorter, the equestrian bullfights are also canceled
The equestrian bullfight, traditionally organized as the closing chord of the Pozoblanco festivities, was canceled yesterday morning after the would-be equestrian bullfighters found the terrain of the arena unsuitable for the contest.
As a result, the committee, with the agreement of Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to cancel the bullfight.
The bad weather severely damaged the series of celebrations, as two of the three events could not be held.
On Saturday, the second bullfight was canceled due to rain.
Future protagonists José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista would have fought the bulls of Castilblanco.
Thus, bullfights were held only on Fridays.
The winner was Daniel Luque, he took home three ears as a trophy. After the sophisticated and aesthetic struggle, he was carried around on his shoulders.
That same afternoon, Alejandro Talavante won many accolades and an ear as a trophy thanks to his two bulls, but this was due more to the public than to his own performance.
After that, however, came El Juli, who did little to improve the reputation of the Los Llanos arena.
After a comfortable ride with the second bull, most of the audience was managed to get out of the way.
In Álava, a van carrying two tons of hashish tried to escape from the road inspection
It&#39;s four fifty minutes in the morning.
The Basque Regional Police carries out traffic control in the administrative area of Armiñón (Álava).
The authorities stop a van with two passengers. The passengers try to escape the measure.
At the same time, the shipment, more than two tons of hashish, was inconspicuous.
Investigators pursued the passengers and arrested one, a 28-year-old man, identified as AAJ, the Basque government&#39;s Department of Internal Affairs said.
The arrested man is accused of drug trafficking and document forgery.
The incident took place in the administrative area of Armiñón, where the staff of the Álava Traffic Authority carried out a traffic control on the N-1 highway.
When they tried to stop the van, the driver refused to obey, suddenly hit the gas and then left the scene of the inspection.
The detectives gave chase, and the vehicle stopped a few kilometers away in the stop lane, and its passengers fled the highway into a wooded area.
The Basque Regional Police finally caught one of them and, after searching the Iveco Daily brand van, seized its shipment, 2178 kilograms of hashish.
The hashish bales filling the back of the vehicle were transported by the police to be subjected to a more thorough examination and to weigh the drug.
In addition, during the inspection, it was proven that the vehicle&#39;s fake license plate does not match the data in the van&#39;s papers, so proceedings will also be initiated against the arrested person for forgery of public documents.
The Basque Regional Police is continuing the investigation, the aim of which is to arrest the other suspect, who, as already mentioned, fled the highway, and to determine the origin of the seized drugs.
The 28-year-old accused, AAJta, was taken to the police station for the necessary interrogations, and within a few hours the court proceedings began.
Actress Heather Locklear was arrested for driving under the influence of drugs
Actress Heather Locklear, the popular Amanda from the series Melrose Place, was arrested by the police in Santa Barbara (California) over the weekend for driving under the influence of medication.
According to an eyewitness, he was trying to leave the parking lot in Montecito using strange maneuvers, a spokesperson for the California Traffic Authority told People magazine.
According to the witness, around 4:30 p.m., Locklear &quot;floored the gas, revved the engine, tried to leave the parking lot in both forward and reverse, and went over his sunglasses several times in reverse.&quot;
A short time later, the witness, who may not have recognized the actress at first, saw Locklear stop on a nearby highway and get out of the car.
He also informed the police because he was &quot;worried for Locklear&#39;s life&quot;.
When the police arrived, the actress was sitting in her car, which partially paralyzed traffic on the highway.
He &quot;seemed confused&quot;, so the patrol took him to a center specializing in drug and alcohol testing.
According to a police spokesperson, the actress was cooperative and alcohol consumption was ruled out almost immediately. The spokesman also said that based on the officers&#39; initial impression, Locklear was believed to be under the influence of medication.
Locklear was arrested and charged with driving under the influence of an unidentified substance. He was taken to the local jail around 7 p.m., where he was released a few hours later.
Locklear came out of a sanitarium in Arizona two months ago, where he was treated for anxiety and depression.
Llamazares calls on the Andalusian federation of the IU (United Left) to take action on the Silva case
Gaspar Llamazares, the general secretary of the IU and the representative of the United Left, stated today that the regional federation of the squad will make a decision in the case of Francisco Manuel Silva, the former Youth and Sports Councilor of the Municipality of Seville. Silva resigned last week after being accused of abusing his position to benefit family members.
&quot;In these matters, I am far and away a federalist, and this case certainly belongs to the competence of the Andalusian organization&quot;, Llamazares pointed out the procedure that the party should use against the former member of the city council of Seville.
On the other hand, the president of IU emphasized that &quot;transparency&quot; must be kept in mind when investigating possible irregularities committed by Silva: &quot;At IU, it has always been in favor of maximum transparency in cases of this nature.&quot;
He added that &quot;in the case of public employees, the strict code of ethics is also part of the training.&quot;
&quot;Blood of May&quot;, an epic work by Garci
Benito Pérez Galdós&#39; National Episodes inspired José Luis Garci, who recalls the famous anti-French uprising of the Spaniards in Blood of May, which, with a budget of nearly 15 million euros, is the largest work in his filmography.
Accordingly, the director attempted to illustrate the flow of people and social analysis he had always admired in the work of the well-known novelist. Garci told all this to a large audience of actors at the film premiere today in the company of Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría.
The two-and-a-half-hour Blood of May will be shown in cinemas on Friday, and Telemadrid will later show it as a mini-series of more than four hours.
José Luis Garci, a great admirer of Galdós&#39;s literature, realized his childhood dream with this shoot. He owes all of this to Esperanza Aguirre, as she commissioned him three years ago from the Province of Madrid to make a commemorative film for the 200th anniversary of the events in Madrid on May 2nd. Garci accepted the invitation on the condition that the story could be based on the National Episodes.
The 15 million budget was entirely financed by the Autonomous Province of Madrid, and it was a special opportunity for Garci: with period scenery and costumes, he was able to present &quot;the confused Spaniards who mistakenly sided with the wrong leader, as the fight for independence pushed the country into great backwardness under Ferdinand VII with his reign,&quot; he said.
However, the director expressed his regret that he could not count on the budget of Alatriste or Goya&#39;s Phantoms, which were more than twice the size of Blood of May. Because of this, he was forced to leave out some scenes from the script, which - as on many other occasions - is written together with Horacio Valcárcel.
So the director of Újrakezdés resorted to his usual working method, recording the scenes with the actors with whom he had already started rehearsals before the shooting. There was no casting because Garci considers it &quot;humiliating&quot; and because, as he said, &quot;part of the craft of directing is going to theaters and cinemas to find out what is going on in the industry in which we work.&quot;
Several actors of Blood of May, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo, were not in front of the camera for the first time.
Garci - who can boast of four Oscar nominations and one Oscar award - believes that none of this year&#39;s nominees representing Spain before the Hollywood Academy, i.e. The Blood of May, The Seven French Pool Tables and the finally selected Blind Sunflowers, are young Spanish cinema. represents his generation, &quot;even though it should be presented,&quot; he said.
Garci does not expect awards with this film.
&quot;In the beginning, you think you&#39;re working for posterity, then you realize that the only thing that matters is prosperity, and in the end you&#39;re happy when one more film is made,&quot; says Garci, with a professional career of almost 30 years behind him.
Isabel Bayón recalls the life and art of the Sevillian dancer Tórtola Valencia
A flamenco dancer from Seville commemorates a dancer from Seville.
Born to a Catalan father (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and an Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), Carmen Tórtola Valencia was born in the Triana neighborhood and moved to London with her parents at the age of three.
He was an artist of free dance and an expert in oriental dances.
During her active life, she fought as a pioneer for women&#39;s equality, just like Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and a vegetarian and fought against the wearing of a corset that restricted women&#39;s freedom of movement.
He sparked a dance and aesthetic revolution in wartime Europe, and his life dazzled Isabel Bayón.
&quot;I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa, he recommended Tórtola to my attention, whose personality really impressed me.&quot;
The flamenco dancer said: &quot;Our goal is not to tell her life story, but to capture her spirit.
The titles of his dances reminded me of flamenco styles.
For example, from the &quot;butterfly dance&quot; to guajira, or from the &quot;snake dance&quot; to tango.
&quot;He danced sensually, and according to others, this characterizes my style as well,&quot; he says.
The light of the performance is enhanced by two extraordinary contributors: Miguel Poveda sings again in Isabel&#39;s performance after the Open Door; and Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to work with a former student in this case.
&quot;Matilde plays the older Tórtola, the mature woman.
I&#39;m happy that he said yes to the invitation, it&#39;s a great honor to have him perform in my play.&quot;
In addition, the production includes musical directors and guitarists Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, singers Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; Percussionist El Pájaro, violist Rafa El Viola, and actor Juanfra Juárez, who &quot;plays the constant character who constantly besieges the real diva with his love.&quot;
The play largely shows the life of the woman, who lives in London, but also travels through Europe and reaches places that were still considered remote at the time, including India, the United States, and Italy.
&quot;I wanted to memorialize him because his personality had a great impact on his own time, but at the same time his work is not known and even less appreciated nowadays,&quot; says Bayón.
The show starts tonight at 8:30 pm in the Lope de Vega theater.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Arts
I recommend J. Vicente Resino&#39;s exhibition &quot;Flamenco and life̵&quot; because his black-and-white, documentary-style photos are fascinating.
The simplicity and strength that radiated from them, as well as the respect for the people in the photographs, caught my attention.
This exhibition is permeated with emotions.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments.&quot;
At the end of the Triennium, the &quot;Diary of a newly married poet&quot; will also be published
The first illustrated edition of Diary of a Newly Married Poet will be presented at Saint Stephen&#39;s Church (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in May 1916. The presentation is part of the series of programs entitled Zenobia and Juan Ramón Triennium (2006-2008), which was organized by the Cultural Committee of the Andalusian Regional Government on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the awarding of the Nobel Prize in Literature and the anniversary of the death of the two.
In this way, the final chord of the Zenobia and Juan Ramón Triennium is the re-release of the said work, the International Congress in New York, the restoration of the Nobel Prize-winning poet&#39;s memorial house and the traveling exhibition &quot;Juan Ramón Jiménez: The Bright Poplar&quot;. The exhibition opened in May this year, visited several Andalusian provinces and is scheduled to visit New York during the International Congress.
The Cultural Committee of the Andalusian Regional Government acquired a total of eight hundred copies of The Diary of a Newly Married Poet, published by Perdo Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to promote the reputation and work of one of the most versatile Andalusian poets.
America is not as attractive without Paul Newman
&quot;Sometimes God creates perfect people.
So was Paul Newman.&quot;
The quote comes from actress Sally Field, who worked with Newman on The Sensation, and reflects the shock and helplessness that Newman&#39;s death caused in the American film industry and across America.
How hard was he to get the Oscar?
retired in 2007,
and was known to be ill
but even so, everyone was shocked by his death.
&quot;Sometimes we can&#39;t put our feelings into words, and I just lost a good friend,&quot; said Robert Redford through tears, &quot;his existence has made my life and this country better.&quot;
No one was afraid of being ridiculed or exaggerated.
One of the heroes of the cinema and the homeland passed away during a particularly dark period, overshadowed by terrorism and fear of market conditions, a desperate search for American self-respect and dignity.
When times are so hard and many people easily lose their virtues and there are very few people left to look up to, you don&#39;t have to be Luis Cernuda to admire Paul Newman.
In the eyes of the people, he really embodied the Platonic ideal of beauty and justice.
He was Richard Nixon&#39;s formal nemesis and defender of causes lost and won, from an anti-drug foundation in memory of his firstborn son who died of a drug overdose to the creation of his homemade organic food brand.
It was a real gift to a country struggling to overcome its suicidal food culture.
The overwhelming wave of admiration swept through Hollywood regardless of nationality or origin.
According to the last James Bond, the English Daniel Craig, not a man but an era died with him.
Another Englishman, Oscar winner Sam Mendes, said that his joint work with Newman was clearly the highlight of his career.
Russell Crowe, the bad boy from Australia, called Newman his biggest inspiration.
&quot;He set the bar very high for all of us,&quot; said George Clooney, who is perhaps one of the few people today trying to follow Paul Newman&#39;s lifestyle: demanding honesty and a serious, off-camera private life.
This is not always easy, if at all possible, in today&#39;s media jungle.
Still, there are those who try, and Paul Newman is their role model.
He was divorced once, but then he was faithfully married to Joanne Woodward for fifty years, although he would certainly have had many occasions for infidelity.
&quot;Why would I eat a hamburger elsewhere when roast meat is waiting at home?&quot; - he joked.
In heaven, he can be proud that his daughters on earth are also his fans, which is not very common in America.
&quot;Of all his roles, he was more proud of none than his roles as a loyal husband, a loving father, a caring grandfather and a devoted philanthropist,&quot; they say.
The bumpy road to the Madrid Olympics
Indeed, the dream of many of us is an Olympics in Madrid, and after the 2012 failed, maybe it will be 2016.
But, I ask, are we really prepared for it?
Because if we start from yesterday&#39;s running race, I don&#39;t think so at all.
They called it a perfect race, but in my opinion, it was the worst race I&#39;ve ever been to.
It was characterized by a multitude of absurdities, and if it had to be evaluated once, and I were the examiner, the result would clearly be a failure.
Well, let&#39;s go ahead and start at the beginning.
The absurdities started with the taking of the queue number, because that is why you had to arrive earlier.
This is not a problem in itself, but if you go earlier, at least get everything at once (including the chip, to avoid queuing later).
That&#39;s not what happened.
First, they only gave the number (first nonsense, just to get there earlier) and (after the usual queue), surprisingly, it was only an S t-shirt (second nonsense, since I&#39;m an XL size)!
What kind of world do we live in?
Or because of the crisis, they decided to save on material and only buy cheaper, small-sized T-shirts?
But whatever, these things still pale in comparison to what happened on race day.
In addition to having to go there very early to receive the chip, the queue lasted 15 minutes from the time of arrival, and even the backpack had to be dropped off.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible for a running race with more than 11,000 people.
So, as expected, the race has begun and we haven&#39;t dropped our backpacks yet. When I finally did, it was even worse.
In addition, the rain made the more than 40-minute wait, interspersed with attempts at public uprising and stand-attacks, even more pleasant.
I think about 500 of us will definitely get pneumonia by tomorrow, and some of us, myself included, won&#39;t get our ranking with our actual time. I assume that my chip recorded the start incorrectly.
If you were to ask me about the perfect running race, it would naturally not come to mind.
So I think we can continue dreaming about a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft is looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At MIT&#39;s Emerging Technologies conference, Microsoft presented the development of a new image recognition and human interaction system, a kind of - not very intelligent - artificial intelligence, but capable of performing some basic tasks. For example, it can call a taxi (or, in the case of Microsoft, a vehicle on company premises) based on the information it hears from the conversation.
With the help of a camera and a shape and face recognition system, this &quot;receptionist&quot; is able to recognize how many people are in the room, who they are - and even notes what kind of clothes they are wearing - and also hears and understands the key words of their conversations.
In addition, you can group the attendees based on the conversations.
In the presentation video, the receptionist identifies a third person, but knows that he does not belong to the company talking to her, nor is he an employee of the company.
He asks if he has come to visit anyone and assures him that he will come to his aid soon.
All this without the big blue screen.
Impressive.
But of course this is the music of the future.
Currently, the company has more important things to do, such as the development of a new version of the Windows operating system.
This week, many people were saying that Microsoft is changing its strategy.
Windows 7 will be smaller and contain fewer additional programs.
Steve Ballmer realized that if computers ran only the programs they needed instead of all the commercial junk, the machines would be five times faster - well done Steve, that&#39;s something.
Spanish wax was invented, given that Microsoft has added extra features and extras to Windows in every new version so far.
Changing direction pays off.
Microsoft is right, the operating system is increasingly taking a back seat, and so is the software itself.
When Google Chrome appeared on the web, I joined the theory that with it Google took the first step to become a competitor to Windows.
Many have correctly recognized that a browser is not part of the operating system.
The operating system will always be needed, as it is an essential element for the dialogue between hardware and software.
She plays the same role as your wife or husband when you want to say something to your mother-in-law.
That&#39;s right.
It will never disappear, but the &quot;death&quot; of the operating system must be reckoned with, not in an absolute sense, but in a relative sense.
Ballmer&#39;s statement this week supports that idea.
People pay less and less attention to the operating system and more and more to the web browser.
We turn on the computer only to open Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and more and more time is spent browsing than we spend in the world of windows.
What is the purpose of most of the applications that come with the system then?
Sometimes less is more.
And Windows 7 should be less, much less than Vista.
Less difficult, less burdened, less complicated.
Microsoft&#39;s goal is to integrate its services more online and to eventually represent an alternative to Google.
They really need all of this, I&#39;ll give you an example of why.
I took this photo earlier this month at a Microsoft employee lounge in Redmond.
A poster on the soda machine urges them to use the company&#39;s browser. - &quot;Your browser. Our future.&quot;
In 2006, an independent study found that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google for web browsing.
By the way, the release of the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was also announced last week.
It will arrive not at the beginning of 2009, but at the end, rather in 2010.
Microsoft will probably try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together.
After all, the mobile phone functions more and more like a computer.
But the slippage, given that Android and iPhone are already in the market, will definitely hurt their business.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
It was worn by Pablo Picasso on the Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio in Edward Zwick&#39;s Blood Diamond, and Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola&#39;s The Godfather, and it is also one of the staples of the gay customer base.
And if we&#39;re on the list of special features, we can even recall the peaceful figure of the weightlifter with the goofy mustache of the traveling circus.
But what are we talking about? It&#39;s about none other than the - typically tight and sleeveless - men&#39;s cotton leotard.
In other words, about the &quot;tank&quot;, as the English people call it, but none of its competitors can compete with le Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles.
First of all, because of his elegant name - although he is only referred to as &quot;Marcel&quot; among friends - which he owes to the sport, because according to legend, he was named after the boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
Marcel also stands out from its competitors due to its excellent cotton material, unisex cut, distinctive logo and small (barely recognizable) Belgian flag. The latter is carried hidden in the neck of the t-shirt by the most typical models.
But the Belgian company doesn&#39;t just make tank tops.
Sports tops, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, woolen trousers, sailor shirts, baby clothes, miniskirts - and we could list more - are all part of the company&#39;s products.
And they all belong to the comfortable underwear category,
although it is also unfortunate that they have to be worn as underwear.
They&#39;re too good for that.
Honda sales record for the second time
In November, Honda will start selling the second-generation Jazz.
It is true that the passenger space of its predecessor was already quite large, but the design of the interior of the new model is even more spacious.
All this is combined with sophisticated mechanics that make driving more comfortable and increase fuel economy.
Evolution versus revolution.
This is what the second generation Honda Jazz looks like.
Although the new Jazz looks very similar to its predecessor, a number of internal changes have been made to it.
These include, for example, innovative design, new bodywork, larger dimensions and new mechanics.
But before we move on to the detailed description of the new model, we must say that the new Jazz was released six years after the first generation was launched.
So, first of all, we can state that Honda managed to renew this model in a shorter time than other manufacturers.
Although Jazz is less well-known in Europe, it breaks sales records in other markets.
Such a market is, for example, Japan, where Jazz was the most sought-after car brand in 2002 and again this year in 2008.
In Japan, for example, nearly one million units of the Jazz have been sold since its launch.
The second market was the Old Continent, with nearly half a million copies sold in six years.
Nevertheless, Honda wants to further increase traffic in the region with the new Jazz.
That is, while in 2007 the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 Jazz, for 2009 the estimates aim to sell 100,000 cars, which would result in a 17% increase in the European market.
Since 2002, Honda has sold 8,000 Jazz in the Spanish market, which represents 6.7% of Honda&#39;s total sales in Spain.
In the case of the new generation, the managers of the Spanish subsidiary calculate with 2,000 copies sold within a year.
Moreover, it is the arrival of the new Jazz that will greatly alleviate the decline in Honda&#39;s traffic in Spain.
The company&#39;s representatives predict 22,000 copies sold by the end of this year, which is 4,000 fewer than the 2007 figures, i.e. a 16% decrease.
Despite the terms of the sale, Honda increased its market share in Spain, rising to 1.8% from 1.6% last year.
By 2010, I would also like to increase this ratio to 2%.
Honda hopes to achieve this with the launch of a new model.
This would be the Insight, a five-door and compact hybrid - 4370 mm long - of which the Japanese company would distribute 200,000 units worldwide every year.
According to the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of Insight&#39;s market share would be in the United States, while the remaining share would be divided between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial launch of Insight is due in the first months of the year, after the official presentation in Valencia scheduled for January.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz has become more spacious in all respects.
Its length reaches 3,900 mm (five centimeters longer), its width is 1,690 mm (two centimeters wider) and the wheelbase has increased by five centimeters, i.e. 2,500 mm.
However, its height remains unchanged at 1520 mm.
In addition to the dimensions, the passenger compartment has also become more spacious.
The larger interior space is guaranteed on the one hand by the new bodywork and on the other hand by the fuel tank located in the middle - this solution is already known from the previous Jazz.
Furthermore, the total cargo space of the so-called double-floor luggage compartment has increased, it is currently 399 liters, i.e. 19 liters more than the capacity of the first generation.
Although this includes the fact that the mentioned dimensions refer to the type with a 1.4 engine, because the trunk of the 1.2 Honda Jazz is 379 liters.
Some external modifications can also be discovered, such as the rear LED lights or the optional panoramic glass roof, as well as easier access to the rear seats.
In addition, the opening angle of the doors belonging to the rear seats has been increased to 80 degrees, compared to the opening angle of 67 degrees in the first Jazz.
The engines of the second generation Jazz are also new.
At the beginning of its sales, this small model can be ordered with two engines, 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Thanks to the i-VTEC technology, the consumption of both resources is more favorable than the previous model, and it is characterized by lower carbon dioxide emissions and excellent mechanical coordination, while at the same time the engine provides excellent performance in all respects.
The output of the 1.2-liter engine is 90 horsepower at 6,000 rpm, and its maximum torque is 114 Nm at 4,900 rpm.
This engine - which had 78 horsepower in the previous Jazz - consumes 5.3 liters and emits 125 grams of CO2.
And the other engine, which produced 83 horsepower in the previous generation, now reaches 100 horsepower.
The 100 hp 1.4 Jazz consumes an average of 5.4 liters and emits 128 grams of CO2.
&quot;I want to be a young mother; it doesn&#39;t matter who the father is&quot;
He is very similar to his brother, but at the same time he managed to realize himself.
Monica Cruz is small and fragile, but full of energy.
Currently, the Cruz sisters want to take a more serious role in the world of fashion.
For Monica, modeling is much more than just some pretty and pretty girls putting their name on something.
He was present at the promotion of Mango&#39;s new headquarters in Paris, as well as at the presentation of the most prestigious fashion awards sponsored by the Spanish company.
It radiates welcoming warmth and gentleness.
What are you actually doing in Paris?
We present Mango&#39;s new autumn-winter collection, which I designed with my sister, Penélope. In addition, we will participate in the announcement of the second competition of the &#39;Mango Fashion Awards&#39; and the gala dinner organized in honor of Valentino at the Opera.
Quite a busy day, it&#39;s true, but very exciting.
This is your fourth season at Mango. Where did you get the inspiration for the new collection?
We both love 50s and 60s cinema; we took a lot from there.
And then, I often just walk around the city and watch women, how they dress, how they vary and choose their clothes - this is one of my favorite pastimes.
You also work as a dancer, actress and fashion designer. You are a versatile woman, aren&#39;t you?
I think so too, but in the end these three things are related, as they have a lot in common.
I was interested in clothes even when I was little, I couldn&#39;t wait to go to my grandmother&#39;s house and rummage through my aunt&#39;s wardrobes.
Well, it was the same in Canaan, almost as big as an amusement park.
Also, as a dancer, I always tried to pay attention to my dressing.
You know, us dancers like to come up with our own style for classes and rehearsals so we can feel good when we look in the mirror.
And in the role of an actress, you really identify with your role when you get the costume.
You see, everything is connected to everything, and all my respect goes to the designers and their expertise.
You recently celebrated your 30th birthday. Didn&#39;t you fall into lethargy?
Oh no!
I feel better than ever, I love the 30s.
I think women really mature at this point, they are already experienced enough and make fewer mistakes in life.
And the biological clock doesn&#39;t worry me.
I have been doing what I feel like doing since I was a child, and it fills me with great inner happiness.
And do you want to be a mother or not?
Of course, I know that I will become a mother, because as a woman I was born to do so, in fact, I want to be a young mother, I don&#39;t want to miss this in any way.
As for the future father, it doesn&#39;t matter who he will be.
I would like to raise my child in happiness and great love.
Let&#39;s say a few words about the cinema. Last year you shot several films that have not been shown yet.
Sure, and I can&#39;t wait for them to come out.
I, who started in the theater, am very impatient and restless, I want everything immediately, but of course I know that this is impossible.
I can&#39;t wait to see The Last Hour and The Search for Christ&#39;s Tomb.
I wonder what you said to them...
As far as I know, you made your runway debut with Naomi Campbell a few days ago.
Well, no, that&#39;s not true...
I didn&#39;t walk the runway as a model.
I&#39;ve known Naomi Campbell for a long time, and she simply invited me to a charity fashion show in London that she organized for her organization, Women for a Better World. I chose two of my own Mango collections. The presented clothes were auctioned off, and the proceeds were donated to Naomi&#39;s NGO.
People don&#39;t even know how kind-hearted Naomi is.
There are so many things about him, I know him, and I can assure you that not even half of them are true.
On the other hand, I always look at the bright side of his activities.
She asked me to the fashion show for a noble cause, but if she wanted me to stand on my head, I&#39;d do that too.
If the fate of women living in the third world is at stake, I don&#39;t know anything impossible.
The collision-avoidant &quot;bee car&quot;
For the development of accident prevention technologies, this time Nissan took inspiration from nature, more precisely from the world of bees, for its new invention.
The Japanese company has designed a robot that avoids accidents by imitating the flight of bees.
A device called the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, may be the first step in the development of collision avoidance technologies.
Engineers from Nissan Motor Co.&#39;s Advanced Technical Center, in cooperation with the renowned Tokyo University&#39;s Advanced Science and Technology Research Center, built this small robot in Japan.
According to Kazuhhiro Doi, Brand Director of Technology PR and Research Development, the BR23C is a further extension of Nissan&#39;s four-layer safety envelope.
The robot completes the collision avoidance capability of the company&#39;s products.
In flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space, very similar to Nissan&#39;s safety envelope.
However, the role of the bee&#39;s compound eyes is much more important than this, with which it can see in all directions at an angle of more than 300 degrees. Consequently, the bee can fly undisturbed in its own personal space.
To copy the function of the compound eye, the engineers designed a so-called laser range finder (Laser Range Finder).
The instrument identifies obstacles up to 2 meters in front of the BR23C in a 180-degree field of view, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which is immediately converted into an action to avoid a collision.
&quot;As soon as an obstacle is detected, the small robot, imitating the movements of the bee, immediately changes direction by moving the wheels at a smaller or larger angle in order to avoid a collision.
The main difference between the system and the currently available instruments is that in this case the evasive maneuver takes place completely automatically.
If this were not the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles,&quot; explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and chief engineer of the project.
Unlike the bees, the evasive maneuver cannot be directed up or down, nor diagonally, it can only move in two dimensions and only in the direction of the turning of the wheels, that is, not in an infinite direction and way, as is the case with the bees.
That&#39;s why, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, Nissan also used a rotation function in the robot to avoid collisions.
&quot;This structure only needs to process and respond to data every few seconds.
There is no need to store data or intuitive logic based on previous maneuvers, so it can work without interruption even with only a few dozen KB of memory.
This may sound surprising, but we are not really talking about gigabytes, but we are not even talking about megabytes of memory.
This is the first step in the development of immediate crash prevention technology, which Nissan estimates could enter production cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and more durable than the lithium-ion version.
In the future, the integration of the unit with the GPS satellite navigation system may be an additional possibility of application in order to get the motorist to the final destination by avoiding obstacles on the road.
Drunken drivers who relapse will be required to install an &quot;Alcolock&quot;.
The Ministry of the Interior would oblige the motorist to install a device that would prevent the vehicle from starting if the driver is drunk or does not blow into the device after three drunk driving violations.
The proposal was presented in June and is currently being dealt with by the State Prosecutor&#39;s Office, according to which the pilot project will last one year.
Since the goal of the project is to restore traffic, the driver will also have to participate in a repeat course on traffic education.
In addition to the General Prosecutor&#39;s Office for Traffic Safety, the Directorate General of Transport (DGT) and the Foundation for the Technology Institute of Automotive Safety (FITSA) are also participating in the experiment.
According to statistics, 30-75% of motorists who have been repeatedly arrested for drunk driving get back into the car.
Alcolock would prevent this, since the system connected to the vehicle determines the alcohol level of the air blown into it. If it is greater than the permissible limit, or if the driver has not blown into the device at all, the system will not allow the car to be started.
The cost of the instrument, which is more than 1,000 euros, would be borne by the violator.
A relevant 2007 study in the USA proved that vehicles equipped with such instruments can reduce the number of violations by up to 65% in the first year after installation.
And in Spain, according to estimates, this rule could save the lives of 115 people every year.
The measure focuses on violations for two reasons: on the one hand, it is easier to prevent them from turning into crimes,
on the other hand, it is easier to introduce, since the implementation of the legal reform takes place in the usual way, while the necessary criminal justice reform would require an amendment to the Basic Law.
The instrument is not yet available in any commercial form on the Spanish market, although it has already been installed in some industrial and public service vehicles in experimental mode.
Tomorrow, the House of Representatives will vote on the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Workers&#39; Party, which calls for the installation of the system in school buses, following the French model.
In Mexico, in closed shoes
In English, at the time announced in the program, at 5:40 p.m., the plane carrying the Prince of Asturias Party of the Spanish Air Force landed in the Presidential Hangar of Mexico City&#39;s Benito Juárez Airport.
The sun was already setting, but it was still so hot that we could only see the royal couple getting off the plane using our hands as blinders.
At the foot of the stairs stood the Spanish ambassador and other dignitaries.
A few hours before, I asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Spanish Princely Couple was coming to the city for an official visit.
- That&#39;s great, then there won&#39;t be an airport transfer for quite some time today... The woman is from here or something...
- No, no sir, the lady is Spanish, she just lived here for a few years.
- Yeah, or something like that...
But the Mexican press knows everything about the Duke and Duchess of Asturias and the importance of their visit.
Many people are waiting at the red carpet of the airport hangar, at the cordon formed by the 27 marines who protect the dignitaries.
The Prince appears, smiling, in a sea-blue dress, and then the Princess, with the wind blowing in her long hair, dressed modestly, but not in the usual shoes with flashing toes - perhaps they were warned that Mexico City was threatened by a storm.
They stop for a moment and smile for the cameras, then enter the room where the official reception will follow.
At the gate of their hotel - which is one of the four largest hotels in the city - a sassy reporter from Mexican television is waiting for them.
I fear the mortgage
We have to admit that the US Treasury Department, in addition to having a lot of investable cash, is not lacking in common sense.
With the crisis on their necks, and to prevent Americans from getting entangled in the maze of mortgage banks with questionable solvency, they created a fun and informative online game called &quot;Bad Credit Hotel&quot;.
This is the &quot;Bad Credit Hotel&quot; ... that is, the galibas.
The gloomy image of the accommodation and especially the receptionist suggests that we should think once, twice, or rather three times, whether it is really time to take out a loan.
And especially where to apply for a loan, since this is probably the purpose of the matter.
The information on the website is really useful, but not very detailed.
It is aimed at teenagers rather than the general public.
But what if we added to the game?
For example, the room of our dreams would appear in the hotel.
Actually, it&#39;s something, since we don&#39;t even dare to dream about buying an apartment...
The most valuable fashion award
The best place in the world to present a fashion award is without a doubt Paris, and the most sophisticated and coolest of the fashion designers alive today is without a doubt Valentino.
Mango recently announced the second competition of the El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, which aims to introduce young talents of the fashion industry internationally.
The main prize is 300,000 euros.
Yesterday, however, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first competition, saw her own designed clothes in the Mango window at 54 boulevard Haussmann in Paris, and she almost cried with emotion.
By the way, this is the company&#39;s second largest European store and recently opened on 1,335 square meters.
The largest store is located in London.
In the middle of the event, as well as the thanks to Valentino for presiding over the jury, we finally found ourselves at a luxury dinner at the Garnier Opera in Paris.
In the company of the most enjoyable Chagals, the gala dinner&#39;s presidential table made by Mango looked even more spectacular.
Nati, who came with a heavy heart and sadness due to the recent death of her brother, wore a piece from the Company and some breathtaking jewelry from ELAH. He accompanied Valentino to the main table of the dinner organized in his honor, arm in arm with his son named Luis, who is nearly two meters tall.
Andik, the owner and host of Mango, entertained the guests. Together with Baron Rotchil, they were so chivalrous that they ended up without a suit, as they each gave it to a lady.
Monica Cruz arrived at the store in her own designed pants and shirt, and at dinner she wore a sexy long black dress. During the night&#39;s visit to the opera, Gaya became so enamored with Toledo&#39;s company in the ballet hall that, recalling the old times, he walked over to one of the poles and improvised a grand plie.
Inés Sastre did not take part in the palace visit, but before that he showed some photos of his son on his mobile phone.
The next morning we were able to admire Oliver Martinez - he is also about two meters tall and rides a motorbike - and John Travolta also arrived at the Intercontinental hotel in Paris. He also brought his own sheets and towels and said well in advance that he would not ask for any perfume in the room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh là là, c&#39;est la vie.

Those who talk in their sleep
Some children talk at night.
I don&#39;t mean the ones who wake up and tell me fully awake what happened to them that day, but the ones who talk in their sleep.
The phenomenon may seem scary at first, but it is actually completely harmless.
This benign sleep disorder is called somniloquism.
It is quite common, especially among children and adolescents.
They must have told several of them that he talked at night.
In terms of frequency, it can be completely rhapsodic (for example, it occurs only once in an illness with high fever) or more regular (once a day, week or month), and usually the next day the child does not remember anything.
Its appearance cannot be traced back to a single underlying cause.
It is often combined with other sleep disorders, such as nightmares, waking up at night, bedwetting at night (enuresis nocturna) or sleepwalking, but this is also not legal.
As we have already mentioned, it can be a condition accompanied by a high fever, or even a stress or heightened state of excitement.
In any case, it has been little studied until now.
The intensity of speech is also very variable.
It can be quiet, calm, it can consist of incoherent words, mumbling, but in contrast to all of these, it can also occur in the form of shouting, crying or longer speech.
If the phenomenon is very intense, it is recommended to observe the child and contact a specialist. The examination can reveal whether there is an underlying problem causing great anxiety and thus offer a solution.
As already mentioned, it is a benign phenomenon, and therefore there is no cure for it, unless it is accompanied by some other treatable form of sleep disorder (for example, insomnia or stress).
However, there are some things we can do, here are a bunch of preventive measures:
Make sure the child stays calm before going to bed.
Let&#39;s choose soothing games and avoid the child watching fear-inducing or more aggressive TV shows or series.
We teach children who are prone to nervousness or who find it difficult to relax some relaxation methods to help them find inner peace.
This helps the child sleep more peacefully.
If he does start talking in his sleep, try to keep calm.
Remember, this is harmless to the child and they won&#39;t remember anything the next day.
Useful advice
Do not wake the child.
It would be unnecessary, because the child is not conscious, but it would wake him up from sleep.
Even though he talks, he actually continues to sleep and rest.
Remember, if the phenomenon is accompanied by severe anxiety several times, it is recommended to consult a specialist or find out what is causing the child&#39;s high level of anxiety.
If he speaks intelligibly (which is the rarer case), don&#39;t start asking him questions to find out anything from him.
It would be unnecessary anyway, since he is not conscious enough to gather his thoughts during sleep.
On the other hand, you only hear the speech, but you do not see the dream images associated with it, so be careful with the interpretation of what you hear and the possible conclusions.
Never tell the child that they can ask him about his secrets at night.
Not even as a joke.
This causes a lot of anxiety.
So the most important thing is not to worry, as it is only a harmless episode of a few minutes.
Finally straight on the Illhaeuser
After a long slump, the Illhaeusern team finally gained new momentum and won again at home.
Although it wasn&#39;t a fierce match, the yellow and black got into several situations, and they were able to take advantage of one of them and finally win.
The pace of the match was not very tight, as the attackers struggled to find the right rhythm.
The first shot on goal was attempted by the captain of the visiting team, Kauffmann, but the far ball just touched the top corner of the post. Illhaeusern then gained the upper hand and shots followed one after the other: Fonderflick tried a long-range shot and Hirn&#39;s shot went over the bar. Romain tried to shake the Dannemarie defense with a spike, and Diebold also tried to shake it with a long shot.
On the other side, the players gathered in a block and defended in the midfield, and only the ever-moving Riahi was in a shooting position.
The start of the second half promised to be crucial: Riahi and Temporale were first in a position on the Dannemarie side. Immediately after that, the first goal was scored: Illhaeuser&#39;s Marais got the ball after Diebold&#39;s first shot with excellent positioning, and then put it into the goal (53rd minute).
However, Illhausern&#39;s scorer could not enjoy the glory for long: twelve minutes later, he was forced to leave the field, so his teammates had to continue the fight with a man disadvantage.
Dannemarie, on the other hand, could not take advantage of their advantage: they did not cause much trouble to the home team, who just pulled back a little to strengthen their defense. Only the last seconds held some excitement, when after a lot of haste, the ball came very close to the goal post.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy makes a detour to Brittany.
On Monday, a demonstration held by fishermen paralyzed traffic in several Breton and Norman ports. Therefore, the President of the Republic decided to visit the port of Le Guilvinec in Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet the representatives of the protesters.
The latter promised to welcome the president in a &quot;constructive spirit&quot; and expressed their hope that Sarkozy would &quot;come with concrete proposals&quot;.
The president&#39;s visit coincides with a meeting of the &quot;crisis committee&quot; set up by Breton fishermen to initiate action against the rise in the price of diesel, as the price of oil has exceeded a record average price of €1.14 per litre.
According to David Martinon, the spokesman of the President of the Republic, the President &quot;will discuss with the fishermen what solutions could be used to help the companies regain their competitiveness, and to make the working conditions and wages safer for the sailors&quot;.
The fishermen are eagerly awaiting the arrival of Nicolas Sarkozy.
On Tuesday morning, traffic-slowing demonstrations were held in Morbihan and Calvados departments, causing nearly 10 km of traffic jams.
Traffic in Quiberon&#39;s marina was also paralyzed, but the roads leading to Belle-île were not blocked.
Roadblocks were placed on the Quiberon peninsula.
On Monday, the sailors already showed their determination. Tires and pallets were set on fire in front of the fuel depots of the ports of Brest at dawn, while demonstrations also took place in Concerneau and Saint-Brieuc.
This was followed by further movements in other ports on the Atlantic coast and in the English Channel. In Sables d&#39;Olonne in the Vendée department, for example, fishermen did not get on board, while in Le Havre, about twenty boats blocked the traffic of commercial ships.
Fishermen from La Turballe and Le Croisic in the Loire-Atlantique department lifted the blockade of the huge Total oil refinery in Donges in the evening.
The fishermen of Boulogne-sur-Mer, on the other hand, decided to wait for Wednesday&#39;s meeting at the ministry before deciding on further steps.
In fact, the &quot;crisis committee&quot; in Le Guilvinec must decide on its next step and participation in the meeting planned at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris on Tuesday.
However, some Breton fishermen do not want their interests to be represented by the leaders of the national fisheries commission, as the commission has not supported their aspirations.
&quot;The strike will continue&quot; because &quot;the fishermen will not budge on their demands&quot; and &quot;refuse to travel to Paris,&quot; announced Liliane Cariou, president of the Lorient fishing committee, for example.
Commercial fishermen, who do not pay tax on diesel, currently pay around 50 cents per litre, but believe that operating a vessel would only become profitable if the price of diesel fell below €0.30 per litre.
The wonderful Paul Newman
The unforgettable title character of &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&quot; died of cancer at the age of 83 at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes also paid their respects to the cinema legend and dedicated actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer will not change its 2008 delivery plans
Despite the crisis threatening the world economy, the Brazilian aircraft manufacturing company plans to deliver 215 aircraft this year.
The world&#39;s fourth largest aircraft manufacturing company, Embraer, can keep its plans and plans to deliver 215 aircraft in 2008, confirmed Fredrico Fleury Curado, the company&#39;s president.
In the first half of the year, the company delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturing company is counting heavily on the Chinese market, especially for its 30-120-seat aircraft.
So far, Embraer has delivered a total of 41 planes to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would sell more than 15% of its assets
The insurance company American International Group, which was put on its feet by the American financial authorities, wants to sell more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the 85 billion dollars advanced to it, the Dominican edition of the Financial Times reported.
Apart from its international life insurance and American pension insurance activities, AIG would part with most of its other businesses, the newspaper clarified, quoting sources close to the matter.
According to the Times, AIG&#39;s board of directors met Sunday night to consider the possibility of a sale.
AIG has not confirmed this information.
The assets AIG wants to sell include the company&#39;s aircraft leasing company International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in reinsurance company Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate portfolio and private equity investments, the Times adds.
However, according to the newspaper, no final decision has yet been made regarding the sale.
AIG needs to quickly obtain liquid assets in order to repay the $85 billion loan approved for it by the US government. By doing so, you take on the risk of having to part with up to 80% of your capital, and you lose a corresponding proportion of your shareholders.
Paris Historique&#39;s study of the historic Morning Meeting
The New York stock market posted a historic drop on Monday after the Senate rejected the Paulson bailout plan. The Dow Jones fell 6.98% (an unprecedented drop of nearly 800 points), and the Nasdaq fell 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average index (DJIA) fell by 777.68 points to close at 10,365.45 points.
The largest drop in the index so far (684.81 points) was registered on September 17, 2001, when trading resumed after the September 11 terrorist attack.
The Nasdaq, based mainly on technology papers, closed down 199.61 points at 1,983.73 points, while the extended Standard &amp; Poor&#39;s 500 index fell by 8.81% (or 106.85 points) to 1,106.55 points, according to official closing data .
The Wall Street stock market was already weak at the opening, and then when the Senate unexpectedly rejected the bank rescue plan aimed at restoring market balance, it began to plummet.
With 228 &quot;no&quot; votes to 205 &quot;yes&quot; votes, the representatives refused to provide the funds requested by Finance Minister Henry Paulson.
The plan was voted down by nearly two-thirds of Republicans.
&quot;The market has filtered bad signals from this, as Congress seems unable to approve a plan,&quot; said Lindsey Piegza, an analyst at FTN Financial.
&quot;This also shows how much the market expected this plan,&quot; he added, and then expressed his concern that if such a plan were to be accepted a few days later, it would be &quot;too late.&quot;
&quot;If the plan is really doomed (...), then it will be the turn of the Fed (US central bank - ed.) and other central banks to deal with the crisis, and lending conditions will tighten further&quot; - warns Brian Bethune, Global Insight&#39;s chief economist.
Adding to the sense of urgency, Piegza adds, &quot;every day that passes, more and more financial institutions fail&quot; in the United States.
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, the authorities ensured that Wachovia&#39;s banking business was acquired by its rival, Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis accelerated suddenly, necessitating emergency measures to save banks in the United Kingdom, the Benelux countries, Iceland and Germany. This indicates that &quot;not only an American but a global crisis has developed&quot; in the market, adds the FTN Financial analyst.
The bond market recovered significantly.
The yield of the 10-year government bond fell from 3.827% to 3.632% by Friday evening, and the 30-year yield fell from 4.357% to 4.161% the previous day.
Morgan Stanley opens its capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley has announced that it will provide a stake in its capital to Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG). Japan&#39;s largest bank is paying $9 billion for 21% of the company&#39;s capital after Morgan Stanley&#39;s share price plummeted on the stock market.
A week after the preliminary deal was made public, the two banks said MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley&#39;s common stock at a price of $25.25 a share, or a total of $3 billion.
The accepted price is more than 19% below the book value of the securities on August 31.
MUFG will invest an additional $6 billion in the purchase of convertible securities, which will yield 10% and have a conversion rate of $31.25.
According to Morgan Stanley, an average exchange rate of $29 will be used as a basis for the global transaction, which is 28% higher than the current exchange rate.
However, Morgan Stanley shares fell 6.79% to close at $23.07 at around 5pm GMT.
&quot;This strategic alliance offers a great opportunity for Morgan Stanley to accelerate its transformation into a bank holding company,&quot; explains John Mack, CEO of the American group.
Morgan Stanley approved the new status last week, which will allow it to diversify its operations while also being controlled by the Federal Reserve.
The agreement with MUFG once again confirms that the current financial crisis demands even greater caution from the corporate giants listed on Wall Street.
By the way, from the conditions announced on Monday, it can be seen that the agreement has been modified in recent days: last Monday, Morgan only announced that it would sell 20% of its shares to the Japanese company for approximately $8.5 billion.
&quot;A week ago, we thought the stake would be entirely common stock,&quot; explained Toshihide Mizuno, managing director of MUFG in Tokyo.
&quot;However, due to the current market and economic situation, we wanted to minimize and avoid possible risks.&quot;
On a weighted average price basis, MUFG is paying 7% more than book value for Morgan Stanley shares.
As a result of the transaction, earnings per share will decrease by approximately 20%.
Based on the agreement, MUFG can convert half of its preferred shares into common shares after one year, if the trading price of the latter exceeds the conversion price by more than 50% for a specified period, i.e. rises to approximately $47.
This ensures that Morgan Stanley can use the funds from MUFG to take advantage of its investment opportunities, improve its balance sheet and increase its liquid resources.
However, the group&#39;s spokesperson did not want to give precise information about the strategic plans of the two new allies.
Following the incorporation of MUFG, Morgan Stanley is expected to increase its Tier I solvency ratio by approximately 15%, making it one of the best in its sector.
Morgan said its balance sheet had improved &quot;definitely&quot; since the end of August.
The last few weeks have been a great ordeal for the group, as the price of its shares fell by half, while the cost of its insurance against the risk of non-payment skyrocketed.
This cost moderated on Monday, but remained at a high level of around 12%.
After the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the acquisition of Merrill Lynch, there is only one &quot;survivor&quot; left among the big investment banks. This is Goldman Sachs, which announced last week that it has raised $15 billion, part of which comes from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett&#39;s conglomerate.
Statement by Rafael Correa on Monday, Quito
The reconstruction of the republic in the XXI. in the spirit of 19th century socialism.
This is the joint plan of Venezuela&#39;s Hugo Chávez, Bolivia&#39;s Evo Morales and Ecuador&#39;s Rafael Correa.
Following the example of his fellow presidents and friends, on Sunday Correa explained his ideas for the new constitution.
He succeeded in his mission, as 64% of voters voted yes in the referendum, according to the official results, which covered 80% of the votes cast.
According to this, 28% of the population voted no, 7% of the votes were invalid, while 0.7% were left blank.
The adoption of the draft constitution required 50% + 1 vote.
On Sunday, two surveys conducted at the exit of polling stations and a count conducted by an NGO both proved the huge superiority of &quot;yes&quot; votes with 63% and 70% respectively.
By the way, Rafael Correa already talked about the victory of his draft constitution on the night from Sunday to Monday.
&quot;The constitution won an overwhelming victory,&quot; he declared, thanking Ecuadorians at his governor&#39;s seat in Guayaquil, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
As is well known, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez, Morales and the President of Chile, Michelle Bachelet.
The Organization of American States (OAS) observer mission reported that the voting took place in a calm atmosphere. Its main topic was a 444-point text summarizing the principles of the &quot;new socialism&quot; defended by the president.
The planned constitution puts state power at the service of the economy, reserving the right of the state to &quot;plan development&quot; for a country that basically lives on oil extraction by foreign companies and foreign currency sent by emigrants.
The draft constitution of Correa, who was elected in 2006, also strengthens the power of the head of state, who can obtain a mandate for a maximum of two consecutive terms and has the right to dissolve the parliament.
Correa has already announced that he wants to take advantage of this opportunity, and in February 2009 he will compete again for the mandate of the head of state.
By the way, free health services and education were also included in the constitution. The president has already started implementing it in his country, which has 13.9 million inhabitants and half of the population lives below the subsistence minimum.
Finally, the Constitution prohibits the presence of foreign troops in the country. That could end an agreement between Quito and Washington to use the Ecuadorian facility as a base for US anti-drug operations.
Obama won the first televised duel
The first debate between the two US presidential candidates on Friday was followed by another, which had to decide whether John McCain or Barack Obama would emerge from the duel as the winner.
Unsurprisingly, both Republican and Democratic campaign officials claimed victory in a televised duel watched by a third of American households.
According to political analyst David Gergen, although John McCain&#39;s performance was respectable, it was not &quot;impressive&quot; enough to stop the decline in his popularity, as evidenced by polls conducted five weeks before the presidential election.
According to the Gallup institute, the Democratic candidate is better in the fight: according to the results of the public opinion poll published on Saturday, Obama has a five-point advantage over McCain (44% and 49%).
Among the most important, still undecided voters, 39% of those polled say Obama will win, while 25% expect McCain to win, according to a CBS survey.
Obama is expected to further increase his advantage with the promising performance of his running mate, Joseph Biden, on Thursday. Biden is preparing for his first and only public debate with rival Sarah Palin.
However, Bill Clinton warned this weekend: &quot;It would be a mistake to underestimate Palin.
You have good intuition.&quot;
McCain, now in his seventies, never fails to highlight his own, arguably enormous foreign policy experience. He also emphasizes his opponent&#39;s &quot;naivety&quot; in these issues, which were the focus of their first face-to-face meeting.
&quot;Senator Obama doesn&#39;t seem to understand that...&quot; - the attack was made several times.
&quot;I do not believe that Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge to be president,&quot; McCain said.
This is the main attack surface, which is also exploited by the Republican TV ads that have been running since yesterday.
Obama, on the other hand, emphasized that he represents the future.
He did not allow himself to be embarrassed: he expressed himself concisely and precisely.
He emphasized his ability to make good decisions and restore the image of the United States in the world.
&quot;McCain still doesn&#39;t understand, but Obama already does,&quot; retorted the Democratic ad aired this weekend, accusing the Republican leader of still not assessing the impact of the crisis on the American &quot;people on the street.&quot;
&quot;During the ninety minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you,&quot; Obama declared yesterday in front of 20,000 people who gathered in the pouring rain in North Carolina for the election meeting.
He didn&#39;t even utter the words &quot;middle class&quot; or &quot;working class.&quot; The chaotic situation in the financial world undoubtedly favors Obama, who Americans consider the most qualified to save the economy on the brink of collapse.
&quot;The next week could prove to be a turning point,&quot; Charles Schumer, the influential Democratic senator, believed yesterday.
Democratic Rep. Rahm Emanuel, a veteran of the Clinton administration, said Obama has &quot;as good economic instincts as Bill Clinton did during the 1998 financial crisis.&quot;
In the eyes of the Democratic presidential candidate, the current crisis is &quot;the final verdict on eight years of bad economic policy created by George Bush with the support of Senator McCain.&quot;
The Illinois senator reaffirmed that he will be able to lower the tax burden of 95% of Americans despite the stock market fluctuations. He added that his primary goals include the creation of the country&#39;s possible energy independence through the use of renewable energy sources, as well as the establishment of a health insurance system.
McCain, on the other hand, plans to build 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
However, both presidential candidates carefully avoided questions about the $700 billion (€470 billion) bank rescue plan: the extremely unpopular plan passed by Congress last night.
Minsk: &quot;Did you notice that there was an election here?&quot;
Young people and opposition protested on Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the expected results of the parliamentary elections.
After the polls closed on Sunday evening, hundreds of Belarusians gathered in the main square of Minsk to protest against the falsification of the election results.
Although results have not yet been announced, many young people demonstrated against President Alexander Lukashenko with the words: &quot;Dictator, resign!&quot;.
Some admit that they didn&#39;t even go to vote: &quot;Why would I go? They&#39;re going to do what they want with my vote anyway!&quot; says a young man.
The protesters do not believe that the regime, which tried to present itself in a good light to foreign observers in order to build relations with the European Union, is ready for a democratic regime change.
If the elections were deemed fair by observers, they could lift sanctions on the country, which have denied visas to 40 Belarusian leaders and frozen some bank accounts.
However, according to the opposition, the elections were not fair.
&quot;They kept us away from the election commissions, and our observers were not allowed to participate in the vote counting,&quot; lamented Yuriy Potemkin, the spokesman for the twelve-party, thus very heterogeneous United Democratic Forces coalition.
&quot;The changes were only nominal,&quot; emphasizes Aleksandr Milinkievics, the opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election and the leader of the pro-European movement. &quot;The bottom line is who counts the votes, and in our case it is the executive branch.
If opposition delegates get into parliament, it means they were appointed, not elected.
But their entry into parliament allows them to be on television, hold meetings in the country&#39;s regions and introduce bills.
The opposition must therefore take the stage in political life, because &quot;dialogue with the European Union must be initiated&quot;.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, falls into a crisis and we are unable to renew ourselves, we risk falling under the authority of Russia.
We, on the other hand, want to be independent.&quot;
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which monitors the election process, will accept the result of the vote as valid.
They emphasize that the turnout appears to be too high, and that the large-scale organization of the preliminary voting (in which 26% of the voters in Minsk took part) provided an opportunity for any manipulation.
&quot;Did you notice that there was an election here?&quot; - asks social democratic leader Aleksandr Kozulin, who was the last to be released from the prison, where he was held as a political prisoner, in August this year.
No one was in the polling stations.
And a maximum of five opposition representatives will enter the parliament, namely those who best suit the leadership.
The silence of the night falls on Október Square again.
And on television, President Lukashenko and the members of the Central Election Commission are rejoicing at their success.
The 19 hostages in Chad were freed
An Egyptian commando attacked the kidnappers, who had taken eleven tourists and their eight companions hostage ten days ago.
The hostages are now in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions were held in the desert for ten days, from where they were transported unharmed to the Egyptian capital on Monday afternoon.
The hostages were freed in Chad by an Egyptian commando during the morning.
Apparently in good condition, they arrived by plane at the al-Maza military base, which is directly connected to Cairo International Airport, around 4:30 p.m.
The hostages were forbidden to speak to the press and were immediately transferred to a hospital in Maadi, a residential area on the outskirts of Cairo, where they were examined.
The hostages are &quot;healthy&quot; and the kidnappers &quot;were not paid a ransom,&quot; Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garanna said at the airport.
The hostages were captured on September 19 at the foot of Mount Ouanat in the border region of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, where they were taking part in an off-road safari. The group was then dragged from one hiding place to another by the 35 unknown hostage takers.
There were 11 tourists in the group (five Italian men, five German men and one Romanian woman), as well as eight Egyptians: two tour guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the Aegyptous travel agency that organized the safari.
According to an Egyptian security chief, a 30-member special commando arrived on the scene in two helicopters, where they raided the hostage-takers just before dawn.
&quot;A firefight broke out between the troops. Half of the kidnappers were killed, the rest fled,&quot; said the leader, who asked to remain anonymous.
He also said that a special squad of 150 people was sent from the Egyptian Lightning Brigade to Sudan, where they were supplemented by German and Italian commandos.
Italian diplomatic chief Franco Frattini, currently in Belgrade, emphasized the role of secret agents and Italian special action groups.
&quot;We have to admit that we could not have achieved this result without the professional and effective intervention of our secret service people and action teams,&quot; he said, without giving further details.
He also denied that ransom was paid for the hostages.
The previous day, the Sudanese army announced that they had intercepted an SUV in which the kidnappers were traveling while on patrol. Six of them were killed (including the Chadian leader) and two were arrested.
According to the army, the hostage-takers were connected to a rebel organization in Darfur, the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLA-U), which the organization immediately denied.
Lettres - The &quot;silent majority&quot; of culture
The debate about the funding of culture is currently at the center of the news and the current election campaign.
We can only be happy about that.
But a part of our cultural life is still being forgotten.
Who will speak up to highlight the ridiculous sums of money that small museums, archives, archeological digs and national historic sites on the brink of starvation are earning?
What politician dares to remind the federal government that it does not care about its monuments and heritage buildings?
Or that there are no laws in Quebec or Canada that really ensure the effective protection of our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government spent three and a half million euros on the restoration of Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley alone?
And the Constitution of our American neighbors states that the protection of cultural heritage is part of American culture, and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all elected representatives and all government agencies in a coordinated manner.
Within the framework of the Federation of Historical Societies of Québec (Fédération des sociétés d&#39;histoire du Québec), more than 40,000 volunteers from 211 societies dealing with history, cultural heritage, archives and genealogy work to research history and preserve a large number of private archives and archaeological finds on a minimal budget.
Often these organizations defend our heritage tooth and nail and protest with the last of their suffocating strength when real estate developers and policy makers point their bulldozers at our old buildings and forgotten cemeteries.
When will someone stand up for the protection of historical and cultural heritage?
Blood is safe again
Héma-Québec celebrated its tenth anniversary yesterday. President Dr. Francine Décary had good reason to celebrate because Héma-Québec has now become one of the safest and most efficient blood donation societies in the world.
And most importantly, he succeeded in regaining people&#39;s trust, which was severely shaken by the tainted blood scandals of the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, the national blood reserve managed by the Canadian Red Cross blood supply service was infected with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV) and hepatitis C viruses in the 1980s.
Following the drama and general uproar, the Government of Canada launched an official investigation in February 1994, led by Judge Horace Krever. The purpose of this was to shed light on the circumstances that led to the tragedy and to make recommendations to avoid similar cases in the future.
While Judge Krever delayed submitting his report, some provinces formed their own commissions to design a new blood system for Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau committee performed this task.
Following the Gélineau and Krever reports, two blood services were created in Canada: Héma-Québec, which serves Quebec, and the Canadian Blood Society, which is responsible for all other provinces and the two territories.
&quot;When Héma-Québec began operations in 1998, only 38% of people had confidence in Québec&#39;s blood supply system,&quot; recalls Dr. Décary.
The situation was desperate.
&quot;In the following years, however, as a result of improving the safety of blood products and our work in the field, we managed to regain people&#39;s trust.&quot; Décary proudly states that at the beginning of 2008, almost 94% of the Quebec population already considered Héma-Québec reliable.
However, Dr. Décary does not forget that &quot;trust is an extremely fragile thing&quot;.
Since its foundation on September 28, 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the principle of prudence.
During this period, a number of cases were discovered in Europe in which mad cow disease, i.e. the new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, also infected people - says the doctor, who has managed the company since its foundation in 1998.
&quot;We had no idea if this disease was spread through blood.
Therefore, we relied on one of the most important recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports. According to this, if we are uncertain about this and there is a risk of developing a serious disease, then we must apply exclusionary measures. In this case, it was Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which causes changes in the brain and thus inevitably leads to death.
Therefore, in April 1999 we did not accept blood from people who had spent more than one month in the UK since 1980.
And a few years ago, it was established beyond any doubt that the disease is also spread through blood.
This case convinced us that it made sense to apply the precautionary principle.&quot;
In 1999, a technique appeared on the market that enables a much more sensitive diagnosis of the HIV virus. This is the nucleic acid test (NAT), which can directly detect the virus itself in the blood of blood donors, rather than the antibodies formed against the virus, on which the previously used tests were based.
With the help of the NAT test, we were able to shorten the window period, which lasts from the time of infection until we can detect the virus in the blood with the help of our technical devices - explains the specialist.
They were able to reduce this period to less than a week.
In this way, the risk of blood donors unknowingly contaminating the blood pool was significantly reduced, as well as that this could not be detected.
These developments greatly reduced the risk of AIDS being transmitted through blood transfusions.
Today, the risk of someone receiving HIV-infected blood is 12 million to one.
&quot;In other words, this means that we would have to distribute 12 million blood products until someone is infected with the HIV virus.
Since Héma-Québec distributes 400,000 to 500,000 blood products every year, it would take more than 24 years for such a case to occur and for someone to become infected with the HIV virus through a blood product.
I think that today anyone can safely accept or prescribe a blood transfusion in order to restore health - claims the number one leader of Héma-Québec.
&quot;The challenge of the coming decade will be to maintain the reliability of our products.
We never know what new pathogens will enter the system.
After all, it was only last year that the chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, enters the blood through an insect bite.
That&#39;s why we have to be constantly alert,&quot; Dr. Décary continued, then emphasized that Héma-Québec must ensure sufficient permanent reserves in addition to emergency reserves.
&quot;As the population ages, so do the demands.
As cancer treatments have become more aggressive, patients often need replacements of red blood cells or platelets.
The aging of the population also affects the pool of blood donors, since the number of people in the network who are eligible to donate blood is only 3% of the Quebec population.
However, any healthy person at least 18 years of age who meets the eligibility criteria can donate blood every 56 days, i.e. six times a year.
Blood is not accepted from an average of 14% of applicants because, for example, they are infected with AIDS or malaria. Those who have visited a country where malaria is ravaging are not eligible to donate blood for one year.
&quot;With this 3 percent, we have enough reserves to meet the needs of hospitals.
It is very rare that we run out of stock.
On the other hand, we need to increase the number of blood donors to the extent that the existing ones get older, because after a while they can no longer donate blood.
But it is very difficult to convince people to donate blood, and it is even more difficult to keep them and make them become regular blood donors.
In today&#39;s fast-paced world, people hardly have a single hour to go and donate blood,&quot; laments Francine Décary.
Operating on an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec provides not only blood products but also human tissue, such as bone grafts, heart valves, eyeball tissue and skin tissue, which is used almost exclusively for severely burned people.
These tissues are analyzed, transformed and frozen, then deposited at Héma-Québec, which also manages Québec&#39;s only public stem cell bank.
Blood that is rich in stem cells can be obtained from the umbilical cord, which was previously only treated as medical waste, and thus enables the treatment of serious diseases (e.g. leukemia).
&quot;A few weeks ago, we celebrated the fact that the thousandth sample of umbilical cord blood entered our bank, and we plan to collect more than a thousand new samples every year.
At the beginning of next year, we will probably start offering these for organ transplants,&quot; clarified Dr. Décary, who says that the umbilical cord blood collection program is very popular these days.
&quot;Many mothers are sad that they don&#39;t have the opportunity to do this&quot; - this is indeed the case, since Héma-Québec is unable to make this complex and expensive program available in every hospital in Québec.
Soccer - Impact in the semi-finals
The Montreal Impact defeated the Seattle Sounders 3-1 yesterday in the USL-1 qualifiers to advance to the semi-finals with a 4-3 aggregate score. It was the second and decisive match of the quarter-finals, which took place at the Saputo Stadium.
The decisive goal was scored by midfielder Antonio Ribeiro in the 90th minute of the match.
While the first half passed without a goal, in the second the two midfielders of the Montreal team, David Testo and Rocco Plancentino, also found the back of the opponent&#39;s net.
Only Roger Levesque from the Sounders managed to outplay goalkeeper Matt Jordan.
Recall that in their first match on Friday, the Impact suffered a 2-1 loss at the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, a suburb of Seattle.
The Impact will play the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semifinals.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, the Thunder team, which lost to the Whitecaps 3:1 in the first game, won 4:3, but the Whitecaps still made it to the semifinals with a 5:4 aggregate score.
The Impact are expected to face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but match details will be finalized later today.
In a nutshell - Kovalev&#39;s winning goal
The favorite triad of the Canadiens is prepared and waiting for the new season.
The trio of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn led a great offense and the Canadiens ended up beating the Florida Panthers 3-2 in penalty kicks last night at the Center Bell.
Kostitsyn, the number one star of the meeting, scored a goal. Plekanec finished the game with two assists and Kovalev with an assist, which was the team&#39;s fourth win in six preseason games.
The match was decided by Kovalev, who scored the only goal of the shootout.
&quot;I&#39;m not ready yet,&quot; warns the Russian player.
&quot;I need one more game to really feel in shape.&quot;
&quot;He tried too much in the first period,&quot; noted Guy Carbonneau.
&quot;But I think he was happy with the end result of the match.
He got a huge ovation.&quot;
Charest&#39;s Northern Aspirations
The Prime Minister does not rule out that the election will start this year
As soon as the meeting of the Liberal Party ended, Jean Charest already traveled to Jean-Talon, Quebec yesterday, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), is aiming for victory in today&#39;s by-election.
&quot;To push back our last great northern border&quot;: this is the ambitious long-term goal formulated by Jean Charest at yesterday&#39;s meeting of the Quebec Liberal Party in Lévis. The speech was also enriched with visual elements, but at the same time the president tried to concentrate on the essence.
During his performance, sequences similar to &quot;Moulin à images&quot; were projected behind him.
On the three giant projectors, impressive images followed each other: hydroelectric dams, mining, Québec on &quot;Google Maps&quot;, maps...
Such spectacular devices are used during election periods.
At the press conference, however, the prime minister refused to guarantee that the election would not start this fall, although he added that his schedule was very tight.
The &quot;northern plan&quot; is the fourth pillar of the prime minister&#39;s &quot;vision&quot; for the future of Quebec, which is embodied in a &quot;new economic area&quot;. This includes a labor agreement with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe, and several planned agreements with Ontario.
Recently, the opening to the North (ie the northern area starting at the 49th latitude) has often been mentioned in the prime minister&#39;s speeches, but he has never given a lecture on this topic.
However, the head of state limited himself to explaining why he considers the North to be &quot;a treasure trove full of enormous possibilities&quot;. However, he did not talk about the time factor, investment amounts, or a specific order of importance regarding future projects.
He highlighted only a few development opportunities: primarily hydropower plants, forestry and especially mining, which is further stimulated by the growth of countries that are catching up and the reconstruction of state infrastructures.
Charest listed &quot;nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds&quot; in the north.
This territory, which is &quot;twice the size of France,&quot; is &quot;our territory, the territory of Québec.
It is not only with us, but in us,&quot; repeated the head of state, emphasizing that he intends to create a national founding myth.
He emphasized that the development of Quebec was largely determined by the connection with the North: the gold rush in Abitibi, planning work in Quebec, James Bay...
&quot;This is ours, our future!&quot; - he added, after taking a dramatic pause to examine the giant map behind him.
The North, which covers 70% of Quebec&#39;s territory, also includes a part of Labrador, which Quebec has always claimed for itself, the Prime Minister announced at the press conference.
&quot;This is our historic position, which has been confirmed by all governments.
There is a border line, regarding which there has been no agreement for a long time, and if the opportunity arises, I will reaffirm the same position on behalf of the government,&quot; he stated.
On the other hand, &quot;even in the light of climate change, we have to rethink our point of view regarding the North,&quot; said the prime minister, speaking of the northwestern passage that opens every year as a result of the melting of the polar ice.
In the Prime Minister&#39;s opinion, in this new geopolitical environment, occupying the territory is an important task.
And what about the natives of the area, the Indians and the Eskimos?
The prime minister stated that the government of Quebec pays special attention to them, and that they will benefit a lot from the plan, especially young people.
The two ministers belonging to different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (the latter was the Parti Québécois delegate in Ungava), have already started consultations with around thirty local communities.
The inter-ministerial committee led by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Minister responsible for transport and natural resources) also plays an important role, also started its operation.
The Prime Minister does not rule out the possibility of a large-scale meeting, &quot;not necessarily a summit&quot;, where &quot;a common vision is created&quot;.
Otherwise, the development of the North would take place in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The Northern Plan will be coordinated, systematized and environmentally friendly at the same time,&quot; the prime minister promised.
Jean Charest described this &quot;vision&quot; as being in line with the visions of previous Liberal prime ministers.
&quot;Just like the liberals before us, we think differently: our goal is to create new opportunities for growth and development out of challenges.&quot;
Incidentally, this was one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a large cocktail party celebrating the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage&#39;s election as party president.
One of the adopted resolutions proposes that the Beauharnois power station be renamed the Adélard-Godbout dam.
&quot;Politicians of our party, including Godbout, who founded Hydro-Québec, Lesage, who implemented the quiet revolution and the national spread of hydroelectric power plants, or Bourassa, known as the father of James Bay, all knew how to forge the future,&quot; declared Jean Charest.
At the press conference, he cited another - admittedly conservative - work, namely the &quot;Roads to the North&quot; program of John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister between 1957 and 1963.
Regarding the plan for the dam of the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric power plant, President Charest emphasized that the commissioning is planned for 2012.
&quot;Let&#39;s keep this between us, but I plan to be there,&quot; he told his followers, and his statement was met with loud applause.
Indeed, the prime minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008 and probably in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of a vote to be held this autumn, which the law also allows him to do.
However, he emphasized that his calendar is already full, as he has undertaken tasks at the meeting of the federal council in China and the Quebec-New York summit.
The party meeting at the end of the week proved to be an excellent platform for the Liberal president to expound on the nationalist resolutions, which were approved almost without a second thought. Here it is mainly about &quot;constitutional aspirations&quot;: the Liberal Party especially demands the recognition of &quot;Québec&#39;s special character&quot; in the Constitution.
They also want Quebec to be able to appoint members of the Canadian Radio and Telecommunications Council, and for those members to have veto power over decisions made in Quebec.
The opposition, on the other hand, received the main points of the Northern Plan with skepticism.
The leader of the Parti Québécois, Paulina Marois, re-introduced the Northern Quebec development policy introduced by the Landry government in 2001.
According to Marois, the Liberal government that came to power in 2003 refused to apply this policy.
If they hadn&#39;t done it, &quot;we would be much ahead today&quot;, said Mrs. Marois, in agreement with Françoise Mercure, whom she launched as a candidate in today&#39;s Jean-Talon vote.
The ADQ opposition party supports the government&#39;s acceptance of the Northern Plan.
&quot;However, we would like this to be more than just a show,&quot; said party leader Sébastien Proulx, who replaced Mario Dumont, who returned from his vacation today.
Letters - A disgraced country
Vic Toews, a Harper cabinet minister (minister of &quot;justice&quot; by the way) had the nerve last summer to call Louise Arbour a &quot;disgrace&quot; to Canada.
To slander a woman like this, who fought for the truth incessantly and deserves all our admiration, says a lot about the people surrounding the Prime Minister and about Stephen Harper himself.
This is our government, which is the only one of the affected Western countries that did not transport its own citizens home from the Guantanamo concentration camp.
This is the government that completely ignores the fact that Omar Khadr was a teenager at the time of the crimes he was accused of committing.
This is the only government that, despite Canada being a signatory to the Geneva Convention, has reneged on its word and is allowing a child soldier to languish in inhumane conditions.
The only government that makes a puppet theater out of justice while investigating the guilt of a defendant.
Let&#39;s just remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association are demanding Omar Khadr&#39;s repatriation so that he can receive a fair trial in Canada.
And our government turns a blind eye to torture: it does not care that a young adult has already been completely destroyed mentally, and that many years of torture have probably sealed his fate for life.
Although we are not yet aware of this, our rights, freedom and democracy are being insidiously destroyed. &quot;Democracy&quot;: Harper keeps repeating this word, which comes out of his mouth as nothing more than empty words.
So the time has come when morality no longer exists: they can arbitrarily beat, torture and imprison any Canadian citizen at the whim of the head of a government that has so far been in the minority (and what can come after October 14th...?).
Many voters believe that salvation can be found in a party that glorifies Virtue, Law and Order. They do not see that this government is trampling on the values to which our country owes its good reputation and dignity.
Dear Mr. Toews, the shame is more like this - look no further.
Review - Barrick Gold&#39;s Orwellian Oratory
In the September 17 issue of Le Devoir, a letter from Patrick J. Garver, deputy president and general manager of the Barrick Gold mine in Canada, appeared.
Following his Orwellian exposition, Garver states that the world&#39;s largest gold mining company filed a $6 million libel suit against three authors and a small-money publishing company in order to initiate what he calls a &quot;public debate.&quot;
Although the judges are independent and impartial, their decision - especially in defamation cases - is not based on the truth, but on the basis of the law.
Not surprisingly, Garver was deeply silent about this fundamental difference.
Would the best way for Barrick Gold to engage in public debate really be to destroy anyone whose viewpoints conflict with theirs?
Regardless of the outcome of the lawsuit, the authors and publisher of Noir Canada will have to spend significant sums to defend and fight an unequal battle, where on the other side is an army of lawyers supported by the almost inexhaustible resources of the mining industry.
In such an unequal struggle, they often use the tactic of destroying the defendant and reaching an amicable agreement, which not only silences those who disagree, but also intimidates those who would try to address the issue again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it should have expressed its views in public.
While this is done differently in many of the other countries where Barrick Gold operates, in Canada, disputants generally speak their minds rather than hitting each other with sticks.
Therefore, it would have been enough for the mine to open its books and files and prepare for a real debate in the press, media, and publications, paying for independent research groups that could shed light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold doesn&#39;t seem to trust public opinion, sweeping aside petitions and letters in defense of Noir Canada&#39;s authors in one fell swoop.
Could Mr. Garver explain how he can initiate a &quot;public&quot; debate while at the same time disregarding the opinions of that public?
In the Deputy President&#39;s mind, this word probably only means the handsomely paid lawyers, and not the entire population of Canada: the meaning of the term thus narrows considerably.
In a democratic state, even those who denigrate others are entitled to freedom of speech.
Barrick Gold, on the other hand, does not understand - or does not want to understand - that the authors and publishers of Noir Canada are mainly supported by the public because it condemns the harsh methods of the mine.
The public is ready to listen to Barrick and form a judgment, but it would do so based on civilized reasoning, not through a lawsuit aimed more at silencing many. (Regarding the term &quot;public debate&quot;, by the way, Barrick Gold recently wrote to the authors of Noir Canada to refrain from using this term.)
Beyond Garver&#39;s surreal revelations, Barrick Gold&#39;s proceedings are an open attack on the freedom of university research and the pursuit of truth, which are the building blocks of any democratic society.
The procedure as a whole denies the right to cite authentic sources, something to debate about the facts and their interpretation, which form the basis of intellectual activities.
If a country like Canada can only study and discuss topics that don&#39;t please the wealthy corporations of today&#39;s world under the burden of litigation, who will have the courage to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted an open and transparent discussion, it could do so according to the scientific standards that the authors of Noir Canada employ.
You have the right to reply.
In our university circle, we have been able to handle disputes, differences of opinion and conflicts for a long time.
Barrick Gold&#39;s ill-considered course of action clearly shows that, contrary to its claim, it has no desire to engage in an open debate.
This is a loss for both the world of academia and the Canadian institution of public debate. It is time for governments to finally introduce measures to limit legal proceedings for such abuse.
Wall Street bailout - Democrats and Republicans agree
The Bush administration and the Republican and Democratic leaders of Congress finally reached an agreement yesterday on the economic rescue operation, the largest such plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The $700 billion plan, which aims to curb the financial crisis that has raged on Wall Street for months, still needs to be approved by both houses of Congress.
The essential points of the plan: more effective control of the implementation by the representatives; new mechanisms ensuring repayment of allocated public funds; new provisions to keep the number of houses seized for non-payment at the same level; right of access to the salaries of the managers of the aided companies.
US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, Speaker of the US House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi and Republican Representative Judd Gregg announced the good news yesterday, a few minutes before midnight, after the two-day marathon hearing ended.
&quot;We have made great progress toward a solution that will work effectively in the markets,&quot; Bush administration spokesman Henry Paulson said.
&quot;We did everything with the aim of saving the real economy and American citizens from the current crisis affecting Wall Street,&quot; the Democratic representative explained.
&quot;The bottom line is that if we don&#39;t do this, there will be tremendous shock, chaos and confusion in the daily lives of Americans,&quot; said Rep. Judd Gregg, Republican.
Negotiations were sped up in the last few hours amid fears that another setback would hurt investor sentiment.
They gave themselves a deadline for the agreement until the opening of the stock market this morning.
The two presidential candidates who joined the negotiations late showed themselves willing to reach an agreement, however, they expressed that they were not happy that the situation had escalated to the limit.
Senator Barack Obama, a Democrat, took credit for expanding the deal to include provisions such as home ownership preservation or the pay of executives at state-backed companies.
&quot;When we&#39;re asking taxpayers to take some extraordinary measures because of other people&#39;s irresponsibility, that&#39;s not a very welcome thing.
However, these steps are necessary,&quot; he said in an American television program.
And when his opponent, John McCain, was asked by another channel whether he would vote for the proposed plan, he replied: &quot;I would like to know the details, but I hope so.&quot;
&quot;From what I have broadly read, it is already clear that it is something that we all have to digest and through which we can move on.
The option of doing nothing is simply unacceptable,&quot; he said.
According to the 700 billion dollar plan, taxpayers&#39; money would be used to buy the dubious claims of American financial institutions and their unsaleable assets exposed to some risk.
The plan was preceded by a 14-month crisis, which was triggered by the bursting of the real estate bubble. This first led to the collapse of risky real estate loans (subprime mortgages), then spread to other debt (commercial) securities, and finally caused the freezing of liquid resources and the turmoil of banks and financial institutions.
The first draft of the agreement was defeated by a group of Republican representatives last week.
We seem to have managed to get out of this impasse since the Democrats agreed that certain &quot;toxic&quot; assets of troubled companies should be secured by the government rather than bought.
To satisfy all members of Congress, the plan also included a provision that, if the government had to bear losses under the program for five years, it could levy new taxes to recoup its funds.
As part of the new plan, a $250 billion installment would be paid first; this can be followed by another 100 billion if the president deems it necessary.
The payment of the remaining $350 billion would have to be approved by Congress in another vote.
In exchange for the assistance, Washington acquires shares in the supported companies, through which it receives dividends from the profits, which it can sell after the crisis subsides.
The federal government will have the option of delaying the foreclosure of properties used to back the mortgages involved in the plan. In addition, it can set the maximum value of salary and severance pay that can be paid to the managers of companies affected by the crisis.
The drafters of the plan would like the plan to be voted on by the House of Representatives today, and by the Senate on Wednesday.
However, despite their efforts, the plan is still not certain to be approved.
Yesterday, statements against the plan were repeatedly made by both Republicans and Democrats.
&quot;It is abundantly clear that Washington is not hearing your voice,&quot; Republican Scott Garrett, who is a member of the House Finance Committee, told his constituents.
&quot;Yes, we have serious financial problems.
Yes, there are solutions.
But there is none that would benefit the taxpayers.&quot;
Brad Sherman, a Democrat who leads a small congressional group called the &quot;skeptic faction,&quot; presents things differently, but reaches the same conclusion.
&quot;Four hundred eminent economists, including three Nobel Prize-winning scientists, have written to us to ask Congress to take its time and carefully consider which path it is taking,&quot; Sherman said yesterday.
In Europe, at the same moment, they understood again that this was a global crisis.
After a crisis meeting, the three Benelux states announced that they would nationalize part of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion US dollars).
The intervention by the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg came after France&#39;s BNP Paribas said it would not buy its bankrupt rival after losing 2 million euros ($2.9 billion) in the US subprime crisis.
With 85,000 employees, Fortis is one of the twenty largest European banks and one of the ten largest insurance companies.
&quot;This is not wasted money,&quot; said Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos yesterday.
&quot;In return, we get voting rights and influence in the bank.
This is exactly the kind of thing that depositors and households are appreciating now that the situation promises to be uncertain.&quot;
Meanwhile, on the other side of the English Channel, the British government seems to be preparing to nationalize another bank that was swept away by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all of Bradford and Bringley&#39;s ongoing loans, of which real estate loans amount to 41 billion pounds (75.5 billion US dollars).
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that they will acquire the subsidiaries and customer base of the British bank.
After Northern Rock, Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank that the British government wants to nationalize since the beginning of the crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Farewell to the acting idol
Her beautiful azure eyes were considered by some to be her greatest trump card, and to others her greatest weakness.
Has the American actor with the charming smile ever gotten rid of his narcissistic mirror?
Yes and no.
Due to his shyness, sensitivity and innate talent, he was also far from the flamboyant style that is the essence of the real great monsters of the art world.
But what a great course he ran!
Paul Newman died of lung cancer at the age of 83 on Friday at his estate in Connecticut. He was one of the last icons of the heyday of American cinema.
He was less of a monumental individual than Brando, whom he resembled and who was for a long time his rival on the screen. In his roles, he was more restrained and undoubtedly more vulnerable, but he also advocated freedom and the destruction of dramatic conventions.
The mixing of bloods often results in extraordinary children.
Newman was born in Ohio in 1925 to a German Jewish father and a Hungarian mother.
European roots contributed to the birth of one of the symbolic figures of the American dream.
He didn&#39;t think too much of himself, which only added to his merits.
After all, a country fond of the ideal image of the &quot;self-made man&quot; and the ideal of the warrior broken in the Pacific War was embodied in him. In the early 1950s, he studied at Yale University&#39;s drama department and then at the Actor&#39;s Studio in New York, before bursting into the world of theater, television, and soon after, cinema.
In addition to being a champion of civil rights, as a racing driver he finished second in the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1979. In addition, he was considered a sex symbol, although he had been happily married to actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
Now we will never know what dark sides were in the life of this mysterious, aloof actor, dedicated to his work, who hated the glamor of show business. This will remain a mystery forever.
He was an honest man, in the noblest sense of the word.
Paul Newman&#39;s death at the end of the week shocked cinema fans: we can only see him in his big roles on the black screen of memories.
Reviewing his oeuvre, the seventh American art, cinema&#39;s more than fifty years of continuous changes, spins before us.
In our memory, the charming cowboy of &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&quot; (1969) is mixed with the young man estranged from his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor), whose role we saw in the Tennessee Williams adaptation of &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot; in 1958.
From recent times (1990), we can remember him in the image of the sensitive Mr. Bridge, who in his old age is faced with the fact that his marriage has not fulfilled his hopes.
In addition, we saw many other faces of Paul Newman in his films.
In Robert Wise&#39;s film &quot;Someone Up There&quot;, he gave an unforgettable performance as Rocky Graziano, a boxer with a turbulent life. This role, originally intended for James Dean - and taken over after his death - launched Newman&#39;s acting career in 1956.
He also played a likable criminal in the brilliant work &quot;The Big Bad&quot;, which won the Oscar for best film in 1973.
He played an embittered, vengeful pool player in Robert Rossen&#39;s brilliant film The Swindler (1961) and returned in a similar role in Martin Scorsese&#39;s The Color of Money. In 1987, he received his only Oscar award out of nine nominations for his portrayal of the latter.
Times change, but the face is always the same: it was him.
It&#39;s always been like that.
The period of his career was marked by the change of eras.
Younger people mainly know him from George Roy Hill&#39;s cult film &quot;Icebreakers&quot; (1977), where he plays Reggie Dunlop, a coach of an ice hockey team who works with unconventional methods.
His fans saw him in &quot;The Big Leap&quot; written by the Coen brothers in 1994.
The line ended with Sam Mendes&#39;s film &quot;The Road of Damnation&quot; in 2003: in this he last appeared in the role of an Irish mob boss.
Unlike many movie legends who left the screen relatively quickly, Newman remained in the spotlight for a long time, although he condemned Hollywood with its glitz, luxury and hypocrisy.
The French film director Bertrand Tavernier considered it, not without humor, as &quot;a living refutation of underplaying&quot;: in his opinion, his acting was too powerful.
However, the profession was not always kind to the handsome Paul Newman, who for a long time had film roles just falling into his lap.
However, he rarely played young and successful characters: rather, he played characters living on the fringes of society - mentally ill, alcoholic, malicious or hopeless - whose drift and rebellion he was able to reproduce with perfect authenticity.
As a director, Newman showed a lesser-known face: deep down, he is a truly shy and sensitive man.
In the 1968 film &quot;Rachel, Rachel&quot; (an adaptation of the novel by the Canadian writer Margaret Laurence) with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, he painted a delicate portrait of a melancholic woman.
And with the 1984 film &quot;Harry and his son&quot;, radiating restraint and sadness, he commemorates his son Scott, who died of a drug overdose.
Yesterday, countless admirers of Newman remembered the actor. His close friend and old comrade, Robert Redford (with whom he starred in &quot;The Big Bad&quot; and &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&quot;), overcome with grief, said: &quot;His presence made my life and the world better.
Generosity and the joy of being: this was the secret of the vibrant personality of this great actor, whom we have now lost.
Overshadowed by his legendary career is his fight for civil rights, the environment, independent film production, and his comments criticizing the excesses of Hollywood.
We have often seen his image smiling on the packaging of sauces, sauces, biscuits and other foods. He did it in rather bad taste, although he thought it was funny at the beginning.
However, the proceeds from such sales were always transferred to his foundation for children suffering from the disease.
Newman never sat on his laurels: he remained committed to the profession throughout.
In a letter to his five daughters, he wrote the following sentences: &quot;Your father was always and always unimaginably grateful for his lucky star.
It was a privilege for me to be here.&quot;
It is also a privilege for us to have been able to follow the career of such a brilliant and generous American artist.
He was a model citizen, above all.
What was produced in the invoice factory of Zuschlag &amp; Tsai?
Soon, on October 8, the trial of the criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and his associates will begin.
The politician and his associates are accused of fraud and other crimes, including forgery of documents, which caused particularly significant damage and were committed continuously and commercially in a criminal organization.
According to the prosecutor&#39;s office, the awarded tender funds were used for their own purposes, and the fulfillment of tasks was often verified with false invoices.
The state and municipal funds - a total of about HUF 65 million - went partly into the coffers of the Young Left and partly into the pockets of certain individuals.
The method also described by the investigative authority was that the winning tender funds were taken on the basis of expense accounts that had no actual performance behind them, and the associations never fulfilled their obligations.
According to the indictment, most of the invoices were fake.
The bill blocks for these were acquired at the Józsefváros market, and the circular stamps were produced in Kiskunhalas.
And the name of which companies the invoices should be produced was decided, among other things, on the Balaton-Upland tour on which János Zuschlag sent István Lados.
According to the latter&#39;s testimony, he had to check out boarding houses and restaurants.
He asked for an invoice for his consumption there, based on which the invoices to be submitted to the tenders of, among others, the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor, and the Metropolitan Municipality were prepared.
Most of these were recorded by István Lados with his partner, András Őri, who, according to our information, mostly wrote the reports necessary to obtain the subsidies.
One of the highlights of Lados&#39; &quot;study tour&quot; was a beer house.
According to two invoices issued by the Zuschlags, dated 2003, the restaurant provided meals for a group of ninety people from the Biztos Point Association.
However, according to the company manager, this many people would not have fit into the restaurant at the same time.
In the same way, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 to the Foundation for a Better Future - later named Együtt a Third Éezredért - was full of errors in form and content.
A boarding house in Badacsonytomaj only had three rooms, no more than ten people could sleep in it one night, yet the bill was for one hundred and thirty guests.
But the imaginative form-fillers also went too far when they flagged Pigal Kft., also engaged in hospitality, whose accounting - according to the information provided to the prosecutor&#39;s office - did not even include documents in the name of Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá.
The head of the company, Győző Farkas, told hvg.hu that when he was called to the prosecutor&#39;s office and was shown the invoices, he immediately knew that they were fake documents.
&quot;The name of our business and our tax number were in the wrong place on the stamp.&quot;
He added: in addition to formal reasons, the fact that according to the bill they accommodated a hundred people was also inappropriate, because they have a total of eleven rooms, which do not have that many beds.
In addition, the bill was for catering, while their restaurant has been out of business for a long time.
The zealous invoice makers did not even investigate the fact that the Budapest travel agency they were looking for only organizes foreign trips, so they fraudulently marked Hungarian travel as a service on the cash payment invoice, which also did not match the company&#39;s invoicing practice.
In addition, as it turned out during the investigation, VAT was included on the document, even though the travel activity to countries outside the European Union was VAT-free.
Among other things, the amount of VAT was wrong on the four documents issued by Hotel Révfülöp Kft. to Jobb Jövőért, because the company&#39;s services are charged not at the specified 25 but at 15 percent VAT, in addition, the hotel&#39;s employees only issued a machine invoice, whereas the manufactured invoice it was manual.
In addition, the &quot;exhibitors&quot; also messed up the account by indicating that in the case of one company road freight transport was a performed activity - it was revealed through the prosecution procedure - that the company, which was originally based on investment advice, did not carry out.
In addition, due to formal discrepancies - incorrect invoice format, not a real stamp - it was revealed that the Együtt a Third Éezredért Foundation, the XXI. The invoices for Századi Cultural Association and Biztos Pont are fake.
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. or Kunfehértó Sport Camp, whose representatives denied that they had issued the invoices.
For example, the forgers did not pay attention to the fact that HIB Kft. in Nyíregyháza was under liquidation at the time (2001) when the group of the Young City Association had a meal there, which is why the company&#39;s liquidation commissioner - as far as we know - denied that he had issued it the paper.
It was deliberately put out
Another group of invoice issuers consists of those who were aware that they had to issue a fictitious invoice.
At the request of the Young Left - Young Socialists, the Esély Budapestért Foundation issued an invoice for the Együtt a Harmadik Émezredért Foundation, for about four million forints.
According to the indictment, the manager of Collab Kft. was persuaded by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, to issue the fictitious invoice.
Biogate Kft., which is currently in liquidation, also cooperated with the Zuschlags, which in 2003 supplied the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, the Atlasz Egyesület and the Vöröfenyő Egyesület with invoices for a value of roughly HUF five million, which were not backed by real economic activity.
No cash movement either, because the completed invoices were reversed afterwards, but the organizations forgot to include this in their documents.
The next group of invoice-issuing companies includes those that can be linked to the defendants.
Thus, Iván Kubatov was the delivery representative of the Ukrainian managing director of Delta Trió Kft., which deals in fuel and motor vehicles and is based in Budapest, although it is not located there.
The company issued several invoices in October, November and December 2005 for the sale of computer equipment, worth approximately HUF 18 million.
According to the investigation data, these accounts were purchased by Kiskunhalas Cash Investment Kft., which has been in liquidation since September 14, 2005.
The managing director of this company was a Romanian man, to whom Iván Kubatov would also have forwarded documents related to the company between 2002 and 2005.
We know that Kubatov admitted during the investigation that the company he issued an invoice in his name to Atlas, Hoppa and the Together for the Third Year Foundation, and he took their consideration.
At the express request of Iván Kubatov, Romanian masons founded Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
However, none of the companies actually operated, which, according to the accused, was because they did not get jobs.
The companies still benefited, because at the request of his co-accused, lawyer Zsolt Szente, who also prepared the company foundation papers, he issued invoices on behalf of the companies to the associations linked to Zuschlag: Atlas and Y-Generation.
On behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, Kubatov gave a total of 15 invoices to the organizations, worth HUF 14.2 million.
The prosecutor&#39;s office believed that 10 percent of the amounts indicated on the invoices and the VAT went to Kubatov.
The man even used Szi-Beri Bt. to issue fictitious invoices, which were produced for the Bizto Pont tender.
In January 2006, Generation Y and the Alliance for Modern Hungary submitted an application to the socialist party&#39;s public benefit organization, the Mihály Táncsics Foundation (TMA).
They won HUF 500,000 each, but the amounts were not used for the purposes specified in the tender.
To prevent this from being revealed, five fictitious invoices received from Works Team Kft. were submitted to the TMA.
Incidentally, these invoices were found during a search of Árpád Kemecsei&#39;s office at the Ministry of Education.
At the trial, some of the defendants, as they did at the prosecution, will probably report on the invoice production process.
It can be most interesting if the prime accused himself, János Zuschlag, decides to lift the veil on everything.
His testimony so far is not very detailed, and although he has repeatedly promised to speak comprehensively, he has not yet done so.
It is a question whether he is in this interest, after all, the socialists made a deal with him in exchange for compensating a large part of the damage, fifty million forints, and Zusi will take the trouble.
By the way, he might even have been offended by now, since his requests to ease the conditions of his detention, i.e. to place him under house arrest, have continuously fallen on deaf ears.
While the perpetrators of economic crimes that cause much greater damage and do not compensate for it can walk freely, or at least wait for the end of the proceedings against them in their own homes, he does not have the opportunity to do so.
The psychology of overbidding: why do we spend more money?
At auctions, buyers tend to spend more money and overvalue the goods.
The neurological and economic foundations of this well-known - and seemingly irrational - behavior were discovered by neurologists and economists at New York University.
According to their study published in the journal Science, people don&#39;t want to lose out in a type of competition like an eBay auction, so they&#39;d rather pay too high a price.
The research tried to map the neural scheme of this &quot;game&quot; with the help of experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers played the lottery, the other group participated in a playful auction, while the active brain areas of the experimental subjects were examined using the functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) method.
In both games, the participants could win money, but during the auction game - in which an important element is the outbidding of the other party - the subcortical complex called the striatum became active when the game was lost.
This brain area plays a role in the &quot;self-rewarding&quot; mechanism of the nervous system, among other functions.
Therefore, according to the researchers, beating the price can be explained by avoiding the intense reaction of the striatum.
To support their theory, the economist members of the research group also conducted a financial follow-up study.
In it, three groups bid against one partner under various conditions.
The control group was simply told what the real value of the product was and they placed their bets.
Another group was also promised that if they emerged victorious from the game, they would receive an additional $15 as a reward.
The third group, on the other hand, received 15 dollars just before the auction, but the members of the group lost this money as well in the event of a losing auction.
The only difference between the two groups was that one of them emphasized winning and the other emphasized losing.
However, proving the neurologists&#39; hypothesis, the members of the team playing &quot;against loss&quot; were willing to place higher stakes than the control and &quot;winning&quot; groups.
&quot;These results cannot be derived from any previously existing economic theory.
Until now, they have only explained the phenomena experienced at auctions with the joy of winning and risk avoidance.
Only neuroimaging methods have helped resolve the contradiction between these two theories, so that we have now arrived at a third explanation,&quot; said Andrew Schotter, professor of economics at New York University.
Hepatitis: when should we see a doctor?
About half a billion people in the world suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C infection, and chronic liver disease is mentioned among the leading causes of death in Hungary.
The number of people infected with hepatitis in Hungary can be as high as 100,000, but only 7,000 are treated, which is because the patients often do not know that they are infected.
The name hepatitis is a collective name for infectious liver damage caused by various viruses.
There are many similarities in their symptoms, hepatitis and jaundice are typical, but their pathogens and the diseases they cause are different.
Depending on the causative agent, hepatitis viruses are spread in two main ways: hepatitis A and E through the alimentary canal (e.g. through contaminated food and water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses through blood and body fluids (semen, vaginal discharge, saliva).
Travelers should definitely get vaccinated against viruses A and B, there is no vaccine against C.
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after consuming the infected food, generally accompanied by malaise, weakness, abdominal complaints, and nausea.
After this, the skin and the whites of the eyes develop yellowness, the stool becomes light, the urine becomes dark, and recovery may take two to three weeks.
Every year, one million people worldwide die from the more serious type of the disease, liver cancer and liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason for this is that, according to estimates, only every tenth infected person receives drug treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if left untreated, it can lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer.
Most infected people do not even know they have the disease, because the pathogen insidiously destroys the liver cells, and in many cases the first symptoms do not appear until 20-30 years later.
Therefore, early prevention and regular screening tests are very important.
Three groups have much more of this disease than average: among people who underwent a blood transfusion before 1991, among drug users and those with tattoos.
Currently, the number of people infected with the chronic hepatitis C virus in the world can be estimated at 200 million.
Since the disease can already be detected by a routine laboratory test, it is worth contacting your family doctor if you notice any symptoms of unknown origin.
If detected in time, the disease can be cured, the virus can be eradicated from the body, thus the infectiousness ceases and the development of cancer can be prevented.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, which was first organized in 2004 by patient organizations around the world.
Its purpose is to draw attention to chronic hepatitis caused by viruses, the causes of its development and the importance of early detection of the disease.
Benelux governments nationalize a part of Fortis bank
The Benelux countries are helping the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis, which was the first in Europe to get into trouble due to the spillover effect of the American credit market crisis, with partial nationalization: the three countries are supporting the financial and insurance institution, which also has interests in Hungary, with a total of 11.2 billion euros.
The Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments negotiated the matter at the highest level at the end of the week, including the president of the European Central Bank and the competition officer of the European Commission.
In the Eurozone, Fortis Bank&#39;s is the first major crisis within the framework of the international financial market crisis that has been raging in waves for more than a year, and the decisions made in the bank&#39;s case can therefore be classified as precedent-setting from a certain point of view.
According to the decision made on Sunday night, all three states will buy almost half (49 percent) of the bank&#39;s existing property there.
The bank will certainly sell some of its interests, including, above all, the - mainly insurance - activities it bought from the Dutch ABN Amró last year.
The shares of Fortis began to fall sharply last week, and in the second half of the week serious crisis phenomena were already visible at the institute.
However, analysts agree that the bank, with its 85,000 employees, is too big to be allowed to go bankrupt.
The company&#39;s shares fell by around 12 percent to a 14-year low on Friday alone.
Since January, the value of shares has fallen by more than two-thirds.
Looking at the current share prices, the group&#39;s total market capitalization is around 14 billion euros, but according to company managers, this is not realistic.
By the way, the company management blamed overseas market uncertainties related to the acceptance of the US$700 billion package plan for the drop in Fortis shares.
On Monday, the papers rose slightly.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed as the new CEO of the bank.
The financial institution was also looking for private buyers, but so far no one has come forward with a meaningful offer.
The Belgian government has already indicated that investors do not need to worry, they will not lose their money.
So far, there has been no panic among the bank&#39;s clients, and the branches have not been raided.
In Hungary, Fortis has an independent branch and has also acquired leasing companies.
Does it hurt less for those who believe in God?
According to the results of a recent research, religious faith acts as a kind of pain reliever, which may have made the death of Catholic martyrs easier.
Scientists from the University of Oxford conducted an interesting experiment, investigating how faith in God affects people&#39;s perception of pain, the British Telegraph reported.
In the framework of the rather bizarre investigation, 12 Catholic believers and the same number of atheists were given electric shocks while they were all studying a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to block out most of the pain.
Thanks to the technique of scanning the human brain, it was also revealed that the Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain that is responsible for the regulation of pain.
The investigation is the first in a research series in which, in addition to academics, scientists, philosophers and theologians from different parts of the university are also participating.
The test took place precisely by attaching a sparking device to the subject&#39;s left hand, which delivered the electric shock.
The researchers asked participants to look intensely at two paintings, Sassoferrato&#39;s 17th-century Virgin Mary and Leonardo da Vinci&#39;s 15th-century Lady with an Ermine.
The authors of the study hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary would induce a kind of religious state among believers, while the da Vinci image was chosen because it was not too different from the other and was thought to have a calming effect.
The subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner machine, during which time they received 20 electric shocks in four consecutive parts while looking at either the religious-themed or the general image.
The Catholics reported that when they saw the Virgin Mary, they felt &quot;safe&quot; as someone who was &quot;taken care of&quot; and &quot;calm down, filled with peace&quot;.
They reported 12 percent less pain while looking at the religious-themed picture than when they saw Leonardo&#39;s work in front of them.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who himself participated in the study, believes that a similar effect can be achieved with any powerful image, including atheists, you just need to find the right photo.
&quot;We should find an image that they feel very positive about, like a mother or a father.&quot; said the psychologist.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
&quot;Exercising faith should and in many cases does change our personality.&quot; Wright added.
After the excellent results, the only question is, if Leonardo or a painter of a similar caliber showed the faithful a picture of a Madonna, what effect would it have on their pain control?
Would the sight of a quality Virgin Mary mean even better results?
You are what you share about yourself
On its tenth birthday, Google can say: it can be found in people&#39;s pockets at least as much as it is in the sky above their heads; you know where they vacationed, what appointments they attend and what they are interested in.
And this is still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the main people of the company.
As for the skeptics who draw parallels with the Orwellian nightmare, they do not see the essence of Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google&#39;s main goal is to collect even more personal data about its users, which is necessary for them to be able to stick to the original goal of Google&#39;s founders, which was: &quot;to systematize the world all your information!&quot;.
According to the interviewed Google leader, even after ten years of world-shattering work, the company is still only at the beginning of being able to handle all the information.
When asked what will happen five years from now, Schmidt said he wants Google to be able to answer questions like &quot;what should I do tomorrow?&quot; or &quot;what job would really suit me?&quot; - however, until then, the software cannot answer such seemingly simple questions, because they do not know enough about the users.
Not all internet users are aware that search terms are recorded exactly during internet searches, from which IP address they were searched and to which page the interested party left after the search.
With Personalized Search, which was launched two years ago, users can, for example, store their own surfing background history, look back at what they searched for, what they clicked on, and through this it will generate much more personalized results for them in the long term - Recommendations will be based on the same logic, with which it recommends products and services for us, the system is based on our previously stated and recorded preferences.
What if they use my data against me if they see what I do for a living? - ask users who are worried about Google&#39;s data monopoly.
In most cases, the degree of potential power represented by the company can be frightening, not the guilt, the fear of punishment, the desire for freedom, but rather the rebellion against the power that causes the counter-reactions among Internet users.
However, it is a confirmed fact that all searched terms are not only recorded, but in justified cases they can also be transferred to third parties, in such legal cases nothing protects the privacy rights of Internet users.
The loudest example of this in recent times was perhaps the concerted action against Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google provided the Brazilian government with information about pedophiles that enabled identification from the social media site it maintains called Orkut.
On the other hand, Internet users concerned about privacy rights could breathe a sigh of relief in May, when the company, together with the electronic rights protection organization EFF, successfully proved its case against the FBI in court: according to them, Google cannot be forced by any point of the constitution to comply with the FBI&#39;s secret requests in the future. provide any information.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully seized about fifty thousand web addresses and a thousand search terms, obtained by citing the strengthening of child protection laws passed years earlier, but was still unable to obtain search lists of individual users, or a full two-month list of websites and keywords .)
Google&#39;s assessment is therefore quite contradictory: those who are afraid of giving out their personal data, because they feel that their intimate sphere and privacy are being violated by starting to use Google&#39;s services, are whipping it up with a rebellion that is typical of multi-companies with a conservative image.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its wild drive of enthusiastic computer fans, activists, and users appearing in many countries sees them as the next generation of large companies, the &quot;cool corporation&quot;, in contrast to its rival, Microsoft, which is billed as a world conqueror due to Windows, no matter how much both struggle. for the same purpose.
This may happen because, unlike Microsoft, Google does not ask its users for an identification code or charge money for its applications, the open, free, constantly updated source code and program package seems much more accessible, younger, and cooler than the official software giant&#39;s practice.
However, it may also be because geeks clearly see the very problematic relationship between privacy rights and the Internet, which has been brought about by one of the most frequently mentioned keywords of recent years, Web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is about nothing but collaboration, about intentionally leaving traces behind and making use of the communication channels available to us, and while the extent of these varies from individual to individual, the point is the same: we show ourselves.
An average young person can maintain a profile on several social media sites, from Facebook to Xanga, and connect them to other services, such as Twitter, or last.fm, which lists their music habits, and then connect them all to tracking systems such as FriendFeed or Blip. .fm, they can also run a blog, which automatically displays their latest photo galleries stored on Flickr or Picasa.
While we can read about many exemplary cases from which it is clear: the girlfriend can easily find out who her cheating boyfriend spent the evening with after seeing the morning photo stream of the common circle of friends, or she can fire a company employee just because he writes his honest opinion about the top management in his blog: a sure , the concept of privacy has been completely reevaluated by now.
Anyone who lives online is made up of what they show of themselves, and this is how we can formulate the basic premise behind the behavior of today&#39;s young people.
And anyone who wants to hide something, or at least wants to avoid the Google monopoly, can do so (starting, for example, with Scroogle, which uses Google&#39;s search system, but at the same time intentionally leaves no trace).
For example, the number of people who deliberately do not register on social networking sites so that they cannot be found is not small. Google&#39;s online applications, from the text editor to the image manager and news reader, can be replaced with alternative versions that are not connected to huge server parks and that do not make up of us the previously existing best profile.
The public is not so secretly waiting for Google to reveal its tooth protein.
At a current valuation of $156 billion, the company is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising platforms threaten the revenues of advertising agencies, the and services introduced at an ever-accelerating pace cause serious headaches not only for Microsoft, but also for many other software developers.
However, critical observers also find disturbing counterpoints to these: for example, the top management completely rejected the employees&#39; protest after doubling the company kindergarten fee, the company management found it too expensive to feed the employees as many times a day as they want, but all this is dwarfed by the fact , that Google bowed to the Chinese government back in 2006, and according to their agreement, the company filters out all results that violate good taste and the interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the internal rules of the company is that they do not announce a new service in advance, only when it can be used, but it is certain that the foreseeable problems of the coming months and years can move the world at another point: while some believe that Google its book and magazine scanning and archiving project has reached such a scale that the company will soon have to face the US Supreme Court, others are afraid of the Health system, because in it we can build a complete health profile about ourselves with our previous findings, doctors and problems.
And the fact that Google is building a genetic database can also provide good material for the next generation of science fiction writers, the popular Cory Doctorow short story, Scroogled, describes a future in which a person can only use Google data with Orwellian overtones is alarmingly approachable.
Two juveniles helped the Ózd double murderer in the search
The police interrogated two juveniles in the case of the double murder in Ózd, according to the well-founded suspicion that they assisted in removing traces of the crime, said the spokesperson of the Borsod county police headquarters on Tuesday.
The young people admitted to the crime they were charged with, and are currently accused of aiding and abetting.
The two juveniles - according to MTI&#39;s information, two girls - are defending themselves at large.
Aiding and abetting is punishable by up to 5 years in prison.
The suspect of the double murder in Ózd - a 23-year-old local man - was taken into custody on Sunday.
He is suspected of the premeditated murder of several people for profit.
During the investigation, it was revealed that the 23-year-old owed a larger amount to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect didn&#39;t want to settle his debt, so he tricked his creditor to a location in Ózd last week, where he killed him and the man&#39;s 9-year-old daughter as well.
According to MTI&#39;s information, the young man prepared in advance to commit the crime, a sign of this is the fact that he committed the murder with a weapon hidden on the spot.
The police are investigating the weapon and the circumstances of its use with the involvement of an expert.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange made an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw stock exchange offered two hundred million euros - about five billion Czech crowns - for the purchase of one hundred percent of the shares of the Prague stock exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer, which was made by the Poles despite the fact that the Czechs had previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from being a possible new owner of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for this is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in state control.
99 percent of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which intends to sell more than 60 percent of the papers within a few months.
The Czech business daily E15 has learned that the Poles&#39; offer represents the highest amount that interested parties have offered for the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to Czech newspapers, so far the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq transatlantic exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse have submitted offers.
Petr Koblic, the head of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner among those interested, and he did not rule out that this could lead to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague stock exchange at 5-10 billion crowns.
Based on the shareholders&#39; agreement, about 90 percent of the papers could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance with a 25 percent share, followed by Ceská Sporitelna bank with 14.7 percent and Tiger Holding Four S. arl with 13.5 percent.
On the financial crisis from the perspective of European newspapers
In their commentary on the deepening international financial crisis on Tuesday, the leading European newspapers are already referring to the &quot;second September 11&quot;.
The global financial disaster is to be blamed on the American president - accuses the Roman La Repubblica - the president was not even able to line up his own party behind the hastily put together bill, which aims to remedy the desperate situation...
Instead of another Pearl Harbor, mentioned by billionaire investor Warren Buffett, it is more appropriate to talk about a second 9/11.
A part of the Madrid press also sees the scapegoat in Washington.
In El Mundo&#39;s view, the lack of political leadership there has brought the world economy to the brink of collapse.
The danger of the collapse of the American financial system is increasing, and the whole world will suffer from it.
Although Bush&#39;s plan was not perfect, following the congressional vote, there is a danger that Washington will not offer a political tool to deal with the crisis.
The world economy is hanging in the air - just when one of the biggest transformations in the history of capitalism is taking place.
The threat can no longer be ignored, the Geneva Tages-Anzeiger points out.
Some states can still provide a lifeline to struggling financial institutions and save them from bankruptcy with taxpayers&#39; money.
But if even more banks collapse like dominoes, neither the funds nor more improvisations will be enough.
In the long term, it is necessary for the member states of the European Union to overcome their national selfishness and to centralize control over the fragmented financial markets.
On Monday alone, ailing financial institutions received more than 100 billion euros - reminds the Viennese Der Standard, according to which concerns are becoming more and more realistic that, like the Americans, European taxpayers will have to reach deep into their pockets to remedy the crisis.
So far, the EU has not seriously dealt with the crisis, which is sweeping across the old continent like a tsunami.
The &quot;rescuers&quot; do not have to immediately wave a hundred billion euros, but it would be good if they recorded: in which case it is reasonable to reach for taxpayers&#39; money in order to prevent greater damage.
The flight of the dongo is imitated by the intelligent car
What better way to develop collision avoidance technologies than to mimic obstacle sensors found in the natural world?
For example, bees.
In a surprising project presented at CEATEC in Japan, buzzing bees gave Nissan engineers the strategic starting point for how to build the next generation of collision avoidance systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan built the BR23C biomimetic car robot control system, a robotic minicar endowed with the characteristics of bees, with the ultimate goal of helping to develop a system that eliminates all collisions.
In flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space, which is actually very similar to our safety envelope, Kazuhhiro Doi, Technology PR and R&amp;D Brand Director, explained at the exhibition.
The role of the bee&#39;s compound eye, which can see in all directions at a viewing angle of more than 300 degrees, is important.
To copy the function of that compound eye, the engineers came up with the idea of a laser rangefinder.
This identifies obstacles within 2 meters in a 180-degree field of view in front of the BR23C, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which is immediately converted into an action to avoid a collision.
The obstacle is detected in a fraction of a second, and then the car robot, imitating the movements of the bee, immediately changes direction by turning its wheels to the extent necessary to avoid a collision.
Unlike any current system, this evasive maneuver is completely instinctive.
&quot;If this were not the case, the car-robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles,&quot; explains Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the car-robot project.
It must react instinctively and immediately, as this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and innermost layer of the safety envelope, a layer within which a collision is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process should mirror what a bee does to avoid other bees.
This process should take place in the blink of an eye.
But, unlike bees, the deviation cannot be directed upwards, downwards or diagonally, it can only be two-dimensional and only in the direction of turning the wheels.
In this way, instead of the endless possibilities available for the bees to avoid other bees, here only the rotating movement and acceleration and deceleration were used as the available options of the car robot.
The BR23C uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and have a higher energy density, which means they last longer than the lithium-ion version.
According to Andoh, it is the instinctive intelligent reaction that is important, not the ability to process, much less store, data.
This structure only needs to process and respond to a few incoming signals per second.
It doesn&#39;t need to store them and reacts with intuitive logic based on data from previous maneuvers, so it only uses a few dozen kilobytes of memory all the time.
You don&#39;t need gigabytes or even megabytes of memory.
It&#39;s the first step in the development of instant-avoidance technology, which Nissan estimates could be in production cars within ten years.
Another application possibility is the integration of the unit with the GPS satellite navigation system to guide the motorist to the specified final destination by avoiding obstacles on the road.
The expensive child also got a name
The written version of the 700 billion dollar economic rescue package law, which is applicable in several installments and aims to buy bad loans of banks, has been prepared.
In the first round, half of the amount is spent.
According to Reuters, during the new negotiations that lasted until after midnight on Saturday, the leaders of the Congress reached a compromise in the dispute over the rescue package totaling 700 billion dollars, which has been going on for days.
We have made serious progress - said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic President of the US House of Representatives, who said that all that remains is to put the agreement on paper.
The compromise reached on the package was supported by both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
Speaking about the outcome of the compromise, Finance Minister Henry Paulson stated: the program will work and be effective, but more needs to be done. According to Pelosi, this is not about saving Wall Street, but turning the economy around.
The written version of the package was made public before the opening of the Asian markets at 8:00 p.m. Washington time on Sunday (that is, 2:00 a.m. Monday, Central European time), but it did not cause a spectacular rise in the stock market.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will first vote on the draft law on the program, called the 2008 Economic Emergency Stabilization Act, and then it will be the turn of the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke with Pelosi on Saturday night, and news of the agreement was welcomed at the White House.
&quot;We are pleased with the progress made tonight and appreciate the bipartisan efforts to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy,&quot; White House spokesman Tony Fratto said.
By the way, the program differs from the original proposal of the Bush administration, which would have said that the 700 billion dollars would have been spent one at a time on the purchase of low-quality securities with a credit background.
Now, in the first round, no more than half of the 700 billion can be spent, so that 250 billion will be used immediately after the Congress is expected to vote on the matter on Monday, of which the Ministry of Finance will buy bad credit-backed securities, and the fate of another 100 billion dollars depends on the president&#39;s decision.
The program will be monitored by a special board, which will include the chairman of the Federal Reserve.
Spending the other half of the 700 billion depends on another decision by Congress.
Under the law, the Treasury can use a combination of tactics: it can simultaneously buy bad loans, mortgages and mortgage-backed securities, as well as other types of &quot;toxic&quot; loans.
The purchase can be made in the framework of auctions or directly, the officials of the ministry said.
The legislation allows the affected companies to participate in an insurance program where the Ministry of Finance guarantees the assets of concern, for which the companies will pay a premium corresponding to the expected damages.
Henry Paulson said: the law provides the necessary means so that up to 700 billion dollars can reach the urgent needs of the American financial system, whether it is the widespread purchase of bad assets, their insurance, or the avoidance of systemic risk associated with the collapse of a large financial institution.
We will take the necessary steps to be ready to introduce the law as soon as it is signed, he added.
On the other hand, the heads of banks that are in trouble and awaiting state aid can count on the government to limit their withdrawal money - which is simply called a golden parachute in overseas slang.
Payments are limited only in certain cases, and the limits depend on the way in which the Ministry of Finance provides assistance.
The restriction essentially means that if the ministry buys through an auction, an additional tax will be levied on the golden parachute, unless the defunct bank manager is retired.
When outright buying bad loans, the government will step in aggressively to ensure that executive funds are not overstated.
Adding to the picture is that existing golden parachute contracts will not change, the restriction will only apply to new ones to still encourage participation in the program.
This is the first case in American history that there will be a legal restriction on the remuneration of CEOs - commented the chairman of the committee responsible for financial services of the House of Representatives, Democrat Barney Frank.
In addition, the state acquires the right to acquire a stake in the banks participating in the program, so the risk for taxpayers is reduced, since they can ultimately win on the deal, as soon as the economy and the rescued bank get back on their feet.
The draft law states that in the next five years, the president must submit a proposal to Congress, which stipulates how the expected losses from the financial sector can be returned to taxpayers.
Of course, there were those on both sides who expressed their doubts about the plan.
This is not what the American citizens asked us to do, i.e. it does not protect the taxpayers&#39; dollars, said California Republican Representative Darrell Issa.
His fellow Democrat from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, believed that the measures were pushed by the same people who were responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continued to grow
In August 2008, the domestic sales prices of the industry rose by 0.1 percent compared to the previous month, and by 12.9 percent compared to August 2007 - KSH reports.
The prices of industrial export sales were 1.1 percent higher compared to July 2008, and decreased by 3.9 percent compared to a year earlier.
As a result of the change in domestic and export prices, industrial producer prices were 0.7 percent higher than the previous month and 3.2 percent higher than a year earlier.
Compared to the previous month, the domestic sales prices of the industry increased only minimally, by 0.1 percent.
The domestic sales prices of the manufacturing sectors also rose slightly, by 0.1 percent compared to July.
In August 2008, the largest price increase occurred in the leather product and footwear manufacturing sector (2.8 percent), mainly due to the 4.6 percent monthly price increase of bags and belts and the 2.5 percent monthly price increase of footwear manufacturing.
The higher price level of plastic and chemical raw materials resulted in a considerable monthly increase in the prices of the chemical material and product manufacturing sector (1.6 percent).
Price reductions occurred in the petroleum processing (1.4 percent), electrical machine and instrument manufacturing (0.9 percent), and - to a minimal extent - wood processing (0.1 percent) sectors.
The prices of paper production, publishing and printing activities did not change.
In the other manufacturing sectors, we measured a price increase of between 0.2 percent and 0.9 percent.
In the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sector, which represents a significant weight in the industry&#39;s domestic sales, prices increased by 0.3 percent in August, primarily as a result of the lingering effect of the official gas price increase implemented from July 1.
In a twelve-month comparison - with regard to the domestic sales of the processing industry sectors - prices increased the most in the petroleum processing sector (32.4 percent).
A 13.2 percent price increase was observed in the manufacturing sector of metal processing products, and an 11 percent increase in the production of food, beverages, and tobacco, which represents the decisive weight.
Price reductions occurred in the manufacturing of textiles and textile goods (2.5 percent), as well as the manufacturing of electrical machines and instruments (0.3 percent).
In the other manufacturing sectors, the rate of price increase was between 0.6 percent and 9.1 percent.
In the manufacturing industry as a whole, prices have increased by 10.2 percent over the past year.
The prices of the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sector were 18.7 percent higher than a year earlier.
In domestic sales, the largest monthly price increase (0.7 percent) was seen in the sectors producing capital goods in August.
They increased by 0.3 percent in the sectors producing consumer goods, and prices in the sectors producing energy and further use did not change compared to the previous month.
In August 2008, compared to the same month of the previous year, the largest price increase was observed in the energy and further consumption sectors (16.8 percent).
We measured a price increase of 6.8 percent in sectors producing consumer goods, and a 1.4 percent price decrease in investment goods.
The industry&#39;s export sales prices, measured in forints, rose by 1.1 percent in August compared to the previous month, and fell by 3.9 percent in a 12-month comparison.
In one month, our domestic currency weakened by 1.7 percent against the euro and 7.1 percent against the dollar, compared to August 2007 it strengthened by 7.5 percent against the euro and 15.9 percent against the dollar.
Will you no longer need a visa to enter the United States next year?
Kinga Göncz sees a good chance that the American-Hungarian visa exemption agreement will come into effect around January 12 - the foreign minister spoke about this in Chicago, in front of the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
In his opinion, &quot;pretty much everything now just depends on whether the electronic entry and control system overseas is built in time&quot;.
At the same time, he drew attention to the fact that there will be no entry permit in the new system, but tourists will have to register themselves before departure.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy will hold talks in Washington from today.
He meets Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, to whom he presents the Center Cross of the Hungarian Order of Merit with a Star, and holds discussions with the foreign policy advisers of Democrat Barack Obama and Republican presidential candidate John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain are also in favor of the bank rescue package
Barack Obama and John McCain, the presidential candidates of the two major American parties, both assured their support for the government&#39;s $700 billion bank rescue package on Sunday, but there are politicians who demand the resignation of the finance minister.
After several days of marathon negotiations, representatives of Congress and the administration announced early Sunday that they had reached an agreement in principle on the bank rescue package.
The Wall Street crisis and the financial package aimed at thawing the frozen credit market became the central issue of the presidential election campaign.
Both Obama and McCain present themselves as better suited than their rival to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the latest polls, with economic issues coming to the fore, Obama gained some advantage again, the advantage McCain gained after the Republican convention, with Sarah Palin&#39;s nomination for vice president, melted away.
At a campaign rally in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that the law on the 700 billion dollar package would be quickly adopted by Congress.
He emphasized that the proposal contains the consumer protection passages that he also supported.
&quot;We must act now, responsibly (...) your jobs, savings, entire industries, the stability of the entire economy are in danger,&quot; he said to the crowd of 35,000.
He did not fail to call McCain&#39;s economic ideas outdated.
In an interview with ABC, McCain explained, &quot;we will all have a hard time swallowing this (...) but doing nothing is simply not the way to go.&quot;
The Republican senator stated that the proposal included the establishment of a committee to supervise the finance minister and the limitation of severance pay for top executives, which he insisted on.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no meaningful role in the negotiations, but he was in daily contact with the minister.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that the House of Representatives will hopefully vote on the bill on Monday.
Review of the German-speaking area
The right-wing camp is intact, only within the camp have the voters become more self-aware - this is how Der Spiegel analyzes the weak performance of the CSU in Bavaria.
The Haiders are ready to govern Austria to prevent a red-black coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the online edition of the left-wing German news magazine, Franz Walter analyzes the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article &quot;Bavaria&#39;s revolution devours its fathers&quot;.
According to the well-known political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took office.
The Christian Socialists renewed Bavaria for decades - and now it is precisely these modern citizens who are turning away from them.
The change of era is also the problem of the entire Christian democracy, including Angela Merkel.
The failure was not entirely surprising for the CSU, but on Sunday, a process that was probable almost exactly ten years ago ended: the undisputed hegemony of a state party ended.
Already ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU landed at 47.7 percent, the first time since the 1950s it was below the 50 percent level.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, so during the much-mentioned Stoiber era.
The reason for this is the modernization carried out consistently by the CSU in the province, which is devouring its parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but they were very wrong about the pace. However, secularization, educational results, and the settlement of East and North Germans in the developing regions of Bavaria could not be without consequences for the voters&#39; loyalty to the CSU.
Modernization is accompanied by an increase in opportunities, and the political consequences of this are also visible.
The right-wing camp is intact, only within the camp did the voters become more self-aware, more critical, more stubborn.
It is also striking that in the last few weeks it was precisely the classic bourgeois groups that distanced themselves the most from the CSU; freelancers, industrialists, high school graduates and those with higher education.
Here, support for the CSU has already shrunk below 40 percent.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
In the article &quot;Who, with whom? The party presidents are restrained in coalition issues&quot;, the conservative Viennese daily deals with the confused domestic political situation that developed after the Austrian elections.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits the SPÖ from interfering in its internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open to negotiations in all directions, the Greens do not want to discuss the coalition yet.
The election is done, now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debate held on public television, the party leaders barely allowed an insight into their cards.
SPÖ president Werner Faymann confirmed that he intends to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is indeed possible - it exists in some provinces and in the social partnership.
Faymann left the question of whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer - the current ÖVP president as vice chancellor - open.
As he put it, the Schüssel-Molterer course was voted down anyway.
A repetition of this trend is out of the question.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the red offers.
As he said, cooperation will certainly not be effective if Faymann tries to interfere in the ÖVP&#39;s internal affairs.
Whether his party chooses the opposition or joins the coalition is completely open in the party for the time being, the issues must be discussed within the ÖVP.
BZÖ president Jörg Haider repeatedly showed himself to be open in all directions.
&quot;In order to prevent the red-black coalition, we are ready to assume governmental responsibility,&quot; said Haider.
Járóka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
The European Equal Opportunities Summit started today in Paris, which this year is hosted by France, which holds the EU presidency.
Lívia Járóka, the Fidesz representative of the European People&#39;s Party, as one of the main speakers of the professional conference, drew attention to educational segregation in her message to the plenum, because it is one of the most serious violations of the law affecting Roma children and, moreover, it is also the most serious obstacle to their empowerment.
The high-level conference was opened - on behalf of the French Presidency - by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister of Employment and Social Affairs, and Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Those invited to the meeting included representatives of governments, European social partners and the most important European rights defenders and civil society organizations in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the Fidesz EP representative group, Járóka warned that in addition to discrimination in hiring, Roma are excluded from the labor market primarily due to their low level of education.
&quot;The vast majority of young Roma do not have a secondary education, and due to the poor quality of primary education, only an insignificant part of them can obtain a higher education&quot;.
Járóka further emphasized that, as a fundamental human right, education has a key role in the enforcement of other human rights.
Investing in the early education of Roma children can strengthen the economy of the European Union member states.
According to the representative, it is necessary to make the widest possible awareness of these connections - both among Roma and non-Roma.
Because the earlier the Roma student starts school, the more chances he has to become productive members of the labor market; they contribute to the national budget through taxes paid on income and consumption.
&quot;The Roma must be guaranteed their right to quality education by virtue of their European Union citizenship, and the elimination of their low-quality and segregated education must be guaranteed,&quot; emphasized Lívia Járóka.
According to the representative, the goal and action-oriented cooperation of the European Union is necessary for the immediate acceleration of school desegregation processes, for which the correct enforcement of the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives is essential.
&quot;The vicious cycle of poverty, segregation, and unemployment must be broken, Roma children must be given the opportunities provided by the democratic space so that they can contribute to the future of Europe as full-fledged citizens,&quot; demanded Járóka.
In the spirit of the &quot;European Year of Equal Opportunities&quot; for everyone, the European Equality Summit, which has been held annually since last year&#39;s meeting in Berlin, aims to provide a unique forum for promoting the goals of equal opportunities and non-discrimination set at the European and Member State level.
Fox in the henhouse
In America, life and health insurers often refuse to sign an insurance contract with an applicant based on people&#39;s drug purchase data.
Data protection experts fear that the market for data will become uncontrollable.
&quot;There is a data protection program that always requires the consent of the person concerned to use prescription data.
It has to be in independent hands, otherwise we leave the hen&#39;s chicken to the fox,&quot; the Washington Post quotes Richard Dicket, the developer of the drug prescription tracking program.
The insurance companies make the insurance premium and the amount due in the event of damage dependent on the health condition of the applying client, and if they deem the risk too high, they do not take out insurance.
In the past, the person was sent for a medical examination, and the contract was concluded only after knowing the results of the examination.
Ten years ago, Dick invented a much cheaper procedure: based on the client&#39;s ID number, he easily obtains from the pharmacies what medicines the person has bought in the past year and a half, and from this the program itself infers what disease he suffers from and what his medical condition is.
For example, if you regularly take high doses of cholesterol-lowering drugs, it indicates that your blood fat level is practically unmanageably high, which immediately puts you in a higher risk category.
There are several versions of the program in circulation, some of which also determine a risk multiplier, so the insurer has little to do apart from the paperwork, although minor difficulties arise.
Among the disadvantages is that some drugs can be used for several purposes, for example, some compounds can be used against migraines or hot flashes, but they are also effective against depression.
The latter is considered a significant risk-increasing factor from the point of view of business insurers, the former are not.
Separate companies were formed to retrieve and process the data, and they ask for the patient&#39;s consent before obtaining the necessary information from the pharmacies.
The authorities are now obliging them to do so, although no penalty has been imposed for their failure so far.
More recently, some companies are already processing the results of laboratory tests and linking them with drug consumption data, so they can provide an even more accurate picture of the patients&#39; health.
More and more companies have access to the data, and it will become more and more difficult to control the use in parallel.
There is a separate healthcare data protection law, but it only applies to healthcare providers and insurance companies.
The bill is before the congress, which gives the authorities control over companies specializing in the provision of data.
Dick Richard realizes that this is not enough: that is why he further developed his program, which would bind the transfer of data to the express consent of the person concerned.
Another issue is that the person concerned cannot refuse the consent, otherwise the insurers will not conclude a contract with him.
So, the hens are somehow dependent on the fox&#39;s kindness.
CSU: grace for a temporary period
The fate of the retired Huber-Beckstein duo will be decided at the end of October
Despite the ugly election failure, heads have not yet fallen, the Bavarian CSU leaders have postponed the discussion of personnel issues for the time being.
Party chairman Erwin Huber and provincial prime minister Günther Beckstein can still remain in place, the question is how long the pardon will last.
The fate of the tandem, which suffered a catastrophic vote loss of 17 percent, will be decided by an extraordinary party congress on the last weekend of October.
In any case, the members of the much-criticized couple made it clear: they do not stick to their seats with all their might.
With this, they tried to calm down the angry members of the faction and the base, who demanded personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority one day after the &quot;Bavarian tsunami&quot;.
Five years ago - admittedly, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, who was still at the top of his career - the Christian Social Union won 60.7 percent, but now, one year after the coup against Stoiber, it was only 43.4 percent of their strength.
For 46 years, the CSU was &quot;monopoly&quot; in Bavaria, which accounts for 18 percent of Germany&#39;s GDP.
Although the conservatives still count highly in the southern province, which is key for the Hungarian economy, they will definitely be forced into a coalition in the future.
As one of the first signs of the reorganization within the party, Horst Seehofer, who is considered a possible successor to Huber and the Federal Minister of Agriculture, will also be included in the narrow scouting team that will begin soft negotiations with the liberal FDP and the Free Voters, which is organized along right-wing values, about a possible government coalition in Munich.
In a strange quirk of fate, Gabriele Pauli, whose action against Stoiber was used by the Huber-Beckstein couple as a coup opportunity, entered the legislature on the list of Free Voters, and then they treated the aspiring municipal politician mercilessly.
CSU leaders are now putting all their energy into somehow stabilizing Beckstein.
Stoiber, who has been weaving threads from the background until now, will also play an active role in the transition. The former provincial head of government and former CSU president called September 28 the most bitter day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber released some bitter comments towards the CDU, in his opinion, they deserved much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel as well.
After the Bundestag elections due in September 2009, Merkel cannot become chancellor if the CSU, which played a significant role in the national success of 2005, is not somehow brought back to its feet.
Hardly concealing her disappointment over the fiasco, Merkel says that the CSU&#39;s loss of ground will not have a negative impact on the grand coalition in Berlin.
Which is, of course, relative: the wounded CSU will not be easier to manage, and the crisis of the Social Democrats will continue.
With 18.6 percent, the SPD achieved its weakest result in Bavaria since 1946.
Opposition to Lukashenko: 110-0
Not a single opposition member made it into the Belarusian parliament following Sunday&#39;s elections.
According to Russian observers, this can be explained by the prosperity and stability ensured in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), it can be explained by illegalities committed during the vote counting.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the elections.
Although the 100-member legislature of the country of 10 million has been without an opposition for more than a decade, before yesterday&#39;s elections the opposition united under the name United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) seriously hoped that, following the constitutional amendment, Lukashenko, who renewed his presidential mandate for the fourth time in the disputed elections of 2006, would this time &quot;allows&quot; some opposition members to appear in parliament.
The ODSZ thus abandoned the previously considered boycott.
The opposition&#39;s expectations were based on the fact that Belarus, which is economically increasingly dependent on Russia - which took out a loan to reduce the ever-increasing price of Russian natural gas imports and also contributed to the transfer of Beltransgaz, which owns the gas pipelines passing through the country, into Russian hands - wanted to improve its relations with the EU, where the due to the Belarusian political system classified as anti-democratic, Lukashenko and several high-ranking politicians do not receive entry permits.
The fact that the OSCE, when evaluating the election campaign, emphasized the positive developments rather than the shortcomings - for example, the banning of a third of the opposition candidates from running - indicated a preliminary relief.
However, the OSCE&#39;s quick report on Monday already objected to the campaign - during which the opposition candidates were essentially not allowed to appear in the press - and especially to the fact that the opposition could not be present during the counting of votes.
At the same time, according to the opposition, there is still a noticeable improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been released, and Minsk is willing to have a minor confrontation with Moscow, still refusing to recognize South Ossetia and Abkhazia, which broke away from Georgia, even though Russia - with which Belarus forms a federal state on paper - has been considering the two areas as independent for a month now.
- We took two steps forward, one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has started - Aleksandr Milinkevich told our newspaper.
According to the opposition candidate of the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable that this should remain, despite the fact that the &quot;power is afraid of allowing even one opposition member into the weightless parliament&quot;.
The opposition is not planning any protest actions after seeing the results, rather it is trying to convey its message about the need for economic reforms to the voters.
- Of course, we have a lot of problems with this, we have to print the opposition papers in Russia, the local authorities put obstacles in the way of distribution, but I still see that more and more people are supporting the change, also among the elderly - said Milinkevich, referring to the fact that Lukashenko&#39;s regime, which sees the creation of social security as its main result, is not considered adequate even by the most officially supported pensioners.
- Due to the country&#39;s indebtedness and the increase in the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before the &quot;cemetery-like&quot; social security breaks down - Milinkevics believed.
Against the opposition politician, Russian observers described the elections as democratic.
Sergey Lebeyev, head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: &quot;people believe not in words, but in deeds&quot;, so the lack of opposition is nothing more than proof of the maturity of the Belarusian electorate.
Global Marseille menu
Trade between the European Union and India will double
Since the European Union and India are each other&#39;s leading trade partners, this topic also dominated the agenda of the ninth summit, along with other, largely global, issues.
There will also be a French-Indian summit today, where nuclear energy cooperation will be the main topic.
Although the European Union recognizes that India is a rising democratic power that should be given a greater say in international affairs, the member countries have not yet managed to reach a common denominator on whether to support New Delhi&#39;s permanent membership in the UN Security Council.
This question was thus not discussed at the ninth summit held yesterday in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as EU President-in-Office, Commission President José Manuel Barroso and High Representative for Foreign Affairs Javier Solana received Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they agreed to double trade turnover in five years, i.e. to more than a hundred billion euros.
Considering that between 2000 and 2007, the exchange of goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not an overly ambitious goal.
In the spirit of this, the twenty-six bilateral civil aviation agreements with India have been smoothed out in a legal sense, which means that air traffic can also soar in the future.
India wants to sign a free trade agreement with the EU by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up negotiations.
The aim is to balance the fact that, while the EU is India&#39;s number one trading partner, New Delhi is at the same time only in ninth place among the EU&#39;s partners.
The summit focused on global affairs.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, as well as terrorism - the latter was condemned in all its forms, and the convening of the UN conference was urged.
They have also called for an end to the Doha trade round, although both have a large part in the failure so far.
The EU has confirmed that it is sticking to its energy and climate program, meaning that it wants to reduce emissions by at least twenty percent by 2020.
India also agreed with this, as well as with the fact that a global deal should be concluded at next year&#39;s climate conference, and the production of greenhouse gases should be reduced by fifty percent by 2050.
They also want to prevent the rise of food prices, and they supported the convening of an international meeting to review the financial crisis.
The Indian Prime Minister is going to the French capital today, where he is preparing to conclude a deal on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at the bilateral meeting.
In Paris, they are confident that French companies will receive orders worth twenty billion euros for the construction of nuclear reactors in India.
According to news agency reports, the agreement is for 15 years.
More than three hundred Italian book publishers in Frankfurt
Italian publishers are represented by a strong field at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than three hundred Italian publishing houses will be present at the most important international copyright meeting, the 60th Buchmesse fair.
7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries are expected at this year&#39;s Frankfurt International Book Fair, on a floor area of 171,790 square meters, where more than 403,000 books will be presented. The guest of honor will be Turkey.
At the opening ceremony of the Italian Pavilion, the Italian government will be represented by Francesco Maria Giro, Deputy State Secretary of the Ministry of Cultural Assets and Activities: Italy will occupy an exhibition area of 264 square meters through the establishment of a unified Italia Point.
The ceremonial opening will be followed by a press conference to be held in the &quot;Room Struktur&quot; room of the Buchmesse 5.0 pavilion, where there will be an opportunity to present data, trends and prospects regarding the situation of Italian book publishing.
According to the data, the proportion of foreign authors in the Italian publishing market is constantly decreasing, especially in the field of adult and youth publications.
Brunetta: &quot;Breakfast only before working hours&quot;
In a unique way in the history of the Chigi Palace, revolving doors were installed to let employees in and out.
Starting today, this new measure against cheaters will come into effect, to filter out those who block and then go have a coffee during working hours.
The new anti-piracy law was presented today by Minister of Public Administration Renato Brunetta and Secretary General of the Prime Minister&#39;s Office Mauro Masi.
&quot;The turnstiles - said Brunetta - serve to work better and more efficiently, reduce absenteeism and increase services&quot;
&quot;A new, more responsible and transparent period is coming.
This is the real reform,&quot; emphasized Brunetta.
The installation of all buildings of the Council of Ministers is completed with the Chigi Palace.
According to Masi, &quot;the installation of the turnstiles is also important from a symbolic point of view&quot;.
We did not experience any resistance from the employees - confirmed the general secretary: &quot;The employees approved the measure, everyone cooperated.&quot;
In short, breakfast during working hours is over, no more coffee and brioche.
Brunetta advises with a smile: &quot;a good cappuccino at seven in the morning can do wonders&quot;
At the College of Public Administration in Rome
at the meeting held, the minister explained: &quot;in three months, absences due to illness among public sector workers have decreased by 50 percent, which means sixty thousand more people going to work in one year&quot;.
At the same time, he added that the Italian public administration should be made more efficient
, &quot;whose wage dynamics - according to the minister - in the last 8-10 years was twice as large as that of the private sector, and far exceeded the inflation rate&quot;.
At the same time, thousands of civil servants gathered, joining a petition supported by the Italian Association of Environmental and Consumer Protection Associations, to protest the provisions of Brunetta&#39;s decree.
&quot;While the Minister of Public Administration is boasting of data supporting the reduction of absences due to illness, the army of &#39;tireless day stealers&#39; is constantly growing,&quot; writes the consumer protection association.
Across Italy, thousands of honest and hard-working civil servants gathered to declare war on the unlawful provisions of the decree.&quot;
The regional administrative court is challenging, among other things, the cancellation of additional sick pay due to illness attributable to service reasons, the extension of the stay-at-home period of employees on sick leave, which means the period within which the sick visitor can appear, and several other provisions contained in the new provisions prescribed by the minister aspect.
Workplace accidents: According to Napolitano, prevention is more important than anything else
In Italy, 2,500 workplace accidents occur every day, 3 of which result in death and 27 in permanent disability.
According to data from the workplace accident insurance company, nearly 1,200 deaths occurred in the workplace in 2007.
The numbers testify to the seriousness of a phenomenon that is still one of the most common causes of death today and claims almost twice as many victims as homicide.
Today, for the 58th time, Anmil organizes the Day of Victims of Workplace Accidents, traditionally held on the second Sunday of October, in every county of Italy, to draw the attention of institutions, social organizations and mass media to this dramatic problem.
&quot;The worrying data provided by Anmil, as well as the tragic events of the last few days, confirm that prevention plays an extremely important role in accidents at work,&quot; declared President Giorgio Napolitano in his message to Pietro Mercandelli, president of the National Association of the Disabled at Work.
The head of state sincerely praised the &quot;association&#39;s persistent commitment to workplace prevention, protecting the interests of workers who suffered accidents, helping victims&#39; family members and making public opinion vulnerable&quot;.
&quot;Tragedies of this nature, which, due to their scale, arouse the interest of the media and the public, cause indignation that is natural and honestly shared by everyone, but in reality we have to face dramatic cases that repeat themselves every day&quot;.
Napolitano openly admits: &quot;There is no doubt that we are struggling with a lack of resources, the financing of education and information is of crucial importance.
Initiatives within the school that aim to directly inform young people on the verge of entering the world of work are particularly important.
It is our duty to maintain interest in the phenomenon, not to allow attention to wane regarding the social importance of the issue, and more effective legislation is needed, which must be enforced.
The president of the House of Commons, Gianfranco Fini, for his part, emphasized &quot;how serious workplace accidents that end in death are, they have a social significance that burdens the conscience of all of us, and the institutions are required to put an end to this as soon as possible&quot;.
&quot;Data on accidents at work show a slight improvement, but the number of such deaths is still staggeringly high,&quot; noted Pietro Mercandelli, president of Anmil.
&quot;At the same time, we do not want this declining trend to be coupled with declining attention, because the greatest tragedies happen precisely when attention wanes.&quot;
&quot;We believe that, at a general level, we are still not doing everything to combat this phenomenon, which could be solved through a complex program of action.
In our opinion, stricter supervision and control would be necessary - emphasized Mercandelli - as well as more marked intervention in the field of workforce training, starting from school education.&quot;
&quot;Further efforts are needed to inform and make the public aware,&quot; he added.
What is most needed, however, is a more responsible employer environment in the face of a phenomenon that is a social problem&quot;.
Afterwards, Mercandelli criticized the &quot;gradual deterioration of the compensation safety net for victims of workplace accidents&quot; and the &quot;assistance trend towards which the system has drifted in recent years&quot;.
&quot;So the goal is to return the security provided by the insurance to the workers, because the fate of those who suffer accidents cannot depend on the sometimes arbitrary and sometimes divisive measures of the legislators&quot;.
MP3 players can cause hearing damage
Permanent hearing damage can be caused by listening to portable playback devices such as MP3 players at high volume for long periods of time -
stated in a report published in Brussels, referring to the expert opinion published today by the European Commission, the EU&#39;s Scientific Committee on New and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR).
&quot;The expert opinion reveals that 5-10 percent of those who listen to their portable music player at high volume for more than an hour a day for five years can suffer permanent hearing loss,&quot; reads the explanation.
&quot;It is worrying that young people who use portable music players and mobile phones at high volumes and frequently are not aware that they can irreversibly damage their hearing,&quot; said Meglena Kuneva.
&quot;Scientific surveys indicate an indisputable risk, to which we must respond urgently,&quot; added the EU Commissioner.
The most important task is to inform consumers and widely distribute related information.
In the light of the mentioned expert opinion, we must also review the already existing control systems so that they can operate with sufficient efficiency and keep up with the latest technologies&quot;.
Brussels asked the independent scientific committee to investigate the problem, given the prevalence of portable music players and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the noise they cause.
&quot;Researchers confirm that there is cause for concern. And the European Commission, in cooperation with member states and interested parties, is ready to examine what possible measures could be introduced to protect children and adolescents exposed to noise pollution caused by portable players and similar devices,&quot; he concluded. committee member.
The currently valid European safety regulation defines the maximum noise level that can be emitted by portable music players at 100 dB, however, there is growing concern about hearing damage resulting from the excessive use of such sound sources.
However, there are solutions such as reducing the level and duration of noise exposure, through which the aforementioned hearing impairments can be significantly reduced.
In its expert opinion, the EU&#39;s scientific committee explains that for users of portable playback devices who listen to music at high volume (more than 89 decibels) for five hours a week, the noise exposure exceeds the currently valid maximum value for workplace noise.
If someone listens to music under similar conditions for a long time, there is a risk of permanent hearing loss after five years.
This affects approximately 5-10 percent of portable device users, which may mean 2.5-10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno sets up a committee responsible for the future of the capital
It starts today, lasts until March, and the results are expected in June.
This is the schedule set by the Metropolitan Municipality for the operation of the committee called &quot;The Future of the Cathedral Capital of Rome&quot;, which met this morning at its new headquarters located behind the Baths of Caracalla.
Over the next six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 commission members will develop Rome&#39;s guidelines.
After the final word in March, the general assembly and the local government committee will evaluate the study and the plans so that the capital&#39;s strategic plan, officially approved by the local government and mayor Gianni Alemanno, can be submitted in June.
&quot;This is a completely independent committee in which all kinds of political, social and cultural ideas are represented - stresses Alemanno - and its task is to develop proposals for Rome&#39;s development ideas that the political decision-makers, i.e. the General Assembly and the Municipal Committee, can rely on.
There is no question of any conflict of interests, we just wanted a platform where big plans for the benefit of Rome could be created.
In March, after it has completed its work, the committee will be disbanded because it has a fixed-term mandate.
In June, we will submit a strategic plan based on the work of the committee called &quot;The Future of the Szekler Capital of Rome&quot;, the mayor declared.
To those who consider the operation of the Commission unnecessary, citing that the expert opinion it draws up is not binding, Alemanno replies: &quot;It all depends on what kind of work the Commission will do and what quality proposals it will put on the table.
If the standard turns out to be adequate, just like in the case of the Attali Commission in France, which I am certain will be the case in Rome, the contribution it provides will play an important role.
The power of politics is often fragmented in managing day-to-day affairs as well as dealing with urgent cases that arise from time to time.
On the other hand, we, taking long-term aspects into account, look further and plan for the longer term, and we work dedicatedly for the development and future of Rome&quot;.
The mayor of Rome wishes to state that &quot;this Commission cannot be considered a useless &quot;watershed&quot;, as it is completely free, it will not cost the citizens of Rome a single euro, on the other hand, it serves as a stimulus for thought and aims to involve the best minds of the capital&quot;.
According to Alemanno, &quot;an open-ended and flexible strategic framework is needed, which enables our city to make the leap in quality it so desperately needs, thinking about its future in a unified spirit&quot;.
Regarding the future, regarding which the mayor of Rome emphasizes: &quot;it will not only be limited to the current municipal framework, but will look much further&quot;, we see in it not only the future metropolis and capital status, but also &quot;the role that Rome, Europe and the Mediterranean as the capital of the region, it can and should do&quot;.
Obama? The first anti-American president. We&#39;ll show you why.
A well-known American politician who claims to be independent wrote about this: &quot;Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who destroyed the American economy with his decisions and maintained close relations (as he still does today as a private person) with the hostile Islam.
As the election approaches, the attacks against Obama intensify.
A Miami lady wrote online: &quot;This man is full of ambition.
Obama brazenly thinks he can win the highest public office in a nation that has had a total of two black governors and five senators!&quot;
These attacks are actually meaningless; they are of course racist in nature, but they do not answer the voters&#39; question of whether he will be a good president. Then there are the polls: they indicate that Obama will win, and by a large margin.
Even in this case, there are those who listen to their emotions and not their reason.
In the interior of the southern United States, a Mississippi newspaper wrote this in its editorial: we know very well who the true American patriot casts his vote for in the voting booth.
A side of the American way of thinking that remained hidden until the last moment appears here.
&quot;Just say what you want, and then we&#39;ll know where to put the money, Obama or McCain&quot;.
Some swear by it: if Obama wins, they will leave the United States.
Such words have never been spoken until now, when the success of the black candidate is almost certain.
At the same time, despite all these reasonings, the Democrats&#39; winning weapon is George Bush himself.
1500 people were asked what were the mistakes made during Bush&#39;s tenure? 89 percent said Iraq.
America is changing.
This nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam and was so screwed that it flew all the way home.
4,500 soldiers died in Iraq and the Americans didn&#39;t have to pack.
Yet the majority believes that Iraq was Bush&#39;s weak point.
Whoever succeeds George W. has a huge task ahead of him.
USA: journalists are already feeling the economic collapse, the time has come for cutbacks in editorial offices as well. Many people blame the Internet for the &quot;death&quot; of print media.
The PEW research institute asked five hundred American journalists how they feel about the future status of their profession and its intellectual power.
Well, at the moment almost all journalists are pessimistic about their own future.
However, they did not clearly state that their concerns regarding credibility had decreased.
They don&#39;t feel as isolated as before.
The problem for American journalists is money.
According to them, the 2008 crisis is the failure of a weak economic model.
Another serious problem is the restrictions imposed on the newsroom, that is, on the editorial offices that produce the newspaper.
If we don&#39;t want traditional journalism, in the sense that the general public understands it, to shrink to a minimum, this problem must be solved, say the interviewed journalists.
A visible and complex pessimism characterizes American journalism today.
Sixty percent of journalists and top managers working in the print media are convinced that national journalism is on the wrong track.
At the local level, 65 percent of journalists are in top management positions.
Print versus electronic media.
It is not difficult for the staff of the press to see where the world wide web is going.
The biggest publishers are making their way to the Internet, which many believe is the &quot;killer&quot; of the print media.
The &quot;economic pressure&quot; perceived by journalists increased to 79 percent.
The 500 interviewed journalists admitted that they would vote for technology, hoping that it might benefit journalism.
Today, in the American press industry, there is a gap between the editorial managers, that is, the directors, and the reporters who work for them.
At the national level, 56 percent of the managers are sure that their correspondents share their information with others, while at the local level, this ratio can be reduced to only 23 percent.
Some associate this with secure employment.
At the national level, 47 percent of managers fear that they may lose their jobs within three years.
For journalists, this rate is 30 percent.
In America, the issue of &quot;safe work&quot; is constantly on the agenda at the team level (in the case of our editors, ed.).
Only 13 percent of journalists have a contract.
In a huge nation like the US with 300 million people and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and Internet service providers, employers tend to offer as much as they want, so it&#39;s a must-or-don&#39;t thing. .
Directors are usually highly paid, and editors can earn up to ten thousand dollars a month, on top of pension and health insurance premiums.
The vacation, on the other hand, works on a rather complicated principle: x days in the first year, and also in the third, until after a certain time it reaches the maximum of 15 days.
But American journalists, by their own admission, often &quot;get sick&quot; during the year.
It all depends on the climate.
UNIPOL: ROME COURT: DANILO COPPOLA REMAINS IN GROTTAFERRATA
Carmelo Rinaudo, the president of the second criminal division of the Court of Rome, rejected the request of Danilo Coppola, who works in the real estate business, who wanted to move from his place of residence, Grottaferrata, to an apartment in Rome.
Coppola is being investigated for economic bankruptcy, as part of the ongoing investigation into the Unipol - BNL share exchange agreement.
Last week, during the proceedings initiated against him, the house arrest was lifted and it was changed to a curfew for Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, requested that the real estate professional be allowed to move from the small town in the countryside to his apartment in the capital.
However, according to the court, these commutes (for which the prosecutor made a negative proposal) would allow him to influence the affairs of the company and to have access to the evidence brought against him.
The elite are in danger
The phenomenon was already felt a few days ago, when the House of Representatives did not vote on the 700 billion dollar bailout package presented by the White House: a significant number of Americans were, and still are, more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
This is supported by yesterday&#39;s New York Times, which informs that the current crisis has created a rift within the Republican Party, which is increasingly divided between the traditional, restrained, pro-federal institutions and business circles on the East Coast and the central and between a growing new direction in the southern states, against Washington and the financial world.
This trend manifested itself in a critical way during the House of Representatives vote mentioned in the introduction.
However, the above event is only one of the significant changes that the economic restructuring that is still taking place predicts or makes visible, and not only in the United States, but in the entire Western world, and perhaps even beyond.
It seems that the crisis, both in the USA and in Europe, only accelerates those phenomena that have been lurking for quite some time, which are consolidating in this new atmosphere and finally coming to light.
The first such phenomenon is re-actualization, the bringing back of the double category of state sovereignty to public consciousness, in connection with a kind of re-nationalization of the economy.
Indeed, the crisis affects those banking and financial institutions that maintain close relations with foreign countries, but primarily, and quite extensively, carry with them people and families who live in one country, one state.
This, on the other hand, means a direct political difficulty for those in government: how to respond to the difficulties and protests of those people who are also voters.
So, although the crisis appears to be worldwide in the economic sense, it is almost exclusively national in the political sense.
It seems that political internationalism is essentially stuck outside the coastline: the European Union is a clear proof of this, which, maneuvering between different interests and different national strategies, is unable to designate a unified political direction.
Therefore, everyone expects from the individual national governments the intervention, the rescue package, the revival and the new rules, but above all the opening of the monetary funds: because in a difficult situation only the individual states have economic resources, a financial stock that can be able to put things in order do things.
They have both the tools and the authority to use them: under the circumstances, they have two invaluable resources that no other market and no international organization will likely ever possess to such an extent.
On the other hand, the new emphasis placed on the nation-state by the crisis is fully consistent with the fact that the economic growth that has taken place in recent times is giving increasing importance to a factor that is closely related to this element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had already entered the abstract world of the network, of increasingly sophisticated technology, and were convinced that the global financial world was destined to rule the world, we suddenly had to realize that the our future depends more and more on things, not the least abstract, like water, crops and petroleum.
From things that can be transported from one side of the planet to the other, they can still be completely tied to a defined place, an area.
So whoever dominates the area has a lot more trump cards than someone who was unfortunately born in a place with no crops, no oil and no water.
With that, I would also move on to the second innovation, which hints at a kind of fault line.
Anyone who says territory, state, government necessarily also says: politics, in other words leadership.
From this point of view, it seems that the economic crisis produces two overlapping phenomena:
On the one hand, the objective recognition of the need for authentic leadership, for people who can take control of events.
On the other hand, it brings a complete loss of credit to the current leadership, especially the economic leaders, who have proven to be completely incompetent and have proven that there are still many murky areas ahead of them.
Together, the two have an even deeper significance and, in a sense, more disturbing: the sense of discredit, impatience, inadequacy and isolation that affects the entire leadership elite in more and more Western countries.
So it seems that the belief that the time of the social elite, which has been at the top until now, is over, is spreading among an increasingly wide range of the population. It expired even before they had embraced their actions, experiences, lifestyle, culture, in the complex sense of the word. With this, the social elite is becoming more and more alienated from the opinion of the majority.
In short, the need for leadership, in a covert form, feeds a widespread but strong delegitimization movement against the ruling class and the traditional political system. This manifests itself in the unexpected &quot;riots&quot; of voters or, in recent times, sudden changes in the public mood. Examples include the coming to power of the conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, the collapse of the labor party unity in Great Britain, or the rebellion of the American congressmen against Bush (and perhaps the victory of the Italian right wing can also be classified here).
It seems that the traditional elite, with its parties, programs, and we could even say that together with its habits, press and renowned intellectuals, understands less and less, and is therefore less and less able to represent what has been going on in the deeper layers of Western society for some time. Furthermore, the economic crisis is getting stronger, spreading, and is potentially able to create more and more intemperate tempers.
Despite all this, to speak of an &quot;imminent revolt of the masses&quot; would frankly be an exaggeration.
But keeping your eyes open doesn&#39;t hurt at all.
We can walk on the wall with super strong glue
Defeat gravity and walk on walls like Spider-Man with the help of a super-strong glue.
Several American research centers have set themselves this goal, and a group made up of four institutions is close to the solution.
With a piece of glue measuring only 2.5 square centimeters, the researchers managed to stick a 100-kilogram body to a vertical wall and keep it there.
THE STUDY - The American journal Science published the discoveries of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the group of scientists is already existing, special, ú. n. was born from the further development of materials with a carbon nanotube structure.
&quot;We have to think of the glue&#39;s working principle as a tube system similar to a package of spaghetti,&quot; says Zhong Lin Wang, a researcher at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The researchers got the idea from the gecko&#39;s legs, which are covered with microscopic folds, which provide the animal with perfect grip.
Tests with different materials, such as glass, Teflon and sandpaper, confirmed that the new adhesive is ten times more effective than the soles of the mentioned reptiles, but at the same time &quot;it easily comes off the wall,&quot; explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton&#39;s School of Engineering.
WALL WALKING? - &quot;This material can be useful as a temporary adhesive,&quot; adds Liming Dai.
Can we walk on walls, just like Spider-Man? Maybe so, but the researchers are thinking of a less impressive use, like connecting electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are good conductors of heat and electricity.
Another application can be found in the field of space exploration.
Superheroes can wait.
THE OTHER RESEARCH - the University of California, Berkeley, is also conducting experiments with a new adhesive material.
The American Chemical Society c. According to an article published in the magazine, Californian scientists have presented an adhesive made of a hair-like, microfiber material that undergoes self-cleaning during movement on the surface, thus always ensuring perfect adhesion.
Medicines? No fruit juice!
Be careful with grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These thirst-quenching drinks with a high vitamin content, popular especially in the summer, if they enter the body together with certain life-saving drugs, change their absorption, increasing or reducing their effect depending on the case. This can have serious health consequences.
David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, drew attention to the risks of using canned or fresh fruit juices together with certain medications. The professor announced at the 236th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia: a glass of grapefruit, orange or apple juice can reduce the absorption of certain life-saving drugs, thereby preventing their beneficial effects and endangering the patient&#39;s health.
Grapefruit juice has already been in the dock when it was found that it can increase the effect of some antibiotics, antihistamines, anti-anxiety drugs, heart rhythm regulators and nerve drugs to a level that can be considered toxic.
DANGEROUS DRUGS - Two years ago, the Italian Institute of Pharmacy itself disclosed the news in its official gazette, and at the same time warned doctors and patients to take seriously the risks associated with the aforementioned co-consumption and to be careful what they drink when taking drugs such as Diazepam or Methadone.
NOT ONLY GRAPEFRUIT - According to researchers, orange and apple juice also contain substances that inhibit the effectiveness of medicines.
The list of active ingredients whose absorption is hindered by grapefruit and other fruit juices could be long.
This is what Michele Carruba, a professor at the Department of Pharmacy at the State University of Milan, points out: &quot;Discoveries of this kind are usually reported immediately to the various national and international pharmaceutical institutes, who, if necessary, make sure to change the data on the information sheet of the given drug.
That&#39;s why you should always read the information sheet of the medicine you intend to take, and if something is not clear, don&#39;t let yourself be influenced, but ask your doctor or pharmacist clearly,&quot; emphasized the specialist of the Ansa institute.
Paul Krugman received the Nobel Prize in Economics
The American Paul Krugman was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics for his analysis of trade models and territorial relationships of economic activity.
The 55-year-old neo-Keynesian Krugman teaches at Princeton University and is a well-known New York Times columnist.
Krugman is one of the fiercest critics of the Bush administration&#39;s economic and foreign policy actions.
A few months after the terrorist attack in September 2001, when Enron went bankrupt, Krugman predicted in an editorial published in the New York Times that the latter event would have even more decisive consequences for the history of the United States than the collapse of the Twin Towers.
This forecast provoked quite a bit of controversy, the economist was criticized several times, but today we know that it was accurate.
&quot;I&#39;m surprised and a little shocked at how quickly the public interest has moved past the scandalous collapse of Enron or Worldcom,&quot; Krugman said in late 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, a member of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is an &quot;extremely valuable economist&quot;, but at the same time he &quot;spreads his criticisms of the Bush administration&#39;s excessive liberalism in a rather aggressive style.&quot;
Open Office, its third edition, was also worth the &quot;anti-Microsoft&quot; package
The OpenOffice.org 3.0 personal productivity-enhancing, open-source application package is released today. As a free alternative to Microsoft Office, it targets an increasingly wide range of people, from home users to office users, from freelancers to public administrations.
After almost a year of work supervised by SUN Microsystem and carried out by volunteer developers, the new Open Office comes to the public with several new features: in addition to the welcome screen and a redesigned, less spartan user interface, it also offers several important new features. Examples include compatibility with the Apple Mac OS X operating system, and support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format according to the ISO standard.
Particular attention was paid to compatibility with the Office 2007 system, so Open Office can also open Microsoft documents with new extensions (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Also interesting are the specific functions of some modules, such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations. This can be useful when sending files via email. Another function supports the import of PDF files into the graphics module, keeping the correct page layout.
On this interface, however, we can also create &quot;hybrid PDF&quot; documents, which combine the typical Adobe format with spreadsheet or text editor elements.
Sharing within applications has also undergone several improvements: the spreadsheet supports the joint use of workbooks, but prevents overwriting each other&#39;s work. Each employee&#39;s contribution is marked with a different color, which helps to make it easier to recognize during the verification phase.
Some companies are already working on making some functions of OpenOffice available from the Internet (on the cloud), so the final version will probably be presented in the coming weeks.
The Italian version, after it has been added to the mirror pages alongside the English version that has been available since Friday, can be downloaded from the following address: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html
In addition to the usual Windows and Mac OS operating systems, the program package is also available for Linux.
Upon request, we can even pick up the installation CD at our home or workplace.
From the point of view of the spread of the home application, the freeness is probably the biggest attraction, but the Open Office suite is now trying to kick the ball in the business sector as well, as it can count on many public administration and school projects.
There is no shortage of educational, consulting and service services ideal for small and medium-sized businesses, which can open up new business prospects.
Open Office consists of five basic modules: Writer, a text editor similar to Word; Calc, a spreadsheet program designed to replace Excel; For Impress, Powerpoint type presentations; Dbase is the most well-known database manager similar to Access; and finally Draw is the graphics module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads. But if we take into account that with the release of the new version we are already at 3,600,000, this number will probably be higher than expected.
Kohl&#39;s result is also positive, this is already the fourth doping case
On the last stage of the Tour de France, one of the participants, the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, competing in the colors of the Gerolsteiner team, once again produced a positive example, and in addition to the bronze medal, he also won the jersey for the best climber.
The news was published on the website of the Equipe Internetes newspaper.
The 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth rider, after the Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepol, and the German, also a Gerolsteiner rider, Stefan Schumacher, who produced a positive result in the Cera test, which is considered the third generation version of the EPO.
Kohl&#39;s blood sample, like the tests carried out in recent weeks, was analyzed by laboratories in Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the control tests also confirm the positive Cera result, the Austrian will lose his third place and, according to the regulations, he will be banned from racing for two years.
The news about the positive result of Kohl&#39;s third-generation EPO test was also confirmed by Pierre Bordry, head of the French Anti-Doping Agency, who told the Associated Press news agency: he reported the positive doping result to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian managed to stand on the podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, and also won the polka dot jersey for the best climber.
IMMIGRANTS: THE NEW YORK TIMES ASKS, IS ITALY RACIST?
Italy has only recently transformed from a country of emigrants into a popular destination for reluctant immigrants.
Is this why &quot;Belpaese&quot; is turning into a racist nation? This is the question that the New York Times is debating, which, starting from the case of the young Burkinabe Abdul William Guibre - who was murdered in Milan last month for stealing a box of biscuits - devotes a long article to the debate surrounding racism in Italy.
The case is a good example of what the New York Times calls the &quot;paradox of the north&quot;: the northern regions have the &quot;strongest integration and the highest employment&quot;, but at the same time, &quot;anti-immigration and support for the Northern League&quot; are also the strongest here in the country. .
The NYT also cites incidents in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno to support the growing tension between Italians and immigrants.
In fact.
The new laws demanded by the League, which would tighten the reins on immigration and make it easier to deport illegal immigrants, were also put on the table as an example of the mood change taking place in Italy.
The aforementioned trend is highlighted by the Pope and the President of the Republic: &quot;Giorgio Napolitano met with Benedict XVI in the Quirinale Palace and suggested that the state and the Church work together to defeat racism&quot;.
The plane of billionaire Steve Fossett, who disappeared a year ago, has been found
The remains of billionaire Steve Fossett&#39;s plane, which disappeared on September 3, 2007 over the Nevada desert, have been found.
The wreckage was found on a 3,000-foot high plateau in the Mammoth Lakes area of the Sierra Nevada Mountains on the California-Nevada border.
No human remains were found inside the plane.
Madera County Sheriff John Anderson dispelled any remaining doubts: &quot;After determining the location of the plane, we dispatched a team, and now we can be sure that it is the plane that Steve Fossett was flying on the day he disappeared,&quot; he said at a press conference.
The sheriff further confirmed that no human remains were found in the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said that a few hours after the discovery of the wreckage, a board of inquiry was called in to identify the plane and determine that it was indeed the Bellanca 8kcab that disappeared on September 3, 2007. the day Fossett took a three-hour flight from Yerington, Nevada.
Yesterday, also in California, not far from the Nevada border, a couple found some of Fossett&#39;s personal belongings near his Mammoth Lakes home.
Two IDs in Fosset&#39;s name issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, some cash and a sweater.
The search for Fossett was abandoned a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire set many peaks that made him go down in history.
In 2002, on his sixth attempt, he managed to fly around the earth in a balloon for the first time: a two-week solo flight.
Three years later, he flew around the world without landing.
Among his many records is the flight over the Andes, at an altitude of 15,445 meters, which he performed with a co-pilot.
GLK, shocking advertisement
An unusual, at the same time, original and distinct form of hobby SUV, with large surfaces and clean corners.
In a few words, that&#39;s the latest &quot;compact SUV&quot; from Mercedes-Benz, with which the German car manufacturer tried to bring fresh momentum to the market.
It is precisely because of this unconventional content that the introductory campaign of the SUV GLK, available in Mercedes-Benz showrooms from October 17, will be surprising and unusual.
Because the advertising campaign accompanying the introduction of the new vehicle uses a hitherto unknown media communication tool, including utopian 3D posters, the likes of which no car brand has ever used in Italy.
The billboard action, which consists of three stages, will dominate Milan&#39;s central shopping street, Corso Como, until November 15.
The first stage of the mentioned new type of media communication begins with the three-dimensional presentation of the car, in the framework of which the new SUV will be seen in almost real size and three-dimensional form with the help of special glasses distributed around Corso Como.
The viewer of the picture will have the feeling that the car stands out from the poster.
After that, thanks to the innovative Elumina8 technology, every detail of the new GLK becomes visible one by one, and then comes together into a unified image.
There is no doubt that with this promotion, Mercedes is trying to introduce something new into the stereotypical advertising world of the automotive industry.
Will this succeed in arousing the interest of prospective customers? We&#39;ll see.
We show you who the Italian football hooligans are
Young people from Triveneto. They will probably be banned from the tracks.
But who are these 150-200 boys and girls, because of whom the whole of Italy is now ashamed? They are members of a group called &quot;Ultras Italia&quot;, which has been following the national team for years and which, to be fair, hasn&#39;t caused too much trouble so far.
They never clashed with opposing fans.
The core of the group is right-wing.
The main organizers come from Trivento.
Also from Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
They were joined in Sofia by smaller sporadic groups (actually only a few units) coming from Campania and Puglia.
They waved Italian flags with the fans&#39; hometowns on them: these were taken down on Saturday so they could not be identified.
They follow the example of English fans.
In Bulgaria, they faced a real Nazi supporter team, the Levski fans.
The Italian Football Association made 144 tickets available to Italian fans. These were personal tickets, making it easier to check the fan base.
The Ministry of the Interior also checked everyone: among those preparing to go to Sofia, there was no one who was being prosecuted, no one who had been banned from visiting the stadium.
Four Italian fans, who own Prius related to soccer, were denied tickets and exits.
Currently, the Ministry of the Interior is waiting for the reports from the Sofia police, then it will take the necessary measures: fans who were arrested or identified during the riots can be banned for up to five years.
It is an international ban that applies not only to visits to Italian stadiums, but to all stadiums in Europe.
So our football hooligans cannot set foot on any football field.
Fortunately.
But we also have to worry that the hooligans will find followers, that is, that these barely one hundred and fifty people will be joined by others.
&quot;This fire must be extinguished immediately, and those who behave in this way must not be excused,&quot; the Ministry of the Interior announced.
So it&#39;s better to keep our eyes open, especially as the day of the national team&#39;s match on Wednesday in Lecce approaches.
A small cell supporting the Italian ultras operates in Puglia.
Tomorrow, the Monitoring Service will meet, and on Tuesday, the Committee for Analyzing the Security of Sports Events, which can count on a department of the internal security service, the secret services dealing with fan behavior.
&quot;Duce-Duce chants and swinging arms during the Italian national anthem? Not a crime in Bulgaria...&quot;
This idea was expressed, in a rather unfortunate way, by Domenico Mazzilli, who was appointed a few weeks ago to head the monitoring service of the Ministry of the Interior (the post was held by Francesco Tagliente and before that by Felice Ferlizzi).
Prior to this, Mazzilli was the police chief of Trieste, the city where a cell supporting the Ultras Italia group has been operating since 2002.
What Mazzilli claims is true, it is not forbidden to support Duce in Bulgaria, but the behavior of those 150-200 fans was still shameful.
I am not a sociologist, added the first person of the monitoring service, but crimes must be judged in the country where they were committed.
So far this group has not caused any problems. We need to examine exactly what happened and consider how to proceed.
But let&#39;s also talk a little about whistling the Italian national anthem: it&#39;s not a crime either, but, if I may say so, it can&#39;t be called well-mannered either...&quot;
Students suffer from expensive rental fees, a room can cost up to 900 euros
The market for accommodation for university students is not affected by the crisis.
According to the latest survey by Sunia, the Tenants&#39; Union, a student can pay up to 900 euros for a single room in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
&quot;The phenomenon has now reached such amazing proportions that - due to the huge total costs falling on families - large sections of students are excluded from the opportunity to learn,&quot; explains Laura Mariani, head of Sunia&#39;s study office. &quot;The high demand from students in these cities has distorted the market to such an extent that a general process of price increases has started for local residents as well.&quot;
In the majority of cases, the real estate offers also contain a series of irregularities: unregistered contracts without rent restrictions, with linked subleases.
According to Sunia, an extraordinary measure would be needed that would create an opportunity to maximize prices through the revision of the taxation system.
The details of the survey reveal that 450 euros are asked for a bed in the Brianza area of Milan; the price of a single room ranges from 650 euros (Bande Nere area) to an average of 800 euros (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera), but can reach 900 euros (Vittoria area).
In Florence, a bed costs on average 350/400 euros, a room about 700.
In Bologna, where the majority of students live in the area close to the university, a bed costs 250/280 euros for a double room and 370-500 euros for a single room.
In Rome, in areas close to the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) they charge around 600 euros for a bed in a single room and 450 for a double room.
Prices are slightly cheaper (€550 for a single room) around the other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
You can save a bit in the suburbs: a bed costs 300 euros and a single room costs 450 in Prenestina, Centocelle and other similar districts.
In Naples, they ask for 300/450 euros for a bed, from 400 to 600 euros for a room. Prices are highest around Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, you have to pay 250/350 euros for a bed, and at least 350 for a single room.
In smaller cities, the prices are lower in absolute terms, but they represent a greater weight within the city budget.
In cities such as Perugia, where students from outside the EU often look for accommodation, another anomaly can be seen: the rent charged to foreign students is about 25-30 percent higher than that of Italian tenants.
Goodbye good old Cinema Paradiso, the days of the old cinemas in the cities are over
Traditional cinemas are closing in favor of multiplexes.
&quot;A city without cinemas is a blind city, like a face without eyes&quot;.
The pictures made by the director Giuseppe Tornatore effectively present everything that takes place in the Italian cities, but also in the rural regions.
The displacement of cinemas - the emergence of large, multi-screen cinemas in the suburbs, and the consequent decline of single-screen cinemas in city centers - is a seemingly inevitable and irreversible process, but at the same time it bears all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
When places full of history and memories disappear, &quot;it&#39;s like losing a friend, an acquaintance with whom we shared our journey and many experiences,&quot; says the director of Cinema Paradiso. The film, which twenty years ago won Tornatore an Oscar and the grand prize of the Cannes festival, tells the lyrical story of a small-town cinema, the yearning for a cinema experience that may have been lost forever.
The data provided by Anec, the largest association of operators, speaks clearly: 316 traditional movie theaters have closed in the last five years. Cinemas in big cities recorded the biggest losses: 10 movie theaters closed in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
The most affected regions are Emilia-Romagna, which lost 82 single-screen cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And that the rise of multiplexes is responsible for their disappearance, there is nothing better than the fact that the number of newly opened multiplex cinemas is the highest in these three regions of Italy: in the last five years, the number of theaters has increased by 195 in Lombardy, by 81 in Tuscany and by the same amount in Emilia - In Romagna.
&quot;The number of units in Italy has increased irrationally,&quot; says Anec president Paolo Protti. &quot;It&#39;s okay to build new facilities, but the survival of the existing ones should also be ensured, because when a city cinema closes, not all passers-by are willing to go to the multiplexes.
Not to mention the unused financial funds intended to support the operators: the state&#39;s overdue debt can be estimated at around 10 million euros.
From an ethical and moral point of view, it is shameful that the government does not comply with the existing legislation.
16-18 million euros per year would be needed to maintain the market&quot;.
The case of Bologna deserves special attention. It is the first Italian city that, in its concern over closures, has decided to remedy the problem through an agreement between the municipality and Anec, in order to protect and boost single-screen cinemas in the outer and inner city.
Provisions would include tax incentives for operators, as well as benefits for the public to promote accessibility: spectators can drive into restricted areas and park at reduced rates in certain parking lots.
&quot;I like this initiative,&quot; says Giuseppe Tornatore, &quot;and I hope that other cities will follow Bologna&#39;s example, even by introducing other measures.
But it is also certain that traditional cinemas, in order to be able to fight the dominance of multiplexes, have to improve the sound and picture quality, because today&#39;s audience is much more demanding.
The preservation of traditional cinema has always been an important issue for me: the closing of the Supercinema in Bagheria - where I spent my childhood and youth - gave me the spark that finally made me make Cinema Paradiso, even though I had been thinking about it for 10 years.
I&#39;ve lived in Rome for 25 years, so when I walk past the closed Rialto or the Quirinale on via Nazionale, I turn my head away to avoid seeing the dust-blackened posters. I had so many experiences here&quot;
Close ties between politics and the &#39;ndrangheta, the mayor of Gioia Tauro was arrested
&quot;Mayor Gioia Tauro supported the interests of the Piromalli clan in municipal decisions&quot;.
The judges of the Anti-Mafia Directorate of Calabria made serious accusations against the mayor and deputy mayor of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and the mayor of Rosarno, Carlo Martelli, who were arrested this morning on charges of external participation in a criminal organization.
Gioacchino Piromalli, the senior mediator between the clan and the public administration, as well as the nephew of the boss, a lawyer with the same name, who was previously convicted for participating in a mafia-like criminal association, was also arrested and fined 10 million euros.
&quot;Disregarding all legal and moral rules, what&#39;s more, good taste,&quot; state prosecutors write. The two local governments expressed their intention to pay a consulting fee to lawyer Piromalli.
&quot;Thus, the clan would have had an official visit to the town hall, which would have given an additional opportunity to control and manage the public administration, which can already be said to be significant.
Agazio Loiero, president of the assembly of the Calabrian region, does not hide that in the region &quot;there is a lot of collusion between local institutions and the organized underworld&quot;: there are areas where the spread of the mafia is stronger than elsewhere, where collusion is almost inevitable.
However, many local politicians are resisting the pressure of the &#39;ndrangheta, they are the heroes who stay clean&quot;.
This morning&#39;s arrests are a continuation of events in July, when the police announced that they had succeeded in killing the Piromalli clan.
At the end of April, the local politicians were released from their duties regarding the administration of the municipality. Gioia Tauro&#39;s municipal committee had already been dissolved once in 1991, again due to alleged links between organized crime and the local government.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, the reigning Christian Democrat mayor at the time of the dissolution, became the leader of the center-right coalition in the second round of 2006.
He cried scandal when the County Hall ordered the dissolution of the local government committee.
He summoned the then Deputy Minister of the Interior, Marco Minnini, to court and accused him of having planned everything with a political goal in mind. But the court said in an arrest warrant signed this morning that the Piromalli clan had gone so far as to demand changes to the A3 project.
The wiretap ordered against Dal Torrione reveals - the state prosecutors write - that &quot;he was willing to comply with the demands of an extensive group of entrepreneurs known to be close to the Piromalli family, and to subordinate the decisions of the municipality to the interests of the clan.&quot;
Energy comes from waves, and now the big ones are coming
An inexhaustible source of energy that covers 70 percent of the planet&#39;s surface and is only now being discovered by major international energy companies
Waves, sea currents, tides are all sources of renewable energy that giants like Chevron have set their eyes on, and are now trying to get their hands on it.
The possibility of obtaining energy from the movements of the sea has been researched for a hundred years. In the 1970s, during the first oil crisis, research intensified.
Around 1980, when the price of crude oil fell, the idea of harnessing marine energy was shelved, but today the demands of environmental protection and the renewed rise in the price of crude oil are giving new impetus to the sector.
According to a 2007 estimate by the London-based World Energy Council (WEC), 15 percent of the world&#39;s electricity needs could be covered by facilities utilizing the waves of the seas.
This amount is twice what is currently produced by nuclear power plants.
In addition, there would be currents and tides.
The giants are on the move.
Enersis was the first company to commit to marine energy, signing an agreement in 2005 for a power plant in northern Portugal.
It seemed like a revolutionary move when the signing was announced.
Two years have passed since then, and more and more companies are voting in favor of marine energy, including those who were committed supporters of traditional energy until now.
&quot;Chevron is studying technologies that utilize ocean energy and is considering the possibility of working with us,&quot; a spokesperson for one of the American oil industry giant&#39;s affiliates told the Wall Street Journal.
The cooperation in question concerns the obtaining of the license issued by the US Energy Commission for the start-up of a marine energy project in Alaska.
The matter is of no small importance, especially if we take into account that the USA is currently extracting crude oil in Alaska, and even President Bush recently launched a plan for further drilling.
In addition to Chevron, New York&#39;s Verdant Power Inc. and New Jersey&#39;s Ocean Power are also following the path of energy extracted from the sea. The amounts invested so far, as far as the details are known, testify to growing interest.
The technology is waiting to be developed.
According to the experts, it is still a rudimentary technology, if only because the energy that can be obtained from the sea does not dispel doubts about the environmental impact.
The facilities that currently exist, similar to those in Portugal or Scotland, are all small in size and therefore do not cause too much of a problem in terms of the ecosystem.
On the other hand, in order to produce energy on a larger scale, facilities with a greater environmental impact are needed.
There are several options: Ocean Power, for example, uses an interconnected buoy system.
The shocks created by the waves and which move the buoys up and down are converted into hydraulic pressure by the pistons and cylinders located in them.
The pressure turns a turbine, which in turn powers a generator.
Electricity reaches the land via cables running under the sea.
There are currently four facilities of a similar nature in the planning stage, which are only awaiting federal approval. Some of the energy produced would be used in a military installation.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, has already started generating energy for a shopping center and a parking lot with the help of six subsea turbines located in New York&#39;s East River Strait.
At high tide, the movement of the water turns the blades of the turbines, and this turning motion powers the generator.
Verdant said it has a long list of partners waiting for permits just to use the energy.
Tide after wave.
Currently, the opportunities that can be exploited through the tides deserve special attention.
Although it is a periodic phenomenon, tides are more predictable than wind, sun, or waves, and therefore can be considered a more reliable source of energy.
New York, Maine and Alaska, along with other coastal states, spent $7.5 million in 2008 just to harness the energy provided by the tides. This amount is expected to increase to 35 million in 2009.
