European inflation on food slips
Accelerating inflation in the euro area is mainly due to the rapid growth of food prices.
The price increase in November was higher than expected in the 13 countries of the eurozone, with an annual inflation rate of 3.1 percent after 2.6 percent in October, the EU’s Luxembourg statistical office reported.
The official forecast was only 3% likely, Bloomberg said.
The European Central Bank (ECB) has not cut the base rate, other than the US central banks in the United Kingdom and Canada, saying that the reduction, along with rising raw material prices and easing unemployment, would lead to the development of an inflationary spiral.
The ECB wants to keep the inflation rate below two percent, but close to that.
According to one analyst, the ECB is trapped in the twenty-second-two: “we need to talk about inflation” so that it does not have to act on this issue later.
In Germany, the 3.3% record in November’s inflation is a twelve-year record, rising to 4.1 in Spain from 3.6.
Eurozone inflation has been high in rising food and energy prices.
The price of wheat has risen by 88 percent, and the price of soybeans has reached its highest level since 1973.
Oil and dairy products were also paid significantly more in 2007.
The world market price of stone oil has risen by 52 percent this year, and last month, a barrel of black gold cost almost 100 dollars.
According to the ECB, inflation will jump from 2.1 percent this year to 2.5 percent in 2008, but will fall to 1.9 percent in 2009.
According to the analysts, the 12-month inflation rate will remain at around 3 percent in the next 3-4 months, but the annual average rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, it is expected that the ECB has lowered interest rates twice in 2008.
Gallup sees a government crisis
Fidesz’s supporters grew significantly by the beginning of December after a long stagnation, so they have the largest camp since 2002, while Gallup has not previously measured such low socialist support of 13 percent.
In the case of certain party voters, the difference – due to the greater determination of the opposition voters – would represent more than two-thirds (71 percent) support of the MSZP against the one-fifth (20 percent) support of the MSZP.
According to the survey, the MDF and the SZDSZ are below the parliamentary threshold: their support within the total population is low.
Among the sure voters of the party voters, the supporters of both camps are one percent more.
The economic sentiment has deteriorated further – it has never been so high, 41 percent of those who considered the economic situation in the country to be particularly bad, while another 46 percent believe that the situation is rather bad.
Families are now pessimistic about the change in their own financial situation after the hopeful prospects in the spring and summer.
For the next year, the majority of the population expects further deterioration and only one-tenth of the population for improvement.
In December, more than in Gallup’s previous survey, 71 percent of the respondents believed that the prime minister is doing his job poorly than well.
In Ferenc Gyurcsány, 13 percent of the respondents trust or trust very much, while Viktor Orbán has 38 percent of the supporters.
Fifty-four percent do not trust the government at all, and 27 percent of the Fidesz president.
One of the indicators of the political situation is how much of the society believes that it is possible to deal with dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister without a change of government.
While 35 per cent of the government and the government were desirable after last October’s riots, at the moment this figure is only 20 per cent, while the relative majority (33 per cent) sees the solution in the call for new elections.
60 percent of the respondents answer the question of the intention to participate in the question, and an additional 20 percent say that they would probably go.
By comparison, only 55 percent would participate in a “now Sunday parliamentary election” and an additional 15 percent would consider their participation likely.
74 percent of the people would say no to the tuition fees, 79 percent for the visit fee, and 84 percent for the hospital daily allowance.
If we look at the same proportions only among those who promise to participate in their participation in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 percent of the voters would reject the introduction of tuition fees, exchange fees and hospital daily allowances.
Auchan is the most expensive, Tesco raised by nearly one-fifth
In the Budaörs trade triangle, hypermarkets maintained an average price increase of 16 percent last year, with the difference that VAT did not increase this year.
The Daily Economy article
The usual Christmas basket of the Daily increased by an average of 16 percent in the Budaörs commercial triangle this year, but in each hypermarket there was an increase of well over a thousand forints in value.
Since prices in the supermarkets were already “getting” in December last year, there was no drastic increase in prices compared to the previous high base.
But it is obviously frightening for consumers that what they could get well under nine thousand forints last year are not even available for ten thousand forints.
The Daily basket exceeded the psychological limit of ten thousand forints with at least 91 forints in the hypermarkets examined.
The highest cart value was HUF 10,573.
(The basket cost 6800 forints in 2003.)
The price of Unicum and the live fish remained almost at last year’s level, but the turkey breast fill, the walnut and poppy seeds also increased strongly.
The data of the HCSO was followed by the price of flour and bread in the shops, although we found a kilogram of bread in Auchan for 139 forints.
The competition did not push the price of the product below 200 HUF.
It was also surprising in this store that the price of the two-liter returnable bottle Coca-Cola was below 200 forints, so even with a deposit fee, they only asked for 257 forints for the product.
However, this year Auchan was the most expensive in the Daily basket, while Cora was the cheapest.
Compared to last year’s Christmas prices, Cora increased the prices in the Daily’s basket by 15 percent, while Tesco and Auchan increased the prices in the Daily basket by 18 percent.
Compared to last year’s most expensive and this year’s cheapest cart value, the difference was 12 percent, while last year’s cheapest and this year’s most expensive is 21 percent.
On average, there was an increase of 1,480 in HUF.
Last year, the average price increase came out to 1,206 forints, so that last Christmas the VAT increase had an effect in the prices.
This process was the process that disrupted the trade, and apparently they could not decide how much margin the stores would use for each product, as they were unable to calculate the impact of the price change on consumption.
(If the dealer unplannss the rotation speed of a product, it can be of great use to the price adjusted to the traffic intensity.)
Due to VAT, the price increase of the Daily’s basket was so steadily last year that the most expensive was 1,720 forints more than in 2006, while the price difference was only 844 forints.
This year, this bulging did not show up, as the current most expensive one was 1,630 forints more than last year, and the cheapest also increased by 1,284 forints.
Compared to the two Christmas seasons, there was a catastrophic price increase, with daily consumer goods in hypermarkets increasing by more than 30 percent in less than 20 months.
(This does not necessarily justify the data of the HCSO: the statistical office has an increase of more than 30 percent in 12 months for some basic foods.
For example, in addition to flour, eggs.)
According to the Daily basket, this seems almost impossible for the latter, as the price level of the product, which is already quite expensive last year, has produced a price increase of just over 10 percent compared to the base in the worst case.
The flour suppliers seem to be in a stronger position than egg users, and they managed to scam the drastic price level increase on the multinationals as well.
In the commercial gold triangle, hypers are not complaining, they are constantly reporting a good year.
In our experience, the majority of buyers are no longer interested in the prices in the three shops visited.
They buy quantity from everything, they carry the durable food in a flatbed.
Wednesday noon in all three stores, serious queues were formed in front of the cash desks, because the number of visitors suddenly increased.
However, as far as we know, the turnover is less in the countryside, and several multinationals complain to the research companies that even the revenue is lower than its plans, and not only in the case of food, but also in the case of durable consumer goods.
In many places, they save on disinfectants
This year, more than 1,000 infections have been reported in hospitals, mainly due to the inappropriate use of antibiotics.
The sanitation conditions of hospitals, the congestion of the beds and the overload of staff are not favorable for stopping infections, according to the head of the department of the National Center for Epidemiology.
In many places, they also save on disinfectants.
Recently, MRSA infection was diagnosed in the traumatology department of the János Hospital.
A man who was injected after a serious accident was diagnosed with antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
The patient was isolated.
There was a similar infection at the beginning of the year.
The injured person in a serious car accident was released from the hospital, but shortly thereafter he had to return with an MRSA infection, and an important operation has not been performed since then due to the bacteria in his body.
By 10 December this year, 1094 hospital infections caused by multi-suspensive pathogens were reported to the National Nosocomial Surveillance System, said Karolina Böröcz, head of department at the National Center for Epidemiology.
This means that so many multi-resistant pathogens have been reported in hospitals, and the rest are not known.
About two-thirds of the infections (683 infections) were caused by MRSA, or methicillin-oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria are carried by one-third of people in their nose without causing the disease.
Infections caused by SA (e.g. pharyngitis, tonsillitis, skin infections, wound infection) respond well to antibiotics and can be cured well.
However, if antibiotics are used excessively or not properly, the bacteria that respond well to antibiotics develops a highly resistant bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics, which spread rapidly in inadequate hospital conditions.
In the case of temporary or persistent malfunction of the immune system, it can cause serious hospital infections such as wound infection or blood poisoning in degraded, elderly or low-weight patients in de minimisation.
According to the medical director of the János Hospital, there is nothing special about the MRSA infection, such infections belong to the daily practice of hospitals.
The infection should not be confused with the epidemic, MRSA is not there, said Tibor Nyulasi, where the presence of the pathogen is not investigated.
Resistant to antibiotics
“We areoling such patients, the nursing staff treats the patient in rubber gloves and masks, and they have the right antibiotics for their treatment,” said Tibor Nyulasi.
Patients admitted to the hospital are already examined to see if MRSA is present in their body, but infection cannot always be avoided.
Sampling is not fashionable
The vast majority of hospital infections caused by MRSA could be prevented, but the current hospital conditions and conditions in Hungary are not favourable for the prevention of the development and spread of multi-resistant pathogens, says Karolina Böröcz.
Since this infection typically occurs in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should monitor patients incoming patients and immediately segregate patients with MRSA.
However, microbiological sampling is not in fashionable in Hungarian hospitals.
This is also due to the fact that the National Health Insurance Fund does not finance these studies.
Most cases will come to light if the patient has a detectable MRSA infection, the chief medical officer of the epidemiology center said.
The European Union has strict recommendations for the proper use of antibiotics in human medicine, and there are also domestic guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and diseases.
It is necessary to make antibiotic therapy targeted, i.e. microbiological studies should be carried out so that there is no resistance to drugs, but hospitals do not always observe this.
Microbiological sampling is even rarer in outpatient and primary care, said Karolina Böröcz.
Saving on disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA most often spreads from one patient to another by mediating medical personnel.
Therefore, hand washing, the use of gloves and masks play a very important role, but there are also significant shortcomings in this in hospitals.
MRSA is spread by droplet infection and contact, but in the domestic hospital conditions it is not always possible to isolate the infected patient.
Moreover, the wards are often crowded, often the beds are very close to each other, although from an epidemiological point of view, patients should be at least 1.5 meters apart.
Unfortunately, it is also happening, said Karolina Böröcz, that in hospitals in unfavorable financial situation, disinfectants are spared, there are few nurses, there are a lot of patients, so they are even more likely to develop infections.
According to Karolina Böröcz, where appropriate precautions are observed, there are demonstrably fewer such infections or the further spread of the pathogen can be stopped.
Government program against MRSA
Treatment of MRSA infection causes huge costs for health insurers, so they fight it everywhere.
In England, for example, the government included the prevention and reduction of MRSA prevention and occurrence.
The program seems to be successful, and according to the data provided, MRSA infections are showing a downward trend in England.
One of the priorities of the European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) includes the development of multidrug-resistant pathogens (including MRSA) and the prevention of such pathogens caused by hospital infections.
He was not drunk by the police commissioner who caused the fatal accident.
The official expert opinion on the fatal accident caused by the police captain of the 22nd district has been prepared.
It can be ruled out that the police commissioner of the 22nd district, who had recently resigned from his post, who killed a pedestrian on Tuesday, informed Attila Morvai, spokesman of the Budapest Prosecutor’s Office, on Friday after an expert opinion was prepared.
The expert opinion confirmed the initial test result, which has already stopped the former police commissioner not drinking alcohol before sitting behind the wheel.
The head of the XXII. district police station hit the 55-year-old man in front of him on Tuesday in Kossuth Lajos Street in the XXII. district with his own passenger car, who did not want to cross the road at the designated pedestrian crossing.
(This is the latter, so that the pedestrian did not cross the zebra crossing, is not a mitigating circumstance based on the rules of the Highway Code, and the turning motorist must give priority even then.)
The pedestrian died after being taken to the hospital.
As a result of the incident, the district police chief resigned from his post and asked for his retirement, according to the police, because the incident was so shocked.
The case is being investigated by the Budapest Investigative Prosecutor’s Office.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former police commissioner had cooperated with the prosecutors conducting the investigation from the beginning.
Another 400 million euros for infrastructure
Minister of Finance János Veres and Vice-President Marta Gajecka, the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed three credit line agreements worth a total of 400 million euros, in support of education, transport and environmental infrastructure, as well as energy, in Budapest on Friday.
The European Development Bank (EIB) approved a budget of EUR 300 million in 2006 to finance the Hungarian budget of transport and environmental projects financed by the Cohesion Fund, of which 100 million of which have already been concluded by the parties, and the contract signed now is about the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
The EUR 150 million loan agreement also serves the budget financing of projects related to education.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for this purpose for this purpose, and the remaining EUR 150 million can be used later, with the extension of the loan agreement.
In the field of innovation, the parties signed a contract of 50 million euros, which is primarily used by the budget for the research and development project of the University of Debrecen.
Metro 4 was also discussed at the meeting.
They agreed that when Hungary finalises the details of the financing of the metro with the EU, they will return to whether and how to modify the original contract.
According to János Veres, this can take place in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed 113 projects in Hungary with a total of 8.4 billion euros.
The interest rate on loans is provided by the EIB with a capacity of 8 years and without a maintenance commission.
Bulgaria is the real estate paradise of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is amazing - the whole of Europe is focused on the previously mentioned Balkan country.
What, where and who are buying in the EU’s cheapest but fast-growing market?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The most popular real estate purchase destination in Eastern Europe is now undoubtedly Bulgaria, with cheap ski resorts and coastal houses.
Among the mountains are the most fashionable areas of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa, and on the coast Albena, the "Golden Coast", "Supplementian", the ancient Sozopol and Nessebar, but more and more people are also looking for real estate in the Kavarna and Balchik districts.
According to Re/Max Bulgaria analysts, sooner or later the central part of the country will also arouse the interest of investors – such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna – and more and more people are also shopping in the extremely cheap Rusi area.
The capital, Sofia, also offers attractive opportunities, and the commercial and office spaces promise the highest return.
Bulgaria is on the right track to become one of the most attractive European golf paradises, so in addition to the summer and winter seasons, it will be a high destination for the other two seasons.
Forward-sighted investors are already buying large, for example in the Bansko area.
According to analysts, those who buy real estate in Bulgaria are also striving to change their lives and lifestyles.
Most of the customers are English, but they come from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more from Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot investors are also present, and there are traditionally many Russian buyers in the Black Sea and ski resorts.
Foreign buyers can be divided into three groups, says Georgi Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
The settlers either buy refurbished properties at prices between 50,000 and 100,000 euros, or degraded old houses for 5,000 to 15,000 euros, and then they will be renovated.
They require good accessibility and communication facilities, it is important for them to have a big city, shops and the proximity of the local doctor in general.
The second category is for holiday shoppers (Bulgaria was added to the list of the first 10 German holiday destinations in December).
The third group is business-oriented investors who buy in the hope of medium- or long-term value growth.
The price of real estate in the capital is continuous, as the demand is increasing.
Bulgaria has the lowest house prices in the European Union, but they have grown by 21% in the last five years.
The rise in property prices is basically higher than the increase in salaries.
Fodor and the six Hungarian percentages
According to Gábor Fodor, Minister of Environment and Water, the meeting of experts will be completed on Tuesday, and on Wednesday, following the official opening ceremony, the negotiations of the international climate regime after the ministers will continue with the negotiations of the ministers.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world are discussing the Bali Roadmap, which provides for efforts to reduce emissions under the Kyoto Protocol until 2012.
This is currently being debated between developing and developed countries.
The United States has also indicated that it does not currently intend to negotiate exact figures, although it is inclined to agree to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25 to 40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990.
Another big question at the conference is whether developed countries undertake, in addition to reducing emissions, to provide both financial and technological assistance to countries in need.
An agreement was also reached on subsidies to developing countries.
The funding fund, which is provided for in the Kyoto Protocol, will be managed by a 16-member board of directors, expected within the United Nations Global Environment Fund (GEF).
6% of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Minister of Environment and Water Gábor Fodor supports the EU’s efforts to maintain its flagship role in global climate protection efforts and to facilitate the establishment of a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister explained that the EU will undertake to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent compared to 1990 levels by 2020, regardless of the success of the conclusion of the “post-2012 agreement” and is ready to undertake a reduction of up to 30 per cent if other major developed regions of the world and developing countries are willing to assume commitments appropriate to their responsibilities and capabilities.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that in 1997 the countries joining the Kyoto Protocol set a total target of a 5.2 percent reduction, within which the EU – then 15 member states – assumed minus 8 percent.
The Hungarian obligation is 6 percent greenhouse gas emission reduction compared to the period 1985-87, which Hungary will meet, the Ministry of Environment recalls in a press release.
The stakes in Bali are high, as the long-term international climate policy agreement must be concluded within two years, otherwise its entry into force would surely be postponed after 2012. In this case, the reduction commitments under the Kyoto Protocol would not be immediately followed by another international emission reduction system, which was also highlighted by the IPCC, the International Scientific Panel on Climate Change, which was also highlighted by the IPCC, the UN Nobel Peace Prize-winning international scientific body on climate change.
This would result in a delay in reducing emissions and an unavoidable increase in the Earth’s average temperature above 2 degrees of Celcius, which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irreversible consequences.
The British Army is recruiting on YouTube
Videos of actions in Iraq and Afghanistan are being published on video-sharing by British military units, with which they promote themselves.
The British Air Force (RAF) was first redesigned for YouTube: special forces operating in Afghanistan have been uploading videos of their actions against the Taliban since March 2006, the BBC reported.
These miniature, helmet-mounted cameras are inspected at the Kandahar Operation Commander of the Air Force, and then sent to London, where they are uploaded to the Internet by the Hungarians.
The political message is inevitable.
Air Force soldiers have already recorded 139 recordings on the Internet in this form, and more than 75,000 people have viewed their “channels.”
The British Ministry of Defence, registered as “defenceheadquarters” in the spring of 2007, will publish videos of actions in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the British Commonwealth Office (Commonwealth Office) and the Iraqi International Peacekeeping Forces (MNFIs) have their own YouTube channel.
Operation in Afghanistan
According to the Air Force’s original intention, he posted the videos for recruitment purposes, and according to the Ministry of Defence, this is also good for acquainting the public with the real purpose of the military’s foreign presence.
Propaganda in this form does not cost almost anything compared to traditional television recruitment advertising, Defense expert Gordon Mackenzie told the BBC, but it inevitably carries some political message, as it proves in a specific form the legitimacy of the military actions decided by the government.
Americans have made a game.
The army is also a problem that, in addition to the carefully edited, censored recordings, amateur videos are also uploaded to the share, which, for example, also depict the death of soldiers: in the somewhat hypocritical, "official" propaganda films, officers only talk about the losses, but do not show the bloody side of the fight.
A number of videos from the Iraqi and Afghan theatres have already been released on the Internet, but the British army has only recently received it.
Americans are recruiting a little differently, with the free-down game called America's Army, in which the player can play as a more or less realistic simulation.
There will be a rampage and sconing Christmas at the ministries
Labour Minister Mónika Lamperth does not seem to be sentimental: instead of a Christmas party, she will hold a year-end workshop for her colleagues, who will be able to thank them from 2007 with scones and coffee.
There are some ministries where there will be a live music party, elsewhere with raffle and toasting, they conjure up a Christmas mood in the hearts of officials.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet - so the power is fun.
State offices are also preparing for Christmas.
The largest ministerial Christmas party will be held by the Ministry of Defence this year, but HM is not waiting for the ministry’s employees.
At the Christmas of the Orphans, children of the fallen soldiers will receive gifts, at Missionary Christmas they will host the families of soldiers currently serving in foreign missions, but they will also hold a press reception.
The ministry will spend 25 million on the end-of-year atmosphere.
The National Development Agency (NDA) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (GKM) are firing the harness compared to the other portfolios.
GKM’s party will be held in the House of the Future, with a total of HUF 4,320,000, and approximately three hundred and fifty guests are expected from the ministry’s employees.
At the ceremony of the ministry, they will insist on the Christmas mood, but there will be performers and a raffle will also be drawn.
The Christmas of the NDA cost HUF 4,700,000, and it was held in the building of the National Council for the Judiciary (OIT) on Wednesday – concerts and dinners.
The room rental cost one million forints, the rest of the more than four hundred guests were spent.
As far as we know, one of the departments of the NDA is also official for another Christmas celebration: this is being organized by a tender management company, the Hungarian Economic Development Centre, with EU money.
For the purpose, the building of the Comedy Theatre was rented.
The information was not confirmed at MAG Zrt., as we have not been able to reach the competent person.
I don't need a suit
The building of the OIT hosted not only the NDA, but also the Ministry of Justice and Law Enforcement, which organized a Luca-day ball on 7 December instead of Christmas.
He did not ask for money from them for using the OIT rooms.
Five hundred people attended the ball.
The party started with the minister’s toast, and after dinner you could dance to the forepic of the music.
In response to a question from [origo], it was not mandatory at the ball for the evening dress or the suit.
The Ministry of Health, Labour and the Ministry of Health is scheduled for a Puritan party.
The Ministry of Health organizes a show and a ceremony for the employees in its own building for 400,000 forints.
Mónika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, officially, is not officially waiting for a Christmas party, but for a workshop at the end of the year.
They expect one hundred and eighty guests, who, the press department said, will only receive coffee and scones, so they will get the party out of 350,000 forints.
Gordon Bajnai, the local government minister, on the other hand, will simply toast with his colleagues in the hall of the Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) organizes a Christmas gathering in its own large hall, for which 436 employees are expected.
2,500 HUF per guest is allocated to the Christmas party – the amount includes a buffet reception and a toast.
Since János Veres, the minister, the employees of the PM have been celebrating Christmas every year.
However, there will be no party atmosphere, the officiality will be strengthened not only by the ministerial speech, but also by the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture will give a New Year’s reception on 20 January, and the Ministry’s Christmas will be cancelled.
The reception will be held in Vajdahunyadvár, in the City Park, and according to the ministry, 1000 forints per hundred guests will be allocated each.
According to the press department, this will be a very simple standing reception, which is only official for foreign diplomats accredited for Hungary.
These annual receptions begin with a short ministerial greeting and end with a moderate snack.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Education and Culture will not have a Christmas party at all, the Ministry of Education and Culture told [origo] in the relevant press departments.
The price of the Ministry of the Environment’s Christmas could not be determined in the press department.
In any case, more than four hundred people were invited to the party, which will be held in the Museum of Applied Artists.
The forces of the giant strike are gathering.
On Friday, the League Trade Unions and the National Federation of Workers’ Councils will form their strike committee coordinating the indefinite strike on Monday.
A protest rally will be held on Saturday, and on Monday, the day of the final vote on the Health Insurance Act, the work stoppage will begin.
The action will surely cause significant disruption in transport, as rail transport will almost stop, and they will strike at BKV until 1 p.m.
On Friday afternoon, the League will present the details of the strike organized by the League Trade Unions in cooperation with the National Federation of Workers’ Councils on Monday.
The LIGA-MOSZ strike committee will also be established, which will coordinate Monday’s actions.
A protest rally will be held on Saturday, and from Monday, the organizations joining the strike will cease the work indefinitely if they cannot reach an agreement with the government.
This means that the date of the end of the strike on the day of the parliamentary vote on the health insurance law was not set for the end of the strike.
If the National Assembly does not adopt the health insurance law, the trade unions will immediately withdraw the call for strikes.
If, on the other hand, they vote for the law, then the strike committees will meet and decide on the continuation.
Based on the agenda of the National Assembly on Monday, it is also possible that the health insurance law will only be voted on in the late evening, or even at night.
Due to the strike starting on Monday, significant disruptions can be expected in transport: the work at the railway will be stopped indefinitely, and a part of the public transport in Budapest, more than half of the Volán companies may stop in the morning.
At the same time, there will be a half-track road closure in many parts of the country.
The strike was joined by a number of trade unions and NGOs, the list of which is constantly updated on the League’s Hoday.
Some organizations have declared a strike for an indefinite period of time, while others have declared temporary work stoppages.
Until Thursday afternoon, MÁV and the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (VDSZSZ) could not even agree on sufficient services, despite the fact that more and more people are travelling by rail as the Christmas holidays approach.
According to reports so far, the Trade Union of Teachers and the Democratic Trade Union of Teachers (Grazers) and the Democratic Trade Union of Teachers and Teachers are on strike between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m. at Budapest Airport between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m.
The Hungarian Medical Association strikes nationally, at shifted times, and the Democratic Trade Union of Workers in the Health and Social Sector (EDDSZ) of the SZEF holds a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands formulated by the League is that the government withdraws the proposal on the reform of health insurance and to issue a new concept for a social debate.
The second demand is to gradually introduce a new method of calculating pensions due from next year.
The third is that early retirement is granted the possibility of getting into the system for the jobs that deserves it before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is that the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (VDSZ) belonging to the League of Trade Unions does not accept the offer of the Ministry of Economy and Transport for the railway wing lines, and expects a different offer.
Political Capital: the Hungarian Guard increased the country’s risk
The activities of the Hungarian Guard, founded in August this year with the support of the Jobbik Movement for a Better Hungary, increased the political risk of Hungary and the region in several respects, according to the Risk Analysing Division of Political Capital.
In its “risk warning”, the company wrote that the biggest political risk in connection with the activities of the Hungarian Guard is that “with the escalation of ethnic tensions between the already existing ethnic tension between the Hungarian Gypsy and non-Gypsy populations, even in the short term, violent ethnic clashes may develop”.
The main reason for this is that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard is likely to be aimed at provoking such an act, the research institute added.
As they wrote, all this can be traced back to one of the main omissions of Hungarian political actors: “the public debate on the Roma issue was handed over to representatives of radical and extremist political groups, who could build a political strategy for the Roma-Hungarian conflict”.
This deepens the problem, makes normal dialogue impossible, strengthens extremists, and increases the likelihood of violent conflicts.
In addition, according to the research institute, the activities of the Hungarian Guard “caused the great domestic and international media attention, it has significantly deteriorated the image of Hungary abroad, especially in terms of the country’s stability and democratic development”.
They recall that from the autumn of 2006 onwards, part of the reorganization of radical and far-right groups in Hungary, which received increasing publicity and impetus, has been transformed into more and more publicity and far-right extremist groups, that from the summer of 2007 several organisations, which calls itself a “national self-defense” association, have been established in Hungary.
“The common feature of these groups is to define themselves as an NGO, while openly proclaiming the preparation of their members, including armed, for defence (disaster protection, defence, law enforcement) tasks, moreover, citing the inadequacy of the police, the army, i.e. the state,” they added.
They noted that all this is done in accordance with the method that seeks to put various political aspirations into a civil guise based on the anti-political and anti-party nature of society.
The emphasis on civility and the form of association are therefore not only used to avoid legal pitfalls in these associations, but also to avoid legal pitfalls in the case of civil society.
According to the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are also a risk-increasing factor for neighbourhood relations.
“In recent months, the Hungarian Guard is a potential source of danger in several neighbouring countries, and the ultranationalist political actors of some neighbouring countries want to justify their own anti-Hungarian policy on the grounds of the establishment of the Hungarian Guard.
This has an impact on the political stability of the region,” he added.
According to the research institute, the establishment of the Hungarian Guard is not a unique phenomenon in Central and Eastern Europe, so political risks have increased for the region as a whole.
The operation of the Hungarian Guard is similar, for example, to the activities of the Bulgarian National Guard, the establishment of which was announced by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU) in August 2007.
The Bulgarian guard’s formation is due to the mass Roma riots that broke out in a quarter of Sofia (Kracna Poljana).
BNU took advantage of this to decide on the establishment of the guards, saying that the organization’s goal is “national self-defense”.
In the past 17 years, Bulgaria has experienced a “Gypsy terror”, but the state has remained inactive and indifferent, according to Political Capital.
They added that the initiative sparked a heated debate in the Bulgarian public.
The increase in the risk of ethnic clashes is indicated by the fact that some Roma organizations in Bulgaria have announced that they will set up their own guards as resistance.
Since the operation of the Hungarian Guard so far shows similarities with the operation of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be ruled out that the Roma in Hungary react to the threat in the same way, by organising their own self-defense, according to the risk warning of Political Capital.
Attila Juhász, director of research at Political Capital, told the telegraph office that risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, they publish their risk analysis every year, and if they experience something that could have an impact on the change in risk, they will inform the public, as in this case by issuing a risk warning.
The holiday is not in red letters everywhere.
In Hungary, the law accurately marks the red-letter days, and around the holidays the working day reorganization has become a common practice, of which there will be fewer next year.
The holidays in the EU and America are not uniform.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between a national and state holiday and a public holiday.
Public holidays are mostly related to church holidays and eminent historical events.
We also celebrate the New Year: both the last and the new first day of the old year are both a holiday - the latter is just so that New Year's Evers can rest.
We have 11 red-letter holidays all year round.
The National Day is also the memorial day of March 15 and October 23, the Memorial Day of the 1956 Revolution.
On the 20th of August we celebrate the foundation of the state, on 1 May the work, and on the 1st and 2nd of November we commemorate our deceased relatives and friends.
In addition, a two-day holiday is Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
Since our state, national or religious holidays rarely fall on the weekend according to the calendar, it has become a practice in the case of a work-working day shift in cases where we would only work for one day before or after the red-letter holiday.
It is true that the price of extended weekends is that we will not stay away from work and school on the previous Saturdays.
The exact date before or after the holiday must be worked out for many years has been regulated by the Minister of Labour in a separate decree.
The law extends to all employers and the employees they employ, both civil servants and those in the civil service relationship.
However, it does not affect service companies and institutions operating uninterruptedly and operating on public holidays as a result of its intended purpose.
This year, the work schedule will only change around the end-of-the-year holidays: from 24 December, life will almost stop in the country, as experience shows that the days between Christmas and New Year’s Eve will be “slid down” by the majority of people, or use their saved holidays for this purpose.
Next year we will have more holidays in the middle of the week and at the end, so there will be less workday relocation than this year.
First, the calendar is transformed around the celebration of work, so that the workers can stay at home for four days.
Saturday, April 26, will be a working day to rest on Friday, May 2nd.
The other relocation is related to the 23rd October holiday: on Saturday, October 18, instead of the 24th of Friday.
However, the end of the year may be completely spent next year in the spirit of the holiday, as from the 24th of December a non-stop break will be held almost everywhere, even if it falls on New Year’s Eve.
Six deterrent things to annoy your colleagues
E-mails that we forget to send, voicemail messages, which we never receive, are innocent lies that we hardly even notice: they “color” everyday life at work.
The question is whether you get used to the little inconveniences or take up the glove and consciously avoid the misunderstood situations that cause others to be annoyed.
Tips.
“Sorry, I forgot to tell you that you were looking for me from the marketing department,” one of your colleagues said.
That you missed a meeting?
At best, you regret and resent the matter, or call the marketing department to tell you that you forgot to give the message (this is a less common solution).
Most of the time, it's done with an apology.
Before you make an embarrassing apology, it’s worth thinking about what you can do to get unpleasant moments for your colleagues and consciously strive to avoid it.
You borrow something that's not yours?
There's nothing more annoying than reaching for a document, office supplies or your phone, and it's nowhere.
Do you remember that you put your stapler on the table yesterday, but by morning, did you get your feet?
Do you discover your lost pen on one of your colleagues’ desks?
Don't take anything away from your colleagues without asking, because they'll be rightly angry with you to get rid of their property.
Don’t pocket office envelopes, post-it, because it can be embarrassed if you run out prematurely, and you need it immediately.
Are you messing with your colleagues' personal lives?
There is no good way to stop the rumors.
Who, with whom, what did he do?
Where and why?
Tell your information (presues) about the private life of your colleagues, don’t tie it to everyone’s nose.
If one of you shares your innermost secrets with you, don’t abuse your trust.
Bury the things they hear within you, and in your absence, don’t discuss it with your co-workers, even if others know about your colleague’s behavior.
You're calling indisapencyly in sick?
When you call into the office and you call in the office and call in sick with a splintering headache, because you have a bad feeling of being well-being, or you feel that you would rather relax that day; think about that your work, your work, your timely work should be done for you.
Don't mess with your colleagues.
If you know in advance that you won’t go to the office the next day, or something might come up with to stay home, let’s signal that your colleagues and your boss don’t face your absence the next day.
Dudging, giggling, talking, calling
You got a deep pituiter for work, but is it that the co-workers' giggling are pulling you out of it?
Unintentionally you have witnessed a phone conversation that would have been better not to hear?
Do not disturb your co-workers with bulges, singing, loud conversation (which you continue above their heads), nor with foot-throwing, constant swearing, loud dissatisfaction.
These can all be confusing, even if they don’t get into a project (writing, planning, organization).
Do you blame others for mistakes?
If there is no time, you have forgotten to send an important letter or message, do not blam us for your forgetfulness.
Don't refer to the chaos that might prevail in the office, your noisy colleagues.
Admit it if you made a mistake, and someone else has a disadvantage and eliminate the damage.
Ask him how to make up for your mistake, to make up for the omission.
Do you feel too at home in the office?
Bear pants and slippers: comfortable to wear a home, but not suitable for the office!
Don’t wear comfortable leisure clothes if your job allows.
Don’t be sloppy, your colleagues, and honor yourself by going into the office in everyday clothes, if your job requires you, pretty and elegantly.
If you want to meet, you're not interesting anymore
Harassment with the car in the usual morning traffic jam.
From the radio there is a special melody: the voice of a violin, which is accompanied by electronic effects.
I'm gonna roll the volume up.
The music changes tempo and the bass arrives next to the previous tones, and then as a real jewellery, a female choir joins in.
Zagar's Wings of Love is on mr2.
For a long time, the Hungarian music scene did not spoil us with high-quality electronic pop.
But now it looks like the traffic jam is quite different if you listen to the new Zagar record.
Yonderboi’s appearance, some new and exciting productions coming up from the Hungarian digital underground slowly change the overall picture, and despite the fashionable garage rock with guitar-boosting, the Hungarian electropop also proves that there is a new one under the Sun.
Balázs Zságer started from Pécs and himself played in Yonderboi’s band, until – perhaps because two bagpipes could not fit in a tavern – he took his own path.
With his project (Zagar) and his music, which combines elements of jazz, electronic dance music, pop, but he began to break through when film-engine soundtracks were asked to be composed (e.g.
Turkish Ferenc Season).
The bands, who initially played in smaller clubs, were introduced to a wider audience when wan2 magazine listed their first album in 2002 as one of the fifty most important Hungarian albums, and Zagar, together with Yonderboi, declared them the almost unique Hungarian trend-forming, which seemed marketable in the West.
Undoubtedly, Zagar and her band became "trendi", but of course no one asked them if they liked to bear the label.
The band reacted as they should: they made a new, better album.
The now-released Cannot Walk Fly Instead can open up new avenues for them, although the title itself wants to create continuity with the initial years of Pécs.
This was one of Balázs Zságer’s old bands there.
We would be on the airborne, flying reference, but in addition to the airiness of the music, the influence of the louder guitar, rock and roll, has just appeared, in accordance with the spirit and trend of the time.
In these songs, György Ligeti, a singer currently working with The Puzzle in England, showed himself at the Millenáris premiere of the album.
The album also produced a real radio hit, the mr2, who played popular music from morning to night, started to smuggle into the ears the great melodies of Wings of Love with the six Hungarian singers ("Underdic Divas").
So everything is okay (?).
Hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new hit song now raises the question: how much layered music you play has remained?
Balázs Zságer: The definition of layer music does not mean too much to me.
I think there are two types of pop music castes; it is not mainstream and underground, it is not alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
The so-called alternative, underground music can also be flat, meaningless and can be prepared for sale in the same way, which makes them commercial.
But it can also come from a good pop song from a sincere motive.
The attitude of the host also works in this spirit, regardless of language and national borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of Hungarian and foreign audiences to music?
Zs.B.: There are greater traditions of popular music abroad, especially to the west of us.
There, not only the tteen-twenties-old age group attend concerts, but also the older ones.
Rather, they are following the changes in popular music around them, because they also consider it part of contemporary culture.
HVG: What is the role of the audience in your work?
Does it matter who, where, how many people listen to your music?
Zs.B.: Of course, it feels good that more and more people go to our concerts.
But we never made music for the market.
Music is not born for a purpose, but for some reason.
The role of the audience is more noticeable at the concerts, where the influence of each other already works, but this only lies in the elusive changes of the moment.
Still, I noticed that if you wanted to meet the audience, you're no longer interesting.
hvg.hu: How much do you plan to follow Yonderboi’s example?
He works solo and built his career further west.
Zs.B.: We don’t really go his way, regardless of the fact that they sometimes try to explain it into our music.
We are more of a team player who trusts in the presence of the other person and let it unfold.
At first, of course, it was inevitable that our works were compared to Yonderboi’s music, as many of us left their band and set off on a different path.
hvg.hu: The Wings of Love was ranked first on the mr2’s top list.
Many people first heard the name Zagar.
Are you consciously open to a wider layer with a more popular style?
Zs.B.: We didn’t have a plan to write a hit, and then we sell the album with it.
This song is about more.
It was intended to be the finale of the album, with which we tried to dissolve the so far-reaching vocal orgies and the more difficult themes.
HVG: How did you choose the six singers?
Why them - what was the guiding principle?
B.B.: The idea was to have a gospel-like choir.
Then came the idea of putting this choir together from the good-sounding soloists of our own Hungarian music scene.
This is how the six-member choir – i.e. Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikő Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh – came together, which was then called Underground Divas.
HVG: Is this how the girls planned or played the song on it?
B. Zs.: The song has existed in an instrumental version for a long time, and when the album material came together, we thought that something else would be needed for this song.
The chord march attracted the sedative to make it.
That night I sang the melody that the girls later learned.
It all came almost the first time and frighteningly spontaneously.
I remember it was very thrilled at the time, but of course it required the Divas.
It wouldn't have worked so strongly with my voice.
hvg.hu: Both on the album and at the concert, the girls seemed to be in the background.
There are no solos (except Judy Jay’s short solo), they don’t have their own roles, they sing completely together and aren’t louder than the music, so music doesn’t just accompany their singing.
They were back on the stage.
Is that intentional?
B.B.: The fact that they were standing in the back was just because of technical problems.
But it is clear that we did not want to give solo roles.
This is what the number is about to forget a little about our ego, who came from, where where he is going, just let those wings, the wings of love, let those wings raise us.
I wanted others to feel the euphoric state we felt when the song was born.
Q. Which of which was the most work?
B. Zs.: In the case of the musical creative process, there were not really any pieces that were heavier than mixing.
For example, Dorian Gray's Dilemma, in which I play a tournament piano, or Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where groove didn't want to work for a long time, and then slowly everything took its place, like a puzzle game.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite song from the new album?
Zs.B.: This is constantly changing with the concert and by “leting” the album.
Now is Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never the Same.
The traitorous broker risked billions because of a sense of inferiority
It's an unfaithful embezzle.
The owner of the Czech Commercial Bank, the French bank giant Sociéte Générale, calls his former employee, Jerome Kerviel.
Kerviel lost almost five billion euros.
However, it seems that Kerviel was rather a great player who wanted to catch up with his colleagues.
Unlike other banks, he recognized the crisis in the U.S. mortgage market in time.
"He has a defiant mental ability," he said to his superiors who informed the police.
However, as the Frenchman Le Monde reported, Kerviel’s testimony reveals that at the end of last year he made a profit of 1.6 billion euros from his stores.
Crisis not just in America
"I just wanted to make money for my bank," he said in his testimony.
In the summer, he was able to earn half a billion euros in the American crisis.
He felt the opportunity at the beginning of the year.
In February, there were rumors that there would be problems with the so-called subprime mortgages granted to low-income customers or to customers with repayment problems in the past.
However, this crisis should not have a negative impact on the economy.
Kerviel didn't believe that, and he put me on a good horse.
The year-end profit reached 1.6 billion euros.
“When I earned the first half-billion, I didn’t know how to announce it,” Kerviel admits, adding that he didn’t keep anything for himself.
In his testimony, he admits that he falsified his reports in such a way that it could not be revealed.
He also managed to fool his bosses, even when the Eurex stock exchange began to be interested in his trades.
The risk was a profit
Were you afraid everything would come out?
I'd rather not.
“I thought the only fact that I made 1.6 billion for the bank would calm them down.”
Where did he have the will to risk so much?
He gradually reached his position.
After graduating from the University of Lyon, he worked at the Société Générale bank since 2000.
His annual salary was around 51,000 dollars.
Two years later, he was already an assistant broker and became an independent broker in 2005 with an annual salary of 90,000 dollars.
He knew he would never earn as much as others.
“In 2005, during my first conversation, I knew that I was being looked bad.
Because of my education, my professional and personal development,” Kerviel told investigators.
Shortly after his entry, the first great success came.
Allianz made money thanks to its shares, as it was worth half a billion euros to drop these stocks during the London bombings.
And it started an avalanche - he wanted more.
As long as you're looking, we'll leave you alone
"It's like a snowball," he told the police.
But his bosses allegedly knew everything, or rather suspected.
"As long as I made money, they turned a blind eye."
There was a blow at the beginning of the year.
In one day, he lost a billion euros.
He tried to cover it in mid-January on a weekend.
When he went to work on Monday, he stopped working at the bank.
And a few days later, the bank announced that it had lost five billion euros.
And how did they find out?
Because of his freedom, he became suspicious.
“I only took four days in the last year.
A broker who has no freedom is a broker who doesn’t want anyone to get a glimpse into their reports,” Kerviel concluded.
Czech Republic has a chance of acquiring 365 billion
The Czech government’s ministers signed a total of nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, of which the Czech Republic could produce 14 billion euros (approximately 365 billion crowns) in the coming years.
The Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels between 2007 and 2013 is about half of the total amount.
The regions will cost around 125 billion crowns out of seven operational programmes.
Czech companies will be able to earn around 100 billion crowns from the Enterprise and Innovation Programme.
Most of the money, 150 billion crowns, is aimed at transport.
The Transport Program is the largest operating program and represents 22% of the funds available to the Czech Republic.
These funds will increase the state base of the Transport Infrastructure, which will have a population of 90.8 billion crowns next year.
The Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme helps entrepreneurs and companies to win tools for innovation businesses.
The company should also raise funds for the introduction of new technologies, industrial research, but also for the introduction of more efficient organizational methods.
In the benefit of EU funds, the Czech Republic is among the least successful in the newly recruited countries.
Ex-pre-ste-Secret Nicaraguai fined 20 years in prison
The Nicaraguan Court of Fellebence on Thursday approved a 20-year prison sentence for Arnold Alemán, the country’s former president, to which he was convicted in 2003 for financial fraud reaching 100 million dollars (almost 1.8 billion crowns).
He was later released from prison and under house arrest in his hacienda near the capital.
Whether the former leader of this Central American country from 1997 to 2002 will be back behind bars is unclear, according to the AP news agency.
Ileana Perez, the president of the Court of Appeals, said it would depend on the prison’s management whether Aleman’s sentence will be allowed to be served at home or if he would go back to prison.
Four years ago, the court proved to Aleman that he regularly transferred government funds to the accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These fictitious companies and their account numbers belonged to relatives and closest sponsors.
Some of these funds then ended up at a foundation, which Alemán founded to finance his election campaign in 2001.
Approved of our budget
That's right.
The state budget was approved.
What makes this budget special?
This is the first budget drawn up by this government, approved by a coalition majority, without the support of the opposition.
This year, last year, with the support of the Social Democrats, was the support of the Social Democrats, as Minister Sobotka and the Czech Social Democratic Party could not afford to accept the gender.
Unlike the debate before the vote, there was no drama this time.
The House of Representatives has passed this generally ignored, albeit the most influential law.
That's a certain contradiction.
All governance begins and ends with individual chapters and items in the budget, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an essential element of politics, but it is hidden behind the struggles of the powers of the government and the opposition.
This is more grateful in the press, which is why it gets more attention in the media.
Politicians’ debates are more interesting than the mere numbers.
The state budgets of the past Social-Democratic governments suffered three shortcomings, which were in the context of 2008. The annual budget cannot solve it simultaneously:
The first of them is the high proportion of the law on compulsory, so-called principal expenditures, which mean not only pensions, but also social benefits, which were approved last year by the silent "co-altition" of the SSD and KS-M-M before the elections.
The second is the first deficiency to defficulty farming.
The third limit is the deficits of public funding, i.e. the deficits of the budgets of cities and districts.
However, the biggest risk is not the deficit of the state budget.
This is public and relatively controlled.
Time bombs are a deficit in the budgets of cities and districts.
Many mayors can also make money for investments other than money from taxes, levies and bank loans, often issuing bonds that have disproportionately indebted their city halls.
In recent years, these debts have been repaid by the massive sale of the shares of the energy and other distribution networks, which they received from the state from privatizations.
They don't have that kind of source anymore.
If we rely only on official and verifiable facts, we will conclude that:
For a few years now, like the rest of the world, our economy has been going through a growth phase, with which the Czech Social Democratic Party is constantly boasting.
This was a unique opportunity for its governments to put public funding in order.
Instead, the country was increasingly put into debt.
The other countries, with two exceptions, such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, were much more rationally managed in the Czech Republic.
This is primarily a huge disgrace to previous governments.
We belong to countries that are least at risk of poverty on a global scale.
Therefore, for example, there is no need for huge social programs, which, unfortunately, have swelled into a gigantic size in recent years completely unnecessarily.
Although this year’s share of the meaningless populist expenditures approved before the elections have been eliminated this year, even if the retirement line is not extended in the near future, then any policy in this country will actually come to an end, and whoever governs, this will only be an official.
With a little exaggeration, it can be said that most of the money spent from governing politicians usually turn to pensions and social benefits into their mechanical distributors.
Therefore, this year’s budget cannot be revolutionary, but can only stop the displacement of normal expenditure by the client’s expenditure.
The 70 billion deficit planned for 2008 would be completely unnecessary if previous governments had not squandered everything it could have been in the last decade.
If we do not want to make it really possible to become pure officials of the governing politicians, then we must be patient and wished for calm to this not too strong coalition government, which is aware of the fact that the state can only give out as much as it can obtain from taxes and levies.
Only these make it possible to gradually achieve a balanced budget.
Jisí Krej?í
Banks want to solve the crisis.
The Federal Reserve Bank of the United States, the European Central Bank and the UK, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight the crisis in the financial markets.
Financial markets will now cost more than a hundred billion dollars through the stock market.
On these stock exchanges, the interest rate is raised on the bank, for which they are ready to borrow money.
For example, the U.S. Fed is offering 40 billion dollars to the stock market and makes another 24 available to the European and Swiss central banks.
This is the first time since the 11/11/11 attacks that the central banks of each country have agreed on a coordinated procedure to prevent or reduce the consequences of the financial crisis.
“This step should solve the biggest problems of the economy, i.e. the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend,” Bernard Baumohl, a consulting firm for Economic Outlook Group, wrote to his clients in his report.
“The coordinated action of central banks in the United States reduced the likelihood of a recession from 65 percent to about 50 percent,” Baumohl said in a report.
Banks in the United States have already lost 60 billion dollars due to unpaid loans.
Analysts expect more billions of dollars in losses.
“Central banks are really afraid of what could happen if they have decided to do so,” said Kieran Davies, chief economist at ABN Amro.
It seems that the situation is really bad,” he added.
Central banks fear that if the banks themselves have difficulty accessing loans, they will also lend to their customers more expensively.
This would reduce the need and plunge the U.S. economy into recession with the potential consequences of the world’s economic growth.
The central banks decided this way after the failure to reduce the so-called LIBOR, the London interbank supply interest rate, which is used for money lending on the interbank market.
This meant that banks were constantly afraid of mutual money lending, despite the fact that the central banks of the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom had reduced their interest rates a few times in the autumn.
“This will have an impact similar to further interest rate cuts,” Greg Salvaggio told Reuters.
Some analysts do not believe that the action of central banks will contribute to the averting of the crisis, as it does not solve the basic problem, the fall of the U.S. real estate market.
Klaus: Incredible debates of ecologists
Global climate change is the most a threat to developing countries.
President Václav Klaus has re-elected the problem of global warming.
This time he criticized the United Nations Conference on Climate Change in Bali.
His book Blue, presented in Vienna, not the Green Planet, said that ecologists’ debates were incredible.
According to Klaus, not only the structure of the conference is unacceptable, which is made up of a special mixture of representatives of governments and NGOs, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric and reality that accompany it.
“The debate there is absolutely devoid of the structure, it’s just a throwing in words, which are the substitutes for solving the current problems,” Klaus said.
In the presentation of the book of the Czech President, he stressed that it is very important for his topic, which is why he is so committed to this topic.
He expressed his satisfaction that the book is also published in German translation, because, as he said, “I only meet the caricatures of my opinion.”
Now, those interested can read your unfathomed opinion.
Klaus recalled that although he is not a climatologist, he believes he has sufficient basic conditions to write such a book.
As he is able to monitor and assess professional dissertations as an academic experience in statistical secrecy and economist.
In conclusion, the book described as a thesis that the climate is constantly changing, that is, its changes are normal, and all scientists do not agree with the same view of the warming of the planet, that the consequences of the current changes are not too large and serious, so they do not pose a threat, and the efforts to influence climate development are unnecessary, ineffective and unacceptablely costly.
In addition, as a man with experience in the field of totalitarianism, the intrusion of unproven opinions on others find unacceptable, which he perceives as a dangerous restriction of freedom.
In response to questions from those present, he reiterated that “it is not against the rational protection of the environment, but against militant envirethanolism, which does not take into account the relationship between costs and their benefits.”
Klaus had already spoken two months ago at the Hayek Institute in Vienna.
600,000 people were unable to exchange their licenses.
Six hundred thousand drivers missed the deadline and were unable to replace their old driver’s license in time, the validity of which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day to request an exchange so that the offices can issue a new driver’s license in time by the end of the year.
However, the ministry is not afraid that after the new year 100,000 drivers will leave without a valid right.
According to the authorities, the driver’s license was not primarily replaced by those who no longer want to drive.
While districts are a violent drop in interest in driver’s license exchanges, the metropolitan offices have been flooded with requests for driver’s license exchanges, for which interest this week has increased.
The mayor’s office receives about 2,000 clients a day.
We have to wait about half an hour in line.
In Prague, the driver’s license was not replaced by 140,000 drivers.
A new driver's license will take 20 days.
However, the new driver’s license can be applied for with a shortened deadline of five days.
In such a case, however, the driver will have to pay an extra 500 crowns.
Drivers who are unable to complete the mandatory driver’s license exchange by the end of the year and are on their way with an invalid driver’s license will be threatened with a penalty from January.
The culprit will have to pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
However, the police officer may also settle the violation by agreement.
In the case of administrative offences, the penalty is 2500 crowns.
Based on previous information received from the town hall, those who do not travel anywhere can also receive a fine.
It is said that it can pay up to 30,000 kroner.
The ministry had previously called on the offices to be lenient and to impose fines of up to a thousand crowns.
According to a spokesman for the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, tens of thousands of fines, no one is threatened.
According to him, a driving licence is a document where people can decide whether or not they want to.
This is not an identity card that must be valid for everyone.
Those who don't want to drive anymore should give up their license.
It is enough to take it or send it to the appropriate office by post.
At the end of the year, the licenses issued between 1964 and 1993 are no longer valid.
However, drivers must gradually replace the other driving types.
Those with documents from 1994 to 2000 can be replaced for another three years.
The validity of the licences issued between 2001 and 2004 will expire in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, there are about 2.6 million additional documents.
Court Reduces Berdycchel Allied Investigators' Punishment
Josef Opava and Petr Kosazík, who are suspected of collaborating with David Berdych's criminal organization, were sentenced to thirteen and ten years in prison.
The Prague Supreme Court has ruled with final effect, which reduced their sentences by one and the other two years.
Investigators from the Organizational Crime Division in Prague were initially threatened with 14 and 12 years in prison.
Today’s decision can no longer be appealed, a review can only be requested by the Supreme Court.
Although Berdyche is also suspected in this case, he is only waiting for the first-instance verdict.
In other proceedings, he has been sentenced to more than 16 years.
You can't have any more.
In January, the County Court found 19 people guilty of involvement in robbery, of which the Supreme Court today negotiated 16 appeals.
Most of the defendants dismissed the allegations from the beginning of the investigation, saying it was a speculative case.
According to the Senate of the Central Bohemia, after the agreement with Berdycchel, members of the police provided the criminals with information from police sources, covered certain robberies and helped the gang avoid criminal prosecution.
The gang therefore gave 30 percent of the robbery to Opava and Kosazík.
The indictment is about the gang’s crimes between 1999 and 2001.
In particular, these are robberies whose victims have often suffered serious health damage, but also of misuse of civil servants and unauthorised arms.
Because police found illegally holding pistols, steel-core shells, laser sight or submachine guns during searches.
The gang is accused of looting tens of millions of crowns.
The gang, which has only almost 20 members, has been recognized as guilty by the courts of Berdych’s other robberies and many others as well.
Other members of Berdych’s environment testify before the court in other proceedings, and some cases have not yet been brought before the court.
So far, the first-instance trial has avoided Tomás Puta and Marosule, who are in pre-trial detention in Ireland, awaiting a final decision on their discharge to the Czech Republic for their prosecuting.
Account for child exchange: 12 million
For children traded in obstetrics, Igor Veleba, a lawyer for the injured families, demands 12 million crowns of pain from the hospital in T?e?s.
For mothers three million each, fathers two million and children a million.
The hospital offers up to 200,000 per parent.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondeej Dostál Veleba, disagrees fundamentally disagree.
“We reject such a demand because it’s too much,” Dostal said after today’s trial.
“In order to form an opinion on the counter-proposal, we need an expert opinion developed by the opponent.
We determine whether it has any usable value at all.
But we maintain our opinion that this will be measurable for everyone in hundreds of thousands,” Dostál said.
According to him, the four parents should move between 100,000 and 200,000 Ks.
At the beginning of the case, the Jablosov family wanted a million crowns for each month, until he had raised their own biological daughter.
Veleba was responsible for expert criticism of the compensation hearings, which was developed by the Motol University Hospital in Prague.
According to psychologist and psychiatrists, the parents of the children suffered psychological damage and stress of varying degrees and depth.
The stressful situation was better tolerated by men, even if they were reproaching them that they did not prevent the newborn exchange.
Women are worse coping with the actuality of the trauma they have experienced and what is happening right now, summed up the content with Him.
Veronika and Nikola were replaced by nurses in the obstetrics of Bethelí on 9 December.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola ?ermák in P?ibyslavica, Veronika Libor Broca and Jaroslava Trojanova in Jabloov.
At the end of October, the head of the district of Vysina, Milos Vystroil, handed over to families 100,000 crowns to replace their expenses, which were caused by the fault of the hospital in T?ebeké, which is controlled by the district.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic have compulsory damage insurance from the law.
In case of error, they must reach into the reserve fund, in exceptional cases they may request the help of the founder.
So far, the courts have approved relatively low compensation for people, and the amounts have been calculated on the basis of charts of a few hundred thousand, in exceptional cases a few million crowns.
Polive lost his kingdom in Valassko
Bolek Polívka lost the lawsuit for the title of the Kingdom of Valassko.
According to the judge of the district court in Ostrava, although he first used the name of the king of Ostich, the project was developed by a team around Tomás Harabic, who cooperated with the actor, with many years of work.
Poliva did not attend the trial today.
However, according to his legal representative, the case is unlikely to end and the client will appeal.
“The debate is about Mr. Harabic and his team paralysing the popularity of Bolek Polic,” Polívka’s lawyer said after the trial.
According to him, in the words of the kingdom of Valach, everyone thinks of the actor-comedian.
This view is shared by Harabic.
“There’s almost ten years of work behind us.
Searching for money and inventing actions,” he said.
He thinks the reason for the debate is money.
“Yeex, they realized that the project was successful and that they could gain something from it.
They want to be at the forefront of our work,” he added.
Income business
According to the court, the name of the king of Suschi was first used by Polive on his television show.
In 1993 he was crowned by Radoslav Brzobohat.
At the time, however, this was not related to the purpose of building a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabis came up with the idea of issuing the passports of Suschi.
The original student coup operation turned into a business and a lucrative entrepreneurial activity, on which Harabici based the establishment of the society of the Kingdom of Vala'ssko.
In 1997, Polívka agreed to indicate his name and signature in the passports, and even offered their owners discounts when visiting his farm and theatrical performances.
Who will take the throne?
The judge also mentioned today that Harabis himself had only been using the idea, which Polívka published in the mannequin for his business.
"Boleslav Polívka's popularity must have helped the Valachi kingdom project," the judge said.
However, he added that the soul of the project was Harabic and his team, which dealt with it intensively.
The now quarreled parties continued until 2000, when Harabicsa organized an official coronation in Vsetín.
Since then, however, there have been controversy between Polive and Harabic, which were "forever elected I. They came to the acquittal of King Boleslav.
At the initiative of Harabic, Jarmila Sulaková took over as Queen Mother.
In 2002, he filed a lawsuit against Mr. Livac and Others, which was rejected by the court today.
Lights into the debate could be brought to the quarrel by the battle planned by Harabis for the throne and half of the princess.
From this fight, you should be a new king.
He didn't want to give the details and the date.
"We don't want to rush anything.
This should be something like the Slovácko king march.
The king should be elected for a fixed period of time.
Mr. Polívka can also apply," Harabica added.
207 SW 1.6 VTi Peugeot test: Disappearances
Honestly, I never liked the Peugeot 206.
The properties of the march are nothing special, the quality of the change, the management and the production can often be marked as below average.
But the Peugeot 207, its successor, which is already present on the market, is significantly better.
And the SW-named station wagon goes one step further, so for me there's nothing left to do but think more than to think.
When I was testing the classic hatchback of the Peugeot 207, I complained, for example, in the back seat left to the head.
This time the complaining is now over, as the body of the station wagon means that even the two-meter-high giants do not suffer in this respect.
Fasting in the world
I get through the interior so I don't repeat myself many times.
It’s a relatively successful design, where I have the only excuse for the poor console.
There would be a little more designer inventions here, since the exterior of the car is so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and where are the times when we complained about short parts of the seat or armrests.
Side driving has also improved significantly compared to the 206 model.
As for the space, there is also an increase in the dimensions of the body.
In the station wagon, the few places of the head have already mentioned disappear.
Suitcases in the trunk
The main thing on this vehicle is the luggage compartment.
I have to evaluate this as very accessible (also thanks to the folding back window) and spacious spaces.
Empty places are equipped with gourmets, which are ideal compromises.
They are out of the way, they can be pulled apart and they can handle heavier objects.
But let's just stick to the volume.
Based on the tables, this is 428 l in the base layout, which is rather average value compared to the competition.
However, in the Czech Republic, it is not the most sought-after car of this class -- in contrast to the Skoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of mladá Boleslav, we will find that Peugeot is well behind the noticeably many 52 litres.
For a foreign holiday or stroller insertion, this value is almost critical.
But if I have to highlight the positives, I still have to mention the almost completely straight floor after the backrests of the second row or the very low threshold.
120 horsepower in four rows
The vehicle we tested is equipped with a 1.4-cylinder, 88 kW four-cylinder engine with a capacity of 88 kW.
And to tell you the truth, this is what the thousand six hundred, which drives the hatchback of the Csladz.
Quiet, low consumption and pulls first.
If we compare it to its Skoda-proper, which often acts as if a rag had been stuffed into its exhaust, I can only be happy about this.
The price is whispered
The price of the car is not cheap.
However, we have to remember that we tested a car with a spacious interior and equipped with a very good engine.
The car with a four-cylinder alien engine is still going to cost 329,900 Ks.
The car starts at 410 990 K, which is quite a lot.
The tested Premium equipment will throw the equipment at an additional 80,000 K.
However, we also had head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic wiper launch, rear windows also had electronic remote control....
In other words, the car with a case-to-treater costs 531 900 K?
This is a lot, but count the equipment of the Fabia additional and get very similar results.
There is no other choice for the brand.
The integration of Slovak students in British schools is unsuccessful
British schools are increasingly children from Eastern Europe, which attracts local concerns about the further development of local school affairs.
The integration of Eastern Europeans is currently facing a number of obstacles.
British schools have already registered cases where disputes between immigrants and the populations of domestic residents have turned into violence.
The problems with the integration of children in Eastern Europe are well illustrated by a case in northern Central Hungary, where disputes between their places and Slovak immigrants are increasing.
The quarrels and bonds between the students already characterize the relationship of the parents.
The situation has escalated to the point where police in Chatham have arrested a Slovak woman who beat a ten-year-old student with an iron rod.
The culprit defends himself by saying that the boy insulted him with racist curses.
Police had to go after two 12-year-old girls’ attacks on a Slovak immigrant.
The girls allegedly scolded the man with racist remarks and threw stones at him.
"When we were on our way home, a boy climbed up to the bus stop and spit on us.
When I told him to stop doing this, he slammed us with apples and pears, and then he revealed his naked buttocks,” the mother of Slovak students wrote down another unpleasant case to The Times.
There are complaints from both sides.
One local resident described disputes with immigrants in Eastern Europe as a struggle for survival.
The above-mentioned cases suggest that the atmosphere between locals and immigrants in British schools is becoming tense.
In the UK, 70,000 Slovaks are looking for jobs.
Approximately 30,000 Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba is the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it is truly an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your holiday, this can be fulfilled if you choose correctly.
The golden and white beaches, high waves, or sea, calm like a fish pond.
Palm trees and all inclusive waiters on the beach with waiters serving pizza, ice cream or intoxicated cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
In the Caribbean islands, you can find this in a complete and richer list.
On an island, however, you can find much more, and this is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island of the Great Antilles.
Under the Spaniards, Cuba was the bastion of their American conquests.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place that the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became a treasury and transhipment site that the Spaniards in America robbed and transported to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The Nacional Hotel was built in the late 20s.
Lucky Luciano, one of the bosses of the American mafia, built it, because everything that was considered a crime in the United States (primarily Prohibition) was welcomed in Cuba and supported drugs, gambling, and prostitution.
Among his guests, for example,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high-rise buildings were built, and on the wide avenues, cars that became the cult symbol of the 50s of the last century were driven.
Ernest Hemingway bought a estate in San Francisco de Paula, not far from Havana, and he had his own yacht in Cojímar.
The walls of Bodeguita del Medio are decorated with the signatures of the stars and politicians of American show business.
And today?
You can sign the walls of Bodeguita in Havana.
You will be mixed with a cocktail in your dear Nacional Hotel’s wish.
And the cult cars of the 1950s still drive in Havana, as the once-exported stigs and your son have been rotted in this salty and wet air.
Although the oldest part of Havana has deteriorated significantly, there are not as many beautiful colonial monuments anywhere else in the area than there.
Other places are getting more beautiful, like Trinidad.
Given that tourism provides the money so much needed, its development has been given the green light.
In the last fifteen years, new hotels have not only been built in Havana, but also in Varader, on the coast of Holguín province and on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers a unique delicacy in the world, which is primarily appreciated by train lovers.
From their extensive plantations, sugar cane was transported to the sugar plants by steam and multiple units.
Their motorcycle park has not been renewed for decades, so you can see machines operating there, the contemporaries of which can only be seen elsewhere in museums.
Where to go?
Most of the visiting countries in Cuba do not avoid the most famous places.
So you don’t have to write too much about Varader or Havana.
Perhaps we should remember that there is a museum on the already mentioned Hemingway estate, and those who love the writer do not have to miss a visit to this museum.
The Valley is one of the most picturesque parts of Cuba in the western part of the island.
The lustful vegetation grows from lime socket.
Limestone formations, lime-mountain cones and rocks rise steeply from the bottom of the valley and fertile soil accumulated in their cavities, thanks to which the disintegrated cliffs are also covered with dense vegetation.
The valley is a place where the best quality Cuban tobacco is grown.
Its final form can be found when visiting one of the Havana cigar production plants.
Some may also find it interesting that Major Zeman's episode in Chile was filmed there.
Trinidad
It is an ancient city that was founded shortly after the island colonization of the Spaniards.
Fame and glory were brought by the slave and sugar trade.
The economy was embodied in the beauty and monumentality of the not-so-large city.
Colonial Spanish architecture, which was significantly influenced by the later French settlers, has changed almost nothing in four centuries.
Trinidad between the Escambray plain and the sea is so secluded that even in the 50s of the last century there were no roads connecting this region with the rest of the country.
That particular isolation helped to remain an outsider.
They didn’t build anything there, so they didn’t even break it down, everyone was happy that there was a roof over his head.
If you have more than an afternoon for Trinidad, it’s worth seeing the interesting places in the area, such as the Playa Ancón coast or the valley of the Sugar Factorys.
In the evening it is appropriate to go to the Casa de la Música, which resurrects after dark, where the music is only quiet in the morning.
Baracoa
Located in the eastern part of Cuba, some consider it to be the most beautiful city.
I am sure that opinion is already influenced by the road itself.
Both Guantanamo routes must overcome high and articulated mountains, through nature hardly affected by human activity.
The eastern land bridge of Cuba has been included in the World Heritage List by UNESCO thanks to its intact nature.
Here is the best chocolate, in the church there is a cross of Columbus (in reality it was made a hundred years after the sailing of Columbus) and from the hill, where the former castle stood and today stands the El Castillo hotel, some board hills can be seen, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
About coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Meastro plain, the Bay of Pigs and the Isla de Pinos Island, the Tropicana cabaret, the Cuban patron Caridad del Cobra, the Santeria, the African religion, which is believed by the descendants of the former slaves, all this can be written a lot.
As they say correctly, it is better to see it once.
Allies in Afghanistan are passive, the Americans say.
Few soldiers and lack of equipment are influenced by the U.S. mission in Afghanistan.
Defense Secretary Robert Gates said NATO should outline concrete plans for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not planned to take place, the leaders of the countries in Edinburgh, Scotland, which have units in the south of the country, have agreed.
In addition to the growing resistance of the Taliban movement, the eight participating countries are also discussing further plans and coordination of allies.
While the United States, with the assistance of Defense Secretary Robert Gates, has called for more activity this week to involve NATO troops, Britain considers the strengthening of the Afghan government and the strengthening of development assistance as a priority.
“The development of Afghanistan is palpable, but military power can only be a part of the solution.
The other is to allow the population to start further development of the economy and security themselves,” British Defense Minister Des Browne told the BBC.
Ninety percent
The activity of Afghan rebels is the strongest in the last five years, according to the U.S. government.
The number of violence increased by 27 percent compared to last year and by 60 percent in Helmand Province in the southern province.
NATO countries have about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, about a quarter in the southern areas.
However, according to the United States, the Allies have reached their borders in the organization and equipment of the troops.
Specifically, additional helicopters, soldiers and experts were asked to train Afghan troops.
“We need to think about concrete goals for the future and on the way to achieve them,” Gates said.
Jaap de Hoop, NATO Secretary General, spoke in a similar spirit.
“I’m not happy about what’s in Afghanistan and in the air.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that’s not enough,” De Hoop told Reuters at the end of a three-day conversation with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Out of Passive
In recent months, there have been debates between the participating countries on whether allies will offer the maximum in Afghanistan.
Germany, for example, was criticized for its passivity.
"The Germans are present in Afghanistan.
However, they were deployed in areas where the least amount of violence and combat requirements are not as high as they are against us in the south and east of the country,” Gates said.
The British tabloid Sun called the German soldiers lazy this week.
"The Afghan slackers have been covered: The Germans play while our sons are fighting," Sun wrote in a material with a photo of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild launched a counter-attack and published a photo of a British team’s rugby match in southern Afghanistan.
Public debt to reach a trillion in 2009
Every Czech country has a government debt of 84,000 crowns.
The total debt reached 842.7 billion crowns by the end of September.
This year, the government plans to borrow 159.2 billion crowns.
By the beginning of December, however, the Ministry had reduced this plan by 152.8 billion crowns due to better developments in the state budget.
The Czech Republic’s public debt reached 842.7 billion crowns at the end of September.
During the nine months of this year, it has risen by 40.2 billion crowns.
From June, however, it decreased by 13.4 billion crowns.
The Ministry of Finance verified its government debt data from the beginning of October.
Each Czech has more than 84,000 kroner in debt.
Last year, the state was indebted to more than 11 billion crowns.
“For the time being, it seems that next year’s lower deficit will allow us to exceed the one-million-crowned limit only in 2009.
The next year, the debt will be around 900 billion and a trillion crowns,” Patria Finance analyst David Marek told iHNed.cz.
Next Finance analyst Vladimír Pikora sees this similar: "We can cross the footsteps of a trillion in 2009.
Exactly when, it depends on the next budget that is still unknown.
If it were proven that the situation would change in the field of politics, politicians would be ready to save more, which could shift until 2010.
But I don’t assume that change,” he said.
Growing debts
The government debt is made up of the debts of the central government, which is primarily generated by the accumulation of deficits of the state budget.
The public debt is financed by cashier tickets, state loan bonds, direct loans or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
The state’s internal indebtedness has increased by 38.5 billion to 719,4 billion crowns this year.
The state’s foreign debt has increased by 1.7 billion to 123.3 billion crowns.
The so-called marketable government debt reached 803.3 billion crowns by the end of September and decreased by 13.7 billion crowns from June.
The average debt-to-GDP ratio has increased to 6.5 years.
“Fidebt between the year increased by 13 percent in the first quarter, which is indeed quite a lot compared to the economy’s progress.
Interestingly, the increase is mainly generated in the case of loan bonds, where there is an increase of 20 percent.
“It’s bad that debt is growing, but on the other hand, it shows that there will be something to trade with, and when the pension reform is here,” Pikora commented on the data.
Better than expected
The financing strategy and the 2007 government debt management show that this year the government planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns.
By the beginning of December, however, the ministry had reduced the plan by 152.8 billion crowns due to better developments in the state budget.
The amount is mainly due to the deficit of the state budget, which is likely to reach 76 billion crowns this year instead of the assumed 91.3 billion crowns.
Furthermore, the planned maximum amount of 13.3 billion crowns of the Czech Consolidation Agency, a reserve of ten billion for the payment of pensions, the financing of public loan bonds with a crown of 43 billion and the repayment of loans worth 1.8 billion crowns from the European Investment Bank.
The teacher appears today in a Khartoum court for a name given to a teddy bear
A Khartoum court sentenced the British teacher to 15 days in prison and expulsion from the country in Sudan on Thursday evening for violating Islam, his lawyer said.
The British woman was accused of allowing her 6- to 7-year-old students to name a teddy bear as Muhammad. Islam, however, forbids any representation of its prophet.
Such an act can be punished by a whipping.
The 54-year-old British woman, a teacher at Unity High School in Khartoum, was arrested on Sunday in her apartment. Under Section 125 of the Sudan Penal Code, he was accused of insulting Islam and rebellion after the students’ parents repeatedly complained to him by the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story began in September, when the teacher asked his students, 6-7, to choose a name for the class’s teddy bear.
“The children proposed a total of eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed,” said Robert Boulos, the school’s principal.
In the end, 20 out of 23 children chose the first name Muhammad.
Of course, Muhammad is the name of the prophet Islam, but it is also a very common first name in Sudan.
The children then made a joint diary with the teddy bear’s photo and the inscription “My name is Muhammad.”
The bear itself was not labeled with that name. Rather, the problem lies in the fact that any representation of the prophet is a violation of Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons’ Muslim colleagues at the same school said she knew her well and that the teacher would never have done anything that would offend any religious beliefs. He said it was just an “innocent mistake”: “I only regret that he had the children vote for the name.”
Many students of the teacher agree with this opinion. According to them, the teacher "treats very well with the children" and "never speaks of religion in the class".
Let’s not forget that Muhammad is the second most popular first name in Britain, and there are 14 different spellings in English.
This first name, so often chosen by Muslim families, is a way of expressing respect for the prophet. (The firstborn child of the family receives this name.)
But what are the rules for using the first name?
Can you get this name, for example, a game?
This is obviously a matter of interpretation.
No agreement was reached on the future status of the province at the last meeting in Vienna on Wednesday.
The end result is failure.
The sixth and final separatist status of the Serbs and the Kosovo Albanians ended on Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, on Wednesday morning.
“It is regrettable that the parties have not reached an agreement on status,” Wolfgang Ischinger, an EU diplomat, said at a press conference in Vienna.
U.S. Ambassador Frank Wisner stressed that peace in the region is “at the stakes” and urged Belgrade and Pristina to keep their promises to maintain peace and dialogue even after the talks.
“There is no need to fear violence in the near future, but it will be a very difficult period,” he added, stressing the “existence of obvious tensions.”
Mediation ends on December 10
On Monday, the mediator troika, including the European Union, the United States and Russia, will visit Serbia and Kosovo for the last time.
The future of the 90-percent Albanian province could be clarified after Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Bocan-Harcsenko, submit a report to the United Nations Security Council by December 10.
The meeting near Vienna in Baden was the sixth and final meeting of the talks since the United Nations commissioned the troika to be broadcast again last August.
Americans and Europeans see their mediation task ending on December 10.
The Russians, who have already thwarted the independence of Kosovo in the Security Council, insist that negotiations continue beyond the deadline.
“Russia has been and will remain committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise,” Bocan-Harcsenko said.
Unilateral Declaration of Independence?
After Kosovo has been under the control of the United Nations for eight years, Western powers believe that independence under EU oversight is the only viable solution.
Pristina said she was ready to unilaterally declare her independence if the Security Council did not decide in her favour.
Belgrade would continue to support greater autonomy.
“Unfortunately, we have not been able to reach an agreement,” Kosovo’s independent province chairman Fatmir Sejdiu said at a hotel in Baden where “the last chance negotiations have been held since Monday.”
Hashim Thaci, the former commander of the Kosovo uprising and the future prime minister of the province, also expressed his regret.
He added, however, that Belgrade’s vision of autonomy would be “a continuation of the past that ended in murders and deportations”.
"Dominion effect"
Serbian President Boris Tadic said the compromise was still possible and warned of the Albanian majority in Kosovo about the consequences of the unilateral declaration of independence.
Belgrade is afraid of a “domino effect” in the still unstable region due to the wars of independence of the 1990s.
“For Serbia, this does not exclude the possibility of a compromise,” Tadic said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation reiterated that the decision should be exclusively for the Security Council, where its Russian ally has the right of veto.
“The Kosovo parliament will have the last word.”
“For Serbia, only a solution approved by the Security Council is acceptable,” Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
“Negotiations lasted for two years.
They must end where they started: in the Security Council.”
Fatmir Sejdiu told reporters that “the Kosovo parliament will have the last word.” He added that the Albanians are unilaterally proclamation of independence on the basis of a “coalization” with the Western powers.
Bush calls for agreement between Israel and Palestine
On Tuesday, at the opening of the international peace conference he held in Annapolis, Maryland, announced that Israel and Palestine had finally reached an agreement to sign a joint statement.
According to Bush, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas have agreed to immediately begin negotiations for a 60-year dispute between their peoples.
In the presence of the two presidents, Bush promised to support them in every possible way to sign the “peace treaty” in 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians will have to dismantle “terrorist networks” and Israel must stop its colonial activities, Bush said, reminding the two parties of their obligations to the “peace plan” adopted in 2003.
The White House’s head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Abbas-led Palestinian Authority and Israel were “to sign a peace treaty that solves all pending problems, including central issues.”
The latter concern the three sensitive problems at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute: the future borders of Palestine, the situation of Jerusalem, and the fate of Arab refugees who lived in the territory of today’s Israeli state during the conflict in 1948.
Speaking after the US president, Abbas insisted on making future talks “global and in-depth” and to affect all areas of regulation, such as “Jerusalem, asylum, border, colonies, water and security.”
Olmert then promised that future talks would be “direct and continuous”, and he would seek to “find them in 2008.”
By the end of 2008, Bush had set out to see the “water of two states” of Palestinian and Israeli coexisting.
Saudi Arabia said Bush had received a promise to do so before deciding to attend the conference.
Saudi Arabia (whose involvement in Annapolis was considered a success by Washington) has initiated a plan, with the support of all Arab countries, which guarantees peace to Israel in return to withdraw from all Arab areas occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis is a “response path in the history of the Middle East, especially because it captures the problem at its root and focuses on central issues,” the Saudi prince said in an interview with the Saudi-owned Arab newspaper.
According to the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As is usually the case with news of this kind, the official position and the rumours contradict each other.
How did the accident happen?
According to the first data of the investigation launched by the National Police General Control Body (IGPN), a police car was driving on Louise-Michel Street in Villiers-le-Bel on Sunday, a few minutes after 5 p.m.
“The car was patrolling, so it wasn’t in action. He was travelling at a speed of 40-50 km/h, without sirens,” we learned from a police source.
The two helmetless young people were driving "high speed" with a green "non-registration, so it cannot be used in road traffic" (see below) Kawasaki branded engine.
“Since the right-hand rule was not followed, the engine hit the left side of the police car,” says a policeman.
The results of the alcohol test on the passengers of the vehicle were negative.
The intensity of the collision is well illustrated by the fact that the front of the car is dented, the windshield cracked in the shape of a star, and the bumper was torn off.
Pontoise’s state prosecutor Marie-Thérse de Givry said in an extraordinary announcement yesterday morning that he had commissioned the IGPN and the Val-D’Oise County Directorate for the investigation, which was launched for “failure to commit homicide and assistance.”
During the afternoon, the prosecutor said at a press conference that the responsibility of the police at the current stage of the IGPN investigation could be ruled out.
According to the prosecutor, three eyewitnesses interrogated on Sunday evening confirmed the “police of police officers that the scooter arrived relatively quickly from the left side of the police car.”
Yesterday, from a stripe that was undoubtedly pulled by the footrests on the road, it was shown that the two vehicles had collapsed and were running together for a while until the police car managed to brake.
The vehicles were seized for technical inspection.
The body of the two victims was tested by a medical examiner yesterday.
What happened immediately after that?
Yesterday, the rumor spread like wildfire in Villiers-le-Bel, according to which the police quickly left the scene without helping the two young people.
In this regard, the IGPN is cautious, but it excludes that the police had made “any serious mistake”.
“This is the most difficult part of the investigation, which requires even more thorough investigation and in the process of taking special precautions,” police said.
Libération met an eyewitness who reported a few minutes after the accident.
One of the windows of his apartment overlooks exactly the site.
“My cousin, who is a hospital nurse, we immediately went down to try to resuscitate them,” the eyewitness says.
"There's nothing we could do."
Then he noticed "a policeman who was completely confused and limping.
The other two tried to resuscitate one of the youngsters and the fourth called.”
Tensions escalated among those present as the hopeless situation of the two young people became apparent, so the arriving policemen took their colleagues away from the scene by car.
We also know from the eyewitness that the ambulance arrived "about 20 minutes after the police leave".
They also used heart massage, but in vain.
“I wouldn’t say the police didn’t try to help the young people.
The young people did get help.
Firefighters arrived at the scene immediately.
They did everything they could to save them,” the prosecutor said.
Tensions in Pakistan
On Monday, Pakistani police blocked the first protests after the emergency imposed by General Musharraf two days earlier.
According to eyewitnesses, about 2,000 lawyers protesting against the measures imposed in the eastern part of the country in Lahore, in the eastern part of the country, were injured by tear gas bombs used by law enforcement forces.
In response, they threw stones at the police, many of whom were injured.
At least 350 lawyers were produced.
Similar events took place in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police attacked and injured lawyers.
Several people were produced.
In Islamabad, registered lawyers of the Supreme Court called for a general strike and announced protests over the arrest of some 500 opposition members, human rights activists and lawyers over the weekend.
On Monday morning, the streets leading to the Supreme Court were closed to prevent assembly.
There were also protests in Multan, central part of the country, and Peshawar, northwest.
Since Monday, the law school movement has been supported by the massive Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance of religious parties. His leader “exhorts the people to send flowers to judges who disagree with the state of emergency and garbage to those who swore before Musharraf.”
"Musarraf's promise is no longer valid."
The Pakistani Supreme Court is directly affected by the exceptional measure announced on Saturday evening.
In the coming days, the Court of Justice shall declare the legality of President Musharraf's re-election with indirect vote on 6 October.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was removed from office and replaced by others.
“What we are witnessing is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the Supreme Court’s rulings,” he told The News.
President Pervez Musharraf’s promise to leave the military to serve as a civilian president after the state of emergency has been “lossed” after the introduction of the state of emergency, Deputy Minister for Information Tariq Azeem announced on Monday.
Musharraf had to leave the military uniform until November 15, the end of his first term as president.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed the news of the postponement of the elections in January.
The Pakistani government has denied the nationwide rumor that President Musharraf would have appointed a forced residence as a deputy general.
More than a third of pregnancies are unplanned.
This result includes unwanted (24%), or improperly or unplanned pregnancies.
Even today, more than a third (36%) of pregnancies are not planned, according to a study by the French National Institute of Demographics (Ined) forty years after the adoption of the Neuwirth law, which liberalizes contraception.
This result includes unwanted (24%), or improperly or unplanned pregnancies.
Ined estimates that different methods of contraception, such as tablets or uterine spirals, are still failing in 5-6% of cases.
However, according to the institute, the liberalization of contraception has made “birth regulation” more effective. The study notes that only 5% of women between the ages of 20 and 44 were taken in 1970, but today it is 60%.
Today, 8 out of 10 pregnancies are planned.
Every five plans with a few months of accuracy, and if possible, it is spring, as it is the most favorable season to receive a child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and the crew of the International Space Station (ISS) had to work more than seven hours in space to carry out a spectacular repair of the torn solar panel, which is essential for the station’s scientific activities.
This dangerous spacewalk proved to be a record in several respects: the repair took a very long time, there was very little time to design it, and it had to be done away from the residential modules, with "wheed" tools by the astronauts.
The problem arose on Tuesday when the astronauts separated the Harmony module from Discovery. This is a huge cylindrical element that will soon be the site of scientific laboratory activities in Europe and Japan (see the framed part).
This module is a kind of gateway to laboratory modules.
However, they must be supplied with power.
The second task of the crew was to relocate one of the modules that produced electricity at the ISS using the 17.5 ton solar panels to its final location.
Then the crew began opening the module’s 76-metre-wide solar panels.
Among the synchronously foldable boards, one of them was damaged by a stuck cable in a length of about 1 meter.
In order to avoid further injury, the board was not continued to be opened.
The astronauts were originally tasked with taking a check-in walk from the Discovery space shuttle and then repairing another solar panel with a defective rotation system. Instead, they had to devote their entire time to repair the damaged solar panel.
Scott Parazynski was chosen to perform the stunt hanging on the 30-meter robotic arm of the space shuttle attached to the station crane.
He's one of NASA's best "space walkers."
It has a high, strong, extremely clever, muscular upper body and long arm.
So the 46-year-old man with a doctor had to "operate" the "injured" solar panel.
After carefully assessing the damage, he cut the defective cable and recorded the damaged area with some "rails".
His work was also assisted by another "spacewalker" who remained near the safe passageway, as well as other astronauts, including the crew captain Peggy Whitson.
The tool he used, a mini hockey bat, which was insulated against hundreds of volts of tension in solar panels, was five-fold and "whyed" by the station's astronauts.
After completing the operation, Scott Parazynski waited for his companions to open the board completely, and only then packed his tools and returned to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts held a half-day rest, and today seven returned to the Discovery space shuttle to begin their return on Wednesday.
EADS share prices are falling
EADS shares fell sharply on the Paris Stock Exchange after the aircraft and defense equipment company announced that the long-term development of the A400M aircraft will result in an additional cost of 1.2 to 1.4 billion euros.
EADS shares are currently at 21.96 euros after a 4% decline.
The company was forced to review its forecasts for 2007 operating profit, as the development of the engine of the A400M is delayed, which is likely to delay the delivery of the aircraft.
The delay in delivery of the tactical transport aircraft, announced in October, will cost between EUR 1.1.2 billion and EUR 1.4 billion, of which more than USD 1 billion will affect Airbus,” the parent company of the European EADS manufacturer announced.
Due to the incurrence of these expenditures, the EADS will have to publish new plans for its 2007 operating profits next Thursday, when it announces its quarterly results, the company added, but did not disclose any further figures.
The Group also indicated that it took into account the six-month delay when preparing its new cost estimate.
In 2006, EADS’s operating profit declined by 86%, largely due to the delay in the development of another program, the A380, which also put a huge financial burden on the company.
The company originally planned to hand over the A400M to the French military in October 2009.
Remains the status quo
Sunday’s elections do not promise much surprise: the vast majority of Russians will vote for Putin’s side, United Russia.
This is the demand of the Russians for stability, so to speak, arbitrary governance, after a heavily manipulated campaign.
Today, three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin will send a televised message to voters through public service channels, which has already been recorded, but its content is still secret.
Putin is leading the candidate list of the Kremlin-backed party, United Russia, which is expected to win an overwhelming victory in the elections.
At the reception of foreign ambassadors yesterday, the head of state’s behavior did not reveal anything: he only made another outburst against the interventions of Western countries, which was a popular topic during the campaign.
“We know the price of true democracy, so we want honest, absolutely transparent and open elections without any violations,” he added.
However, according to the opposition, this is not the case.
The opposition condemns the campaign in which, according to them, pressure on the electorate.
The leader of the Communist Party, Gennady Zyuganov, said that “this dirty election in Russia was not even in Yeltsin’s time.”
After last weekend’s protests, former World Chess champion Garry Kasparov was sentenced to five days in prison for an unauthorised demonstration and said his lawyer was still unable to visit.
"The Russians still think as "homo sovieticus"
Predictable election results raise two more obvious questions:
Who is following Putin in the head of state?
The official newspaper published the date of the first round of the presidential election, which will be 2 March 2008, and the candidates will be able to announce their intention to run until December 23.
Since Vladimir Putin was elected in 2000 and 2004, his mandate could no longer be extended.
There is no other successor in the horizon.
What role will Putin play in March?
Will he be Prime Minister?
Or, as the leader of the omnipotent United Russia party or the parliamentary majority, he will decide on the government and the president?
Either way, the outgoing power will win in both parliamentary and presidential elections.
It has become a tradition now.
“The Russians are still thinking like ‘homo sovieticus’: they don’t feel like they can control their fate,” says Lev Gudkov, director of the independent Levada Center.
Nikolai Koposzov, the historian of the University of St. Petersburg, goes even further: according to his theory, the country became a Christian five hundred years later than Europe, so the development of civil society is also delayed. The traditional community spirit hindered the development of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 90s, "Putin went back to the paternalistic model, which perfectly suited the people. All the more so since this new kind of paternalism was not accompanied by intimidation, but with a certain economic well-being,” said Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians “reject their personal responsibility”, which quickly manifested itself after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.
"Why should we think?"
The phenomenon affects all strata of society, even the business world.
The administrative elite is interested in maintaining the current situation: the local lists of the United Russia are led by 65 governors, who are from the leaders of the 85 Russian regions.
Freedom imported from the West often embodies chaos, as happened in the 1990s.
The public prefers stability.
In this spirit, the Russians do not vote for extremist parties either.
Tamara Cherednichenko, a 54-year-old teacher, concludes: "Why should we think?
Those in power aren't so bad, so why should we replace them?"
Depressing Memories
After more than 60 years of encryption, the Bad Arolsen archive, which documents the fate of the 17 and a half million victims of the Hitler regime, has become public.
The 47 million archive documents, which occupy a 27-kilometre range of shelves in Bad Arolsen, in the province of Hessen, have so far only been researched for "humanitarian" purposes, i.e. only provided a unique and name-related access to the former victims or their descendants.
The eleven states responsible for the treatment of the archives, including Germany, France, Israel and the United States, agreed in May 2006 to open the archives to researchers and historians.
After all states ratified the Convention, the archives were opened yesterday.
Confidential information
The opening of the archives of Bad Arolsen will allow historians to conduct “research on the relocation of imprisoned people, the residents of the camps and the health of forced laborers,” explains Reto Meistern, director of the archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross.
Until now, several states, including Germany, have opposed the publicization of the documents, as they contain names and thus confidential information.
This could include, for example, the alleged homosexuality or mental disability of some deported victims.
Lists of concentration camps and arrest warrants issued by the Gestapo began to be collected for practical reasons after the war. The aim was to find civilians who had been deported or forced to work on the basis of these, and to provide evidence of their internment, on the basis of which they could receive compensation.
In Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees are currently engaged in the processing of tens of thousands of individual needs.
However, some of the scientific community does not consider the opening of the Bad Arolsen archive to be of paramount importance.
“These documents basically contain nothing new,” said Wolfgang Benz, director of the Center for Anti-Semitist Research at the Technical University of Berlin in 2006.
EU and India to sign free trade agreement in 2008
The turnover of the Indo-European bilateral trade is already close to EUR 60 billion annually.
The EU is India’s number one trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and Indian Trade Minister Kamal Nath announced.
As early as last April, EU foreign ministers approved the European Commission’s opening of negotiations with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to sign free trade agreements. The annual turnover of the Indo-European bilateral trade is already close to 60 billion euros.
The EU is India’s number one trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also India’s main foreign investor, but India is only the EU’s 9th most important trading partner, according to the European Commission’s figures.
Peter Mandelson said that “a free trade agreement could be an economic stimulus for both sides,” and that “India could increase its presence in a prosperous market of 450 million people.”
Europe is the primary or secondary importer of the ten most important products exported by India, the European Commissioner added. The two giants, Europe and Asia, exchange each year with “EUR 47 billion worth of products” and “10 billion euros worth of services”, said Dani?le Smadja, head of the European Commission delegation in New Delhi this week. At the same time, he regretted that bilateral trade “still has not reached its full potential”. The EU and India will meet in New Delhi on Friday at the eighth diplomatic summit, attended by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and European Commission President José Manuel Durao Barroso.

In response to concerns: Bank of England offers the financial market 10 billion pounds for a five-week term
The Bank of England wants to alleviate the unrest about credit conditions, so on Thursday it announced that it will pump 10 billion pounds into the financial market, which will be made available at a base rate of 5.75% and, unlike usual, this time with a maturity of five weeks.
“We want to alleviate concerns that financial market conditions will be particularly bad at the end of the year, and we also want banks to plan their liquidity position more securely for this period. Therefore, from 6 December, a significant part of the Bank’s reserves will be offered on the international financial market in the framework of a five-week open market operation,” the bank said in a press release.
According to the bank, 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be on the market on December 6, at 12:15 local time. The central bank base rate is valid for the offer, and the repayment deadline is 10 January.
This is the first time that the Bank of England has issued liquid funds for five weeks in the context of an open market operation.
The term of such operations is usually one week.
In a press release, the Bank of England added that it was “ready to take further measures” to ensure that interbank loans are aligned with the central bank base rate.
The current interbank interest rate was 5.82% on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate exceeded the level of 18 September, currently standing at 6.6%.
Since the beginning of the summer financial market crisis, the Bank of England has charged a significant punitive interest on the amounts pumped into the financial market, which discouraged the banks from using them.
According to the rumours (which is only reinforced by the euro, the euro’s exchange rate) many people would have preferred the funds offered by the European Central Bank, which they could have obtained with a more favourable interest rate and greater discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to examine the socialist proposal on purchasing power
The UMP and Nouveau Centre group on Thursday refused to discuss the articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which is equivalent to the rejection of the text itself.
The text, which was discussed at the meeting initiated by the Socialists, contained about ten measures adopted by the socialist party’s national office on Tuesday. These included, for example, a 50% increase in the employment allowance, the reinstatement of the variable fuel tax, the introduction of travel cheques and the restriction of rents.
Since the UMP and the NC voted 180:115 against examining the articles, the meeting between the ruling party and the opposition, which sometimes ended in sharp discussions, was interrupted. This was just a few hours before President Nicolas Sarkozy’s televised speech on purchasing power.
The head of the socialist delegation, Jean-Marc Ayrault, announced that he would resubmit all his proposals in the framework of the amendment of the corrective draft financial law, which will be on the agenda of the Parliament next week.
A new festival is born
There have been many rumors about the new Philadelphia music festival by C3 Presents. Now, however, the company organizing and promoting the event has announced that the Vineland music festival will be held in New Jersey in cooperation with the British producer company, the Festival Republic.
“We are honored to work with someone who is the initiator of today’s American festival movement,” Charlie Jones of C3 told Billboard.com.
C3 also organizes the Lollapalooza festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits music festival.
The Vineland festival in New Jersey will be held in the summer, so there will be a way to camp.
The festival is August 8. Between 10, a 500-crash private area, about 40 minutes from Philadelphia, will be held.
The director of the Festival Republic, Melvin Benn, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the world’s most respected festival organizers.
In 1989, he began organising the British Reading Festival, which attracts about 80,000 visitors each year.
In 1999, Melvin Benn expanded its palette with the Leeds Festival, and in 2006, the Festival Republic established the Latitude Festival in Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn has been co-owner of Glastonbury Festival for its licensing and licensing and organisational tasks. By now, this festival can accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3 called Glastonbury Festival the “most inspiring event” he had ever attended. He added that his company and Melvin Benn’s company are working in parallel to enrich the region with a European-style festival event.
“We have already selected the Philadelphia venue and, together with the Fairmount Parks Commission, we have worked hard to organize this festival in the center of Philadelphia,” said Charlie Jones.
“We were conducting activities with the city, and the Commission was very enthusiastic about our plan.
“Unfortunately, however, the political maneuvers of the city administration has failed,” Jones continued.
“We were lucky enough to talk to Melvin Benn about it, and now we’re preparing to host a huge festival in another unique venue that ultimately serves the interests of the people of Philadelphia.”
C3 Presents revived the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 at the Grant Park in Chicago, after it proved its exceptional festival organizer talent with the Austin City Limits music festival in 2002.
The gross revenues of the two events in 2007 amounted to 9.8 million and 11.3 million dollars, respectively.
Both festivals were held in the city.
“Melvin Benn’s European concept is based on the rural festival, while our festivals usually take place in urban green areas,” says Charlie Jones.
Our goal is to combine the two models in some way, creating both the rural atmosphere in Europe and the urban lifestyle that is common in America.”
Vineland is located between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“The people of Valland, and even the mayor himself, are enthusiastic about supporting the event,” says Charlie Jones.
Although he does not talk about the details of the agreement, he says that “the conditions are favorable enough to allow an investment in such a large event in a venue that hopefully will give the festival a long time to host the festival.”
According to Charlie Jones, the festival will be “huge-sized” and is roughly equivalent to the capacity of 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo music festival in Tennessee.
The ensembles have already received the invitation to the event, but nothing is final at the time of the press release.
“Vieland is basically a rock festival, but we’re planning a diverse musical offer to make sure everyone can find something to please him,” says Charlie Jones.
Jones and his two partners, Charlie Walker and Charles Attal, together with the company, are the company C3, which received the "best independent event organizer" award at the latest Billboard Touring Awards.
Montreal to confront Terminator
It's not easy to lure Hollywood directors to Montreal if you have to fight the Terminator itself...
"Slection" is one of the duties of the delegate from Montreal.
The mission promises to be “politically difficult” as California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger is opposed to filming his own production abroad.
Is it really hard to fight with the "Terminator Governor"?
“We have to be careful because the film industry decides which one is the best place for you.
If you find that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, you will go there.
Our job is to offer the best possible conditions that they choose between us,” Schwarzenegger says.
Competing for Festivals
Denis Turcotte, however, is now focusing on promoting Canadian films.
The competition for the Oscars has begun.
The goal is to present and promote as many Quebec films as possible at every American film festival, whether it is the Sundance Film Festival, the Denver, Seattle or San Francisco Film Festival. We also need to be able to make the directors listen to.
The film L'ge des tén?bres received a favorable reception a few weeks ago at the 30. The Mill Valley Film Festival.
It will also be screened at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil at Santa Monica and the 30th in November. It will also be premiered at the Starz Denver Film Festival.
Quebec also featured four short films and four feature films this month at the American Film Institute Fest.
Will there be a year-end rally on the stock market? Experts shared by the 'subprime' crisis
Just five weeks before the end of the fiscal year, investors are already rubbing their hands and are eager to wait for the usual end-of-year hairstyle.
This year, however, it is not clear to experts whether this will actually happen.
According to Banif, “from a statistical point of view, the stock market generally behaves positively in December.
However, projections with only statistical backgrounds are not necessarily correct, in fact, in the current situation, the market is characterised by uncertainty, at least in the short term.”
Experts do not support the start of the year on the stock market, although they state that “the stock market is maintained by the presence of liquidity, which gives the investment, as there is a lack of the guarantee alternatives, especially the fixed return, which is negatively affected by the escape towards quality securities, as well as in the short term”.
For this reason, the stock market will be more characterised by lateral, volatility-free movement, “especially because the impact of the Fed’s interest rate reduction is still unknown, as the price of crude oil is high and there is also a threat of inflationary tensions”.
Javier Barrio, the sales officer of BPI in Spain, agrees with this, so it would be risky to say that there will be rally.
According to the expert, “the situation is not rosy at all.”
Ibex’s loss is close to 4% compared to the highest figures recorded on 8 November, when the index closed at 15,545.7 points.
Not all experts are so pessimistic.
According to Intermoney analyst Juan Solana, Ibex 35 could close the year closer to 16,000 points due to the reorganization of the portfolios and the usual pension fund.
On the other hand, the expert adds that some changes are expected this year, as the rally will be postponed to the second week of December, the week after the long weekend concerning the Constitution’s Day.
The analyst considers it unlikely that volatility would affect market trends.
According to Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banco, we are close to the technical level and “because of the decline in the stock market index, which may also rise depending on the news from the US, in terms of the consequences of the credit market crisis.”
The analyst hopes that they will be positive.
Analysts agree on the securities targeting Ibex’s new maximum quotas.
Solana, from Intermoney, emphasizes that “this year it’s the turn of the big securities.”
The expert would hire the two big banks and some construction companies to the list, “because the electrical sector will be very expensive by then.”
Federico Olucha of Inversis Banco states that the increase is due to the banking sector and the industrial sector.
Rally can also be positive for construction companies, if it does at all.
“ACS has been trying to regain its positions for several months and we hope that Ferrovial and FCC construction companies will follow it along the way,” he said.
cyclical consumption will be the protagonist of the remainder of the year due to the increase in sales during the Christmas sales period.
On the other hand, according to the expert, technology companies can also benefit, although the representation in this area is not very high in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, there have been only two drops in December.
The real year-end rally was observed in 2003, when the stock market market recovered from the crisis caused by the bursting of the technological bubble.
This year, when Ibex corrected 35, 28.17 percent, a 6.88% jump was recorded in December.
So it is still open whether 2007 will be the fifth consecutive profitable year (at the moment Ibex has an increase of 8.36 percent since January) and whether the rally at the end of the year can take place.
Banco Popular Espa ol 200 opens 12 hours open account from Monday to Saturday
Banco Popular Espa ol has decided to renovate most of its accounts.
This affects a total of 200 branches in Spain’s most commercially affected areas.
These accounts run under the name Popular Max and make a big difference for the bank.
But for the other Spanish institutions as well, as this is the first group whose branches are open continuously until 8:30 p.m. and even on Saturdays from 10 am to 8:30 p.m.
The other group, BBVA, which has also repeatedly said that it plans to open its branches for extended opening hours, has not yet taken the necessary steps.
However, he is currently preparing to agree with the unions that he would close 75% of his accounts to open in return one afternoon, although not to the public.
The experience of Banco Popular Espa?ol will be crucial for other institutions, as it will decide whether to join the initiative to support the more favourable opening hours of the shops.
This is the objective of the Banco Popular Espa?ol project.
In these places, they would like to target shopping individuals, small and medium-sized enterprises, sole proprietors and local businesses.
The bank wants to operate 200 branches of its branches throughout Spain for 18 months with the already mentioned opening hours, as it is not a new opening hours, but a refurbishment of the existing one.
To do this, the institution will modernize its branches in the commercial zones according to the needs of the customers of each street.
In this way, the extension of the opening hours is accompanied by a new concept of the nature of the branches, a more modern and more colourful design.
Commercial bank manager Ángel Rivera points out that the reorganization does not require a large investment, but they have to employ more employees, which means eight or nine employees per branch instead of the current six.
The branches, which even have meeting rooms for SMEs, will also sell non-financial products.
Facilitating experience
Banco Popular Espa ol has already implemented the initiative in three of its branches in Madrid.
According to Ángel Rivero, the experience was positive.
The branches in the streets of Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía in Madrid were chosen, and Rivero said the decision was the right.
Banco Popular Espa ol currently has 2,500 accounts.
Another 60 are under the name Mundocredit, specializing in immigrants, and also have a very favorable opening hours, even on Sundays and holidays.
In these suites of PopularMax, they do not use the BBVA model, where some accounts offer a wide range of non-financial products.
“We don’t want to create competition for our customers,” Rivero points out.
At the moment, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica and will sell mobile phones using external personnel.
Telecinco will first double the value of its rival, Antena 3
"We did it."
Yesterday, Paolo Vasile, the acting adviser of Telecinco, expressed his satisfaction with the closing of the market, when it turned out that the TV station he led doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
“It only hurts that it is because we have risen more, but because we have fallen less,” he said.
Even so, he put great emphasis on the fact that in the weak market we “we fell less”.
Telecinco closed with a 2.54 percent increase yesterday.
This increase puts its annual loss at 15.66 percent.
Fifty-two percent of the company belong to Mediaset and 13 percent to Vocento, so its stock market value is 4.488.88 million euros, according to Bloomberg data.
His rival, Antena 3, lost 1.52 percent yesterday and has fallen by 40.5 percent since January, reaching half as much yesterday, 2.193.46 million.
The value of the other listed communication companies is 3.571 million for Sogecable; 2.518.53 million for Prisa (the publisher of Cinco Días) and 1,779 million for Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 is due to the similarity between the two companies.
The only question is how much we can perform in the same market, at what cost, and how it pays off in terms of viewership.
Telecinco announced last week that it would like to be the first TV channel to exceed 1 billion gross advertising revenues this year, said Giuseppe Tringali, Acting Adviser at Telecinco and Publiespaa. The latter is the subsidiary of the group’s advertising affairs.
If the announced fact were realised, compared to the 965.4 million recorded in the financial year 2006, the TV channel would increase its advertising revenues by 3.6 percent in this fiscal year.
Antena’s net sales increased by 1.6 percent in the first nine months of the first nine months of the fiscal year (around 734.4 million), while television’s net sales increased by 0.7 percent (630,4 million).
According to analysts, one of the factors that trigger Telecinco’s market momentum on the stock exchange is the high pay out that has been maintained so far: in 2006, the company led by President Alejandro Echevarría distributed 100% of its shareholders’ earnings.
According to Vasile, although it is too early to decide, this ratio may change after the purchase of 33% of Endemol’s parent company, Mediaset.
“We are formally guaranteeing a payment of a minimum of 50%, although we have always distributed much more.
I hope our shareholders will be satisfied with us this year, as we have already benefited from the acquisition of 33% of Endemol.”
According to analysts, the market is currently characterised by some lag.
Lehman Brothers recently lowered its Telecinco yield estimates by 4 percent in 2008 and 7 percent in 2009.
According to them, this is due to the fact that the estimated increase in sales revenue will decrease from 10.5 percent to 8.4 percent in 2008 and from 5.5 percent to 5.1 percent in 2009.
According to the same company’s forecasts, Antena 3’s profits will decline by 4.5 percent in 2008 and by 7.5 percent in 2009.
3 reviews
1.
Ibersecurities: proposes the purchase of both securities, mainly due to its high profitability and long-term sustainable potential resulting from dividends.
2.
Caja Madrid: Telecinco is considered to be more favorable (acquisition) than Antena 3 (hercess of retention) due to its "multiple attraction" and business gain.
3.
JPMorgan: in both cases, it recommends underweighting due to the "similar risks" (saturated market and less favourable economic climate).
Congress approves MiFID takeover on November 1
Parallel to the parliamentary process, which ended today with a congressional vote approving the amendments of the Senate, the government initiated a social dialogue on the regulation on which the law is based, so that both could enter into force before the end of the year.
Representatives from different groups unanimously highlighted the efforts of MEPs and senators in negotiations and agreements, which served to develop the most favorable normative to protect investors, as well as to regulate the activities of companies in order to operate efficiently on the market.
Mifid, which amends the Securities Markets Act, allows the modernisation of financial markets, while at the same time strengthening investor protection, broadens the supervisory rights of the Spanish National Securities Markets Commission (CNMV) and promotes cooperation between the various inspectors of the European Union.
The new directive allows financial advisory services for specialized companies, but also for natural or legal persons, and in addition to securities distribution companies, securities agencies and portfolio management companies, a new financial services company (ESIS), namely financial advisory companies (AFI).
In addition, the law increases the number of systems suitable for carrying out operations involving funds, and thus the addition of multilateral trading platforms and internalisation systems for the execution of orders to be entered into competition with current stock market players.
Furthermore, the Act obliges investment service providers to provide market information regarding the determining aspects of their business profile, their risk-taking and risk management methods, and to keep a record of all operations implemented to facilitate the control of CNMV.
The Economic Committee of Congress has enacted a number of amendments. Of these, it is of paramount importance that securitised debts are treated as "complex" funds due to the high risk to the investor. This was confirmed in connection with the US high-risk mortgage lending (subprime).
On the other hand, the transposition of the directive was also used to legally outline the scope of activities of those with economic and entrepreneurship qualifications. This was done 30 years after the Royal Decree defining the professional functions that could only be performed by economists in 1977.
The Senate proposed the creation of new players in the financial sector, such as the brokerage agent, who works for another account, does not need CNMV permission, and can distribute products or acquire customers to several investment companies at the same time.
The Consumer Price Index increased by 0.5 points in November, reaching 4.1%.
This indicator, which Eurostat takes into account for the calculation of the European Union’s inflation rate, shows the evolution of prices in Spain for November.
Its disclosure is in line with Eurostat’s and the European Central Bank’s strategy to provide data comparable to data from the United States, both in terms of the time and nature of their creation.
For the preliminary indicator, the same calculation method is used to calculate the Unified Price Index, but the statistical modelling method differs from the information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The Statistical Office emphasized that the preliminary indicator is purely informative, so it may deviate from the final data, which will be published on 14 December.
"The Consumer Price Index continues to be relatively high."
Pedro Solbes, one of the government’s vice-presidents and Minister of Economy, stated that the rise in the Consumer Price Index to 4,1 % in November is only “temporary in nature”, but at the same time predicted that the price index is expected to show a “relatively high” value in the coming months as well.
In Parliament's corridors, Solbes confirmed that "although the indicator is not really favourable", the inflation rate in Spain has remained at a level more or less the same in recent years within the monetary union.
He also added that the month of November brought “seventys” to the previous month, when the Government did not expect such a large increase.
“We expected a value of around 4%” in connection with the data published today by the Minister of Economy.
Northern Rock aims to raise 42 billion euros in three years.
Northern Rock deposits have fallen by more than 50% and are currently only 12 billion pounds (EUR 16 billion,800 million) since it was in crisis in mid-September and had to borrow from the National Bank of England.
At the time, it had a record number of deposits of more than 25 billion pounds, the number of which gradually declined over the past two and a half months due to the loss of customer confidence, despite the fact that the Government promised the bank a one hundred percent guarantee until the end of the crisis.
Virgin will operate this unit under its own financial and commercial name Virgin Money. Virgin will have to acquire about a quarter of the revenues of British banks over the next three years to raise the remaining 18 billion pounds, reaching the target of 30 billion.
Richard Branson’s group, a highly respected businessman known for his high-noscious advertising campaigns in England, intends to spend about 50 million pounds (i.e. 70 million euros) on advertising and marketing a year in order to achieve the goal he has set.
Northern Rock this week highlighted the offer of the Virgin consortium as the most favorable to avoid bankruptcy. In addition to Virgin, three other companies make up the consortium.
Totana mayor arrested for alleged corruption
Earlier this morning, the Gendariar arrested the mayor of Totana (People’s Party) in Murcia province for allegedly being involved in the city’s corruption scandal that erupted this week.
An other member of the City Hall and the police chief of the town were arrested.
José Martínez Andreo, a former member of the city council, took over the place of Juan Morales, a member of the European People’s Party in May, who, according to official bodies interviewed by the SER radio channel, may have been the head of the corruption network.
The police continue to investigate the city’s offices and the Urban Development Council, and it cannot be ruled out that further arrests are expected.
Juan Morales’ lawyer was also investigated as the main suspect in the corruption scandal that erupted this week.
According to SER radio station, Juan Morales’ lawyer was arrested while he was leaving Morales with corruption documentation in his bag.
According to police sources, the subject of the investigation is the alleged commission that Morales received in exchange for signing an urban development agreement with a construction company in Galicia on the reclassification of 200 hectares of land.
Eight people are currently under arrest.
Bono accepts the PSOE’s candidacy in Toledo and Parliamentary President if they win the elections.
Former Defense Minister José Bono has accepted an offer from the Prime Minister and the Socialist Party Secretary General José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero to lead the PSOE list in the next parliamentary elections and to hold the presidency of parliament if the Socialists win the elections.
This was announced by PSOE’s Organizational Secretary José Blanci at a press conference and confirmed by Bono himself at the party’s federal headquarters at noon after a meeting with Zapatero at noon.
The head of government justified his election on the former minister by saying that “we have to count on the best in politics” and Bono is “on among the best”.
He added that “probably” the Manchai politician will be the candidate of the Socialist Party for the presidency of the Parliament if the Socialists win in the upcoming elections.
Bono would take the place of the current parliamentary president Manuel Marín, who announced on 15 November that he did not intend to run in the next elections and, giving up his political career, would rather fight climate change in scientific circles.
The former minister acknowledged that the head of government was constantly besieging him to return to the political scene since he abandoned active politics two years ago.
He also added that since the voters are aware of who will be the vice-president of the economy in the event of the Socialists’ victory, the party also wanted to inform them in the “point of transparency” who will be the Speaker of Parliament.
If Bono really turns the post on the post, he would like Parliament to be “a place of respect and not insulting or shouting” and would be more like a citizen’s home.
“Of the time, unfortunately, it seems that Parliament is the only place in Madrid where it is not possible to talk in peace, and the President’s speech has been interrupted 26 times in the Senate.”
At the same time, he praised the current president, Manuel Marín, for his “excellent work”, but he did not want to present himself as president, so that his opponents would not consider him “dominant.”
Campaign for the Climate
Since the climate change movement relentlessly persecutes both those who behave skeptically against their predictions, and those who prefer political or social battles, must be very strong.
In fact, he must also bring on his side a political leader such as the head of government, Zapatero, who believes that the movement is more important than the struggle against Islamic terrorism, and that he proclaims that “we must conclude a new agreement with our Earth”.
However, this remark raises the question of the extent to which the activity or inactivity of its government has contributed to the fact that Spain is at the forefront of the non-measurement of the Kyoto Protocol within the Union.
Who is responsible for non-compliance with the agreement, which sector they concern, and why did the Government not seek to avoid this?
In addition, it should also clearly explain to the Spaniards what measures it intends to take to curb climate change.
Which companies will be affected by these measures, what habits of the population will have to change, what individual and social level of energy saving we have to expect, and what economic consequences will this have?
So who has to make sacrifices and who has to pay to save our Earth?
But we have not received and will not be able to explain these questions.
Precisely because it's sacrificing and money.
Climate changes have taken measures, actual measures are always unpopular.
They are expensive, inconvenient and costly for both companies and the general public.
Even the PSOE gasoline price increase would have been so unpopular before the election that Zapatero quickly withdrew.
That is, we must save the Earth from nothing, merely propaganda texts, empty, unrealistic slogans.
Conventions, committees, protocols, new positions.
With the agreement with the Earth, as the Prime Minister says, who speaks so nicely in the election campaign, does not demand, does not attack, and even beautifies the electoral assemblies and awakens tenderness in us.

Totana mayor and police chief arrested for alleged corruption case
The Gendarmerie has arrested the mayor of Totana, the EPP’s José Martínez Andrea, the local police chief, the secretary of the City Hall and a catering entrepreneur for crimes related to urban development, police sources informed today.
The mayor was arrested in his home and then transferred to the City Hall, and is currently with several police officers, many of whom are investigating the Urban Development Council and the municipal body responsible for the management of Industrial Estates and Housings.
The three arrests were preceded by the arrest of six people in Galicia, Madrid and Murcia on Monday in connection with a case in which two hectares of agricultural land were reclassified as reclassified as reclassifiable areas to allow the Galician company to build 4,000 homes after paying executives illegally to the executives during their previous mandate.
Two other persons have not yet been arrested, but are under investigation, according to the Documentary Court of Totana.
The six first arrested were handed over to the court.
According to official sources, the former mayor of Totana is Juan Morales, who is now an independent member of the EPP, is also under investigation.
The ex-wife, who owns a property agency registered in Totana, is also being investigated, as is the former mayor’s current girlfriend, who lives in Murcia’s provincial headquarters.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, Manuel N.A., a lawyer and entrepreneur, was arrested in Nigran (Ponertevedra), along with the director of the Suelo de Inmonuar company, Pablo José M.G. The latter company also belongs to the Nuaria Group and has been responsible through it.
The investigation is carried out by a group of crimes committed at the local government level by the members of the Operational Central Unit of the Gendarmerie, which, in addition to the arrests, carried out eleven searches, primarily at companies linked to those arrested, which operate in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
In Totana, only one person was arrested: the owner of a well-known poultry company in the area who may have played an intermediary role in the case.
The Nuaria Group was supposed to create the largest residential park in the city of Totana, with 5,000 apartments, a golf course and two wellness hotels.
The company acquired an area of 2.2 million square meters in Totana, which was reclassified. The project would have doubled the population of the city, which currently has a population of 25,000.
The Nuaria Group includes companies such as Autesa e Inomonuar, in Vigo, Conycase, which is in charge of parking lots in Coruna, Venezuelan streets and Catholic Ferdinand Square, and Preconiza, which specializes in direct marketing, and Preconiza, which specializes in the sale, promotion and installation of building elements.

If you agree, we'll put aside the Book of the Month and see if we can learn some philosophical knowledge and wisdom.
I've already armed with one.
People, life is a constant change.
Of course, everyone can think of something for themselves.

Our Finnish correspondent found this commentary in one of Finland’s largest daily newspapers: (certainly at the head of the PISA report on the level of literacy in the world), Helsingin Sanomat, referring to what was published on November 18 with the criticism of Blackburn’s book.
“The philosophical teachings came to the public after the tragedy of the Jokela High School.
The killer, a student before graduation, quoted Plato and Nietzsche in his messages.
On the pages of the Helsingin Sanomat daily, the Education Councilor, Pekka Elo, who was tasked with the teachings of philosophy, demanded that teachers examine Plato’s teachings with a critical eye, adding that Nietzsche’s knowledge is not necessarily important in the compulsory basic philosophy classes of secondary schools.”

One of his colleagues informs us that the Criminal Code contains the misdemeanor related to Internet downloads:
A. Downloading a song is considered a misdemeanor and can be punished for six months from one year.
However, if you steal a record of less than 400 euros in a store, it is only a violation (Article 623.1).
B. If you are stealing in a store worth EUR 1000, theft is already a misdemeanor, but your sentence is still not the amount of the penalty that can be imposed for downloading online (Article 234 BTK).
C. If you steal a car but return it back in 40 hours, the penalty still does not reach the penalty for downloading the Internet (Article 244.1).
D. You can expect a minor penalty if you get into a fight than if you copy CDs.
If you take part in a mass fight, you can be sentenced to three months to one year (Article 154 BTK), but a fine of six months to two years for copying the CD
(Article 270 of the BTK).
E. According to Article 184.2 of BTK, sexual harassment in the workplace is not as serious as a DVD movie download.
F. The distribution of copyrighted films without the consent of the authors is more severely punished than the sale of pornographic materials to minors (Article 186).
If my colleague is right, someone has very much out of control.

My family doctor gave me an article about strange research with the following address: "Money causes brain activity, especially if the others have less of it."
That is, the feelings of the employees on a payday depend on how much the others have received.
The experiment was conducted at Bonn University by measuring magnetic resonances by measuring tomography, and the results were published in the latest issue of Science.
The study’s author and Bernd Weber, the head of the Life&Brain Institute’s Neurocognition Group in Germany, said: “We measured the strongest activity when the participant responded correctly, but his partner made a mistake.”
The researchers found that if they both responded the correct answer and received the same amount of money, the brain activity was moderate, but if one of them received a double amount, the activity was also intensified.
I have no idea why such a great science was needed for such a simple conclusion.
The Attorney General of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly persecuting Balkan war criminals from the prosecutor’s office of the Criminal Court in The Hague and the Criminal Court, which investigates crimes in the former Yugoslavia.
His term expires at the end of the year and Carla leaves with a slightly bitter taste, as those responsible for the Srebrenica massacre, during which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims were massacred, i.e. General Ratko Mladic and the Bosnian leader Radován Karadzic in Serbia are still at large.
Their names are on the list of Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach named his documentary: Carla's List (2006, not yet premiered in Spain). The film follows the Swiss Attorney General’s work from Belgrade to New York as the film tries to pressure the governments concerned to hold a noose around the fleeing culprits.
What insurance is right for me?
Motor insurance, which means safety for the owner of the vehicle, brings significant costs to the owner of various damages and depends on several factors, such as age, gender, driving licence, marital status, type and scope of use of the vehicle to be provided.
Buying a car is only the first step.
In fact, choosing the right insurance is often harder than deciding what kind of car you want.
First of all, we need to know what it is about.
The vehicle insurance is an agreement between the insurance company and the insured.
This agreement is embodied in the form of an insurance contract, which states that the insurance company undertakes the compensation for the fixed insurance premium in the event of the occurrence of the damage.
The insurance premium is practically the amount paid for insurance, which is determined taking into account various factors, such as age, gender, date of obtaining a driving licence, marital status, type of car to be insured, its use, and so on.
Insurance companies determine the insurance premium on the basis of the statistics, i.e. a higher amount is paid by those who represent a higher risk of accidents.
That’s why people over the age of 25 or women pay less, because according to statistics, they pose a lower risk because they are more cautious.
Similarly, according to the statements, insurance companies have concluded that married people cause fewer accidents than lonely people.
Frequency is decisive for the type of car.
More frequent use increases the possibility of an accident.
When determining the insurance premium, a number of factors are taken into account by insurance companies.
Therefore, the owner must carefully look into it to choose the most appropriate form of insurance for his profile.
The following will be presented with the most important factors in the selection, so that it is best to adapt to the needs of the insured and to create an acceptable price.
When concluding an insurance contract, people under the age of 25 have to face a number of disadvantages, such as the lack of driving experience and the freshness of driving licences.
Although it is best to be insured against all dangers, there are also more economical solutions.
Careful managers can take out complete insurance with a self-sufficiency, ensuring against all hazards, and the price will also be affordable.
In this type of contract, the insured pays part of the damage.
"The amount of the deductible payable by the insured depends on the insurance premium; the higher the premium, the lower the deductible," says Luis Noguera, head of the Internet insurance intermediary in Spain at First Europa.
Another option is liability insurance extended to third parties, when the customer insures himself against the damage caused to others, but not against the damage caused to his own car.
In addition, it will be assured of theft, fire damage and the loss of the car.
- A good word of advice.
If you are not yet 25 years old, be careful and preferably avoid accidents, as this affects the bonus and thus reduce the amounts to be paid in the future.
Bonus is called the discounts provided in relation to the underlying tariff of the insurance company.
The penalty charged compared to the basic tariff is called the málusz.
"The amount of bonus and foliage depends on the insurance company and your profits.
If the company has had a good year, you can afford to increase the bonus,” Noguera explains.
Once the age limit of 25 has been exceeded, it is easier for the owners to take out adequate insurance, as the risk of an accident decreases due to the experience gained over the years.
At this time, we advise you to take out complete insurance with your own.
“Usually, young people are not yet able to properly apply their experience during an accident or even in driving,” says the director of the European insurance company in Spain, adding that most accidents occur in the second year of driving, when drivers have already overcome the fears of beginners.
If the insured is already married but does not have children yet, it is best to take out complete insurance, of course, if its financial options allow it.
Insurance companies consider married couples with children as the lowest-risk customers, so in their case the fee payable is also lower.
In this case, it is best to have complete insurance with a self-sufficiency (which can reach 300 euros), or if they have a higher bonus, they can extend the insurance from the third year of the vehicle to the damage caused to others.
“They drive more calmly, but they have more customer power and they can afford to have a higher deductible,” confirms Luis Noguera.
In the case of pensioners, we recommend complete insurance with a self-sufficiency (which is around 150 euros) or, in the case of a higher bonus, it can be extended to liability insurance.
Car insurance is a very important thing, not only because it means protection for the owner in the event of damage events, but also because it means a large expense, so it is essential to choose the personalized form of insurance properly.
Celtic want to score points in Milan to qualify for the eighth round.
Milan and Celtic will compete against San Siro Stadium on Tuesday to score the missing point at the Champions League. The Italians could be the first, and the Scots can qualify.
The Italians have a total of ten points and already in the fifth round they secured the qualifying match with a draw with Portugal, but Celtic has nine points, but it would take one more to prevent the six-point Shakhtar, who will fight the four-point Benfica, not to overtake.
The two matches of Group D will be held a week before the end of the sixth round, as Milán will have to play in Japan at the Club World Cup, where he will try to qualify for the 16th final in the semi-finals on the 13th.
Group D will be over before the others, and although the most likely result in Giuseppe Meazza will be the draw, the two teams are aiming for the victory, as the Italians do not want to be left behind at home, and Celtic will be the first to start from a better place in the eighth final.
Gordon Strachan’s team is even enough to qualify if Shakhtar does not win, but it can’t be sure, because if there is a point equality, the Ukrainians who lost in Glasgow last week (2-1) but won the next match (2-0).
The Italians will try to make the evening of the Scots bitter, who would like to make it to the eighth round of the reorganized Champions League twice in a row, after they lost there in the previous season with a goal from Kaka in the extra time after the 0-0 draw (1-0).
Shakhtar would be most pleased with the victory of the "Rossoners", because if Celtic loses in the eighth round and stay in UEFA.
Since Benfica, despite the fact that he is currently in last place and has no chance of remaining in the European Championship, he can still take third place with a win to play in UEFA.
Twenty-nine people went to Vancouver to attend the first concert on the Spice Girls tour.
The Spice Girls began their tour in Vancouver, Canada, performing in front of 20,000 viewers for the first time since they broke up in 2000.
"Posh Spice" (Victoria Beckham), "Scary Spice" (Melanie Brown), "Baby Spice" (Emma Bunton), "Sporty Spice" (Melanie Chisholm) and "Geri Halliwell" (Geri Halliwell) announced a few minutes before the concert in GM Place, vancouper, that the ensemble was "in fact in a "mere form".
Approximately 20,000 people bought tickets to attend the concert, where a video was also presented about the history of the band in the 1990s.
Simultaneously with the band's re-combination and tour, EMI released a new album in Spain, featuring major hits and two new songs "Headlines" and "Voodoo".
Five members of the Spice Girls took the stage in the bracelet given to him by "Posh Spice" husband, British footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was also present in the crowded auditorium of GM Place, although Victoria had banned him a few days earlier.
When the performance was announced, Victoria Beckham said that the British football star “didn’t see our costume yet, so I’m nervous about what she’ll think about the performance.”
'Sporty Spice' was the reason why the band disbanded two years after he left the band in 1998 "because the members didn't understand each other." He also seemed nervous during the press conference, which was held two hours before the concert.
"I was scared.
I was nervous, but I saw people's feelings for the Spice Girls change.
I thought, why not? Now I’m glad I decided to do that,” Chisholm said of the band, which was disbanded nine years earlier.
The singer also added that in the meantime, “things are arranged and we love each other very much”.
But a lot of things have changed since the last time the Spice Girls performed in 1998.
According to CTV television, the band arrived in Vancouver on Virgin Airlines’ plane.
A team of babysitters were waiting for them at the airport.
Five of them have seven children.
After the concert in Vancouver, the band will perform in California (USA) and then in San Jose (December 4) and Los Angeles (December 5). and 7)
Madrid will perform on December 23.
More fears about the Russian-Ukrainian gas dispute
The gas price dispute between Kreajna and Russia has renewed, which could also affect Russian fuel to be transported to Western Europe.
Most of the Russian gas exported to the European Union (EU) is transmitted through Ukraine and the disputes between the two nations are always attracted by great attention.
Kiev has stated that if Moscow raises the gas price to be paid by the Ukrainians, they will also impose higher transit costs on Russia.
As a result of a previous debate between the two countries last year, supplies to EU countries have declined.
The recent debate between Kiev and Moscow relates to the attempted agreement between the Ukrainian government and the Russian state-owned natural gas monopoly Gazprom, which is the price of gas to be paid by Ukraine to Russia in 2008.
Gazprom stated that it would have to make a 50% increase compared to the price agreement with Ukraine for gas produced from neighbouring Turkmenistan for 2008.
According to analysts, this could mean a 40% increase in the price of the shipment from Gazprom for Ukraine.
“It is important to argue in accordance with one of the most important natural gas transmission transit states during the negotiations,” Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinah told Reuters.
“The changes to gas prices should be linked to our debate on the level of transit through Ukraine (and heading for Western Europe).”
As a result of the latest major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom turned off the gas tap to Ukraine in January 2006.
This resulted in a domino-like decline in exports to Western Europe, which also pushed up prices to a large extent.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the European Union’s gas supply.
Russia has the world’s largest reserves of natural gas, but most of them are still unexplored.
As a result, Gazprom’s own gas supply is supplemented by natural gas from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet states in Central Asia.
The NHS is “to control foreign workers”
The Scottish NHS committees need to improve the control of the criminal records of workers from outside Europe, a supervisory body said.
The proposal came up with the proposal after a foreign national doctor was linked to an attack on Glasgow Airport in June.
Black also expressed concern that NHS Scotland does not have accurate data on the number of employees overseas.
At the same time, in his report, he also pointed out key checks that were properly carried out.
Following the attack on Glasgow Airport, the chief auditor checked a list of staff recruited outside the European Economic Area.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, a Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after a jeep crashed into the building’s main terminal.
Abdullah was one of three doctors interrogated by the Old Bailey court in October on charges of attempted vehicle bombing in the UK.
The NHS Committees shall verify the existence of the qualifications and work experience of the workers concerned before the start of employment for their employees from the overseas countries and their provision with the necessary authorisations for employment in the United Kingdom.
Although the Scottish Health Committees use Disclosure Scotland to verify the criminal record, the Agency is not entitled to obtain such information from outside the UK.
The report of the Chief Auditor also proposed, inter alia, that the committees should introduce a guide to the Criminal Records Office, which will facilitate the employer's control processes with different overseas countries.
“Although we found evidence of such checks among the records of the staff, they are not carried out regularly,” the report said.
According to Black, the Scottish NHS is following its own pre-employment screening process at a high level, he added: “Our report highlights the areas of the system that can be developed in order to provide up-to-date information on the number of NHS personnel from overseas.”
Dr. Dr. Peter Terry, president of BMA Scotland, said it was “extremely unrealistic” that prevent-employment checks could help identify potential NHS employees who could commit terrorist acts in the future.
“According to the report, the pre-employment checks currently used are working well in the NHS Scotland, and the value of the proposals is not yet transparent,” he added.
According to the Scottish health authorities, the current number of overseas employees, consisting of doctors and nurses, is 1,161.
However, the chief accounted for the fact that the figures are likely to be higher, which can be partly explained by the fact that the committees have a problem with the identification of employees on an indefinite period of leave.
The investigation also showed that the control procedures introduced in the Ayrshire and Arran regions, in Grampian, the Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and the NHS authorities in Lothian operate in a highly coordinated manner.
These procedures covered the verification of passports, work permits and certificates of qualification.
The Scottish Government is currently examining the directive and guidance on checks prior to the employment of employees of the NHS from the overseas countries.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: “I was delighted to have been successfully completed following the attack on Glasgow Airport.
He also added that the Scottish Government, in cooperation with the health committees, will take into account the proposals contained in the report and will ensure that the up-to-date guidance on pre-employment checks for the entire staff, including those from overseas, reflects the best practical application. The updated version is planned to be published next month.

Saudi Arabia Arrests 208 People Arrested in Terrorist Conspiracy
Saudi Arabia reported yesterday that 208 militants involved in terrorist cells were arrested, planning to carry out an imminent attack on an oil facility and several strikes on clerks and security forces.
State television from the world’s largest oil exporter said one of the cells wanted to smuggle missiles.
Al-Qaeda has launched a campaign of the monarchy, which has been an ally of the United States since the invasion of Iraq in 2003.
According to the television report, an eight-member cell led by a foreign national is planning to launch an attack on an oil facility in the eastern province.
After an attack on the world’s largest oil processing plant in Abqaiq in 2006, Saudi Arabia began building a 35,000-strong rapid response force to protect facilities.
According to a report citing the words of the Minister of the Interior, 18 of the detainees belong to a cell led by a person who crosses the border illegally and specializes in “set-shots”.
The report also reported that the fighters tried to smuggle eight bullets into the kingdom.
Twenty-two of the detainees plotted to carry out attacks on church leaders and security forces.
The government has called on church leaders to stop Saudis who are influencing the flow of Iraq to Al-Qaeda fighters to crack down on the Allied forces and the U.S.-backed Shia Muslim government. The latter is considered to be the Saudi hard-line Sunnis as heretics.
Al-Qaeda fighters see a significant part of the church leaders in Saudi Arabia as involved in support of the policies of the royal family that governs the government.
The group’s fighters, inspired by the request of Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born leader of Al-Qaeda, aimed to target the pro-Western Saudi government, foreign settlements, government buildings and energy facilities.
“Financial forces have made huge efforts over the past... five months,” a spokesman for the interior ministry told state television.
During the arrests, a 16-person "media cell" was also captured in Medina, which aimed to spread "takfiri's thinking". The tafir’s thinking is the ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals, which supports the violence against Muslims stigmatized and unfaithful.
The arrestees also included 32 people accused of financial support for militants.
The climate of Venus can provide an outlook on the future of the Earth
Scientists said yesterday that Venus once provided a pleasant living conditions.
Data from a European circulating spacecraft suggest that this planet is more of a capricious twin of the Earth than previously thought.
Venus is the closest planetary neighbor to Earth.
The two planets are almost the same size and similar orbits, although Venus is slightly closer to the Sun.
As scientists know today, billions of years ago, Venus could have very similar living conditions on Earth and even the habitable conditions may have been given.
However, due to the extremely high carbon-glass housing effect, the atmospheric erosion caused by the solar radiation and the smaller rotational wounds of the planet, Venus entered a completely different developmental path.
Today, the planet has evaporated, its surface temperature is hot enough to melt lead, and hurricane-force winds and lightning storms are devastating.
The findings of the European Space Agency’s Venus Express spacecraft, based on a year-long study of the planet, paint a sobering picture of how similar catastrophic climate changes can occur on Earth.
Fred Taylor, a professor at the Department of Physics at Oxford University and one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: “Grave to see why the climate of Venus differs so largely from the experience on Earth, despite the fact that the two planets are otherwise very similar.
“With the help of our new data, it was possible to develop a scenario for the development of Venus billions of years ago, when it had habitable conditions similar to that of the Earth.
"enriched uranium" seized by the police
A kilo of radioactive material – according to reports of enriched uranium – was seized by the Slovak and Hungarian police yesterday.
A police spokesman said three people had been arrested and the material was examined.
The spokesman did not confirm whether it was an enriched uranium, but stated that the material could have been sold for 1 million dollars (480 000 pounds).
Opened gates
Mitt Romney says he is not worthy of a presidential election candidate to answer questions from a snowman.
However, Republican candidates for the presidential election agreed to participate in a YouTube-streamed debate, in which ordinary voters recorded their questions on video and forwarded them to the candidates.
None of the questions submitted on Wednesday night, November 28, proved to be as ridiculous as that of the snowman, who asked Democrats about global warming in the other party’s YouTube debate.
However, the questions and answers this time reflected the situation of the Republican party approaching next year’s election.
It is not yet known exactly what the production managers of CNN, which co-finaled the debate, selected the YouTube clips submitted to the candidates.
The longest issue of the first half hour of the debate dealt with immigration.
This is one of the Republican steeds.
CNN asked some insecure voters to dial a number if they were told, the mediator had an outstanding consensus when the candidates spoke harshly about the border issue.
The most vivid and long-lasting dispute was between Rudy Giuliani, a national leader, and Romney, who was advancing in decisive primary elections in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani is trying to change the image of him that under his mayorship in New York City, he was too lightly handled the issue of illegal immigration.
He accused Romney of hiring illegal immigrants to build his house.
The word battle between the two became particularly fierce when the interviewers inquired about the support of the "amnesty" (which would give illegal immigrants the permanent status and the possibility of citizenship).
Some candidates with fewer votes, such as Duncan Hunter of California and Tom Tancredo, Colorado, have managed to get into the subject.
And although none of them are considered to be the favourites, their stay on the race track may be explained by the fact that they started to ring the bell that sounding the immigration sounder sooner and louder than the others.
At least on the issue of immigration, there is a broad consensus among the candidates: a common goal is to strengthen borders and to take tough action against illegal immigrants.
This topic, like the fear of Chinese toxic toys and other disturbing factors from the outside world, will help the divisions between libertarians and Christian conservatives to be forgotten or minimized.
However, when other topics came to the fore, the debate became very unpleasant.
Giuliani was faced with the question of why he had previously supported gun control.
John McCain and Romney argued that simulated drowning should be considered torture.
Another questioner wondered if candidates would believe all the words of the Bible.
In this question, Giuliani clung to the point of view that although he considered the Bible as his favorite book, he might not interpret the story of Jonah and the whale literally.
Another question was whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee, who won the first place in the iowa election, who owed his victory to his persevering Christian conservatism, responded to expectations as a result of the death penalty being painful, but necessary.
When asked if Jesus would receive enough support, he laughed and said that Jesus was wiser than running in elections.
The competition is still unusually open.
The dynamic upswing of Huckabee in iowa coincides with the Libertarian Ron Paul’s money-gathering action and the enthusiastic cheering surrounding him during Wednesday’s debate.
The sudden rise of the two candidates can be explained by the fact that the two wings of the party have not yet succeeded in running a joint candidate from the more well-known and more traditional aspirant.
In 1980 and 2000, there was a candidate who united the party, who in time and convincingly shouted the victory message proclaiming the greatness of America, and who found common voice with both wings of the party.
Now, however, the party is divided, and the consequences of this are still unpredictable.
Labour pains
Another gap is gap between Gordon Brown; the way out is unchanged
Compared to the British political scandals, the current one does not seem to be too spicy.
No one sold his honor, no politician’s hotel accounts in Paris were found, and no one committed an extramarital scandal.
But the discovery that a wealthy businessman, for more than four years under the names of others, contributed to the Workers’ Party, which governs Britain, with an amount of more than 650,000 pounds (1.3 million dollars), and that the party did not report on this, is one of the things that the circumstigated Gordon Brown would have been well.
Two months ago, when the Prime Minister escaped the election, and when his statement that opinion polls had no influence on the outcome of the decision, he recklessly questioned the intellectual ability of the British, people still hoped that Brown would provide a strong and effective governance.
Instead, however, as Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrats’ deputy headline, remarked with increasingly witty remarks, the once dreaded Brown from Stalin, Mr. Bean's was transformed.
The mistake to save the distressed bank, Northern Rock, has put regulatory weaknesses and judgment gaps in the crossfire.
The sickly proposed amendments to the tax law encouraged business interest groups to join forces with the government.
The loss by the tax authority, affecting the personal data of 25 million people, revealed an unimaginable degree of administrative clumsiness.
In the House of Lords, three retired generals incited sedation, protesting against the reduction of the army budget, declaring that the position of the Minister of Defence was part-time occupation.
And now here are the mysterious donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Labour Secretary General (formerly administrative leader), has already resigned.
These accidents do not mean that Brown cannot turn back on the way to the exit.
At the same time, governments can reach the point wherevering control is impossible.
People don’t like politicians and don’t trust them, but when a new group comes to power, they usually suspend their unbelief.
However, as it becomes clear that the Prime Minister is unlikely to be able to advance things, and that he may not remain in his post for a long time, the suspended unbelief is over: the civil servants will start to leak it, the Cabinet Ministers will take briefings, the press will look for bad-mouthed news; and the government will start defending and will be unable to concentrate.
In a sense, Brown is in a particularly difficult situation, as unlike other political leaders, he is not considered "fresh blood."
As much as he wants to deny his relationship with Tony Blair, he was his right-hand man.
The problems surrounding the Northern Rock and the tax office records, for example, are linked to decisions that Brown made during Brown’s office.
And although Blair’s missteps, such as the protracted investigation of the relationship between “money nobility” and political party financing, was not directly involved, voters may rightly assume the opposite.
Although Brown's position is really unpleasant, it's not as embarrassing as it seems.
The blunders they make are not as frightening as the torsa says.
Just like Mr. Reese. In Bean's case, no one died, no one was taken directly.
Compensation, as much as it is painful, can be the creation of the tendencies that Stalin has always promised in Brown: a reliable, solid and slightly hard-handed steering.
Good, for example, serves the fuss about political donation.
The turbo-like mysterious Abrahams, who compares his donation to charity, said he did not want to disclose his good deed to the public.
Perhaps it is true, but the decision was not within his competence.
The law prohibiting the anonymity of large political supporters is clear and clear: the population has the right to know who knocks on the door of the country’s leaders.
Watt, who, according to his own account, knew of Abrahams’ actions, was not aware of his illegal nature, he would certainly be sweated during the interrogations; as well as Jon Medleson, the Labour Party’s foundation leader, who learned of the confusing donations in October.
Brown, on the other hand, is not in the lead for the time being: there is no indication that he knew about these cyclists, not even the fact that the huge sums were paid after Brown took office in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has fulfilled half of his duties.
Although he soon condemned the violation committed by his party, he diluted his firmness by using a familiar means of dealing with the case, he commissioned a commission chaired by a retired bishop and a judge, just in case.
In this story, the "leather lesson" is not too complicated.
In the event of a breach of the law, the police are competent.
Brown also needs to fix other things, such as the appointment of the chairman of an independent committee on administrative rules that have been running for six months without a leader or an advance on effective reform of political party funding.
This would require the hard-boiled Labour Party to cooperate with the Tori and break with special financial relations related to the associations - this would be a tough wall for Brown, which would be a tough wall for the party-loyal Brown.
But you should face some of the party-related facts.
Conservatives are currently leading with a major lead; Brown has two years to reclaim voters; the only way to get the victory is impeccable integrity and strong competence.
Card sharks
Is the second-market mortgage crisis threatening America’s credit card market?
When blood gets into the water, it is natural that sharks appear nearby.
Now that the U.S. housing market is indisaptrum, predators are focusing on the country’s credit card market.
Goldman Sachs analysts believe that if the mortgage crisis infects other forms of retail loans, the loss of the credit card market could reach as much as 99 billion dollars.
The signs of tension are clearly visible.
Both the write-down rate on the proportion of irrecoverable loans and the default rate indicating the proportion of late payments over 30 days has increased.
Last month, HSBC reported a loss of USD 1.4 billion in the U.S. consumption finance segment, partly due to cardholders’ financial weakness.
Panic is too early.
The percentage of write-offs and late payments remains low.
The 3.89% late payment rate calculated by the rating agency Moody's for the third quarter is one full percentage point lower than the historical average.
The decrease in the rates can be partly explained by technical factors.
The amendment of the U.S. rules of inefficiency in 2005 resulted in a sudden decrease in the number of insolvency applicants, but caused a large loss in the credit card market; the number of bankruptcies (and thus the write-down rate) is expected to increase again, regardless of whether the totality of borrowing conditions deteriorate or not.
The salary rate, which shows the rate of consumer monthly loan repayment, is also solid in the market.
In addition, trust in credit card-backed securities is quite strong, despite the parasitization in other areas of structured financing.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup estimates that the 2007 output volume will be 25% higher than last year.
The signs of the impact of the mortgage crisis are clear on the credit card market: consumers are increasing the debt on credit cards to repay home loans.
At the same time, card issuers primarily monitor the flow of money and not the asset value, so the fall in house prices does not necessarily cause a change in the creditworthiness of borrowers.
Creditors may even benefit from the situation.
If the property is worth less than the value of the mortgage loan, the incentive for consumers to repay the loan is reduced; as a result, the repayment of debts on credit cards will be higher in the priority ranking.
By changing interest rates or lending limits, card issuers can adapt to changing conditions faster and more flexibly than mortgage lenders.
Theoretically, this should reduce the risk of abrupt re-evaluation of assets.
“It’s unlikely that one day we’ll wake up to completely re-evaluate the loans,” says Gary Perlin, Chief Financial Officer of Capital One.
If a subprime-like sudden crisis in the credit card market is less likely, the risk of a gradual decline is much more likely.
If the downward drop in housing prices and the downturn in lending bring America into recession, the industry will undoubtedly face a harsh future.
It is worth watching those predatory fins.
British bankers plead guilty in the Enron case
On Wednesday, three British bankers were brought to justice to investigate their role in fraud involving the fraud of former Enron CFO Andrew Faston.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew initially pleaded not guilty to seven counts of fraud, according to which they allegedly cooperated with Fastow in a secret fraud committed in 2000 to make them rich at the expense of their employer.
Their trial began in January.
But at a court hearing, U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., all of them pleaded guilty to one-off fraud.
Three former employees of the Greenwich NatWest division of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group became known in the UK during the two-year extradition process.
The investigation into the case launched after Enron’s collapse in 2001 is yet to be completed in the United States.
In 2002, he warned Fastow that he was one of the targets of a government investigation into the bankruptcy of Enron.
The three brokers, dubbed "NatWest-iever", traveled to Houston in 2000 in 2000 to prepare fraud with Fastow and Fastow's then-right-hand Michael Kopper.
Fastow, who was responsible for plotting the countless frauds that went bankrupt, also controlled the Enron subsidiary, into which Greenwich NatWest had invested.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank was unaware of any shares in the subsidiary, but the three British men knew well that the stake was very large.
A company managed by Kopper has acquired the bank’s share of the subsidiary of USD 1 million.
The bankers paid Kopper 250,000 dollars to get a stake in this company.
According to the prosecution, Fastow falsely informed Enron that the energy company would buy the share of the subsidiary of Greenwich NatWest, worth 20 million dollars.
But in fact, the 20 million dollars was the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bill said the bankers had 7.3 million dollars, while Fastow, Kopper and others received 12.3 million dollars.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded two counts of his role in the collapse of Enron.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is currently serving a six-year sentence in a federal prison in Luisiana.
Kopper is serving a three-year and one-month sentence in a Texas prison.
The three Englishmen were allowed to travel to the United States for a bail of USD 1 million each, where they are staying during the trial.
Enron, the seventh-largest U.S. company, had filed for bankruptcy in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks failed to cover up the millions of debts and declining, but in fact, loss-making businesses.
As a result of the collapse, thousands of jobs were lost, the market value was reduced by more than 60 billion dollars, and the value of pension funds has fallen by more than 2 billion dollars.
Kenneth Lay, the founder of Enron, and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling, were convicted last year for their complicity in the company’s bankruptcy.
Skilling is currently serving a prison sentence of more than 24 years.
The conspiracy, fraud and other allegations imposed on Lay were lifted after the man’s death last year.
There is no poverty in Moscow.
A Gulfstream G550 aircraft with a Rolls-Royce engine starts at 54 million dollars, which will run the road between Moscow and Los Angeles with a tank without interruption.
But this amount is only a small change for some Russian rich.
“It can hold 18 passengers,” said Dan Firer, a representative of Gulfstream.
“But no one orders so many seats because they buy machines for private families or business leaders.”
Mr. Crawford. Firer counted on the visitors at the four-day, exclusive Millionaire Fair, which was held in the huge exhibition hall around the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury goods suppliers rented booths at the exhibition, hoping that the Russian new rich would be interested in everything, from mahogany-covered yachts to diamond-covered radiator grilles worth 50 cents.
Mr. Crawford. Firer carefully watched the bright orange Porsche on display at the booth next to it.
“It’s a nice car, but it’s not even worth the trail of our products,” he said.
“Private aircraft have the largest market in Russia after the United States.”
It seems that the Russian capital is swimming in money like Dallas did in its heyday, at the time of the oil price explosion.
“We went through a similar process in the 1890s, when some American millionaires went to Europe. These Americans were considered financialistic,” said Marshall Goldman, senior fellow at Harvard University’s Russian and Eurasian Davis Center.
Like the thieves of the 1970s in Saudi Arabia and the Japanese gamblers of the 1990s, the Russians have now become the most spectacular spendingrs in the world.
The most exclusive luxury brands are demanding their share of the gold rush.
At another Moscow venue, at a conference organized by the luxury industry, Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the president of LVMH, shared his views on how to sell high-value products in markets similar to those in Russia.
(The conference was organized by The International Herald Tribune, which is owned by The New York Times.)
According to Forbes, the richest people, there are 53 billionaires in Russia with a total of 282 billion dollars.
In addition, the number of second-class Russian millionaires reaches 103,000, who can own a total of 670 billion dollars, according to a study conducted by economists at the Centre for Economic and Financial Research, analyzing personal welfare development in the former Soviet Union.
(Based on the World Bank, the number of people living below the subsistence level in Russia was 15.8 percent in 2005.)
“There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow, which is why we are all here,” said Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative at the David Morris jewellery store in London.
Nicole participated in the fair for the first time with the brand’s Russian distributor, Soho Jewelry Group.
"All women are impeccably well-groomed, and men are a real treasure trove."
On Sunday evening in the halls, two real estate agents, 21-year-old Evgenia Yumatova and 26-year-old Svetlana Turovtsova, both own and their clients, were allied as millionaires.
“I’ve looked at the cars and I’m trying to make a decision between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche,” said Yumatova, who was cheeky and cheeky in his uniquely designed dress, as if he was used to this hype.
The fair was primarily organized for the new rich, for brand-oriented Russian customers who are willing to walk around a draught, cycas decorated site after several hours spent on the market, where they can find Cadillac Escaleds, platinum pocket knitting, Mövenpick ice cream, usual billiard tables, Dubai apartments and Gund teddy bears at the same time.
For the average person, the ticket costs 30 euros (44.57 dollars).
“The Russians like to know which brands are the most expensive and the best,” said Mr. Gijrath, who took a patriotic look at the stand of the Dutch porcelain manufacturer, Royal Delft, as opposed to a wall-sized, hand-decorated, blue-wat imitated Rembrandt.
“The Russians are more interested in the conspicuous things.”
Indeed, the sellers here said that the long-gold Russians (based on the Russian standards for 10-15 years) have already shifted from the flagrant logos to trifle, limited-edition brands that would not get into a trade fair.
Still, thousands of people, including millionaires, millionaires and tourists, filled the room every day.
And some of them bought.
Last Thursday, Roman Ershov, director of King Koil’s bedmaking company, said the day he sold two mattresses made of silk, cashmere and cotton, made with gold threads, made of silk, cashmere and cotton.
Also on the evening of the first day, Mikhail Lyubiumov, A1 Moto, a sales officer for high-quality cars with modern alarm, reported that his company sold the shiny orange Porsche to a Russian millionaire for 170,000 dollars.
Andrei Karapetian, luxury car manufacturer, L.A. The president of Connection sold three grille to Rolls-Royce Phantoms on Sunday afternoon. The grids resemble connected chain bracelets and each cost 55,000 dollars.
He also showed reporters a wheel made for a Russian casino owner, which Swarovski said he had with crystals to create the appearance of a roulette wheel.
The price of a set of four pieces is 22 thousand dollars.
“The Russian millionaire who wants wheels of ostrich leather and a picture of his wife’s face from a zirconium cube may not use these items,” Karapetian said.
"He'll be in the garage of 30-40 cars."
Despite the fact that many of its Russian clients are rich, Karapetian says the term "Russian millionaire" is not a big privilege nowadays, given the rapid rise in property prices there.
“Anyone who bought a property in Moscow four or five years ago is most likely a millionaire, if not in money, or at least on paper,” he said.
"There are more than you think."
Those who are not millionaires must have at least created the appearance of wealth in front of the stand of the Russian asset management company Alliance Continental.
The company has built four English-style telephone booths, which were overwhelmed with millions of counterfeit dollar bills.
Azad Karryev, the company’s marketing manager, said his team had printed 500,000 counterfeit banknotes to the Millionaire Fair.
Many of the visitors stopped playing with the money. Many people have taken photos of themselves with their mobile phones as they browse in the crowd of money or just put a few million in their pockets.
“You see, everyone in Moscow can feel like a millionaire,” Karryev said.
Surgical malpractice suspected of death in New Jersey
The day before Thanksgiving, Ronald Livingston looked out the window of a restaurant called "Just a Little Healthier" and saw an ambulance stop on Cape Cod two doors down West Scott Avenue.
Shortly after, a police patrol truck arrived.
And then another one.
“Then I saw the doctor’s car stop,” said Livingston, one of the inspectors at the restaurant.
"I knew someone was dead."
Authorities have learned that the dead woman is 41 years old and is called Olga Arroyo. She previously worked as the chief assistant of the director of the Newark Police Department.
The investigation is currently underway to determine whether the death was caused by an unlicensed cosmetic surgeon working under 212 on the unauthorized operation of West Scott Avenue, which is not identified by the police.
Authorities have so far failed to find out what caused Arroya's death, but they hope that the results of the toxicology tests, which will be available in a few weeks, will shed light on this mysterious death, which was in great pain affecting the senior employees of the Newark police.
Arroyo, whose voice was known to many in the department, has been working as an assistant since September 2006, police director Garry F. Next to McCarthy.
“He was loyal, diligent and reliable,” McCarthy said in an interview on the phone about Arroyo.
". He was my watchdog.
He was my protector.”
McCarthy said Mrs. Arroyo was married to Jimmy Arroyo, formerly a Newark police officer, now working on the Control Commission for Food Products, and left two, one 14-year-old and an 11-year-old boy, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, Union County Prosecutor, Theodore J. Romankow’s spokesman said investigators were working on recontamination that Mrs Arroyo was the victim of the procedure of an unlicensed surgeon.
"He's a probability," Walsh said.
"The investigation is ongoing."
According to reports from the authorities, they arrived at the house around 3 p.m. in November
On the 21st, Mrs. Arroyo was found on the couch.
He was pronounced dead at the scene.
More than a week has passed, and the police have so far revealed very little about the investigation and the house’s owner, Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh didn't say if Castro had been heard by the investigators.
Participants in the study are researching whether part of the house functioned as a doctor’s office.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door in Castro’s home, where a wilted rose bush stood in the narrow front garden and a songmata barked from the back of the house.
Next to the door leading to the cellar, there was a blue tank in the driveway with the inscription "Etil Vanilin", which is used to replace vanilla in food and perfumes.
Two mountain bikes hanging from the hooks turned to the side.
McCarthy recalled that when he first arrived in Newark in 25 years at the New York Police Station, Mrs. Arroyo was invaluable help by helping her navigate the unusual and unpolitical culture of the new city.
“He always said, ‘You’d better be careful with it,’” he recalled.
“He was always here when I arrived in the morning and he was always inside when I left in the evening.
It was confusing."
Expectations for Fed interest rate cuts lead to a storm on the world’s stock markets
Stock prices on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean rose yesterday after the Vice-President of the US Central Bank reassured statements increased his hopes that the Fed would try to ease investment opportunities with further interest cuts.
Stock markets in both London and New York and across Europe have spilled after Donald Kohn, who is the right-hand man of the Fed president Ben Bernanke, said that managers must “flexibly and pragmatically” react to the ongoing turmoil in the financial markets.
In addition to Kohn’s clear goal of calming markets amid signs of a resurgence of credit crunch, he said that the current unrest “partially reduced the progress made in the market at the end of September and October.”
He said that if the increased confusion persists, it could increase the possibility of further austerity on the credit conditions of households and companies.
The statements were interpreted by investors as the Fed was ready to inject fresh capital into the US markets or even further interest rate cuts in order to stabilize the loan conditions.
The statements also sedated on Wall Street, which has recently been due to a number of bad news about the U.S. economy. This was the negative record for the number of home sales in the United States.
The side-effect side effect of financial unrest was also confirmed by the announcement by the investment bank Bear Stearns, according to which it will lay off 650 workers and 4% of its global workforce to offset the loss in the U.S. second-market home loan sector, as part of the cost reduction.
A total of 20 jobs in the London headquarters with 1,500 employees are affected by the above measure.
In New York, the Dow Jones industry average grew by 331 points, 2.55 percent and closed at 13.289.40 points, while the wider S&P 500 index rose by 2.65 percent.
The London FTSE 100 index grew by 165.5 points, 2.7 percent, and closed at 6,306.2, increasing the value of British blue-chip companies by more than 39 pounds.
The German Dax grew by 2.6 percent, while the French CAC40 increased by 2.3 percent.
The credit market unrest was renewed after the three-month-long securities were delivered to European banks at a high-demand auction organised by the European Central Bank at a price of 4.7 percent since April 2001.
After the UK interbank interest rate, Libor, after a steady increase after 12 November, reached its highest value since September, 6.59 percent, the Bank of England was under increasing pressure to follow the Fed and the ECB, as well as to allow additional capital to the London financial market.
England calls for decision between Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
There are two dilemmas, one is more complicated than the other.
Who owns the English team's six shirt in Kandy, Owais Shah's or Ravi Bopara'
And in the context of the first test against Sri Lanka, it is no less important who makes the decision?
The latter question is topical because David Graveney, the president of the selection, who temporarily performs this particular task, helps the lead coach Peter Moores and the captain Michael Vaughan in the decision. On the other hand, because the drawer of the desk of the English Executive Director, Hugh Morris, begins to fill in with requests for a national or at least one-time sorting position.
The short straw of the two players is drawn by the one that does not get the sixth hit place, but as it is known, life, and especially the sport is often unfair.
It is never easy to say why one reaches the top of one’s vocation, while others cannot get over at a lower level. It often depends more on luck than talent.
It is not only cricket that it is difficult to choose – often on a subjective basis – difficult.
Is it time for Bopara to move forward?
Is it fair to Shah if that happens?
The same question may arise in other areas of life, for example, if John Edwards and "Tubby" Banerjee were put in front of the decision-makers with two clever, excellent-culties-trained young leaders who are familiar with business, while there is only room for one of the two.
Who can tell which level a cricketer belongs to without being thrown into the deep water in a more serious tournament?
Of course, data greatly influences the decision, but the possibilities are equally important.
In a team, the player must catch the captain’s glance at the right moment in the cricket gate, and a batter player must regularly have a chance if he wants to become a big player.
Getting the look of the pickers is much more complicated.
James Anderson, for example, has played better last season, but he is a sure team member in the first test, despite the fact that Stephen Harmison says he is in good shape and is very good at the punch.
Anderson fought 32 first-class gates with a knock-down stroke and 33 runs.
Chris Tremlett only scored 29, but both of them have had successful moments at the highest level and hopes to do so in the future.
Whether Shah or Bopara will play at Asgiriya Stadium will be decided by opinion.
This decision can take up or break anyone’s career, but it may not have a special impact on the future.
Four years ago, Sri Lanka Gareth Batty played every test and performed well with five gates and 40 useful runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, who was emerging at the time, and became a decisive test cricketer, who may still be underestimated even today, despite the fact that he scored a double 100 against Australia in Australia.
It is probable that at their meeting at Asgiriya Stanion during today’s game, Graveney, Vaughan and Moores will vote for more experience against Bopara’s young life and dynamism.
There are arguments for both.
Shah has a bright and successful debut in Bombay's 88th bombay test district. In contrast to the 22-year-old Bopara, who is seven years younger than him, who also had excellent twisted throws, he scored 32 first-class 100.
But the fact that Middlesex player Shah ran only ten in two quarters against West Indies in a test at home in May, and the fact that Vaughan, who fought for him again in the next game, seemed to reduce the endurance in him, which was clearly visible in Bombay.
In contrast, Essex’s universal talent is a lively and unsurpassed player.
There is nothing to be upset on the cricket track, but his off-court behaviour was well characterized by the fact that he overturned the team’s car sponsor, Volkswagen, at an exhibition.
He suffered minor injuries and was probably in shock. Despite this, the first thing he did after that was to take over the (of course sponsored) Vodafone phone and called his teammate Alastair Cook, who was watching him from a distance, to ask him, "Have you seen this?"
Bopara with top-of-the-line player. With its sliding medium steps, it creates a advantageous throwing angle for it, and its punches are confident and skillful.
Choosing the right person is one thing, and another is the right moment.
Perhaps this is the real art of selection.
Personally, I would give Bopara the chance, which doesn’t mean that I don’t think Shah would be outstanding if, as the ceylon tea leaves suggest, he would be the one playing on the weekend.
Refugees are being transported home by bus to work and fight with Al-Qaeda
Since yesterday, the first buses have been arriving from Syria to Baghdad with Iraqi refugees who have run out of money or have expired, or even those who hope that order has returned to the city.
There are also those among them who have returned to fight against the soldiers who drove them out of their homes.
The Mansour bus station was already full of refugees returning from Syria and Jordan before a government convoy of 800 people from Damascus filling dozens of buses arrived.
“I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad,” said Sunni doctor Sabah al-Qubaisi.
“I came back today because I saw what happened in Baghdad and in the newspapers and that the city was safe now.
“They say the Mahdi army has stopped killing people,” he said, referring to the militant pastor Moqtada al-Sadr, who has now shut down his Shiite army.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite teacher from Amariyah, who is predominantly populated by Sunnis, returned home with two of his children because he failed to renew his Syrian visa and the regime there prevented Iraqis from taking up work.
Amarija’s Shit neighbors called him and urged his return home, saying that with the help of U.S.-backed troops, they managed to displace Al-Qaeda from their bastion in the western part of the capital.
One of the first arrivals from Jordan was a Sunni and Shia tribal leader who fled a grenade attack from his home in Sleikh, northern Baghdad, after inciting his fellow citizens to fight Al-Qaeda.
He came back to fight.
“Two days ago, my friends called and told me that they had created an anti-Qaeda militia in Sleikh and they needed to support me and my sons.
That’s why I came back today,” said 62-year-old Sabaah Alu Obeidi.
Many have said that peace in the capital has been strengthened since the entry of U.S. troops and were lured home by armed civilian forces working with the Americans.
However, more people were forced to return from Damascus due to visa-related and financial problems.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51, with three children, expressed widespread views among refugees that Shiite Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki asked the Syrian government to reject the asylum application for refugees in order to force their return home.
It is believed that more than two and a half million people have escaped from the death squads in the country.
“Until al-Maliki paid a visit to Syria and put pressure on the government not to issue more visas to Iraqis in order to move back home,” the Sunni pensioner said.
"I can't trust a government that supports criminals who burned down my house after I ran away."
One of the reasons for the easing of the violence is that the Sunnis were expelled from the ski areas, while the skiers also left the areas inhabited by Sunita. As a result, tensions in many areas have decreased.
Many fear that the sudden appearance of refugees will shake up again, which could lead to further fighting.
Little Saarland - high quality training
The smallest federal state plays a leading role in professional training, and its higher education is also an international invaluation.
Only in one field of training, the people of the Saarland struggle with the same gap as the rest of the country.
“Yesterday I explained to a non-Saar region that we are not French for the fifty in the morning,” the self-ironic slogan advertises on his posters on the occasion of the 50th birthday of the smallest federal state.
At the same time, France and Luxembourg play an important role in the education system of the Saarland, which, according to the surveys of the German Institute for Economic (IW) in Cologne, boasts the fifth place.
In this way, higher education institutions – even for the sake of tradition – cooperate closely with neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded by the French in 1948.
Students can still close their studies with a double and even triple degree.
Accordingly, the proportion of foreign fish-growers is high with its own 15.6%.
However, the colleges and universities of the Saarland are also above-averagely appealing to those who wish to study in the Saarland – many of them do not have a high school diploma.
“In the Saarland, they take advantage of the opportunities for professional training,” explains Axel Plünnecke, an educational expert at the German Institute of Economic Affairs.
More than one-fifth of young people get the right to study in vocational school, making the Saarland more than seven percent higher than the federal average.
The combination opportunities of professional and higher education have also been well developed.
The infrastructure for dual studies ranks second in terms of population numbers in Germany.
However, despite practice-oriented training and increasing interest, the number of graduate engineers has decreased by a third in recent years.
The Ministry of Education in the Saarland has therefore obliged higher education institutions to carry out a marketing campaign focusing on engineering.
“We have initiated a number of reforms in primary schools after the first study in Pisa,” a spokesman for the Ministry of Education said.
Therefore, the government has conducted comparative tests across the country.
To help children start learning earlier, the last kindergarten year is free of charge. This is a model that other federal states have begun to copy.
Whether the performance of the students will improve permanently, only future overall peer studies will give an answer to that question.
According to the Pisa survey conducted in 2003, the proportion of students at risk shrank from 29 to 20 percent.
Overall, however, the performance of the Saarland did not improve as much as that of the other federal states.
The Bavarians are more counting.
The greatest annoyance of the people of the Saarland is not taken into account in the Pisa-feapping - otherwise they could abdicate laurels in this area,
Because the language of the neighbouring countries is a mandatory subject in high schools - even if the people of the Saarland are not French.
Chavez is changing the clocks.
In the near future, classes in Venezuela are different than in the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chavez is turning timetime in the Latin American country for half an hour.
Meanwhile, Chavez became a laughingstock in Spain.
Venezuela’s official newspaper said, according to a new law, the clocks will be turned back by four and a half hours compared to Greenwich.
In this way, the South American state will be part of a time zone that is not used in any other country in the world.
Anti-U.S. Chavez justified his decision, among other things, by the fact that the entire hours-based time zones were forced to the world by the United States.
Chavez also announced on Wednesday that he would break off relations with neighboring Colombia over a hostage incident.
The left-wing nationalist politician stated that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe remains the president of Colombia, he will not maintain relations with either the head of state or the Colombian government.
“I can’t do this because of my own dignity,” said Chavez, who calls for a constitutional reform that the citizens of the oil country have to form an opinion on Sunday within the framework of a referendum.
With the reform, it would build up its power in the country.
The reason for the dispute was Uribe’s decision to withdraw Chavez’s mandate to negotiate with Colombian Marxist rebels on the release of hostages.
Uribe’s decision “arcul spit” Venezuela, Cheves expressed criticism on Sunday.
Everyone in Spain is talking about Chavez.
In the country, a new mobile ringtone attracted attention: "Por quoé no te callas" (why don't shut your mouth), sounds like that more than half a million people have downloaded from the Internet.
The sentence comes from John Charles, King of Spain, who was so upset at the last Latin America summit by the constant intercoclation of the populist politician of Baleda that he thus interrupted.
In 2007, wage cuts threaten the Germans
According to a forecast, real wage reductions this year are threatening German workers despite strong economic activity.
Experts have supported their pessimistic forecasts for a bunch of testicles.
According to the Hans-Bröckler Foundation, in 2007, employees can actually expect less salaries than in the previous year.
“This is due to the modest wage development, the increase in the value added tax, and the rapid rise in food and energy prices,” Gustav Horn of the Macroeconomic and Business Climate Research Institute told the daily newspaper “Bild”.
Employees may also be subject to additional burdens in relation to unemployment insurance.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück said in a statement to the daily Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung that the current situation to reduce the right and reasonable unemployment insurance to 3.3 percent at the beginning of the new year.
In any case, the German Federal Labour Agency should not be put in such a difficult situation as to apply to the federation for credit or support, the politician of the German Social Democratic Party, the SPD, was quoted.
On Tuesday, it became known that the price explosion of food and mineral oil products resulted in the highest inflation rate in 13 years.
In annual comparison, prices increased by a total of 3%.
Venus is the Devil's Twin of the Earth
Despite the harsh atmosphere of Venus, it is more like Earth than previously thought: in its atmosphere, the European "Venus Express" spacecraft has discovered lightning bulges and wind turbines on its Arctic circles, such as those that occur on Earth in winter.
For nearly three decades, scientists have assumed that Venus will lightning.
The European space probe "Venus Express" provided evidence - it discovered electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere: The lightnings on Venus spread from cloud to cloud at an altitude of about 56 kilometers, reports Christpher Russell of the University of California, in the columns of the science magazine "Nature".
According to the famous "primordial soup theory", the formation of Earth life was caused by lightning: According to the theory, thunderstorms triggered reactions in the ocean that led to the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
Not so on Venus: "If there ever had life there, it must have been in very early times," explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institute in Washington.
At present, there can hardly be a living organism on the surface of Venus: The atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, and the temperature values sometimes reach 500 degrees.
“Venus may be the hellish twin of Earth, but it’s still his twin brother,” Russell said.
The main question of the Esa mission is why Venus, which is so similar in size to the Earth, is moving on a completely different path of evolution.
The launch of the "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milestone in the Venus research, because since the early 1990s, no probes have been specifically on the road to locate this planet.
The latest research, presented in several "Nature" articles, is considered by researchers to prove not only the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system.
“They also show that the resemblance of the neighboring planet to Earth is greater than we first assumed,” Esa said.
In addition to the already known Arctic whirlwind, the researchers also discovered a much faster-moving cloud vortex at the South Pole.
The phenomenon is reminiscent of the air currents of the Earth’s winter hemisphere, according to a team led by Giuseppe Piccioni from the Italian Institute of Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second innermost planet in the Solar System has a mass almost the same size as Earth, and with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers, it is almost as large as the Earth.
The celestial body, also known as the Evening Star, orbits the Sun in less than 225 days.
But it is much slower around its own tens: A day of Venus lasts 243 Earth days.
Although the surface temperature of Venus, coupled with a pressure of 92 bar, barely resembles the Earth, is barely reminiscent of the Earth, the scientists assume that both planets were formed under completely similar conditions.
They both accumulated water, which remained as an ocean on Earth, while Venus left into the universe.
And while carbon dioxide was bound on Earth in carbonate rocks, Venus is a large part of the atmosphere.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama
Köhler, the President of the German Republic, is demanding the end of a debate between the parties that erupted around the reception of the Dalai Lama in the office of Chancellor.
He publicly criticized the SPD for attacking the Chancellor after the September reception.
German President Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany’s prestige and called on the Grand Coalition to end the dispute over the Dalai Lama.
“We should not be a divided nation towards the outside world on this issue,” Köhler told Handelsblatt.
Köhler simultaneously expressed his understanding that Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) received the Dalai Lama in September.
“Human rights are universally valid for me, even if I respect the diversity between cultures,” Köhler said.
Everyone is aware that Germany must take care of the foreign-politically sensitive balance, the President of the Republic stressed; however, he defended Merkel against the accusation that the Chancellor would pursue a new China policy.
"The Federal Chancellor did not break with traditional "China" policy.
China is aware of this,” Köhler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) indirectly expressed his displeasure over the reception of the Dalai Lama and therefore became the target of attacks in the EU.
Steinmeier, among other things, complained about the EU's "showcase policy" in the field of foreign policy.
After receiving the Dalai Lama in Chancellor’s office, there were fierce disturbances in the German-Chinese relationship.
Thus, the Chinese leadership not only cancelled the invitation of German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but also, according to SPIEGEL, also froze the so-called Strategic Dialogue between the two countries’ foreign affairs.
Chinese President Wen Jiabao has called on Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel to admit that it was a mistake to receive the Dalai Lama.
China rejects the official reception of the Tibetan religious leader by European politicians, Wen Jiabao confirmed the Chinese position.
The actions and words of the Dalai Lama pointed out that they were trying to separate further Tibetan territories from China, including Tibet and other current provinces.
Schaeuble warns against riots similar to those in France
Street clashes with police, gunshots, flaming cars: Wolfgang Schaeule warns against riots similar to those in France.
Every effort must be made to ensure that social dissatisfaction does not lead to street violence in Germany, the Federal Minister of the Interior demands.
Barriadas were on fire, rioters fired shotguns at police with shotguns: Federal Interior Minister Wolfgang Schauble (CDU) fears similar developments in Germany after serious riots by young people in France.
“We need to be careful not to accumulate social explosives in our country and not to lead to violence.
We need to take this seriously,” he told the newspaper “Neue Presse” in Hanover.
Not all young people are aligned with the rapid changes in social reality.
Alliances, provinces and communities are currently working intensively to solve problematic cases, Schauble said.
This does not only concern the integration of immigrants.
“From the Integration Summit to the Islamic Conference, the first successes are already being achieved.”
However, it is too early to resolve the emergency.
Schauble simultaneously pointed out that there are no urban and sociological problems in the German suburbs as in France.
In the northern suburbs of Paris, the young people fought serious street fights with the police last night.
There were also cars and public buildings in Toulouse.
With this in mind, Kenan Kolat, the leader of the Turkish communities in Germany, demanded greater activity from the federal government in terms of integration.
In connection with the riots in France, Kolat warned of the “threats of imitation”.
Although the situation in Germany is not as sensitive as in France,
However, action is necessary.
Kolat pointed out that the unemployment rate among young people under the age of 25 from immigrant families is “higher than the average”.
Above all, more educational places should be provided.
Kolat stressed: "We must provide a perspective for young people."
However, the head of the Turkish Community added that “social supervision within the family” is much more present in Germany than in France.
Many young people from immigrant families do not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat warns, "Nevertheless, we must be on guard."
“As soon as they have the opportunity to work and receive education, we should be given the opportunity to do so.”
Meanwhile, in the suburb of Paris, Villiers-le-Bel, there was complete calm during the night.
Hundreds of police officers were ready to go, and a helicopter scanned the area with headlights.
The competent authorities reported three arrests and some flaming garbage cans and cars.
Since the report, a security unit of about 1,000 people has been calm.
Police are ready to intervene as long as necessary, Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after a visit to the suburb.
During the night of Tuesday, about 80 police officers were injured as a result of the riots in Villiers-le-bel.
The next night, the riots spread to Toulouse.
The riots erupted in connection with a traffic accident, killing two young people on Sunday.
According to the first findings of the State Prosecutor’s Office, the police are not responsible for the deaths of young people.
The Cloudwalking Angela
The Chancellor’s action, which is out of the question, is a testament to the end of the coalition – and nothing can be expected from him.
In fact, in which country does the Federal Chancellor live in?
After his bleak, contentful and meaningless action at the general debate of the Bundestag, it must be stated that he does not live here - he does not live in the country whose government would be his duty.
Angela Merkel rejected the accusation with a very dominant sentence, that she would focus too much on foreign policy.
This is provincial, he replied, and in this way he only expressed that he did not want to understand what the critics of him were talking about.
At the Federal Assembly, it made it clear to everyone how aptly the reproaches were.
At the same time, neither specific interest nor empathy was felt in the country’s problems.
Instead, Angela, a cloud-walker appeared: a politician who runs away from a reality who flees into foreign policy and there is only uncertainty about his own.
Example of climate protection: Heiligendamm’s resolutions unrestrainedly praises, but remains silent about how to achieve air-conditioning goals in the country.
At all, as far as the self-monument is concerned, such a modesty would not have been allowed to be the president of the CDU two years earlier.
Now he is clinging to the phrase that prosperity has a positive effect on people.
This harms his reputation as a pragmatic personality who provides solutions to problems instead of word flowers.
In Angela’s realm, however, the domestic political problems are only minor things.
Child poverty and low-income problems?
He only praises this of half sentences.
It is telling from this point of view how often it commits a slip of the tongue when it comes to family allowances.
Merkel has to jump three times to put together a half-stight sentence.
When it comes to specifics, he stumbles in a foreign area.
Storm Department
During the Republican presidential candidates’ debate on Youtube, the two favourites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, had a tough swing – and now they have to fear an outsider candidate.
The tension of the candidates has already surfaced on the first topic.
Mitt Romney remarks to his opponent, Rudy Giuliani, that he has made New York a “extended castle of immigrants.”
“I would say that his own house served as a refuge for illegal immigrants,” said Giuliani, retort, and how he reproached the former governor of Massachusetts that he employed immigrants without documents as a private person.
The candidates are on the run: “Because the Republican camp still doesn’t have a uniformly supported favourite, the eight presidential candidates use the debate on CNN first of all to undermine their opponent’s credibility.
The 30-second videos submitted by internet users via YouTube are just as much as short summaries.
“With this kind of isolationism, we bring Hitler to power,” John McCain rubs John McCain under the nose of his opponent, Ron Paul, who is the only one of the participants in the circle demanding an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney’s head is also thoroughly washed by a veteran who has been in Vietnam when he is reluctant to condemn the so-called “Waterboarding” as torture, the method of interrogation in which drowning is simulated.
That the important topics of the campaign, meanwhile, are only beyond the debates on Iraq and torture, is beyond the debates on torture, the Florida St. The reactions of the audience of Petersburg show.
A loud applause breaks out in the room at the praise of conservative values and the rejection of future tax increases.
Meanwhile, the weaknesses of the two candidates are becoming more and more apparent.
“I was wrong at the time,” Romney said, observantly, apologizing to supporters and television viewers for voting for abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, is swollen when he is asked to give his opinion on the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf first governs as a civilian
A day after his withdrawal from the military, the President Musharraf, who exercised power in Pakistan, took place.
This ends eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistan’s President Pervez Musharraf was reprimanded for a further five-year term of office on Thursday.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony from the capital, the presidential palace in Islamabad.
Musharraf swore an oath to the Constitution and act for the good of his people.
On Wednesday, he handed over his military office to his confidant, Ashfaq Kiyani, and thus yielded to international pressure from the United States.
Eight years after the break in power without bloodshed, the former general now governs for the first time as the head of state of civilian state.
With Musharraf's resignation as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, he complied with a fundamental demand from the West and the opposition.
Another important claim is the end of the state of emergency, which Musharraf announced on 3 November.
According to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, Musharraf will end the state of emergency shortly after his resignation, with which he would meet another demand for the West.
The country’s Supreme Court, in which Musharraf planted lawyers sympathetic to him in early November following the declaration of the state of emergency, rejected all protests in connection with the controversial re-election of the head of state on October 6.
Meanwhile, in the north-east tribal area, North Waziristan, five soldiers were killed and four others injured as a result of the attack on a military convoy.
According to an army spokesman, the bomb exploded on a road near the border in Afghanistan.
The fathers of Krautrock are back
The seventies German supergroup is playing again: The three band members of Harmonia have been dusting off their instruments again for a concert in Berlin.
During the reunion, a cut recording appears from their heyday, from the time of "Live 1974".
They were well-known abroad at the time.
The announced sensation is embodied in the person of the three agreed gentlemen around the dinner table.
Before each, it has its own instrument, its own cable and, above all, its own buttons.
Dieter Moebius, at the age of 63, sits in a snow-white shirt in the middle.
Michael Rother, a young man at the age of 57, is accompanied by a laptop and guitar.
From the audience, the 73-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius is hunched and focused on the console.
Each one produces some kind of noise, while they produce rhythm once in a while.
Sometimes it coincides into traditional music.
All this does not seem to bother the gentlemen themselves.
It was a great excitement for the fans of the krautrock music trend that the Harmonia band is playing music again.
What we can tell here: As a result of proper follow-up, we can conclude that the name passed through the collective pop memory, but in no case left such permanent traces that we are painfully missing this band after 32 years.
Why can’t the Germans celebrate the legends of their seventies?
Especially since what we misconsideredly call Krautrock, in England and America, has always been valued at more than in his own country.
When the music industry awarded the Echo Prize for His Lifetime Achievement to the surviving members of the Cologne-enabled band in 2003, the figures of German pop sat with an incomprehensible face in the hall.
When he thanked La Düsseldorf and Neu! in the Red Hot Chili Peppers laudation, the astonishment became limitless.
At the concerts, Michael Rother was sitting on stage with the Red Hot Chili Peppers as an old friend.
Domestic rejection and foreign acceptance are two sides of the same coin.
The memory is overwhelmed by Harmonia because the trio existed for only two years, and during this time it had a far lesser effect than others subsequently attributed to it.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously played with Conrad Schnitzler and the artist under the promising name Cluster.
Initially, they played in the cellar under the Schaubühne Theatre in Berlin.
Then in Dusseldorf, for economic reasons, for economic reasons, a record company funded by the church.
Rother helped Kraftwerk for a short time, and at the same time he made a name for himself as the guitarist of the then most radical German band, Neu!.
Around 1973, however, Rother followed the musicians of Cluster to spend his exile at Forst, Weserbergland.
There, in Alter Weserhof, a 16th-century Rom, lived as a communique that escaped from the city.
Less ideologically than in the 1st commune, where Roedelius was still a babysitter.
Their life is more of an idyllic art.
It is said that the flag of the song-craveling Harmonia Ottenstein was found from the rubbish and they found a name for their art in this way.
Some of these were recorded by Harmonia.
The first album is titled "Musik von Harmonia" and "De Luxe".
Despite his loose and modest music, the band suffered a material need.
The collection of the strudel alone did not ensure the finding of themselves.
The CD, "Live 1974", was filmed at a concert in Griessem in front of a record audience of less than 50 people, so anyone remembers.
Forced Harmonia and occasional practice at the time was Rother's idea.
For Roedelius and Moebius, this is an immoral demand.
The band announced their dissolution in 1975.
Rother ended up in esotericism and made a living from albums like "Flammende Herzen".
Cluster was resuscitated in the 1980s, which has been more successful than Harmonia has ever been.
The griessemi live album is thanks to Herbert Grönemeyer.
His record company, called Greenland, set the goal of caring for krautrock as a special German song for live music.
In this context, Neu! was already excavated as well as Roedelius’s solo work.
The Resurrection of Harmonia takes place in the House of Culture in Berlin.
With public money, within the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope, author of the British deestion, and the Handbook "Krautrock Sampler", is also present.
There is also the creator of Loveparade, Dr. Motte, too.
This roughly outlines the impact of kraut rock on the subsequent pop music era.
In this regard, Harmonia fills the empty space reserved for the super team.
Brian Eno's finding floats with the most unusual sounds in the room: "The only true music, the future belongs."
There are pictures showing the producer with Harmonia in the room of a farmhouse.
The projection of additional black and white photographs of tangled-based equipment is aimed at the building of legend.
In the foreground, the three veterans are busy with improvisation again.
This simply means that microphones are attached to the organ and drum kit with the intention of cheating out sound effects that you have never heard from the instruments using the instruments that produce their own sound effects.
Today, electrical music looks like electric music.
Three craftsmen.
Even the choir doesn't change anything.
Under the conductor of Barbara Morgenstern, they cough and whisper, and in a beautiful part they sing "Aaaaaaaah!" with a hemorrhage.
Racutrock has always been a very English concept.
It was never about rock.
The roots were less sought in the blues than in the Colleges of Music (Can), in technical knowledge (Kraftwerk), or even in the escape from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
If someone here cries "'68!", he's not on the wrong track, and Harmonia won't let himself be thrown out of his calm.
Even the most obvious thing is thoroughly reconsidered on the stage.
Where does the music begin and where does it end?
This can kill you nervously, or you can offer it with the passing moments of exceptional luck.
Richard Gere is simply not cynical.
With the help of "Winning" and "Mörderischer Frieden", two films deal with the Balkan war again.
None of them are convincing.
The basic idea is either too focused on action and shooting, or too emotional.
Even Richard Gere himself can't help with "Word".
First of all, the good news is that although the two war criminals, Karadzic and Mladic, are still hiding in the Balkan mountains, they found the actor Richard Gere again in the dark hinterland of the Bosnian war.
Lately, we have lost sight of the most beautiful man of the eighties, as his many roles played in emotional films for women and many press conferences on Buddhism have even discouraged us from looking at it.
And here, all of a sudden, Richard Gere is the most pressing argument for perhaps watching the movie "Word".
It provides a wonderful, smiling performance: Basically, the war correspondent Simon Hunt, who he played, is exactly what Gere could have become if fate and film industry were not so kind to him: A man who has long left his most beautiful years behind, but his decline has retained a significant part of his former attractiveness as a ruined monument.
However, the film "Word" and the German production "Mörderischer Frieden" started to screen this week, despite this trump card, only continues to be an endless series of failed films about the Balkan war.
The film is not a lot of talk about the film "Mörderischer Frieden": The film is about two German soldiers serving in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save a Serbian woman from the Kosovo snipers, and one of them suddenly falls in love with it.
While it is to be welcomed that the Serbs are once not portrayed as the sole cause of all evil, the film, which bears the shallowness of TV films, is too quickly lost in the shooting and the eventful scenes.
"Cobra 11" character - instead of a highway with war.
On the other hand, in the case of "Wordging", it can be examined exemplary why not a single really good film about the Balkan war has ever been made.
The story of the three U.S. war correspondents who set out to find the Serb war criminal called "Róka", with a different director, other screenwriters (both in Richard Shepard's personal union) at other times, could have become a new "Apocalypse now".
After all, the stories show a surprising similarity: In both cases, small groups set out for the forest to accomplish what the army is incapable of doing – and in both cases, the journey that goes crazy.
One of the reasons for the fall of "Wordry" is that it simply does not allow Simon Hunt to be a depraved cynical person at heart, as he presents him at the beginning.
No, and in the script, he even spends a romantic relationship with a Muslim Bosnian woman who was later murdered.
"Welding" is delayed when reporters reach the same as the last five minutes of the film, in the last five minutes of the film, the Nato, the CIA and all the world’s bounty hunters have not been able to do in five years: They will catch the war criminal and hand him over to the Muslim Bosniaks for just revenge.
This is so bad that one would like to turn to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) for a crime against the logic of the cinema.
The purpose of the film is profoundly human.
He intends to blame for the fact that Karadzic and Mladic are still at large, accusing the Americans and the French (there are also allegedly exceptionally united) that they are not going to persecute intensively due to secret political deals.
But good and evil sometimes look so similar to each other that you think of a famous Brecht poem.
In it, the poet writes about the wooden mask depicting the Asian demon on his desk: "I stare with a lover on his temple the bulging here, which tells us how tiring it is to be bad."
Movies like "Wiasting" have the same oversized, man-headed masks that show how tiring it is to be good.
This profele is not limited to the genre of films about the Balkan war.
Recently, it was reported in the newspaper that all the Hollywood films about Iraq were ugly failures.
We can add that there hasn’t been a single good movie about South Africa.
It is almost always valid: if a star wanders around the crisis zones or minefields of the world, something like Patricia Arquette, "Without the fish," Angelina Jolie, or "Drink Diamond" Leonardo Di Caprio.
It is possible that these conflicts are simply too close to time.
It took decades for Hollywood to make a good film about the Holocaust with the "Schindler List" movie.
Probably some of the films are still ripe - because the works about the Vietnam War, which are now considered classic, e.g. "The deer hunter", "Apocalypse now" or "Full Metal Jackett" were not celebrated as a masterpiece in their own time.
But it is conceivable that nowadays, when all mass murders arrive in our homes in real time, right through two screens, we simply know too much about the conflicts of the world.
And that deprives screenwriters of ignoring reality that is necessary to tell good stories.
After all, "Lenni or not to be" or "The dictator" was successful because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how terrible the Nazi regime was.
Maybe you shouldn’t be looking for a good one’s the right thing to do.
Perhaps we must place the sociastically distant artistic vision of novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When he was questioned about the parallels between his historical novel "Lemprisere-lexicon" and the Balkan War, he replied, "It just depends on certain things never change.
Cities will always be terribly dangerous, people will always be murdered in a terrible way, and Yugoslavia will always be war.
Von Beust is fiercely criticized for resignation of the Olympics
The mayor’s distancing bid for the Olympic Games in Hamburg has provoked fierce criticism in political and economic life.
Many want to continue to fight for the stage of water toys.
However, Von Beust, however, during the chances, emphatically warns of the realities.
The chief executive of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, described the retreat as “unfavorable for the economic environment” on Wednesday.
No other project has recently liberated such huge motivational forces in the city than the Olympic idea.
“Without this goal, we would not be able to keep the sporting political momentum even enough.”
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury the project, but to develop a long-term start-up from modified time coordinates.
Mayor Ole von Beust insisted on his earlier statements that Hamburg’s ambitions for the Olympic Games were unrealistic until at least 2028.
"It's not Hamburg that decides on the Olympic bid, it's the German Olympic Sports Federation," von Beust told WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the decision of the Sports Federation to be submitted for the Munich bid for the 2018 Winter Olympics.
“To give us the preference to this means that we will not have a realistic chance within the period up to 2028 that we have planned.”
However, we will not give up the dream for good, von Beus said.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regretted von Beust’s statements.
This gives the impression that Hamburg does not intend to apply for the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
“It’s too early to blow a chance to bury our plans now,” HSB President Günter Plo, said on Wednesday.
In addition, the withdrawal from the application is contrary to the statement of the President of the Senate made at a reception held at the General Assembly of the General German College Sports Association.
There, Von Beust, a bid for Hamburg for the 2015 Univerziádé, described it as a substitute for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The College Sports Association launched Hamburg as the city participating in the competition only last week.
The SPD’s civic group complained to the Senate that it had left unused for the construction of housing in Hamburg.
“The development of Kleiner Grasbrook has been postponed by the Senate for years because he voted for the Olympics and neglected housing,” two SPD MPs, Carola Veit and Jan Quast, said in a statement.
While the SPD has been steadily plotting a spear for Kleiner Grasbrook’ integrated plan for the Olympic and subsequent housing utilization, the CDU unilaterally focused on the “event factor”.
The bid for the 2012 Summer Olympic Games was aroused great enthusiasm in Hamburg.
However, Hamburg failed in Leipzig.
These are not Warhol's boxes.
Anyone who connects the terms of Sweden and wooden chests to each other is Ikea, not Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Currently, wooden crates produced in Sweden cast a dark shadow on the list of Warhol’s works.
Most of the ninety-four "Stockholm type" Brillo Boxes listed in this are fakes.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" questioned the authenticity of Andy Warhol's 1968 Brillo Boxes a few months ago, now the internal investigation of Moderna Museet in Stockholm has come to a sobering result: six copies of the "Brillo Box" donated by the Pontus Hultén, a former museum director, to Modern Museet in 1995 - and most likely a large of the "Blood Box" in the international art market.
History is a long and complicated, embarrassing chain of artistic and boarding stunts.
Warhol created his first "Brillo Boxai" in New York in 1964 - painted wooden crates based on the red-blue-white design of the cardboard box of soap dust soap dust.
At an exhibition of his works in Moderna Museet in 1968, with Warhol’s consent, hundreds of Brillo chests of cardboard were exhibited: These did not come from Warhol (for cost-savings) but were transported directly from the Brillo carton factory.
It was not about works of art, but about their templates, simple exhibition pieces.
However, Warhol gave permission in 1968 to manufacture some of the Brillo-trees in Sweden, which were not exhibited at Moderna Museet.
Witnesses of the time now speak of about fifteen boxes that, as authenticated at the time, as Original-Andy-Warhol-Brillo-Box, have rightly entered art and auction history under the designation "Stockholm type".
Some of them were auctioned off for more than 100,000 dollars.
The problem, however, is that Pontus Hultén, the legendary museum director later, falsely claimed that in 1968 a hundred wooden crates were produced and exhibited in Sweden, which were then left to him by Warhol.
In fact, 105 boxes of Hulén were produced in Malmö only in 1990 for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
At that time, Warhol was dead for three years.
Lars Byström, the main monument manager of Moderna Museet, examined three privately owned boxes in Sweden, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: The pressed chipboards were first grounded and sanded, followed by a brush the white oil paint.
The structure of the copies from 1990, on the other hand, reveals that the paint was applied directly to the chipboard with a paint roller without foundation - and it is not oil, but acrylic paint.
"These boxes were not authenticated by the artist, so they should be deleted from the official list of Andy Warhol's Brillo Boxers," says Lars Nittve, director of Moderna Museet: "Unless the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board of New York decides otherwise, Moderna Museet will classify the six crates in its collection as copies/exhibition material."
The Authentication Board announced in June that it would investigate “serious allegations” raised in connection with soap dust crates.
Since then, however, they have been wrapped in relentless silence.
Manila rebels give up
Soldiers who barricaded themselves in a hotel in Manila have given up the rebellion at the Philippine airstrike and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
He can’t take responsibility for the bloodshed, said Antonio Trillanes, who accused the president of corruption and election fraud, told reporters.
Prior to that, government soldiers using tear gas stormed the hotel.
Dozens of soldiers have been hurricades in the building for hours.
Half of the team were in court on Thursday for a failed coup attempt, including Trillanes.
He used the trial to suddenly unravel 30 sympathizers.
The military police, who were tasked with guarding the man, apparently switched to him and joined the mutiny.
They infiltrated the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Government-loyal units have sealed off the area around the prestigious hotel.
The Cabinet has invited the Security Cabinet to an emergency meeting.
Security adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the military’s proceedings.
"People have the good of it," Trillanes said.
"We call on people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, formerly commander of the Scout Rangers elitalist, stated that other units in the army wanted to join the march within a short time.
Critics of the government called for strong protests against the president on Friday.
His government has been overshadowed by corruption allegations for several months.
In 2003, the financial district of Manila was the main scene of the attempted mutiny of Arroyo, organized by about 200 members of the army.
The uprising failed after only 24 hours, when the army was reluctant to join.
Since 1986, at least seven attempts have been made in the Philippines against democratically elected governments.
United will be a major shareholder in Versatel
United Internet has secured more than 20 percent of the company’s Versatel telecommunications company.
As the company said on Wednesday evening, the average price per share is 14.46 Euros.
This represents the share capital’s shareholding of 20.05 percent.
There have been speculations about the takeover before.
The possibility of raising the share in Versatel remains open.
This step is intended to facilitate the consolidation of the German DSL market, the United Internet said.
Prior to that, on Wednesday, there were already speculations about a possible connection to the possible involvement, after Berenberg Bank increased its stake in the Düsseldorf network service provider by an additional 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
The financial institution maintains the share only to a third party, it is reported in the financial market.
The previous day, the United Internet had owned a small 10 percent of the company Drillisch.
Within the framework of a capital increase, Drillisch has issued 17.4 million new shares worth 106.4 million euros.
United Online has purchased 5.15 million shares for 31.4 million euros.
In addition, companies have initiated a dialogue on cooperation on the market of DSL and mobile phone products.
“We are strengthening our partnership,” a spokesman for United-Internet said in a statement.
The two companies jointly founded the MSP joint venture to take over the competing Freenet.
The two companies are initially satisfied with a good 10 percent stake in Freenet and will not exercise the right to take over an additional 18.49 percent of Freenet, the United Internet said on Thursday.
However, the two companies leave all possibilities open, in particular to increase the stakes in Freenet AG, the news reports.
The negotiations between the United Internet and Freenet on the strategic partnership ended in mid-November.
The poker game around Freenet has been going on for months and is now only clear in terms of the consolidation of the German telecommunications market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million contracted mobile phone cases and 1.27 million customers with DSL and fixed line access.
So far, the holding company created by United Internet and Drillisch had a direct share of 6.01 percent of Freenet.
It has now been agreed that Drillisch will bring in another 4%.
The right to acquire 18.49 percent of the investment company Vatas was agreed in August.
