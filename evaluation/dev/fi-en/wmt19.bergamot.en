Eemeli Kouki leads Hurricane to home win in opening - Savo Volley wins second win
Hurricane Loimaa, who has been medals in the men's volleyball Championship medals seven times in a row, started the 2018-19 season with a home win when Raisio's Loimu went down 3-0 on Saturday.
All-rounder Eemeli Kouki, who returned to Finland from Romania, was the Hurricane's most effective with 22 points.
There were some tune-ups abroad, but they didn't happen, and then we got a call from Loimaa.
We got things done pretty quickly, Kouki said.
Tomi Rumpunen, who played in Loimo, also supported Kouk with 18 points.
Samuli Kaislasalo, the most effective of the visitors, was national team chipper Samuli Kaislasalo, who plays on a match-by-match contract.
Winning an opening game is always important.
A lot of players had experience from the other side, and it brought extra extra extra extra to the game.
Our game is not yet ready, but continuing the medal streak is of course a goal," Kouki said.
Määttänen Savo Volley's most effective
Miro Määttänen was Savo Volley's most effective with 18 points, when the team downed the Vantaa Ducks 3-0 in Vieremä.
Our game was volatile, especially on the offensive end, but luckily we were able to squeeze the win.
I certainly didn't have any conscious download when I played against my former team," Määttänen said.
Antti Siltala, who started his career in Volleyball 3 in the 2000-01 season, scored 12 points.
Head coach Jukka Tuovinen was happy with many things.
The hall was a small atmosphere on the ceiling all the time.
Good luck with a home opening.
Miro was a king, Sillit played a good game, Tuovinen said.
Siltala's previous season in the league was 2006-07, then he won silver in Pielavesi Sampo with Tuovinen even then as head coach.
Thiago Maciel was the Ducks' most effective with 14 points.
Mikkonen again Akaa-Volley's star
Joni Mikkonen, who won the league in 2012-13, has also made a strong start to this season.
The chipper scored 25 points as Akaa-Volley took his season-opening win after downing the Kokkola Tigers 3-2.
The season has started well.
Of course, today was a close defeat, as we were down 17-21 in the fourth set.
We lost a batch win somewhere, and the fifth round came in the process, Mikkonen said.
The Tigers, who were still in finals a few seasons ago, were the most effective chipper Edvarts Buivids, who scored 28 points.
Compatriot Aleksandrs Kudryashovs backed up with 17 points.
We didn't get much of a grip on a guy's chipper, Mikkonen boasted.
Finland compares human capital to number one in the world
Finland is at the top of the world in comparing human capital, according to the scientific journal Lancet.
The study compared human capital development from 1990 to 2016.
Over the years, 195 countries were compared.
In both years, Finland was number one in statistics.
In 2016, the top five was almost the same as in 1990.
Finland was followed by Iceland, Denmark, Canada and Holland.
Later, Holland ranked one higher and instead of Canada found Taiwan on the list.
In 2016, Niger and South Sudan were ranked in the worst comparison.
When measuring human capital, the education level, skills and health of the population are examined.
The World Bank has stated that human capital is linked to economic growth.
Real Madrid's Thibaut Courtois kept Atletico in check, local game ended goalless
Real Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois stretched to splendor fightbacks, and the local game of Madrid teams ended in a goalless draw late Saturday in the Spanish Football League.
Atletico from Madrid Antoine Griezmann and Diego Costa were the closest to goal, but Belgian keeper Courtois had time to fight.
Courtois played three seasons at Atletico while playing a Chelsea player.
Early in the week, FIFA, the International Football Association, chose him as a goalkeeper of the year.
Real got the best goal spot at Real, but his shot headed past the opening half of the goal.
Bale missed a changeup after a break because of a thigh injury.
According to ESPN, disillusioned Real supporters chanted the name of Cristiano Ronaldo, a goal-cuffed goal-cuffed goal-cup in the match.
U.S. is now facing abortion rights - Powerful documentary explains why
The U.S. Senate is currently trying to determine whether Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate set by President Donald Trump, could be elected as one of the nine Supreme Court members.
In the Republican Party, many hope that Kavanaugh's decisive vote will be overturned by a decision known as Roe v. Wade, which made abortion in the United States legal in 1973.
Ricki Stern and Annie Sundberg's documentary Reversing Roe - The United States and abortion rights explain how the current situation has come to the current situation over the years.
As incredible as it seems, the topic is also topical in Finland.
Foreign Minister Timo Soini has made public employment against safe abortions and received varying degrees of support from most of our country’s MPs.
At the beginning of a powerful documentary, we meet Gynecologist Colleen McNicholas, who has remained the only abortion doctor in the state of Missouri due to regulatory tightening.
The armed guardian of the clinic says he defends U.S. religious freedom.
News reports recall the deadly terrorist attacks on clinics.
Let's move to a time when abortion was illegal in the United States.
At the time, a consortium of Lutheran Churchmen guided women to trusted abortion doctors.
The reasoning behind the successful pastor is good, but they are actually not even needed, a photograph of a woman who died of an abortion committed self-made abortion is enough.
There were about 5,000 deaths a year in the United States.
The legalization of abortions was defended, especially by the Republican Party.
As early as 1967, California, the Law of Abortion Law was signed by Governor Ronald Reagan.
Later, it was Reagan, in his presidential campaign in 1980, in an epochally to confuse religion with politics to pick up voters.
His abortion stance was also reversed by his successor , George Bush, a parent.
And Donald Trump did the same.
The document reaches the deepest core of the issue in seeking the underlying cause of the politicisation of abortion.
When racial segregation-enhanced religious organizations were denied tax exemption, they became politically active.
An abortion was chosen as a hobby horse.
Religion has brought extraordinary knots to politics.
At the time of writing this, the US is in a situation where the president, who has credenzenes with his sectual harassment but caught the sounds of a religious right with his abortion show, has chosen to run Kavanaugh, who is now blamed on sexual assault by several women.
Kavanaugh can gain power based on scale language status to decide on the rights of 164 million American women and girls.
Israeli military shoots seven Palestinians, including two children - large protests at border
Almost 200 Palestinians have been killed in six months after Israel fired protesters in the border zone.
Israeli soldiers on Friday shot dead seven Palestinians in the Gaza border zone, the Palestinian Ministry of Health said.
Among the dead are two children: boys aged 12 and 14, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health.
The ministry says 505 people have been wounded.
89 were wounded by bullets.
The Israeli military has confirmed that it opened fire and made an airstrike in the border zone when protesters threw rocks and explosives at protesters.
The military says it has started using force to prevent protesters breaking up the border fence or running to the other side of it.
At least 191 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza protests since March, when Palestinians launched weekly protests along the border.
12,000 wounded, according to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.
Protesters called on Palestinian families to enter areas from which Palestinians were forced to leave when the state of Israel was founded in 1948.
A Palestinian sniper has killed one Israeli soldier.
Explosives dropped with kites and helium balls sent from the Palestinian side have ignited forest areas and farmland in Israel.
Teemu Pukki got a penalty kick - he didn't get to shoot himself
Wigan topper Chey Dunkley appeared to have knocked him down with a back tackle in the penalty area.
Referee Gavin Ward allowed the game to continue.
His interpretation is that the tackle was clean.
He couldn't believe his eyes.
I think the situation was left to bother referee Ward, who sentenced Norwich a penalty kick in the 85th minute when Pukki was knocked down.
Ward showed a penalty spot, and Mario Vrancic jolted a 1-0 winning goal.
Pukki has scored five goals for Norwich in the Championship series.
The former was born last Saturday against QPR in a classy pectoral muscle.
I tasted like work to Santa again.
After losing the ball, he continued to end the situation.
He created goal situations and defended tirelessly.
For Norwich, it was the fifth game in two weeks.
The team continues in a league cup.
There's a five-win streak behind us.
Paedophiliac assistance was immediately filled with bookings - in Finland, around 40,000 experience interest in children
It is estimated that two per cent of men and a small percentage of women experience at least some sexual interest in preteens.
In Finland, this means about 40,000 people.
Those with sexual interest in children or young people have so far found it difficult to get help.
The SeriE project, a joint SeriE project between the Criminal Welfare Support Foundation and Sexpo, trains professionals to meet paedophiles as clients, as well as help people who experience sexual interest in children.
When the project was reported in the spring, an email flooding and appointments at Sexpo, which provides counseling and therapy, began to complete the reception very quickly, Yle says.
But these are promised to be released through the fall.
The sexual preference of children causes shame for many.
Most of those who noticeped paedophilic emotions in themselves have failed to carry out their fantasies and thus did nothing criminal.
But preference is usually a permanent feature.
Most of them wish to get rid of ideas that distress and depress them.
They also make normal life more difficult,” says sexual therapist Patricia Thesleff, a sexual therapist to Yle.
I think work is valuable if one child is spared sexual violence, Thesleff says.
Korean leaders or Congolese gynaecologist?
U.S. President Donald Trump, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, the idea may sound sudden odd, but Trump is one of the biggest favourites to receive the prize, based on betting odds.
The background is Trump's role in receiving North Korea, at least at the level of talk, to commit to nuclear demagoguery.
The biggest favourites to become a peace Nobel laureate are South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who have met three times this year and promised to seek a peace deal between their two countries.
The warming of the relationship between the two Koreas is considerable, as relations were still chilly last year.
Yet rewarding Kim, who has been threatened with nuclear weapons for years and with an iron grip on his country with an iron grip, would also raise criticism.
Nobel Prize winners will be announced from Monday, with the most attention-grabbing, or peace prize, on Friday.
If the award is not given to participants in diplomacy on the Korean Peninsula, one of the leading candidates is Denis Mukwege, a Congolese physician.
A respected gynecologist has treated thousands of women victims of gang rapes in his hospital in the Democratic Republic of Congo and become a leading expert in his field in the world.
With his work, Mukwege has drawn attention to sexual violence, a gruesome byproduct of many conflicts.
The UN Refugee Agency, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1954 and 1981, has also been considered a strong candidate.
The Nobel committee has said that this year there will be 331 candidates to win the prize.
The names of candidates are not disclosed to the public.
Trump himself would not mind winning the Nobel Prize.
In May, a reporter asked him at the White House if he deserved a peace prize.
Everyone thinks so, but I would never say it myself," Trump said with a smile.
I want to finish this.
The prize I want is a victory for the whole world," the president continued, referring to the North Korea talks.
But there are some facts that make Trump's Nobel laureate unlikely.
The Norwegian Nobel Committee, which awards the award, has often given recognition to individuals and organizations representing liberal democracy and a multi-polar world order - exactly the kind of international cooperation that Trump has been seen as opponents.
In the 21st century, three American politicians were awarded to Democrats: Jimmy Carter in 2002, Al Gore in 2007, and Barack Obama in 2009.
So rewarding Trump would require an ideological turnaround from the Nobel committee.
Fire note in tunnel: Motorists behaved like lemmings and driving in the wrong direction
The traffic chaos on Route 1 in Lohja took place on 8 September.
Due to the announcement, traffic in the tunnel area was cut off in the direction of both Turku and Helsinki.
When it became clear that this is a system failure, the fire department sought to bring traffic to normal.
But it didn't work very quickly.
We tried to open the road once before, but the Finnish Road Traffic Centre said it could not be opened because there are motorists on the road, and they are driving any things," on-call firefighter Pasi Kääriäinen told STT at the time.
At the time, we even started driving in the wrong direction after just a moment of waiting.
When the first one starts to act against traffic rules, a few others often follow suit, says Tapio Heiskanen, Liaison Manager at Liikenneturva.
Under traffic rules, motorways and tunnels must not stop for more than a compelling reason.
Liikenneturva points out that in exceptional situations, traffic cannot be used to endanger traffic with hasty solutions.
The airgoing vehicles shall always provide maximum accessibility.
Driving in the opposite direction on the motorway is especially prohibited, as is the case for a u-turn and reversing.
The same bans are also valid in tunnels, where headlights must always be turned on.
Stopping without compelling reason is also prohibited, as is of course parking.
There have even been incidents of a driver stopping in a tunnel to brush snow from his car.
It should be clear that this is the wrong place and the time for the activity in question, Heiskanen says in a statement.
Ilves fans would have liked to continue their celebrations, even though the ship was caught on the lakebed
Ilves fans of Ilves, carried by the inland waterway vessel M/S Tampere, would have wanted to stay on board to continue their victory celebrations, even though the ship had been caught by the lake floor from its bow, says Juho Syrjä, who was the ship’s head at the time of the incident.
M/S Tampere, which was travelling from Hämeenlinna to Tampere, drifted off its route late on Saturday evening and was caught at the bottom of its bow at Vanajavesi in Akaa.
The 19 passengers and five crew members on board the ship were evacuated to the mainland at night.
No one was injured in a haver.
Ilves fans would have liked to continue their party on board until morning, but of course it made more sense to send them by a fire service to the port and by bus home, Syrjä told STT.
Ilves fans had been in Hämeenlinna to watch Ilves and HPK match, which ended in a 4-3 win for Ilves.
According to Syrjä, Saturday's hadri was due to the water surface of Vanajavesi being about half a metre lower than normal.
According to Syrjä, navigation was also hampered by the fact that the nearest fairway sign was covered by log waste, which is why its reflectors were not normally visible in the dark autumn bridge.
No more mentionable collision
Haveri took place on the west side of the narrow Jumusen Strait, shortly after the shipping route under the bridge between Tampere and Helsinki.
There was no greater drama involved in the case, according to Syrjä, as the ship's speed at the time of the incident was very low and the impact on the bottom did not cause any more significant collision.
According to Syrjä, being caught at the bottom has not caused any leaks or imprints on the ship, and the cruises of the ship are expected to continue as normal.
A diver visited Saturday morning to check the condition of the ship before towing the ship off the shallows.
We will still visit the yard to check that this caused no damage, Syrjä says.
Syrjä believes that M/S Tampere’s next cruise booked for next weekend can be handled as agreed.
The ship's cruise season, he said, will continue until Independence Day.
No use for ambulances
Emergency services were alerted to the incident on Saturday night shortly after half past 12pm.
Ambulances were alerted to the port of Viiala to accept evacuated passengers, but there was no use for ambulances.
Matti Willman, the fire chief on duty, said late last night that evacuation conditions at the lake were tricky due to darkness and quite high winds.
The Pirkanmaa Rescue Department announced after half past three o’clock on Sunday that all those on board have been evacuated and passengers have been transferred by bus to Tampere.
The cruiser, built in 1957, was restored in 2001, 2014 and 2017.
Trump's Nominee for Judges, Accused of Rudicivism and Beverage, may miss out on top post
Brett Kavanaugh, who was presented as a judge of the U.S. Supreme Court, may well miss out on his post, says Programme Director Mika Aaltola from the Institute for International Policy.
So far, at least three women have accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault and inappropriate behaviour during their studies.
According to Aaltola, the doubts have brought so much political pressure on the Republican Party that President Donald Trump may end up presenting another person to serve up.
In the United States, there have been occasional incidents in the past that the presidential candidate for Supreme Court justice has provoked a series of contradictions.
In this case, the judge nominee has usually withdrawn himself, says Aaltola.
That way, the president has been able to keep his face.
The appointment would rain down on Democrat laurels
The U.S. Supreme Court seeks to be above politics, but in the case of Kavanaugh, choosing a new judge has become a very politically sensitive process.
If Kavanaugh is appointed, the decision will likely rain down on Democratic Party laurels in the upcoming midterm elections of Congress, according to Aaltola.
That would boost voting interest among young people and women who would be more likely to vote for Democrats.
On the other hand, a conservative judge's appointment to the Supreme Court would be a long-time victory for Republicans.
The appointment is not awarded to every presidential term, as in the United States Supreme Court justices are appointed for life.
In practice, some of them have retired at their own request between the ages of about 70 to 80.
Even among Republicans hesitant to call
U.S. Supreme Court Judacial Candidates will normally be subject to background verification, Aaltola says.
Although Trump has only set a deadline of one week for the FBI’s additional report, Aaltola says it can bring up something relevant.
It might bring it.
Rarely is smoke without fire, says Aaltola.
According to Aaltola, at least it is certain that Kavanaugh’s suitability or inconsistency will be discussed even more closely before the Senate makes its decision.
Republicans in the Senate have a majority of 51-49 votes, but at least two female Republican senators are thought to be skeptical of Kavanaugh's nomination.
The most embarrassing thing would be to take the nomination to a vote and the Republicans lose.
Woman identifies Salisbury suspect as military intelligence agent
A Russian woman has told broadcaster BBC that she recognizes a Russian man suspected of poisoning Salisbury as an agent of Russian military intelligence service.
The woman said based on photographs that it was Anatoly Chepiga, who works at military intelligence GRU.
Online community Bellingcat and Russian community Insider Russia previously reported revealing one of the men suspected of poisonings to Chepiga.
Already earlier, they said they found evidence that the men's current identities are undercover identities.
The BBC group travelled to a village near the Russian-Chinese border, where Chepiga grew up.
A woman in the village identified a young Tshepigan Bellingcat from photos posted.
He identified the same man from images from British police posing a man calling himself to Ruslan Boshirova.
Russian men are suspected of poisoning former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter with a Novichok nerve agent in March.
The Skripals survived.
Colonel Chepiga has been awarded, among other things, the title of honour for a hero of Russia in 2014.
Russia still denies a suspected GRU connection.
In an interview with Russian TV earlier in September, the men suspected of poisonings said they had been tourists in Salisbury.
Elderly in hemitp-to-war health and social services reform
We have now received a living example of what the social and health care reform thresholds defined by the Sipilä government means in practice.
My birth, Vaala’s health and social services, are produced by the Oulunkaari municipal authority, whose health service director has been elected as Attendo’s former Regional Director in 2016.
Local Government leaders warn the council of a change limiter.
If war spending rises now, municipal government aid will be cut in the future.
The municipal city centre decision-makers were startled, and most of them are ready for a major structural change in care for the elderly, which would end institutional care in an inpatient care of a health centre and a small unit of memory disorders.
Home health care would be increased, which means elderly people living in remote villages in remote villages to be dumped from their roots next to a health centre for treatment.
Attendo trusted the municipality to pay it to customers.
Vaala's left did not swallow up poor preparation, but organised a good public event involving a large number of relatives, local nurses and also councillors from other parties.
I used the social and health care community to showcase how the municipality of Vaala is already treating elderly people at home in the whole of Northern Ostrobothnia.
A neighbouring councillor, Carina Läntinen, was also involved.
The local newspaper made a big story about the occasion, and it again put Oulunkaari’s preparers on their back foot.
Sote preparers do not write in any papers that Attendo has built a new care home in Vaala, which is now waiting for empty residents.
There are no other service providers.
Preparators only talk about service vouchers, but do not tell us what level of care it provides or what kind of personnel structure Attendo will treat elderly people until hospice care.
Without a nurse?
Namely, the facilities of a health centre are closed because there is no doctor’s night-time emergency.
Attendo will also resort to doctors at the Vaala Health Centre.
Vaala's example is about how centric government officials run councillors with inadequate information and councillors put their backs against a wall against a change limiter.
This is how the Centre Party clears Vaala's residents, as who will stay there unsafe voluntarily if there is a chance to move out.
Was there one election phrase for the whole country to be kept inhabited?
Turkish President Erdogan opens Grand Mosque in Cologne
In the German city of Cologne, thousands of people protested when Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, visiting the country, opened one of Europe's biggest mosque.
Several hundred people had gathered to the Rhine River beach from early this morning.
Erdogan is not welcome, read protesters' signs, and slogans condemned fascism.
Several demonstrations have been held during Erdogan's visit, which began Thursday, with strict security measures.
In Cologne, about 10,000 people were expected to protest in advance of the human rights situation in Turkey, among other things.
Erdogan's supporters had also gathered in the vicinity of the Grand Mosque.
But police had cordoned off a large area of the environment of a mosque for safety reasons.
In his opening speech, Erdogan praised his visit to Germany as having succeeded and judged it to strengthen relations between Germany and Turkey.
During his visit, Erdogan met with Chancellor Angela Merkel twice.
Erdogan and Merkel on Friday vowed to rebuild relations between the two countries, which have worsened significantly since Turkey's 2016 coup attempt.
But Merkel stressed that there are deep disagreements between countries, including on human rights issues.
The review surrounds a visit
Both Cologne Mayor Henriette Reker and North Rhine-Westphalia state Prime Minister Armin Laschet cancelled their participation in the opening as criticism of Erdogan's visit intensified.
Cansu, a 30-year-old student from Turkey, said he came to an anti-Erdogan protest from Switzerland.
I want to be a voice for those who can't take to the streets in Turkey.
They have been arrested, killed and subordinated.
For Erdogan, everything that differs from his own thinking is terrorism.
In the last stage of Erdogan's trip to Germany, North Rhine-Westphalia, a significant proportion of the population is of Turkish origin.
Slovakia faces charges of journalist murder
In Slovakia, three people have been charged with murdering journalist Jan Kuciack.
The prosecutor said Friday that three people were charged with murder of Kuciaki and her fiancee in February, as well as other crimes.
Earlier this week, police arrested eight people in an investigation into the murder, but five of them have been released.
Kuciak was found shot dead in February with his fiancee at his home in Bratislava.
He had studied the links between politicians and the Italian mafia.
Police have suspected the killings were linked to Kuciak's investigation.
The incident and an article published in Kuciaki have raised media freedom and corruption in Slovakia.
There may be problems with Karjalainen distribution in sparsely populated areas on Sunday
Due to the imbue of printing, Sunday’s Karjalainen will also have to be mailed unopposed.
This may be reflected in the distribution of the magazine in sparsely populated areas where distribution to joint boxes has to be completed from memory.
The situation was the same for Saturday's paper, and the problem could continue on Monday.
Mailing puts extra bundles of magazines in the province.
The newspapers of other Finnish subscribers will not be mailed separately until Monday.
The distribution of these magazines is delayed.
Vesa is a Finnish astronaut
Journalist Arto Nyberg will interview Vesa Heilala, among others, in his upcoming talk show live.
Vesa is in the studio to announce his upcoming space trip, which he booked from Virgin Galactica in 2010.
The price was 151,000 euros, which needed a bank loan to be paid.
If the original plans had been correct, Vesa would have been in space long ago.
But the departure date has been postponed year on year.
Now it seems that after an unlucky test flight in 2014 and claimed a fatality, things are in the tub.
If all goes well, commercial flights will start this year or at the latest next year.
Vesa's flight number is 300, meaning his journey takes place about a year after the first departure.
The flight takes 2.5 hours and in a weightless state we are 5 minutes at an altitude of 100 kilometres, a Finnish astronaut says of the upcoming one on his website.
At the same address, he also backgrounds his yearning for space.
When I was a kid, I read a Comics magazine called Space Travel and saw the Star Trek series on TVs.
We've seen the Star Wars, and that's what the idea was left to smouldering...
Why not?
Everyone has their dreams.
Manchester City were a rude host
Manchester City continued their undefeated course in the Premier League when they thrashed Brighton 2-0 on home soil on Saturday.
The winner of the sixth win of the reigning champion team of the season was goal injectionrs Raheem Sterling and Sergio Agcheero.
Sterling was allowed to direct his fourth of the season from close range to an empty-net goal when Leroy Sanes found him in the 30th minute of Brighton's goal off the back post of Brighton.
Agacheero raised his own goal balance to five as he sawn off the Brighton defence with Sterling to pieces in the 65th minute of play.
The Argentinian was able to place 2-0 finishes at a penalty spot easy.
City, who started the season with six wins and one draw, lead the Premier League with 19-point picks.
But Liverpool, who played one game less, lurk only one point away.
Liverpool face series three Chelsea in their own seventh-round match on Saturday night.
Youth clubs elected new decision-makers in Joensuu
At their meeting on Sunday, the Finnish Youth Society selected new decision-makers for their next three-year term of 2019-2021.
Anu Sivonen from Ylä-Savo was elected as the chairman and Petra Mäkeläinen from Häme as Vice Chairman.
The council was elected to 40 ordinary members and 40 deputy members, the Finnish Youth Society announced on Sunday.
A youth club meeting was held in Joensuu.
We want our cultural activities to be known for quality and safety.
In its three-year operating goals, the Youth Society Conference in Joensuu provides three promises: We keep the doors open to everyone, and organise equal recreational activities regardless of the place of residence and background, and support volunteer activities and people on their own growth paths, says Suomen Youth Society.
Lewis Hamilton praised Kimi Raikkonen and marvelled at Ferrari: 'Going to a very important driver'
In an interview with Swiss newspaper Blick, the British driver of the Mercedes was asked if he believes that the release of Kimi Raikkonen from Ferrari services would help Hamilton in the rest of the season.
Hamilton leads Ferrari's second driver in the World Cup standings with 40 points to Sebastian Vettel.
Just under three weeks ago, Ferrari said Raikkonen would not continue to join the team next season and Raikkonen announced his move to Sauber.
Hamilton, of course, does not believe Raikkonen would hit gloves on the counter.
I don't think Kimi will change at the remaining Games.
He's an exceptional professional - a fantastic driver.
He remains one of my favorite drivers and I am convinced Ferrari will lose a very important driver.
It doesn't make sense to me.
Hamilton has previously said Raikkonen has been one of his role models.
I don't know if Kimi knows this, but when I was young and dreaming of Formula One, I played F1 on PlayStation all day.
I was always Kimi, which is pretty crazy," Hamilton said in June.
The F1 season continues Sunday with a Russian race.
Mercedes' Valtteri Bottas will go from pole position to race starting at 2pm.
The evening paper follows the race moment by moment.
Football A-juvenile Championship championship struggle became a complete farce: the opponent arrived with only 7 players
Football boys' top tier ends on Saturday, when the final round of the season will be played.
Before the round started at 1 p.m., the starting points for the championship battle were clear: FC Lahti Academy is enough to put a first place against Vasa IFK.
To turn the situation in the final round, Ilves, who is second in the championship battle, must win PK-35 and hope to lose the bayers.
However, the Lahtins championship was effectively secured even before the starting whistle, as Vasa IFK had arrived in Lahti with only seven players.
If there were one fewer of the Vaasans, the match could not have started.
FC Lahti Academy won the match 16-0.
At the break, the Bay Area led 7-0.
One of the reasons for the loss of players is that the team has played some of the same players in the A-juvenile SM-series, i.e. the P20 series, and the men's Two-part C.
Vasa IFK has played in League Two against relegation for virtually the entire season.
In the closing round of 2 on Saturday, Vasa IFK will be forced to win JBK in an away match and at the same time hope that Tampere United will lose their own away match against KuFu in Toivala, Siilinjärvi.
Car ended up on its roof in Eno - emergency services said luck was involved
The passenger car drifted off the road and ended up on its roof at Juttuvaarantie in Eno at 9am on Sunday.
Four people were involved in the accident.
Two of them were slightly injured, emergency services said.
There was luck, the statement said.
Emergency services said the road was wet after the rain.
A police patrol attended the crash site.
Supo expects new ways of reconnaissance: Equipment acquisitions and recruitments already done, planned activities abroad are not shining
According to Suppo’s Chief Antti Pelttar, the intelligence law has been prepared for by making equipment acquisitions and training personnel.
When the intelligence laws enter into force, an increase of approximately EUR 10 million would be permanently added to the supine budget.
The protection police (ssupon) premises on Ratakatu in Helsinki are already preparing for the full entry into force of intelligence laws.
Antti Pelttari, Head of Suppo’s Coalition Congratulation Relative, tells Lännen Media that equipment acquisitions have already been made for future intelligence powers.
Serena Williams startles in video of her singing topless - campaigning for awareness of breast cancer
Tennis superstar Serena Williams shrugged again.
Now she is campaigning to raise awareness of breast cancer by posting a video on her Instagram account of her singing with her arms in front of her breasts alone, reports AFP news agency.
The song is the 1991 hit I Touch Myself by Australian The Divinyls.
In the video, Williams supports the Australian Breast Cancer Society.
"I decided The Divinyls' worldwide hit to remind women to carry regular self-pronged [breasts] checks," Williams writes in an Instagram post.
And yes, this put me in an uncomfortable area, but I wanted to do it because the subject touches all women, regardless of skin color, anywhere in the world.
Early detection is all about a and o - it's playing out many lives.
The second author of The Divinyls' song is Chrissy Amphlett, who died of breast cancer five years ago at the age of 53.
The music video is part of the I Touch Myself project, which is in honor of Chrissy Amphlett.
"She passed away from breast cancer but gave us a hit song to remind women to put their health first," Williams says.
The video has now been viewed 1.5 million times.
It was released early Sunday morning.
In the comments of the video, Williams is praised for courage.
Williams dropped out of the Beijing tennis tournament earlier this week.
There is an uproar at an open US tennis tournament three weeks ago.
Williams fired up to the head judge of the match, including alleged that men are accepted for much more violent behaviour than female players.
Chinese restaurant on mountain trail not suitable for height camlongers
In addition to traditional Chinese delicacies, the restaurant serves great scenery.
An exceptional restaurant has opened in China's Zhejiang province.
It is literally located on a cliff ledge.
You can see the forest spreading below if you wish.
The steepscapes of the high places make restaurant visitors gasp in the Longquan mountains.
To get to the restaurant, you need to hike amid peach trees.
The restaurant opened to hikers on 19 September 2018.
You wonder where the restaurant toilet is located.
A hike for a restaurant requires good ground condition, the site says.
Korpela's alley running stops today: Here's how it all ends
All good things will end in time.
Today, it will happen to the domestic country drama of Korpela’s alley run, which has been quite well maintained.
The third season has gone like hot rocks: last week, the episode was watched on television by 722,000 Finns on first performance.
The peak figures do not in themselves have any practical significance, as there will be no continuation of Heikki Luoma and Jukka Mäkinen’s series.
In the final episode, Jaska and Mirku’s relationship takes a big leap forward, and I think Jaska’s mother will be the first to guess what to come.
The relationship between Anssi and Miisa is also warm, in light of recent events, quite romantic, but then Laiho appears to appear again.
Police are also suspicious of a bone in relation to the man.
Still, no one knows how to foresee Laiho's fate in advance.
Anita, on the other hand, will hear incredible news.
Kauko's last will comes out, which puts a woman to the brink of tears.
A week later, in Sunday evenings, Sorjonen will continue.
Korpela's alley run today on TV1 at 9:05 p.m.
Is it worth going to work tomorrow with a little cold?
Here are the facts for and against
Flu season is hot.
A lot of people are going to stay home or not.
However, a work mole should consider whether it is worth going to infecting others, as the disease can be contagious, even if their own symptoms are small.
Sometimes flu symptoms suddenly strike, sometimes they appear creeps.
In the latter option, you may already infect others, even if your own symptoms feel small, says the Prevention publication.
Is it worth staying at home?
According to Prevention, the flu is contagious even when the person has no symptoms.
The virus is transmitted a day before symptoms begin and from five days to a week.
Children may infect longer illness.
As soon as you recognize the symptoms, you shouldn't be at school or at work.
You can go back to work when the cough eases and there's no fever anymore, says Professor Gregory Poland, a professor of medicine.
Training should also be avoided.
Too fast a return to the gym slows to slow recovery.
In addition, remember to wash your hands, put in a handkerchief and throw snot papers in the trash.
Slow to move anyway?
If you have to leave your home sick, consider wearing a protective mask.
The mask doesn't control viruses, but keeps the user aware of the area of the head.
Then fingers will not be put in your nose or mouth, Poland says.
Sneezing is also limited to a mask.
How can I avoid infection?
The best way is to wash your hands and avoid touching your face.
But the latter is difficult to avoid.
In the United States, for example, an average person touches their eyes, nose or mouth every 15 to 30 seconds, Poland warns.
New Miss Finland repeats pageant tradition: 'My husband is a hockey player'
Hockey player and pageant are often linked.
This was also the case with Alina Voronkovan, 23.
Alina Voronkova from Pertunmaa has received the 2018 Miss Finland crown.
The beauty now lives in Lahti, where she moved to at 15.
Aliina's mother is an Indian and father is Russian.
Voronkova was bullied at school for his father's Russianness.
My mother and Father have moved to Finland 25 years ago, but I was bullied because of my Russianness.
In Pertunmaa I had no friends at all, Alina says at the launch of the semi-finalists of the Miss Finland pageant.
After high school, Alina decided to start with a clean slate and move to Lahti to go to high school.
Soon the pageant beauty found new friends and the day-to-day life rolled out as hoped.
At the age of 15, you think you were an adult, but I really didn’t think about afterwards.
Three years ago, Alina met her current partner Joonas Hurri, who is familiar with the Pelicans.
After a career in SM-liiga, a hockey player has played abroad, such as Sweden and China.
In 2009, he was on the Finnish team at the 18-year-old World Cup.
In the early days of dating, the couple lived in a long-term distance, but later Alina got to travel with her husband to the world.
If I could get to the winning trio and with that I would have a career, I don't want to believe it would affect our relationship in any way.
Even if we have to live separately, we have a good confidence and there is a good thing in a remote relationship that the initial spark stays up all the time, Alina grinned in May.
Rejoicing in constant growth, death on our backs
Almost everyone is concerned about the resilience of the Earth.
There is little to give up nothing.
Sustainable alternatives are sought for continuous growth, but even the theory of a moderate economy runs into major problems.
Over a few generations, the continued growth of the economy has brought ordinary people to normal people, especially in the northern hemisphere, a level of living that could only dream of.
However, the long-standing overrun of the Earth's carrying capacity and climate change are causing this market economy to falter in a threatening manner.
Two men were stabbed on Sunday night in Kannelmäki Sitratori at 4 a.m.
A man born in 1986 was seriously injured in a stabbing and another, born less severely born in 1968.
The older of the men have already been discharged from hospital.
Police have apprehended one person whose possible role in the stabbing is being investigated.
Police are also looking for another suspect in the incidents.
The incidents are being investigated as attempted manslaughter and aggravated assault.
Important point for IFK Mariehamn - Inter coach fretted by error
IFK Mariehamn's Simon Silverholt's equaliser against Inter brought an important point to the team in the men's football league on Saturday.

Silvelholt got through from the right edge and brought the ball over goalkeeper Henrik Moisander with luck.
With a guest game, the Mariehamns reached for the difference to the Turku Palloseura in the spot of series carrivers to two points.
An important goal and a valuable point, summed up Mariehamn head coach Peter Lundberg.
Lundberg noted, however, that the team did not break out to fight what he expected.
We made a lot of mistakes in the opening period, but luckily the Turku goals brought us stronger to the game.
According to John Allen, head coach of home team Inter, the game was in control, but the goal-scoring yielded pain again.
One defensive error took us a full spot, Allen fretted.
We were the best again!

Lehterä showed his underachieving expertise, the venue is not yet certain
Jori Lehterä's strong under-strength play came to the fore when his NHL club, the Philadelphia Flyers, played their last practice game before the start of the season.
Philadelphia beat Boston 4-1, and Lehterä fed Michael Raffpli twice to score.

In a training match, according to Carchid, Lehterä was excellent.
In the second period, Lehterä fought the puck to himself with an underwhelming effort, pulling a defender at him and fed Raffl, who was waiting in front of goal, to open ground.
For the second time, the duo's collaboration brought a goal at the very end of the match.
The Flyers begin the NHL season on October 4 with an away game against Las Vegas.
In Boston, defenseman Urho Vaakanainen is waiting for a solution to the team's coaching management to see if he can join the NHL group.
I thought training camp was good.
I did my best, and I can be proud of this.
Now the coaches decide if I can play.
I believe I'm ready for the NHL," Libra woman said in an interview posted on Boston's Twitter account.
Libra woman, who had a puck-taught puck-taught in the River Boys, played against Philadelphia for 19.31 minutes.

A recent photo shows change: World's strongest man slimmed down on dozens of pounds
Eddie Hall, crowned the world's strongest man in 2017, is undergoing a striking transformation.
Eddie Hall of Britain hunted the title of the world's strongest man long and purpose.
Hall could eat up to 10,000 kilocalories of food in a day and weighed 200 pounds at its biggest, according to the Mirror.

Restaurant ship M/S Tampere crashed a rock in Pyhäjärvi - "Supportingly closed with a rocky"
The inland waterway vessel M/S Tampere ran aground late on Friday night in Akaa, Pyhäjärvi.
Emergency services were alerted to a water traffic accident on Friday night after half past 12pm.
The 30-metre vessel M/S Tampere has run into a rock, and is firmly attached to its bow with a rocky, described Matti Willman, on-call firefighter.
There were 19 passengers and five crew members on board.
Emergency services said personal injuries were avoided.
Passengers and almost all crew members have been evacuated to the mainland from the ship.
Now they are being moved by bus ride to Tampere, on-call chief Jari Nieminen told STT after 1 a.m.
Ambulances were alerted to the port of Viiala to accept evacuated passengers.
The ship, which travelled from Hämeenlinna to Tampere, had, for some reason, drifted away from its route west of a narrow Jumusensalmi.
Police are investigating the cause of the incident.
Matti Willman, the fire chief on duty, said earlier in the evening that conditions at the lake are difficult due to darkness and quite high winds.
Emergency services say the fate of the ship is unclear.
Apparently, the ship is not leaking.
After the evacuation operation, divers will set to check what is at the bottom of the situation there.
Built in 1957, M/S Tampere is a restaurant ship, a inland waterway vessel with a maximum number of passengers of 180 people.
A meeting room for private use is also available on board.
According to the ship's website, cruiser has been restored in 2001, 2014 and 2017.

Ex-managers demanded unpaid fees from Robert Helenius
Boxer Robert Helenius's tonight's fight against Erkan Teper is overshadowed by a money row.
Ilta-Sanomat today reported on a summons of boxing manager Jaakko Helminen and Deputy Judge Jussi Kokkila, in which Helenius, with default interest, is charged a total of over 80,000 euros worth of unpaid manager fees.
According to the application for a subpoena, Helminen and Kokkila worked for Helenius 15 April 2014-30 January 2015.
We've tried to mediate, but there's no other choice.
There has been a clear mandate here, and a great deal of work has been done, Kokkila says to Ilta-Sanomat.
Helenius’ current manager, Markus Sundman, sent a response to Iltalehti, telling the boxer’s view of events.
Helenius denies that he is obliged to pay the required amount.
According to Vastine, Kokkila and Helminen had offered their services in a financially fraught situation to Helenius and promised to arrange matches and sponsorship income for him.
It had been verbally agreed that Helenius would be obliged to pay only percentages of his matches.
It was recurring to be assured that Helenius would not have to pay anything, only to receive their arranged income.
This is also normal and the only practice of professional athletes manager.
Salary work has never been agreed upon, and one would also have been absurd in Helenius’ situation, Sundman explains in his message.
There was never a written agreement on cooperation.
According to the reply, Helenius would have preferred to agree on income distribution in writing, but Kokkila and Sundman only received the draft at the end of 2014.
He stated the proposal for his own weakness and cut off cooperation with Kokkila and Helminen.
Helenius did not fight once when he was dealing with Kokkila and Helminen.
A year after the end of the collaboration, Helenius had been given an "individual but sizable" bill of manager's work.
This year, a cover has been filed with the same claims.
Helenius considers Helminen and Kokkila’s exterior activities to be cowardly, the response states.
Helenius will face seventh-seeded Erkan Teper of the heavyweight challenger list of boxing federations IBF today.
A hearty man and a good journalist
Ilkka "Ile" Vainio, an entertainer and music producer, felt the late radio host and journalist Erkki Päll for decades.
Longtime radio host and journalist Erkki Pälli passed away from incurable liver cancer at the age of 83.
The presenter's death notice was published in Sunday's Helsingin Sanomat.
The announcement says that Päll died on September 3.
Pälli reported a serious illness on his Facebook page in March 2018.
The publication was also seen by Ile Vainio, who was saddened by the fate of an acquaintance.
He left a goodbye to Facebook earlier than a goodbye, Ile Vainio says.
Vainio considers Erkki Pälli to be a multi-talented expert who became a great journalist.
He recalls being a well-liked person with quick hoxtographs and funny things.
I got to know Erkki when I first visited Finnlevy at the age of 12 and started there as a warehouseman.
Erki and I met.
He was then a spokesperson for Finnlevy and in various positions, Ile Vainio recalls.
When I progressed to make records as a music producer, there were hundreds of occasions where Erkki Pälli was a regular journalist at all parties doing stories about artists.
He was always knowledgeable and I saw how great a fire he had for entertainment, music and people.
When Erkki interviewed someone, he got to the skin of his interviewees directly.
He was a heartfelt man and a good journalist.
For many, he became familiar with Yle’s radio host, but he also wrote great newspaper stories.
Erkki interviewed me many times.
He was good at talking, Vainio praises.
Over the decades, in addition to journalistic work, Pälli worked with Fazer label company Toivo Kärki.
He was a music producer on Vesa-Matti Loiri's records.
But the biggest passion of the squeak was radio work, with a distinctive style.
He worked as a radio since the 1960s, and he became familiar to numerous listeners at Yle's ether.
Pälli retired in 1998.
The Finnish Ski Association announced on Saturday that the union’s financial year, which ended in May, showed a profit of about 450,000 euros.
The union describes its economic situation as an experienced "full translation," although of course the economy is burdened by "surprising debt in balance."
Mika Kulmala, Executive Director, praises the rapid response and strict financial discipline.
We react to the situation last autumn as quickly as possible, taking adjustment measures.
Careful planning of operations and financial management have become more active throughout our organisation, Kulmala says in a statement.
We have also succeeded well in partner acquisition, and the return of the World Cups was maximal during the past competition season.
However, in the future, cost control must be accurate, and at the same time we must constantly look for new funding models.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence
Dozens of bodies lie in a hospital backyard in the town of Palu on Indonesia's Sulawes island.
Only one building separates them from an area where injured survivors have been gathered to assess injuries and treatment needs.
Patients are also being treated outdoors due to aftershocks.
One of those in the hospital area was Baharuddin, a 52-year-old paluanguer who was looking for his son.
Like many Indonesians, he uses only one name.
I have one child, and he's missing.
I spoke to him most recently when he was going to school," Baharuddin told AFP news agency.
In the courtyard of the military hospital, there was a Dwi Haris lying in Palu, who has suffered injuries to his back and arm.
He was at a local hotel at the start of the quake with his wife and daughter.
The family had been invited to return to a wedding party.
I probably got pinned under a collapsed wall.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to him and my child.
I hope they're safe," Haris told the Associated Press of the news agency, according to British media.
Small shops are being robbed
At Palu's evacuation center, Risa Kusuma, the 35-year-old mother of a small baby, tried to reassure her feverish baby.
He described the mood in the city as a tense.
Clean water is scarce.
Small shops are being robbed everywhere, Kusuma reported.
Many of Palu's residents have slept outside or in temporary bamboo huts.
Even if the home were somehow up, any aftershocks could destroy it once and for all and bury the residents under them.
According to the Associated Press news agency, more than half of the prisoners in Palu prison escaped after prison walls plummeted.
There were reportedly about 560 prisoners, so there are possibly about 300 fugitives.
Some of the prisoners at Donggala Prison have also escaped, according to The Jakarta Post.
The newspaper said the prisoners were outraged and set fire to prison after guards told them to go looking for relatives affected by the earthquake and tsunami.
Palu Airport has reopened for aid flights.
Among the first to landed at the airport was an Army C-130 transport plane bringing relief supplies.
Commercial flights to Palu Airport are only allowed to a limited extent.
Pilots will have to land at the airport without air traffic control assistance, as an air traffic control tower was severely damaged by an earthquake.
Rain sweeps over Finland at night
A long rain area will spread across the country overnight from the west direction, according to the Finnish Meteorological Institute.
Rainfall comes mostly as water, but sleet or snow are expected in central and northern Lapland.
The frosts of previous night are not happening again because temperatures under cloud cover remain higher.
A cloudier night keeps the lowest temperatures in check.
We can temporarily visit the West, said on-call meteorologist Ville Ilkka.
On Sunday, the rain area will recede to the east as early as mid-morning.
The south and west are pouty or partly cloudy.
In the afternoon, temperatures move up to the height of Oulu at 10-13 degrees.
The start of the week looks similar to temperatures in southern and central parts of the country, but the weather will become more unsettled.
Wind and wave warnings are in place in the sea areas.
There are no actual autumn storms to be expected for the next few days, but otherwise there will be a typically variable autumnal weather.
Autumn is starting to hit it seriously, Ilkka said.
Miss Finland final won't be seen on TV
From IL-TV you can watch the glamour and sparkle of the red carpet of the Miss Finland competition.
Iltalehti’s entertainment editors are streaming live from the Red worm of the Miss Finland final from the Billnäs Ironworks on IL-TV.
The broadcast will begin at around 6:50 p.m.
The new Miss Finland will be crowned from ten finalists on Saturday.
The Miss Finland 2018 final will take place at Billnäs ironworks in Raasepori.
Before the finale starts, you can follow the atmosphere from the spot on IL-TV live.
Live coverage will begin at around 6.30pm and continue for about an hour.
This year, Miss Finland winners of previous years have been invited to the final.
They are represented by 1998 Miss Finland Jonna Ziprus.
Other representatives of the jury include wellness entrepreneur Jutta Gustafsberg, photographer Nadi Hammouda, Managing Director of Jounin Kauppa Minttu Murphy-Kaulanen and Seiska’s news producer Katja Lintunen.
We were hoping he'd get to college before going to pageant
Russian father Dimitri and mother of Ingrian Svetlana believed in their daughter’s success in the Miss Finland final.
The parents of new Miss Finland Alina Voronkova, Dimitri Voronkov and Svetlana Voronkova proudly followed their daughter's first moments with a crown in the head.
They were going to serve to the crowd from Pertunmaa and were still going to drive home after the final.
It's a lovely atmosphere!
We believed Erika all the time, but half an hour before the result, Svetlana laughed.
Svetlana is an Inker and Dimitri Russian.
Alina speaks fluent Russian, even though she has lived her entire childhood in Finland.
Svetlana says that when she was little, Alina was more interested in acting and many other things than being a miss.
Alina was often told that when she's so pretty, she should start to miss.
But he said he wanted to be a radio host.
Only later did Alina get excited about beauty pageants.
The parents wished Alina to attend university before participating in the Miss Finland competition.
That's what happened, and in the end, Alina still wanted to do a bachelor's degree before pageants.
We asked him last year why he wasn't participating, but he wanted to finish that bump.
Parents believe that Alina won the competition because there is a wholesome example for young people and adults.
He exercises a lot and eats healthy.
And Alina likes to be there, it shows.
Alina’s boyfriend Joonas Hurri is playing hockey in Japan, and he didn’t get to Finland to encourage his love in the final.
Aliina's parents believe the relationship between young people lasts a pageant year.
Yes, it is intended!
My parents wished her daughter would visit soon.
It's been such a long break in visits because of pageant kikirs.
I miss you, even though messages have been sent.

Sari Piippo left her career in Brussels and became a housewife in Finland - the idea of a comic book popped into the mind: lack of drawing skills did not slow down
The organic wreath once left my husband's statement, in which he suggested it to be a person to develop my story, says Sari Piippo, a comic book blogger from Espoo, a housewife and a former EU translator.
Sari Piippo says that she was an EU translator with economic and legal affairs in Brussels until after a fourth child, the family became a returnee ten years ago.
I enjoyed being a stay-at-home mom.
This has been the best time of my life, but at some point it occurred to me what to do when even the smallest child was getting big.
Then 2014 picture came a cartoon.
Piippo says he had never dreamed of making a comic book, even though he had read Donald Duck, Tintin and Asterix from a young age.
I had drawn the last time I was a child, but when these creation manuscripts began to emerge, it changed.
I first made some dozens of scripts in a desk drawer.
My daughter, Viivi Valkama (b. 2000) is a skilled sketch artist, but I couldn't lure him up until summer 2016 when I bribed Lines using a drawing plate.
His enthusiasm lasted a dozen pieces of strip, and then I had to start trying for it yourself, laughs Piippo, who says the drawing board was a great encourageor to him.
The drawing board is an easy and convenient instrument to try to get something done.
I didn't even try to draw on paper," says Piippo about his relationship to drawing, which he usually does at night.
The scripts pop into the mind all the time, but usually I don't finish at once.
One three-screen strip takes several hours.
I might do a screen at a time and I like to play with colors.
Starting drawing is always the hardest thing to do, because drawing is not my strongest kind.
Sari Piippo says she appreciates the Dilbert of Scott Adams, among others, from current newspaper comics.
The organic fool is a carrot-tuffed mother with a salad hair cunds to the L-themed L-themed.
Other people are Male, Pissis and Gemini.
In the world of organic nonsense, man is what he eats.
The ideas of the series come from your own life and social media.
Sari Piippo does not want to preach or offer a compulsion bun, even if Organic wobbling sometimes puts it.
Piippo says he reads his series to his husband and children.
It’s such a great feeling when you look at the comic book you’re drawing and saying that I’ve done it today.
There are plenty of challenges for my housewife!

Indonesia earthquake: Air traffic controller sacrificed himself - left no cracking tower until he got hundreds of passengers to safety
The hero of the Indonesia earthquake has been 21-year-old air traffic controller Anthonius Gunawan Agung.
Agung was left alone in the air traffic control tower until escorting a passenger plane carrying hundreds of people safely from an island shaken by an earthquake.
The youngster was in charge of air traffic control at Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie Airport in the town of Palu when an earthquake struck on Friday.
As others fled the air traffic control tower, Agung refused to leave his place before being able to control the Batik Air passenger plane from the tarmac into the air.
This allowed him to save hundreds of lives," Indonesia's Federal Aviation Administration told AFP.
Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie Airport on Saturday after an earthquake.
The air traffic control tower shuddered and cracked.
Eventually, Agung tried to save himself by jumping from the fourth floor of the tower.
His leg was broken and he suffered serious internal organ injuries.
Agung was rushed to a nearby hospital.
He was to be transported by helicopter to a better equipped facility, but passed away 20 minutes before the helicopter arrived, an aviation official told The Jakarta Post.
The quake continued to intensify after the flight reached the air, and its intensity was eventually measured at 7.5 magnitudes.
At least 832 people lost their lives.
Indonesia's Federal Aviation Administration has respected Agung's heroism on social media.
Rehn pondered Europe's end of a trade war: "You have to look at the next tweet"
The US-China trade war is reflected in the global economy as a whole.
Growth forecasts have been calculated across Europe, and the Bank of Finland has also slightly lowered its own economic growth estimates.
Director General Olli Rehn said in Yle’s first morning that even though the intensifying tensions do not have direct effects on European trade flows, it undermines trust, which in turn is reflected in companies’ investment decisions.
The situation also concerns the export of Finnish companies.
Rehn thinks Europe is very talented so far.
It has been able to build an interim peace with the United States and contributed to calming the situation with China and Japan.
In Rehn's view, Europe does not seem to be grinding over the edge of a trade war.
You have to look at the next tweet and then evaluate it.
We have a pretty unpredictable partner in the direction of Washington, he said in an interview with Yle.
Europe also has its own risks.
One of them is Italy, the third largest economy in the eurozone, which is also one of the most indebted countries in the eurozone and the western world.
Yesterday, the market reacted drasticly to a clearly deficit-based budget presented by the Italian government on Thursday evening.
Next year's deficit will be more than 2.4 percent of GDP.
Rehn finds the situation in Italy worrying.
Five per cent of the country's loan portfolio is problem loans and unstructured credits account for more than ten per cent.
In addition, its public finances are weak and the country seems to again exceed its commitments to its European partners.
There may not be any reason to paint new crises yet, Rehn replied when asked if Italy would take Europe to a new economic crisis.
Another issue that is affecting Europe is the UK's exit from the EU.
Rehn hoped it was at peace.
A dispute break-up would have much more negative effects.
Rehn joined the Governor of the Bank of Finland in July.
Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank (ECB), will step back in just over a year.
The debate over his successor has begun.
The name of both Rehn and his predecessor Erkki Liikanen have flashed in speeches.
I don’t mind if Finnish names are included, Rehn said, adding that he would not comment further.

Missing sponger found thanks to 'unpredict trial'
Finnish police drone expertise is world-class: "We are asked about training"
According to the rector of the Police University of Applied Sciences, the police can use drone in addition to searching for missing persons, for example, in forensic scene investigations and intelligence missions.
On Tuesday, Oulu police managed to find a lost spitter in Raahe with a drone in just a couple of minutes.
Kimmo Himberg, the headmaster of the Police University of Applied Sciences, tweeted about the incident and mentioned, among other things, that "with the help of unpredictable experimentation and effective training, we are at the forefront of the world here too."
The drone is quite a new thing and even more recent in police missions.
There are no statistics on the Finnish police being a master of drone use.
According to Himberg, there is a strong belief that this is the case.
This has become clear, for example, when the experiences of the Finnish police have been reported in international events.
There is a lot of interest in it elsewhere, Himberg says.
There would be a lot of people to watch the Finnish police drone operations.
We're being asked for training.
Further generalization
Himberg points out that finding a missing person in Finland’s winter conditions as soon as possible is very important.
As stated, in Raahe’s case, the lost people were found with drone in just a couple of minutes.
The Finnish police have already trained hundreds of drone pilots.
Himberg said more of them are to be trained.
Already, drones are heavily used in police duties, and their use is becoming more common and increasing in the future.
I would dare say that, Himberg tells me.
In addition to searching for the missing, the police, according to Himberg, drones can use drones in, for example, accident or crime scene investigations and in certain kinds of intelligence missions.
For example, you already have to check an area a little further away, where you may be afraid of violence.
The drone can be used for advance intelligence.
Karelian Rugby entered first divar
Karelian Rugby celebrated a 2nd Division win in Kuopio on Saturday.
Joensuuns were still a 7-12 loss to Helsinki Rugby Club in midway through the match, but found a plot in the second period and porch southern guests 26-12.
At the same time, the 2 division championship meant a historic rise to Division 1 for Karelian Rugby.
In the past, the club has played in first place, but at the time Finnish rugby series action was divided into two levels, SM-series and multi-group Division 1.
The club is going to take a place in the league, but it will know quite a job for next winter.
The current roster of just under twenty players must be raised to 25.
Division 1 also knows the increase in the number of games and longer game journeys, so fundraising must also be in line with that.
Kotkaniemi starts season in Montreal, confirms head coach
Claude Julien, head coach of the Montreal Canadiens in the NHL, confirmed on the club's Twitter account that Finnish forward Jesperi Kotkaniemi will start a season in Montreal.
Montreal drafted super-promising Kotkaniemi, 18, in the first round at number three in a summer draft.
The striker joined Montreal's training strength at the end of the summer and has presented strong gripes at September practice matches.
Kotkaniemi scored in his first practice match.
Head coach Julien praised the Finn as having taken big development steps after arriving at a rookie camp.
The NHL regular season starts on Thursday night.
Montreal will face the Toronto Maple Leafs in the opening round.
What is a good leader?
This week there has been a lot of talk about management in Finland.
In an interview with HS, Nokia’s Chairman of the Board Risto Siilasmaa, explained his book Paranoid Optimism, in which he sheds light on his philosophy of leadership.
At the same time, he criticises the management of his predecessor, Jorma Ollila.
Ollila strongly denied the accusations, but even previous Nokia reports have talked about executives' inability to act as a team; fear and non-talking, which in part caused a collapse in mobile phone business.
The company's risk-taking ability and agility of the rise phase disappeared.
During the week in Helsinki, the giant business event Nordic Business Forum was also held, drawing the cream of Finnish business to the Exhibition Centre.
In addition to star Barack Obama, 12 stars of the business world took to the stage.
There was talk of good leadership.
Gary Hamel, a legend of leadership studies, said a good executive must dare to take the company to the future even when the company is doing well.
The problem is that decisions are made by those who are mentally most connected to the decisions of the past.
John Mackey, founder of Whole Foods, a store chain known for its extensive range of creations, said the director must know how to communicate to all staff the company's purpose.
And that purpose can't be just making a profit for owners.
Susan Cain, who wrote about introverts of a successful book of successes, said that the most successful leaders are researchedly humble.
They act calmly, quietly and purposefully.
They are often introverts.
Aswath Damodaran, professor of finance, pointed out that the qualities of a good leader must coincide with the business life cycle phase.
In the early stages of the company, the manager must know how to tell the story on which the company’s future is based.
A company that grew into a mature phase needs a manager who knows the numbers.
These lessons at the Nordic Business Forum were listened to by 7,500 visitors - mainly Finnish managers.
They were at risk of information.
A lot is required of a good leader.
That's why management goes so often wrong, even at the highest level.
Siilasmaa and Ollila were also present.
They talked to each other behind the scenes comrately.
But I don't think they were the right executives for Nokia at the right time.
And it wasn't easy to judge their humility to an outsider.
Sara Chafak arrived on a stunning red carpet straight from Los Angeles to spend most of her year abroad
Model Sara Chafak arrived at the pageant final in a stunning black dress.
The 2012 Miss Finland's spectacular dress also featured a lacy shuffle.
A bit of a poden jet lag.
I came back from Los Angeles.
I spend most of my time there, Chafak says.
Chafak says he's going to L.A. for auditions.
He has made advertising shoots, among other things.
He describes his work in the United States as interesting, and also similar to those in Finland.
He says you have to work harder, because you can easily find a replacement for modeling jobs.
You have to push harder and be aggressive," Chafak says.

Danish police find Volvo wanted in major operation: 'We can't tell you what'
Extensive searches by Danish police have paid off.
At the beginning of the operation, traffic was closed on the Friendship and Great Belt Bridges.
All land and ferry services from the island of Själlan were closed to Sweden, Germany and the rest of Denmark.
Police were looking for a black Volvo V90 registered in Sweden.
IS reached the head of the Copenhagen police media centre.
The truck was searched.
We can't yet tell us where we found the car," Henrik Storm, a Copenhagen police briefing, tells the Evening News.
Storm said the wanted black Volvo has no direct link to the threat, according to police.
He says the greatest danger is over.
Ekstra Bladet, from Denmark, told police about Saturday's news conference.
Jherrgen Bergen Skov, head of the investigation, was the course of an operation of the silent women.
He did not want to say what criminal offence to investigate.
But Skov told me it was a "serious crime."
It was a threat to people's lives.
Three people have been sought in the operation.
Police would not say if they have been arrested.
The newspaper said restrictions on ferry services have been revoked.
Copenhagen police also watched the events on their Twitter account.
STT reports that, however, the public at large audiences no longer have cause for concern, as the threat was directed at certain people.
Macedonia's name has caused decades of discord - now the people vote on the issue in a contentious election
Macedonia, the Balkans is currently voting for a proposal for a new name for the country.
Under a treaty between the governments of Macedonia and Greece, the name would be called the Republic of North Macedonia.
Greece has so far vetoed Macedonia's efforts to become a member of NATO and the EU.
Greece says the name Macedonia belongs to its northern province.
The question of the referendum does not mention a new name, but asks whether the voter supports Macedonia's EU and NATO membership by approving the agreement.
Voting began sluggly, at least at a school in central Skopje, the capital.
Olivera Argirosvka, a retired nurse who voted at the school, hoped for support for the deal.
A referendum will mean change if it opens the doors to Europe and NATO.
It means a change, especially for young people, he said.
Macedonia, which became independent in 1991, has been used in official contexts as the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
The government of Prime Minister Zoran Zaev has campaigned to approve the deal.
A nationalist right-wing opposition, including President Gjorge Ivanov, has called for a boycott of a referendum.
In addition to the result, there is plenty to be excited about whether voter turnout will rise above the required 50 per cent.
The referendum is not binding, but a win of yes votes would allow a mandate to change the constitution.
A constitutional change requires a two-thirds majority of parliament.
The Greek parliament still has to approve the deal.
The polling stations close at 8 p.m. Finnish time.
A handsome victory!
Robert Helenius knocks out Erka Teper
Robert Helenius faced Erkan Teper in a heavyweight professional boxing match in Germany late Saturday night.
The 34-year-old Finn took on a 36-year-old German opponent at Waldenbuch, near Stuttgart.
Tonight's main fight was an IBF heavyweight Intercontinental title match.
Its winner may open up the opportunity to fight in tougher tasks that we saw on Saturday, of considerable economic importance.
Helenius tied the match in the eighth round, when he knocked out Teper with his hard left hand.
Teper could no longer get out of the floor.
"Nordic Nightmare" hurt his opponent in the third round, causing blood from the German's nose to start bleeding.
Helenius and Teper met in the ring for the first time.
They were supposed to fight back in December 2015.
That's when Teper appealed to injury and pulled out of the match.
It then emerged that the German had been fuming twice in a doping test.
Helenius has taken 28 fights from his professional career fights and suffered two losses.
Teper, who went into the match as clear favourite, has won 19 professional fights in his career and lost three times.

Canada fights time to reach agreement on Nafta with U.S.
Time threatens to end in negotiations between the United States and Canada on a free trade agreement on Nafta.
The United States has set a deadline for Sunday, with countries negotiators talking closely through the weekend.
Canada's chief negotiator, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, postponed his speech at the UN General Assembly to focus on trade negotiations to the full.
At President Donald Trump's insistence, the United States, Canada and Mexico began talks about a year ago to reform the Nafta North American Free Trade Agreement.
At the end of August, Mexico and the United States reached an agreement with each other, but no agreement has yet been reached with Canada.
The United States and Mexico want to bring the deal into place before Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who won Mexico's presidential election, takes office in early December.
Trump has said Canada's involvement in the agreement is not necessary.
He has previously informed Congress that plans to sign a deal at the end of November - whether Canada was involved or not.
Given those timetables, the text of the agreement between the United States and Canada would have to be ready on Sunday to allow sufficient time for the US Congress to assess it.

Tablestone fuss on its butterfly succession in SE cup, Laukkanen also swims to final
Jenna Laukkanen and Riku Tablekivi have advanced to the finals on the finals of the World Cup 3/7 competitions in Holland.
Races are swam in Eindhoven on a short track.

Students play a rare treat: ancient tragedy - reduced Oresteia affects its visuals
Ancient tragedies are a rare treat on Finnish stages.
The National Theatre, for example, last saw the ancient tragedy of Sophokleen Filoktetes, in 1988.
Now the Theatre Academy brought the only complete drama trilogy of antiquity to the National Theatre, Aesthemia of Aesthemia, to the tour of the National Theatre.
In the Lavat Open! projects that started in 2015, the acting students of the Theatre Academy work together with a professional director internationally.
This fourth project, like the first, is directed by Mikko Roiha, who lives in Berlin.
Oresteia premiered in Berlin in April.
Roiha’s adaptation of Oresteius sums up the story of the end of the blood command of the convicted Atreus family and the creation of the rule of law to an hour to twenty minutes, especially by summarising choral sections.
The work manages to be very faithful to the spirit of Kirsti Simon's great Finnish translation (2003).
The revealing presentation of dramatic lights and theatre space pages highlights simple and bright stage thinking.
It focuses on the dynamics between performers, who break away from the choir, play title roles, and the choir.
The performance uses double and triple-singer interpretations of name roles.
Actors don't leave the stage at all, so the murders of Agamemnon, returning from the Troy War, and this spoils of cassava Kassandra, are also shown on stage, unlike ancient performance tradition.
Of course, the show doesn't stress that it is loyal to the ancient performance tradition.
Rather, a modern interpretation of the text is created in front of the viewer’s eyes, constantly aware of its ritualistic roots.
Roiha has managed to get a rhythmic crowd of master's degree acting students to emerge as a close group, downright as one organism.
Especially in choir sections, actors who bow down to very expressive, scaly sculpting group formations get their rights on bare, only adorned with a white curtain, on stage.
Impressive.
Oresteia’s performance tour continues to Kouvola and Oulu Theatre.
Korean manufacturer manufactures first hydrogen fourger
The novelty is starting to show in Europe, especially thanks to a cooperation agreement with Hyindai and Swiss H2 Energy.
According to a cooperation agreement published at Hanover's IAA commercial vehicle exhibition, Hyundai will supply a batch of 1,000 cars to a Swiss company and its partners.
By launching a fuel cell truck Hyundai continues to sign the Nexon and ix35/Tucson Fuel Cell models on the road as a manufacturer of hydrogen cars.
With this first project in the world, we are taking fuel cell technology further and further.
We are also constantly looking for opportunities to expand the market for these vehicles by, for example, monitoring the development of the refuelling network," In Cheol Lee, vice president of Hyundai Motor, said at the announcement of the agreement.
Fists slashed several times in Kajaani
A man in his late 30s assaulted three men in a restaurant in the centre of Kajaani and in front of it in the early hours of Saturday.
The man first struck one man inside the restaurant, resulting in his removal from the scene.
Outside, he pushed another man to the ground, and in the absence of a third man, the abuser still punched him.
Police arrested the abuser.
At a police station, the man continued to act aggressively and kicked another officer in the foot.
The man also threatened to assault and kill the police.
The man was taken to jail to calm down.
The matter is being investigated as three assaults as well as violent opposition to an official.
In the centre of Kajaani, another assault incident occurred on Välikatu in early morning on Saturday.
The victim was assaulted by two men.
First, a Kajaani man, about 20 years old, punched the victim.
A short time later, another man knocked him to the ground and the man who previously hit him still kicked the victim.
Outsiders pulled the abusers further away from the victim and police were called.
But the perpetrators were already able to leave before the police arrived.
The police ask anyone to contact the Kajaani police by phone 0295 416 520 or by e-mail to tutkimus.kainuuhope.fi.
Long-time radio host Erkki Pälli has died
Erkki Pälli, known as a longtime journalist at Yle, passed away from cancer at the age of 83.
Radio host Erkki Pälli, 83, has died.
He died of incurable liver cancer, which was reported on his Facebook page in March 2018.
Yes, this is going.
The doctor also said that, I live one day at a time, he commented to Iltalehti a month ago.
The safety of shop aunts and seutum must be guaranteed
I first got paid for a newspaper story in 1984.
When these year rings make you a surprise, it's usually big news.
When I wrote (Karjalainen, 27.9.) about the insecurity of retailers, I was amazed and at times even a little angry.
I also spoke to Erika Kähärä, a working environment expert at the Finnish Service Industries Trade Union (PAM).
He says crime statistics don't tell us the real situation.
The problem is growing, although employers claim otherwise.
Only cases that are clearly considered to be serious to the police and many real violent situations remain unreported.
"Of course, companies have an obligation to statistics their near-missing situation on the basis of the Occupational Safety and Health Act, but these statistics remain in internal use and their data are not collected anywhere," he said.
Mental injuries do not end with statistics.
In violent situations, the problem has always been that they do not always cause physical injuries.
Psychic traumas can be much more serious than bruising and wounds.
The difference between a violent situation and a threatening violence situation is hard to draw, when even a certain level of aggressive threats must be counted as violence - even if there is no way to tackle.
Too many people are afraid at work, even if there is no actual act.
Some neighborhoods are restless.
The store has acquired security guards.
Even when the opening hours of stores were released, there was a fairly high media coverage of its impact on the safety of sellers.
"At the time, quite a few employers arranged security guard services for at least night-time hours and to prevent working alone," Kähärä comments.
When nothing happens, you draw the wrong conclusion.
This now seems to have had an effective effect, but this is a new negative trend.
When disturbances were well under control due to security, there was an image that security would be unnecessary.
Now, in many places, we are trying to find solutions to remove expensive security services.
Mild assault is a criminal offence of a plaintiff, and it is quite understandable that a battered vendor does not want to make an investigation request for an investigation of a criminal who usually lives near a store.
But under the same, clause of the 2011 law, a minor assault will be subject to prosecution if it occurs at work.
I think we need precedents now.
The next time you assault a shop aunt or uncle, the police should investigate and the prosecution to charge.
When a court put a few abusers in prison, and a conviction for a severe chance of a penalty scale, the habits would be tidyed up.
A society in which grocery stores must be open in small towns almost day and night must guarantee the safety of retail workers.
Heidi Sohlberg signed off on a miss before the live broadcast began - "Sara, Iiro is married"
Miss's crowning will not be seen in the traditional way on TV this year, the broadcast will be shown by the Viafree website.
The broadcast is hosted by former Miss Finland Heidi Sohlberg and Viasat and Viaplay's NHL and KHL studios Iiro Harjula.
Backstage and red carpet host is Janni Hussi.
Before the live broadcast, the host trio told invited guests and media representatives who arrived at the scene about the passage of the broadcast.
At first, Sohlberg asked the audience to give Harjula a resounding ovation.
Now all women scream!
Now look at this man host, Sohlberg enthused as his colleague's audience cheered.
The front-runners are followed by many Miss Finland of previous years.
Sara Chafak and Sara Sieppi, among others, sat side by side and Sohlberg threw a little joke in either direction.
Sara, Iiro is married!
Sohlberg was looking towards Saros.
What I think Sohlberg was referring to the very split Sieppi, who laughed at the comment, even though he looked confused at first.
Sieppi spoke of her resignation for the first time in a weekend newspaper of the Evening News.
Missikaunotar said that she does not want to open up the reasons for the breakup in public, as that is between her and Roope Salminen.
He said he's not in a hurry to get into a new relationship, he's going to focus on himself.
I focus on my own things, and especially I start living my own life alone, Sara Sieppi said.
Harjula’s marriage status was even later on when Sohlberg mistaken to call Janni Huss and Iiro Harjula a couple.
The connouncing trio laughed at a screw-up.
I was married to me, right?
Janni Hussi signed off on a screw-up.
A Pohja man tortured his tied-up cohabiting partner by slashing, burning and feeding strong sauce
The District Court of Ostrobothnia has sentenced a 34-year-old man living in Kokkola to three years in prison for a crime against his numerous common-law spouses.
The crime-making tool included belts, cables and zip ties.
The court sentenced those items to the State forfeiture.
Rank's charge was about a suspected aggravated rape.
However, this charge was dismissed by the district court.
The Kokkola resident was charged with four assaults, aggravated assault, coercion, unlawful threats of liberty, aggravated deprivation of liberty, and two counts of damage.
The offences took place between 26 March and May 24.
At the end of the last acts, the man was taken into custody and imprisoned a couple of days later.
On Thursday of the past week, the District Court of Ostrobothnia issued its verdict and ordered the 34-year-old to be held in Vaasa prison.
No evidence of rape
The 34-year-old was also charged with two counts of gross deprivation of liberty and aggravated rape of May 22.
These charges, however, were disproved unpretentious by the court.
The case was heard in court behind closed doors.
But the district judge issued a public record of the verdict.
According to the district judge, the accused had directed violence, threats and coercion to his spouse in situations where he had been tied up.
The defendant cut his victim with a knife, smoked smoking with a cigarette, fed strong sauce and poured water and coffee on top of him.
By its conviction, the court ordered the state to have criminal equipment confiscated by: a belt and cable, zip ties, a bathrobe belt, a knife and a vesurin.
Four Witnesses
According to the district court, the parties continued to live together between actions.
There is a statement of judgment that a large proportion of the most egregious acts occurred at the end of the crime period.
Four witnesses, two women and two men were heard in court.
The 34-year-old must pay compensation for pain, suffering, suffering and temporary harm totalling EUR 5800.
I don't think he has that money, as the sentenced person already has a debt to collect his old ones.
The prison sentence is not the man's first.
The newspaper does not give the name of the convict to protect the victim's privacy.
A recent district judgment is not final when writing this.
Europe with four-point lead to Ryder Cup settlement
European golf professionals on Saturday solidified their lead in a traditional hole-playing match against the United States.
Europe leads the Ryder Cup, which is played on the outskirts of Paris, with twelve still twelve singles to play on Sunday ahead of us.
Europe won three of four four-ball games that started Saturday, and in the afternoon doubles, wins were tied at 2-2.
Europe's lead stars were Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who won all four matches he played on Friday and Saturday.
In the past, no European couple had achieved anything like it.
On Sunday, the two are seeking more history.
No European player has won five points in one of the Ryder Cups, and only three players have been able to get from Americans: Arnold Palmer and Gardiner Dickinson (1969) and Larry Nelson (1979).
HJK condemns fierce harassment of supporters at Honka match: 'Viality is not part of football'
HJK, a football betting league team, issued a statement on Sunday condemning the disorderly behaviour of its supporters during Saturday's FC Honka match in Tapiola.
"We are sorry for the events after the Honka-HJK match on behalf of our supporters," the statement said.

Filipino pilot flies with a drone truck to avoid traffic congestion
Mendiola is a Filipino inventor, hip-hop dancer and something like Pelle Peloton.
He is now part of a growing crowd around the world swearing he's invented a flying car - or at least his own version of it.
As competitors, for example, he has factors such as Audi and Airbus.
Mendiola, however, does not believe in mass production of its device.
According to reports from around the world, the man has spent much of his fortune building his dream.
Six years ago, he started developing his flying car.
Now he calls the development version a drone truck.
Recently, he says he did the first successful test flight - he slid on his device at an altitude of more than seven metres.
One of his goals was to avoid traffic jams.
I hope the device provokes positive reactions.
This was just a dream five years ago," Mendiola said, according to the British Daily Mail.
JHL anticipates: Industrial action starting tomorrow will be visible in child day care and social and health services
In public and welfare sectors, the prohibitions on overtime and shift changes starting tomorrow will be particularly visible in social and health services and child day care, estimates Päivi Niemi-Laine, President of JHL.
The impact will be extensive, and they will certainly show up in such a way that there are not enough staff present.
Everyone has to think about how to pick up their children.
The employer’s job now is to ensure that services are playing and that no one’s life is threatened,” Niemi-Laine tells STT.
According to Niemi-Laine, the lack of employees was also visible at the beginning of the year, when JHL members were banned from overtime and shift changes due to contract negotiations.
Employers have made it possible, through flexibility, to not have hired staff, but that employees have been left overdue or changed shifts.
This is not an industrial action yet.
In terms of occupational safety, it is quite the norm that for each employee we take care of regular working hours and only do them.
With measures, JHL opposes the government's intention to ease redundancy protection for small businesses.
Markku Jalonen, labour market director of municipal employers, will not anticipate the effects of overtime and shift changes bans.
But he doesn't think they are very revolutionary, although services can be undermined.
Employers all over Finland are aware of this and made the preparations that can be made.
The area is such an impossibly large, social and health care sector and a technical sector that it is difficult to say.
The impacts can vary very much by industry, region and employer, Jalonen told STT.
Jalonen says that last week we already had experiences with similar actions of the Association of Local and Basic Nurses Super and Social Care Professionals (FIe) and Tehy, a trade association for social services and health care.
Their effects were minimal.
JHL’s prohibition of overtime and shift changes applies to employees of municipalities, the church, the state and private social and health care sector, among others.
Family day care providers, for example, are excluded.
The industrial action concerns nearly 100,000 JHL members at this stage.
According to Niemi-Laine, JHL’s actions may last a long time.
The union will also be prepared for other industrial action if preparations for the redundancy law continue.
The government should now admit that this is where you run to a wall and hard.
Jalonen believes that both the union movement and the government must come to the fight.
It is extraordinary that the tough ones are already in the pipe, even though the performance has not yet been given, Jalonen updates.
The great Coral Reef is created by children and adults - the performance's fitness circles study the gestures of raus and seahorse
The Great Coal Coral Reef of the second premises collective premiered last spring in Hamburg, and last Saturday it aired for a second time in Finland, this time in Kanneltalo.
Like the group’s previous works, the Great Coaling Reef is a work that is built from start to finish together with the public.
This time, however, a clearer-defined presentation will also be built, which refreshes and encapsulates observations made in initial exercises.
There is plenty of fairytale magic in theatre play for child participants.
The child’s perspective has been included in the preparation phase of the work.
Still, the Great Coral Reef is not a children's performance, it's a performance that adults and children do in cooperation.
It gives adults information and observations about children's way of receiving information and making art.
Children's ability to throw themselves into exercises and joint play also dissolves distance between adults and children.
Indeed, the Great Coral Reef resembles some fairytale ballet, fitness circuit and nature-themed faction, but it is finally tuned in in different, non-human spaces around visits.
The great Coral Reef begins with a study of the movement of corals and organisms and fish living on coral reef.
In six different fitness circuits, the gestures of raus and sea horses, among other things, are taught.
Finally, a performance of less than an hour will be made in which music, lights and shiny paints and costumes help you get to know the life of a coral reef.
In the large Coral Reef, we are both diving people watching the life of coral reef and corals that are being looked at.
There are also organisms looking at corals.
The eyes and observations pointed to many points make the presentation dense and life-fested.
Whether to be the landscape of an organism, an organism looking at the landscape, and another organism or landscape looking at the organism - and all this at the same time.
For children, it doesn't seem to be difficult.
In other spaces, the group strives to reach the boundary of thinking and action, to which catching up when the group consists of both children and adults is challenging.
On the other hand, the involvement of children makes it more significant.
After the workshop, a silent demonstration will be held in Sitratori for endangered corals.
The devastation beyond human understanding must not be allowed to harden, even though it could be difficult to grasp the significance of one's own exercise of compassion in the face of destruction.
In other spaces, it has built its works in such a way that it respects the diversity of life by a political gesture.
There are other generations, there are different kinds of consciousnesses, other species and their future generations, for which it clears room for wonder and play.
Kids grow up too fast - I'm happy I didn't have smartphones in my childhood
Today’s children and young people are more irresponsible.
Young people start smoking and drinking all the time when they are younger and younger.
I think children should be children throughout their childhood, and not messing with their lives because of substance abuse and sex, because others say they are doing so.
I was overwhelmed when my friend told me he had to pick up his fifth-grade sister at the weekend of a "boyfriend."
When she came to get her drunken sister, she told me about her sexual experiences from that night.
I couldn't possibly imagine my own sister in the same situation because we've been told and warned throughout our childhood that intoxicants should not be touched and sex is an adult thing.
I wish modern children could live a decent childhood, and they wouldn't have to grow up too early because of the group pressure created by their friends.
I'm constantly seeing younger girls on Instagram who are wearing makeup on their faces and reveal their clothes on.
Snapchat is used to take and send revealing photos at night.
It's harder to guess what age they're about.
Today's 13-year-olds can easily look like 18-year-olds and parents.
My childhood consisted of playing in the woods and playing board games.
I'm glad I didn't have smart phones in my childhood.
I got to be a kid for many years, and I didn't have to think about what others think of me.
Yle: Officials told the state leadership that the incident Airiston Helmi is not related to national security
According to Ilkka Kanerva, an interviewed by Yle, the Finnish Civil Protection Police and Defence Forces informed the Defence and Foreign Affairs Committees earlier this week.
The Finnish Government has been told that Airisto’s Helmi investigation is not currently related to national security, but to organised crime, Yle reports.
The information of sources of anonymity was confirmed to Yle by Ilkka Kanerva, Chairman of the Defence Committee.
Kanerva said the armed forces and protection police visited defence and foreign affairs committees this week to report on an ongoing investigation.
This is primarily considered to be economic crime.
They were quite strict about not speculating that there would be anything else, Kanerva commented in an interview with Yle.
According to Yle, there has been no evidence of a link to national security of the seized material so far, but the investigation is only at its inception.
We cannot yet know what can be revealed there, one of Yle’s interviewees says.
Extensive house searches that began a week ago in the Turku archipelago and on the mainland have raised the question of whether the investigation is a mere economic crime or a threat to Finland’s internal security.
Earlier this week, I put together a story reviewing claims against both for and against.
Video: dream goal saved Liverpool defeated series
Liverpool's 100 per cent Premier League start came to an end, but it was still a more satisfied team to a 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge.
Sunday marks exactly one year since Manchester City arrived at Stamford Bridge and ran away to win a 1-0 away win.
That's when Pep Guardiola's combination sent a signal to the entire Premier League that City were serious now.
Everyone remembers how last season ended.
And certainly Liverpool manager JHrgen Klopp arrived with the same idea to West London.
The Reds had started the Premier League with six consecutive wins.
Liverpool got off to a stronger start and Virgil van Dijk, in particular, seemed to control alone after their own field end.
Chelsea, meanwhile, had a fine League Cup away win from Anfield Road ahead of Wednesday.
That's when Eden Hazard got up from the bench to settle the match with a great individual performance.
Now, of course, Hazard was involved from the very beginning minutes.
In the 25th minute, he first balled in a small state with three-legged Mateo Kovacic and Jorginho.
Eventually, the Croat saw Hazard plunge forward and sent him a perfectly weighted through-rolled pass.
Hazard drifted a bit to the edge of the penalty area but bombarded a perfectly left-foot pull from there to a rear bottom corner.
Pool brass keeper Alisson was a bit slow in interception and couldn't get his fingertip to the ball.
I'm sure Klopp felt a lightly unfair losing position because almost immediately afterwards Antonio Rchodiger cleaned Mo Salah's control from the finish line.
In the second period, Chelsea forward Kepa also got into action.
The basswer reacts quickly to Sadio Man's pull and pushed the ball from the base of the post to a corner kick.
At the other end, on the other hand, Alisson zeroed in on his throwing Hazard drive through.
The guests' best spot came in the 72nd minute when James Milner found Bobby Firmino with his concentration.
But the Brass star's bulldoze headed toward national team-mate David Luitz, who saved the hosts' lead.
That, too, didn't last any more in the 89th minute when substitute Daniel Sturridge was free to shoot from 25 metres.
Sturridge played in his old home stadium, and the striker bombed an irresistible pull to the top corner in honor of it.
Liverpool's 100 per cent league start came to an end with a 1-1 draw, but it remains at the top of the league - along with Manchester City.
Chelsea are also firmly involved in the championship fight with two points behind the top.
In the clock transfer conversation, foxholes are deep
I remember a few decades ago a magazine asking various Finnish influencers what divides the Finnish people.
The only response to Juice Widow was remembered: Nen suffix.
Some have a nen ending in their surnames and some have no.
There could be divisions wherever you are, and here was one of the grotesque.
In the EU, Finland has achieved the abandonment of annual clockshifting.
A great many people agree that clock-shifting twice a year has been a fool's job and caused a variety of problems.
In the end, this achievement seems to be the easiest part of the solution in Finland, even though it has not been easy.
The hardest part now is to decide which time to end up with: the current summer or wintertime or some other time zone.
This is also where the people can express their opinions on the otakantaa.fi page.
The survey has been opened by the Ministry of Transport and Communications, and is open until Friday, October 12.
The debate is going on fiercely at coffee tables and social media, and everyone has to say what they say.
Those who defend winter time justify their position with the influence of morning light on people’s well-being, and summertime defends the influence of evening light on people’s desire to outdoor activities and, by extension, to well-being.
Both have solid supporters and good arguments.
Research shows that morning light rhythms a person's day and gives you a refreshment.
On the other hand, if you don’t particularly suffer from awakening in the dark, the light increases people’s exercises outdoors and give better opportunities for autumnal yard work, for example.
The amount of additional light after the normal working day has already been calculated for its class.
I'd rather take both of them, but bad enough to be there nothing we can do about the north of the globe.
Winters are too dark and summers too bright for many anyway.
It is typical of a discussion on the subject that one’s own vision is pursued and that the view of another is strongly opposed.
The arguments of the other side are hardly listened to, because the most important thing is how you feel about yourself.
Since almost everyone has an opinion on it, it is somewhat pointless to try to turn the other's head.
That's where the gunpowder goes to waste.
The subject is terribly easy to debate, because it does not require much dedication and there is enough mutu feeling to justify.
Similar issues are usually disputed most sharply and equally fruitlessly anyway.
I'm sorry if the wrong option gets elected, but I think you'll adjust to it, too.
And it always offers a suitable scapegoat if life feels like a pepea.
Josba fought a narrow-ended away win
Josba's first away game in a floorball dump in Divar produced a full three series points against Nurmon Jymy.
Josba went home from Seinäjoki to a jubilant 6-5 (3-1, 0-3, 3-1) win with him.
Nurmo still led with a goal at the start of the third period, but Josba sought compositions and recycled men in chains.
In 50.47 brothers Eetu and Juuso Lehtiniemi plotted a 6-5 winning goal.
When both teams missed, decisive minutes were played with a flat shed.
Josba’s most effective was Juuso Lehtiniemi (2+1).
The second chain was firepower anyway, when Teemu Tuhkanen (1+1), Jere Kaartinen (1+0) and Jere Kettunen (1+0) also hit.
Miika Kosonen (1+0) also played second-string at the time of his goal.
Josballa is six points after three rounds of series.
The next meeting is O2 Juväskylä in two weeks.
In Eno Church on Sunday 200th anniversary
Eno’s 200th anniversary celebrations of the Church will be celebrated tomorrow, partly in a sad atmosphere.
The arson of the arson of the Hurtsvaara church a week ago was a shock.
Eno's church was also guarded for the two nights after the fire.
Despite the pain, today is a place of celebration.
Even if no one wants to do that, Eno’s church is now the oldest church in Joensuu Parish Union.
A church on a hill in the middle of a village has always been the heart of Eno, despite all the world's municipal and other annexations.
The family fair begins at Eno Church at 10 a.m. today.
Then we move to a parish hall over a Karelian stall.
Throughout the day, there are all sorts of things inside and out of the program.
For example, you can explore church building with the guidance of Ari Räsänen, who has retired as parish master for 37 years.
The birth of the church also marks the end of an era.
The already decommissioned parish house, built in 1982, will keep its doors open for the last time today.
We are now in evasive spaces at a former municipal hall, says Chappa-based Markku Koistinen.
The parish house was destroyed by indoor air problems, but the church has been standing in a healthy place for that 200 years.
Elon Musk steps down Tesla board president - Betrayal charges set at quid for quid
Electric car manufacturer Tesla and the company's chief executive, Elon Musk, have settled their lawsuits with the SEC, the US Securities Markets Authority.
The SEC suspected Musk of arguing, and Musk was at risk of being sidelined by the company he founded.
But Musk will continue to be Tesla's CEO.
Instead, Musk will have to step down as Tesla board chairman for three years.
The company will have to hire an external board chairman.
Musk will also face tighter supervision.
Under the agreement, Tesla will have to hire two independent executives and monitor more closely Musk's communications in the future.
In addition, Tesla and Musk will pay each buckling quip (about 17 million euros) to settle the incident.
"The decision is to prevent further market disruptions and harm to Tesla shareholders," said Steven Peikin, director of the SEC.
The incident began in August when Musk wrote on Twitter that he might withdraw the company from the stock exchange.
Musk also wrote that the company's funding has been secured.
The tweet momentarily raised Tesla's share price.
The SEC suspected Musk of a fraud.
The agency said the tweet was false and misleading, and Musk had not spoken to the arrangement with other management or potential financiers of the company.
In practice, the agency accused Musk of misleading investors.
The SEC announced Friday that it would sue the company and Musk.
The SEC said it would demand that Musk be fined and banned from running listed companies again.
Investors were spooked by the SEC's challenge, and Tesla's stock went into a sharp decline.
Indonesia quake and tsunami kill more than 800 people
The death toll in Indonesia's earthquake and subsequent tsunami has risen to at least 832, according to the country's disaster agency, according to the AFP news agency.
The death toll is expected to increase further, as the investigation into the devastation is ongoing.
Vice President Jusuf Kla said the final figure could reach thousands.
Friday's earthquake sparked a tsunami that ejected the town of Palu on the island of Sulawesi.
A warning was issued immediately after the quasi-quake, which was quickly cancelled.
Officials say almost all known dead are, at least for now, Palusta.
Rescue officials are concerned, among other things, about the Donggala area near the quake's downtown, where the situation is still largely unclear.
Many people are already known to have died.
Ruins requests for help
Indonesian military has been alerted to rescue workers to help seek victims.
President Joko Widodon, who arrived in the devastation area today, urged soldiers to resume rescue operations, day out and night.
One of the centers of the rescue work is a hotel in Palu, which is believed to still have between 50 and 60 people in the rubble.
Muhammad Syaugi, head of the agency leading the rescue efforts, said one person was excavated alive in the rubble of the Roa-Roa Hotel, which is popular with business travellers, at night.
We also heard people's calls for help, he told me.
According to Syarage, heavy clearance equipment would be quickly needed for the quake and tsunami area.
Many Indonesians have turned to Facebook and other social media to find their missing loved ones.
Help me, you in Palu and nearby.
A friend of my family members still missing, one writer pleaded on a Facebook group.
Politicians phone numbers leaked to troublemakers in UK
Many British politicians were harassed when their contact information was leaked because of deficiencies in the encryption of the app.
The troubles also had access to the ministers' phone numbers.
It was an application used at a British Conservative Party convention in government.
Michael Gove, Minister of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, who are pushing for Brexit, for example, were subjected to harassment.
Several MPs received harassment calls.
Because of the application encryption deficiency, audiences were able to access the profiles of politicians in the app, which were on the Conservative Party's annual mobile app.
The audience accessed profiles using a politician's email address, which was easily accessible online.
You could view and edit material stored in your profile.
Someone managed to change Boris Johnson to a profile picture for a porn photo and a title insulting.
Michael Goven's profile picture was changed to a picture of media mogul Rupert Murdoch.
Dawn Foster, a columnist for The Guardian, described the problem by writing that the meeting app allows logging into other people's profiles with their email addresses.
Then the login can view the profile person's contact information and, say, send messages in their name.
The meeting app made the phone number of every journalist, politician and participant public, Foster criticized.
A Conservative Party spokesman apologized for the leak of information.
He said technical problems have been resolved and the application is now operating safely.
The UK's information authority ICO backed a leak of information.
The application was created by Crown Comms of Australia.
Labour in the opposition criticizes the Conservative Party that the Conservative Party cannot be trusted in security matters.
A large number of claptling Poles are in the audience of The Wall Suomi every week
Watchful eye-catching viewers paid attention to the reactions of the studio audience on The Wall Suomi quiz.
The Wall, a rapidly spreading US format around the world, landed in a Finland version for Four last Saturday.
Hosted by Heikki Paasonen, the game show is filmed in Poland in the same studio in which other international productions of the format are made.
In the Polish studio, the shooting possibilities were exceptional, as the format's big 12-metre-high game wall required space from space.
During the start, a studio audience of the show, which was called Polish, was highlighted on social media.
There was a debate on Twitter about whether the Poles in the studio may understand anything about a game to play in Finnish.
Unne Sormunen, Head of Domestic Programmes at Four, explains the matter to Iltalehti.
He says that the studio audience includes close visitors to the players, other Finns living in Poland, and just Polish spectators.
The audience consists of international clasps in Finnish production, just like the audiences of The Wall episodes filmed in the same production space in other countries.
In Finland, too, there are such groups, so-called professional audiences, who go to the description of different programmes, Sormunen explains.
He reminds us that following the game itself is not so difficult to understand, even if you don't understand the language used to play it.
Red and green balls falling from the wall are easy to distinguish between.
For guest speakers, however, interpreters are present at the studio to handle translation work.
There are two interpreters there who, as a simultaneous interpretation of a studio director, events all the time.
And the studio director then instructs the audience and tells us what kind of flap is thrown there, for example, and what the situation is going on, Sormunen says.
He compares the situation to how David Hasselshoff was in domestic production the other day.
David Hasselhoff was involved in the filming of Talent Finland in Finland a few years ago.
He was constantly in his ear to simultane interpretation and knew everything that was spoken in Finnish on set, Sormunen sums up.
Typhoon, which has been battering Japan's south, moving toward main islands - authorities warn of landslides and flooding
Officials also warn of possible landslides and flooding.
At least 50 people have been injured in Typhoon Tram, but officials say major injuries have been avoided and so far there were no reports of casualties.
On the southern Okinawa island, the wind has been so strong that it has turned cars around.
The NHK public broadcaster said people have been evacuated to shelters, with more than 300,000 households cut power.
More than 1,000 flights have been cancelled, and bullet trains are at a standstill in some places because of the storm.
The storm is expected to hit near Osaka around noon Finnish time.
The capital of Tokyo is not directly on the storm's route, but there are also heavy winds and rains in store.
Train services have been cancelled today in Tokyo.
Underlying scientists say Trami torment Japan until Monday.
Aces' sky darker
The early season of aces has been bad.
The sky darkened almost into pitch black when the team lost 3-6 (0-2, 0-3, 3-1) on Saturday to Vaasan Sport.
The Pori residents now have five consecutive losses, and there are two points from six rounds in total.
No Aces defender or two lower chain players have scored yet.
Pressure is also increasing.
Against Sport, the crowd was eliminated from the hall already at the point when nearly half of the game remained.
Six games are just played, and of course there's no reason to give up.
Of course, you have to worry, because that's how weak we played.
The second set performance was particularly shameful, Jarno Kärki, who scored 1+2, for Äss.
Sport naturally tasted like to win.
The team had a game from Friday underneath, so it would have thought it would have been made to show.
Maybe it was a sign, but the Aces couldn't take advantage of it.
Bread Day visitor numbers continued to increase
Pirkko Hyvärinen, the mother of bread day, wonders about the number of people in the big hall.
Somehow, I thought that maybe not so many people would come this year, Hyvärinen thinks in the morning.
In autumn 2017, the Finnish Tractor Seyday Championships were held together with the Bread Day, so perhaps there would be expectations that the audience could even decrease slightly from the previous year.
However, it turned out otherwise; the corridors were already blocked briskly before 10 a.m., sellers reported to have stopped the products, nearly 500 more news porridges were sold than before, and Hyvärinen heard that the number of cars was rising.
The estimated number of visitors has been about 6,000, Hyvärinen says later in the afternoon.
In five hours of morning and afternoon, there was a particularly high number of programs for families with children, which I think attracted them to a record number of places.
In addition, Hyvärinen estimates that the event will reach more longer.
Sales also curve to Liperi every year from a larger area.
This year, nearly 100 of producers of handicrafts, pastries and harvesting products had arrived at the bread keeper.
The mother of bread day, PIrkko Hyvärinen, admired the audience from the hall's stands.
At the beginning of the bread day, a harvest was blessed.
In the children's category, Teija Kiviniemi's beautiful bread won a public vote.
11 different forms of bread arrived in the children's bread competition.
Marjatta Vepsäläinen, winner of the rye bread competition, spent a day in the marts pie workshop.
7 x The most beautiful lamp - here you will recognize a good lamp
Bring space to life, create the right atmosphere in the interior and read a book without tiring eyes.
Good lighting is worth investing in.
We gathered three good reasons to invest in lighting.
The tips were given by Innolux’s Sales and Marketing Director Tarja Jokiniemi.
Do a favor to your eyes
The more years of age there are.
Adequate light can help with problems that many people experience with age as the accuracy of vision decreases and more people suffer from glare.
The need for light is also growing.
A 60-year-old needs three times as much light as a person in their 20s.
The effects of light and the characteristics of the luminaire should therefore be invested for health reasons.
A good light fixture gives enough light, but does not dazzle, Jokiniemi hints.
Create beauty around you
The beautiful interior can only be displayed with the right lighting solutions.
The decorator of the moment can choose.
The popularity is a japandi style that combines gestures, Scandinavianism and Japaneseness.
On the other hand, the modern and playful retro style inspired by the 70s with its strong colours, metal with different shades or ice cream colours has also risen to the boom.
Authentication fascinates me in the same way as in other interiors of a home.
The materials now show wood, concrete, ceramics, paper, leather and bamboo.
Express your personality
On the other hand, we invest more at home now than before, and interior design has become a way of expressing itself.
Instead of mass production, you want a customized, even a bold, brave light fixture with a story to tell.
People are clearly looking for Finnish and Nordic products whose origins and designers are known.
So let's be very design-conscious, Jokiniemi says.
You don't necessarily get the latest trend lighting fixture at home, it's a timeless classic for which you've been saved for many years.
Certain timeless, jeweled and elegant classics hold their ground year after year, Jokiniemi says.
Thank you and goodbye!
KooKoo showed the door to Canadian striker after three games
The roads of KooKoo and forward Brendan O'Donnell are breaking down.
The Canadian striker played a total of three League games in orange black without power points, KooKoo said in a statement.
O'Donnell moved to KooKoo in August with a one-year contract, which included a probationary period until the end of September.
Last season, the 26-year-old forward played for Kunlund Red Star in the KHL and KHL farm in KRS Heilongjiang.
O'Donnell's new company is not yet known.
A player wants to set an example in recycling - goods go to the world in recycling boxes, plastic switched to paper
Gamer now recycles not only games but also packaging materials.
The products of the brick-and-mortar store customers are no longer packed in plastic bags, but in paper bags made of recycled material.
Products ordered from online stores are packed in packages from importers, for example.
All packages coming to us will be reused.
We may use the boxes a dozen times, as long as the package is in such a condition that it can be used,” says Ville Puurula from Oulu’s Pelimies.
As a cushioning material, the company uses newspapers and other similar recycled materials.
Bubble plastic is avoided as far as possible.
In the near future, we will move to recycled material in envelopes.
The movement wants to set an example to others.
Recycling, according to Puurula, does not cause extra trouble.
It's not a big problem starting to recycle.
There will be financial savings when, for example, cardboard packaging is reused.
Recycling is a natural fit for Pelimies’ operations, as in addition to new products, the movement’s key product range includes, among other things, used games and equipment.
Buying every fashion conscious: One and the same shirt works in every outfit
Classic clothes work from season to season in costume like an outfit.
They create a good foundation for a garderob with their multifunctional nature, as it is easy to assemble different outfits around high-quality classics even at low cost.
In autumn, the most used classics in the wardrobe are high-quality knitwear.
This category also includes a black polo.
A black knit made of natural material with turtleneck knitting cannot be mis-procurement.
You can combine your clothes with straight trousers, tulle skirts and jeans, and you can create both a low-key outfit and a raunchy style around it.
The pool knit is suitable for both a youthful modern dresser and a classically sophisticated style master.
This is how you create a style.
The autumn trend look comes from golden brown and wide-leg corded cordless pants, black polo knit and grey ankle boots.
A classic polo knit along with other classics, a blue-green Scottish plaid skirt and burgundy loaf, form a feminine and refined ensemble.
Bring an edge to a black turtleneck by combining it with casually trendy items of clothing: denim skirt, tall boots and thick tights.
It's young and stylish!
Sabotage of Russian intelligence agencies has a long tradition
There is no reason to believe that the Russian Federation's foreign intelligence SVR or military intelligence GRU has abandoned this course of action.
During Soviet times, so-called DRG groups specialized in sabotage.
The name comes from the Russian words diversionno-razvedyvatelnaya gruppa: a sabotage and intelligence team.
Officials of the KGB of the Soviet security service KGB in Western countries were preparing detailed plans for important sabotage sites, according to Vasili Mithromh, an archive manager who defected to the West by the KGB.
His knowledge was published in Christopher Andrew's books in the late 1990s and early 2000s
The targets included ports, shipyards, large dams, oil refineries and gas pipeline connections.
In Germany, the KGB acquired uniforms and accessories for DRG groups for the Bundeswehr, railways, game guards and road workers for covert operations.
This trick was used by Russian paratroopers in Crimea in February 2014: they wore local Ukrainian police riot gear, established checkpoints from the peninsula to the roads leading to Ukraine, and isolated Crimea from their motherland.
Cold Wartime agents were handing out packages of equipment containing mines, explosives, detonators and signalling equipment to sabotage teams.
As recently as 1998, a KGB stash was found in Switzerland, whose trappings exploded when authorities sprayed it with a water cannon.
Police reach four drunk drivers in the province at night
Police caught four drunk drivers across North Karelia between Friday and Saturday.
In Joensuu, an 18-year-old man from Kontiolahti blew 1.57 per mil.
At 4:30 a.m., he drove two passengers on board at the beginning of Kajaanintie.
On Polvijärvi Kuorevaarantie, a car swerved into a ditch at 4 a.m., and a 19-year-old local man in a car alone blew 1.54 per mil, according to police.
There were no serious injuries to him in the exit.
A 20-year-old out-of-town man driving a passenger car in the centre of Outokumpu blew 1.33 per mille into a breathalyser.
Police suspect the male drivers of the manslaughter of them with aggravated drink driving and the Polvijärvi driver, in addition to endangering traffic safety.
On Saturday morning, a local man carrying a local van at the intersection of swill and Hoikantie in Tuupovaara blew 0.52 per mille.
He is suspected of drink driving.
Police are appealing for sightings of a stabbing at a railway station after midnight.
Police said the man was assaulted in a parking lot outside the station with life-threatening consequences.
The act was captured on CCTV.
The dark hair suspects dressed in dark trousers and brown or beige jackets immediately after stabbing were removed by a dark station of a station in a dark station.
One suspect left on a bicycle in the direction of the centre of Humalistonkatu.
Pedestrian dies after being hit by bus in Pori
In Pori, a pedestrian died early Saturday morning after a bus crashed into him.
The accident happened after 4 a.m. on the Raumantie road at Niitttumaa.
The bus driver is not suspected of a crime.
Police are investigating the events leading to the accident.
HPK will keep Riska in its ranks for the rest of the season, Lehtinen's probationary period ended
Mika Toivola, Sports Director at HPK in Hämeenlinna, says that Filip Riska (centre) has been important to the team in starts, under-strength play and a defensive role in field four.
Filip Riska, who played in early autumn, will continue to join Hämeenlinna HPK for the rest of the season.
The success of experienced Riska, 33, in the roles offered to him convinced the management of the club management.
Filip has been an important piece for us in starts, under-strength play and a defensive role of field four.
Even though there is still room for improvement, it is good for a young team to hold on to such an experienced player, HPK Sports Director Mika Toivola comments in the club’s press release.
According to Toivola, Riska’s value will rise when playing hockey’s league solution games.
Riska, a centre-back from Pietarsaari, has played league hockey in JYP, Lock and Sport in the past.
Oskari Lehtinen, a winger, was left without a contract after a probationary period.
True story on TV today: Climber left to death twice
Beck Weathers, an American author, wrote a book 18 years ago.
Left for Dead: My Journey Home From Everest is based on his own experiences.
Tonight's film was made based on them.
Everest will now premiere on Finnish TV.
In May 1996, a devastating snowstorm caught climbers on Mount Everest.
Baltasar Kormchokur's 2015 guidance is about a struggle for survival, which has been dealt with in a grain of fruit.
Tragedy has been made into films - and documentaries - before.
Real events are also underway in this case.
22 years ago, the world's tallest mountain took the lives of eight climbers.
Two of them were experienced leaders of the expeditions: Scott Fischer and Rob Hall.
Hall was the guide for Weathers.
Weathers' life may have been saved by eye surgery carried out before going to Nepal.
As a result of that and air pressure, he lost sight of his vision, which is why the conquest of the peak had to be missed.
Rob Hall continued on his way and never returned.
But Weathers' struggle for life and death had only just begun.
When the storm got worse, he got lost and couldn't find him back to camp.
When they came to find the man, he was found in such poor health that survival was not believed to be.
Weathers was left to death.
But it was like he still got back on his feet and found the others.
The badly frofolded Weathers was still thought to be dying and once again left to his own devices.
What is clear is that, contrary to different expectations, Beck Weathers survived.
At some point, even fellow climbers began to believe in the possibility of being given enough help.
In the film, Beck Weathers is played by Josh Brolin.
Rob Hall is Jason Clarke and Scott Fischer Jake Gyllenhaal.
Other roles include Robin Wright, Keira Knightley and Emily Watson.
We celebrate 200-year-old Eno Church today
Eno’s 200-year-old church has been celebrated today on the church hill.
The church was dedicated on 4 October 1818, and a celebration of the whole family was prepared for Sunday.
The party began at Eno Church hill at 10 a.m. at a family fair, after which a Karelian catering table has been available at Eno Parish Hall.
The church was full.
517 people participated in the family fair.
The vicar of Eno, Armi Rautavuori, was glad that there had been so many people coming to church.
It will be a great joy for a long time to come and gives strength to work, says Rautavuori (pictured).
The fire at the Church of Kiihtelysvaara has touched many, and it was not overlooked at the 200th anniversary of Eno Parish.
Eno Church is now the oldest of the Evangelical Lutheran parishes of Joensuu, after the destruction of the church of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in a fire.
The wooden church of Kiihtelysvaara was completed in 1770.
A devotion was held in Kiihtelysvaara in the morning to silence and remember a church destroyed in a fire.
Photos and videos: Medicans flashed their power in Greece - Meri disappeared and street turned into river
A powerful hurricane-type autumn storm rolled from southwest to Greece on Saturday.
Mediterranean hurricane, or oxidant, has been named Zorba.
The Greek Meteorological Institute has issued a red weather warning for the regions of Attica, Peloponnese, Ionian Islands, Cyclades and Crete.
Images taken from the region show plenty of flooding around Greece.
A video posted on Twitter shows the sudden appearance of a river flooding in the town of Kiato in the Korinthian area of the Korinthian area.
Another video shows the car being transported by floodwaters.
In the south of the Peloponnese Peninsula, high winds caused strong seafaring.
The Finnish Embassy in Athens instructs people on its Facebook page to prepare for a storm in Greece.
The embassy urges monitoring weather reports and local authority guidelines.
Mediterranean hurricane, or communicative, brings with it heavy rains and even a risk of flooding.
According to CNN, a 2011 study published in 2011 shows Medicans occurring only once or twice a year worldwide, typically around September-October when the ocean temperature is still high.
The now-resiliing storm left behind flooding in Tunisia and Libya before continuing to head north and towards Europe.
There has also been concern in Greece by refugee camps on islands such as Lesbos.
Thousands of Syrian and Iraqi refugees living in camps have limited access to proper shelter.
Areas destroyed by wildfires around Athens will also be caught under the storm in the summer.
A concodican in Greece also raged last November.
We shouldn't go to the sea now, flights still on schedule - thousands of Finns are currently vacationing in Greek islands threatened by autumn storms
Excursions to the sea are cancelled and even when walking, you should be careful not to fly branches or other bulk items on top of the storm.
Guides have distributed to more than 3,500 Finns in Situations via Aurinkomatkat during the weekend.
The guidelines will come in handy, as even storm Zorbas, which has reached a storm of storming the storm in a hilt of Greece this weekend.
In the vicinity of the island of Crete, for example, wind speeds can reach gusting up to 45 metres per second.
The whistling of the weather is compounded by heavy rains.
According to tours, all passengers travelling to Greece via Aurinkomatkat and Tui from Greece who have reported their phone numbers have been warned of high winds by text message, according to tour operators.
Still in the air, sun and heat
According to Sun Travel Communications Specialist Inka Ikonen, the worst has been avoided by early evening.
Flights, for example, have landed and risen according to normal schedule.
Of course, we're monitoring the situation all the time.
Safety ahead of us.
Antonia Schroderus, a media emergency officer, says their flights have also run on schedule.
We are in constant contact with our staff.
At least Crete was still calm, he told me in the early evening on Saturday.
The most popular Greek islands, Rodos and Crete, currently have a total of over 1,500 Finnish passengers.
In addition, a few hundred passengers are vacationing in smaller destinations.
The worst storm on the island of Kos, for example, is expected to reach Sunday morning.
On the other hand, on Saturday afternoon, the sun had also chunk at Rhodes, and the temperature reached 27 degrees, says Ikonen of Aurinkomatkat.
Zorbass is expected to become Turkey's next nuisance, albeit a little mitigating.
We have already been in contact with Turkey and our staff there, and checked the number of Finns flying in Tua, for example, to Antalya, for example,” Schroderus says.
Shirly Karvinen and Janni Huss have completely identical evening dresses in the pageant final - here's how they react to the situation
Media personality and fitness beauty Janni Hussi arrived at the Miss Finland final on Saturday in an open-backed evening gown.
Hussi says he got a dress from Meslew.
I went to the shop and decided to trust the professionals who found me a great dress for tonight, Hussi smiles.
The exact same silver evening gown was also chosen by presenter Shirly Garfield.
The two also noticed their similar outfits and took a laugh at the situation.
Karvinen told the Evening News he had a rush to prepare, and he had to get dressed up on a plane.
Hussi acts as a backstage and red carpet presenter in the pageant of the missifinal, and he talks to the front-runners arriving.
Huss has a recent move behind him, as he moved from Kamppi to Jätkäsaari on Friday
For now, I'm going to stay there, we'll see what happens.
It is important that the new apartment has its own office, Hussi thought.
Before moving in, Hussi vacationed alone in Greece.
It was wonderful, I was only at a hotel for a week without leaving anywhere.
When I went to stress, I got a cold, but otherwise the holiday was really successful, Hussi says.
Shirly Karvinen's behaviour on a plane attracted a lot of attention - garnering curious looks of pensioners
Host and 2016 Miss Finland Shirly Karvinen said on the red carpet of the Miss Finland final she had enough to do with radio drinks and Love Island Finland shoots.
There has been plenty of rush to such an extent that Karvinen arrived in the finals directly from a Finnair flight.
I put my hair on the plane.
This is the glamour.
Nightgown at home, Garfield laughs.
Garfield says he pulled out his makeup among pensioners.
His preparation also attracted the attention of fellow passengers.
I had a big mirror and I saw people's eyes in the mirror.
I was amusing to me at least for others.
Garfield flies to Spain once a week.
In Marbella, he spends about a few days at a time.
Karvinen says he enjoyed his job as the host of Love Island Finland.
He also describes his experience to date to be halting.
Garfield says he went to say hello to the singles of the show on Friday.
It's really raw in some way.
They are people's genuine feelings, Karvinen describes the feelings of the singles of the program.
How do I wear over-generation boots?
Three perfect example outfits
Classic clothes are items of clothing that work from season to season in costume like an outfit.
Often the classics are decades old, but sometimes more modern individuals can be included.
The over-knee boots that became hit shoes of the autumn and winter season a few years ago have gone nowhere.
As their name suggests, boots over the knee repeat stylish from year to year and season to season.
Impressive boots divide user opinions, but a bold model is worth a try, well - boldly.
Over-knee boots are actually suitable for any outfit.
Whether it's a den, lace, dude or tight, the simple leather or faux leather surface of boots works.
Long boots look good in festive looks alike in festive looks alike in everyday outfits.
Black over-knee boots are also well suited to delicate outfits.
They suitably balance the femininity of a pink, flowery plise skirt and a hemhy, plush knit.
A fresh but autumn-style everyday outfit for a romantic taste.
A strong and slightly retro-inspired outfit comes from a long copper-brown velvet, over-knee boots, spectacular earrings and a rivet short bag.
While over-knee boots have a certain refinement, they also perfectly fit casual everyday outfits along with a t-shirt, long shorts and a trendy cap.
It’s easy and still so stylish!
Two robot cars to operate in Espoo
They will operate for the rest of the year and pick up passengers, the City of Espoo informs.
Otaniemi’s robot cars play the role of a bus simulator, as traffic will be launched next spring by robot bus in the area.
The project will develop and pilot robotic vehicle traffic throughout the year and test the technical functionality of vehicles in Finnish conditions.
The experiment will show how robotic cars are doing on the current street network.
At the same time, the city offers robotbus developers the opportunity to develop technology in a real environment,” says Johanna Nyberg, Traffic Management Manager.
For the first time, robotic cars run completely automatically with other traffic without special traffic arrangements.
Vehicle safety is always provided by an auxiliary passenger on board.
Vehicles sense their surroundings with several different sensors all the time and assess whether the drivingway is free.
If it is not, they will interpret whether a vehicle, bicycle or snowflake is a perceived barrier, says Harri Santamala, CEO of Sensible 4, which is responsible for robotic traffic development.
Robotic cars run throughout the autumn three days a week: on Tuesdays from 1pm to 3.30pm, Wednesdays from 10am to 3pm and Thursdays from 10am to 3pm.
Robotic cars stop at six stops along the route and pick up passengers.
Banquens of robot cars are identified by stop markings.
You can get a sure ride from stop 1 at Otakaare.
Mokoma bassist fell off stage during gig and injured
Mokoma-band informs about a surprising situation at a Tampere Pakkahuone gig on its Facebook page.
Mokoma’s gig at Pakkahuone in Tampere’s Pakkahuone took a dramatic turn on Saturday when the band’s bassist Santtu Hämäläinen dropped from the stage in the middle of a performance.
It was a situation when the band was pulling the last of the evening.

Police monitor hunting in North Karelia and Savo
The Eastern Finland Police Department conducted hunting supervision on Friday and Saturday with Metsähallitus and the Finnish Wildlife Agency in North Karelia and Upper Savo, the police department’s wilderness personnel said on social media on Saturday.
The main focus of supervision was on the legality and licensing of hunting.
A hunting card was checked for each hunter and a hunting permit required on state lands.
In addition, hunting gun possession licences and permissible cartridges of self-loading weapons used for chickening were checked.
Police said 112 hunters were checked during the surveillance, and only one hunter was found during surveillance, missing the required hunting permit.
The hunter was given 12 daily fines for unauthorized fishing.
In addition, 133 drivers of the vehicle were breathalysed by police, and two of them are suspected of drink driving.
In addition, patrols dealt with five traffic offences in a fine procedure, police times.
To sum up, hunters follow the permit of hunting very well.
Many hunters were surprised to control.
One hunter noted that "I've been hunting in the area for 50 years and this was the first time someone checked the permits."
The Eastern Finland Police Department will continue to monitor hunting in the autumn together with other supervisory authorities.
Mykkänen goes to Turkey to follow the selection of Syrian quota refugees
Minister of the Interior Kai Mykkänen will travel to Turkey in the coming days to follow the selection of quota refugees to Finland.
This year, 530 Syrian refugees from refugee camps in Turkey have been taken to Finland.
Selection trips are usually made a couple of times a year, with representatives from the Finnish Immigration Service, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment and the police.
The delegation is already in Turkey to conduct interviews.
The UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) will first select particularly vulnerable people to run.
In practice, it has meant people who are considered to be in a particularly distressed position in refugee camps, for example single-parent families, disabled people and sick, women and children.
More people are elected to the group of people coming to Finland than there are in the quota, because in practice some of them are not arriving for various reasons.
Mykkänen will also meet with Turkish Interior Minister Shuleyman Soylu and NGOs operating along the Syrian border.
The trip also includes Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of the Interior Ilkka Salmi.
Talk about raising the quota
Finland has taken quota refugees since the 1970s.
In recent years, the quota has been 750 refugees a year.
The quota was at a rate of 1,050 a year for a couple of years, but there has since been no agreement in government to raise it.
The Coalition has advocated an increase in the quota, but the project has last fallen to blue resistance.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre) recently proposed gradually raising the quota to 1,500 to 2 000 people per year.
Mykkänen’s visit is the first time the Minister of the Interior will carry out on the spot to monitor the selection of quota refugees.
The previous Minister of the Interior Petteri Orpo (Kok.) and Paula Risikko (Kok.) were able to move to their new duties before the visits were arranged.
Finland receives EUR 10,000 from the EU for every particularly vulnerable refugee.
Now let's go to the hackers - you don't know if to cry or laugh anymore
Karjalainen reported last Saturday on a bill to amend the Animal Welfare Act.
The article gave the impression that, in principle, the bill prohibits the keeping of all animals that are not specifically permitted by ministerial settings in relation to farm animals, pets or otherwise in business activities.
In other words, everything else is prohibited except animals specifically mentioned in the regulation.
If the bill ends up as a law, it means that we are rejecting a general principle in Western democracies that the law specifically prohibits activities endangering the security of society or good manners.
In principle, a ban on any activity to which the law or regulation does not expressly authorise.
The change will cause anything new to try, for example, in business operations and nothing else to do until an adoption of a law or regulation has been issued.
The government's action in lawmaking in general has been weak.
If we go down the road that, in principle, everything in Finland is forbidden, which is not specifically allowed, you no longer know whether to cry or laugh.
I have no doubt that the Animal Welfare Act will require an update.
But a legal project in this direction is not part of democracy.
Unfortunately, I do not know the Constitution very well, but I wonder if it will accept a procedure of 'all of all that is not expressly allowed by law or regulation'.
Hopefully, there will be some reasonable minister to suspend such a legal project to proceed.

Turkey urges to charge mobile phones in case of storm
The Zorba storm, which struck in Greece on Saturday, is expected to move to Turkey on Sunday.
Meteorologists on Saturday warned sailors, fishermen and farmers on the country's west coast of the Greek storm in particular, writes CNN T-rk.
The tropical storm reportedly moves from south to north along the coast during the day.

Kimi Raikkonen sums up reason Mercedes' superiority compared to Ferrari
Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen was allowed to admit that the biggest rival Mercedes was too tough a piece in the Russian GP time trial.
There is no reason to sink to panic in the Ferrari camp, according to an experienced driver.
They were just faster than us, but there's nothing huge about it.
Our car was the best in the time trials for the whole weekend so far, but they were just too fast, fourth-placed and with his teammate Sebastian Vettel, clearly missed the Mercedes pace, said.
Ferrari had a difficult time in the previous race in Singapore.
Raikkonen was asked what exactly is causing a sudden fall from Mercedes.
They seem to go faster than we are - as simple as simple.
If I knew why, we'd probably go at the same rate as them.
But I don't know more than anyone else.
This is always guesswork, and they seem to be ahead of us now.
Who knows why?
The time trials saw a rare treat for Raikkonen's future team Sauber.
Raikkonen, who will replace Ferrari at Ferrari next season, was seventh, with Marcus Ericsson also reaching the final time trial session.
For a Swedish driver, the 10th starting position is the best in over three years.
And even though no fewer than five drivers in the second driving session failed to drive at all, the result was still tasty for Sauber.
And maybe encouraging Räikkönen to come with me?
Yes, if you compare to where they were early in the season, a step forward has been a big one.
There's a different story next year, so we'll see, we'll see.
Robert Helenius knocked out Erkan Teper: "Robbe is back"
Robert Helenius and Erkan Teper's match of Stuttgart's evening proceeded flatly.
The German was a more proactive side in the ring, but he couldn't get any real hits.
Clearly stretching Helenius controlled the match with his tough series, which found to get there well.
The Finn was also clearly in better physical shape than Teper.
The solution finally came in the eighth round when Helenius knocked out Teper on his left straight.
The hit was so tough that the old man fighting in front of a home crowd didn't even try to get up from the carpet.
After securing the win, Helenius vented quite moderately.
In a ring interview, he initially praised the good atmosphere created by the public and his opponent.
He changed his language to Finnish for a moment.
Thank you to all the viewers and Finnish encouragers.
We took a belt with us today.
Helenius rejoiced immediately after the match.
It was a big win for Helenius' career.
There might even be an opportunity to get to a World Cup match, Helenius commented to Iltalehti before the match.
The loss, on the other hand, might have ended the entire boxing career.
Of course it's crossed my mind.
This is no longer any younger, 34-year-old Helenius admitted before the Teper encounter.
Indonesia disaster victims could multiply
According to The Guardian, the country's vice president is urging preparations for a clear rise in casualty figure.
Jusuf Kla, the country's vice president, said the total number of casualties could reach thousands.
Difficult conditions
Rescuers are looking for trapped and also dead in the worst affected areas of Sulawesi Island: the port city of Palu and its neighbouring municipality of Donggala.
For now, all the victims are from Putu, there is no clarity on the situation in Donggala.
Hundreds of people are missing and about 540 have been badly injured.
There are still people in the closed buildings that rescuers have been unable to get out.
For example, a hotel called Roa Roa in Palu has collapsed.
Rescuers say they heard screams from people trapped from the rubble, but a lack of clearing equipment has delayed the start of rescue work.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo has ordered military rescue and clearing efforts.
There is a need for the army and its equipment, as electricity and telecommunications connections are cut in many places in the disaster zone.
Fuel reserves are also depleting.
Miss Finland finalist's hesitant response and long reflection caused a laughing margin
A new Miss Finland is currently being chosen at Billnäs Ruukki.
In an interview tour, every pageant fan was asked a question.
The finalists pulled a question about a glass bowl on stage.
In particular, the hesitant response of the number six Emilia Anttikoski, 23, in the audience present, made sweet but benevolent laughters.
The question to Anttikoski had come via Facebook.
User Pirkko-Ella wanted to know what the latest book is that the pageant fan has read.
Anttikoski thought about his answer for a good time before he started with hesitation.
Thank you for asking, Pirkko-Ella.
The last book I've read..., Anttikoski said, thinking.
The reflection break brought a laugh to the audience until Anttikoski continued his response:
The last book I read is...
I read books at school!
Probably something related to economics.
So the last book I have read is economics, Anttikoski replied.
After his response, Anttikoski received a reaperement of a raucous ovation from the audience, accompanied by a laugh.
Previously, Anttikoski attracted attention to the miss, as he did not want to pose in underwear because of his principle.
The 2018 Miss Finland will be crowned at 9 p.m. when last year’s Miss Finland Michaela Söderholm is abdicated.
Sike's apple-pearl cake takes your tongue away
This recipe is for you with good, acidic apples of their own, as a domestic apple is shockingly priced in the store.
I think you have to buy a pear, even though I think a lot of people already grow that pear tree.
This cake can only be made from apples if you don't want to buy pear.
Of course, the taste is more diverse if you also invest in a cake with its pear.
Peel apples and pears and remove seed codas.
Slicing.
Melt butter in a saucepan.
Whisk the eggs and sugar into a foam and then add cornmal flour to the foam and melt butter.
Combine cornstarch, i.e. maizena, as well as baking powder, and add them to the dough.
Add almond flour and wheat flour, mix well.
Line a bread casserole with baking paper, sprinkle 2 tablespoons of sugar on the bottom of the casserole and spread pear slices over sugar.
Spoon half of the dough over pear slices and apple blocks over the dough.
Spoon the end of dough over apple blocks.
Cook in the oven at 180 degrees for about an hour until the surface is beautifully brown.
Let cool in a casserole and then overturn to a serving platter.
Cut the cake only properly cooled.
The cake is brittle in texture and crumbles easily because the dough has almond and corn flour without gluten.
Ruka to host an international crime fiction event in January

Status symbols don't attract friends - Four facts about popularity
What makes a person popular, charismatic, or admired?
Researchers at the University of Sydney who analysed the issue have outlined two types of "coliness" of slightly different features: generally attractive coolness and, in other respects, a dissenting coliness.
Charmingly, according to the researchers' description, cool people had many aspects of socially desirable: they were outward-looking, friendly, amicable and competent.
Dissidents, on the other hand, were characterized by distance, independence, rebelliousness and edge.
They craved experiences and were only a little interested in outsiders' estimates.
Both types were united by good self-esteem and stable emotional life.
The role of Kovis is not cool in the long run: high status in a teenage age does not necessarily lead to success later in life.
That's according to a 2014 U.S. study in Child Development.
Young people who dated early, partying, applied to good-looking groups and aspire to the popularity of others as young adults had an increased risk of intoxicating and falling into crime.
In their relationships, they did less well than their once more inconspicuous peers.
Luk-sus cars, designer bags or watches that signal cars signal a high status don't make a person cool - or at least not genuinely attractive company.
In a study published in the journal Social Psychological and Personality Science in August, the vast majority of people were more ready to make friends with regular supermarket shirts than those dressed in a branded shirt - despite most picking up a branded shirt in a familiarization.
If you're on Greek holiday islands, watch out!
It's where a hurricane is hit - a weather warning screams red
During the weekend, it may rain as much water in southern Greece as in Finland over an average of six months.
Zorbas Hurricane will hit Greece over the weekend.
Be prepared for it if you are staying in the Peloponnese, Ionian Islands, Cyclades or Crete.
The storm is very strong, so the Finnish Embassy in Athens announces it on its Facebook page.
According to a major proximity, the Greek Meteorological Service has issued a red weather warning to the regions.
The approaching storm is also reported on the weather service Foreca's blog.
It says the storm's toughest gusts are up to 45 meters per second.
By comparison, the Kuisma storm, which beat Finland up earlier this week, blew a good 31 metres per second.
But the blog says the main concern of storm Zorbas is not the wind, it's heavy rains.
There could be more than 300 millimetres of water in southern Greece at the weekend.
This corresponds to about half of Finland’s annual rainfall.
Weather service Severe Weather Europa has shared a video of the storm development on its Facebook page.
The Zorbas storm has caused flooding of Tunisia and Libya earlier this week.

Valtteri Bottas shaking and bursting with adrenaline in Sochi - will he be helped by Hamilton on Sunday?
Valtteri Bottas shook a little more tens of minutes after his Russian GP pole position drive while in front of the media.
A fine lap left behind Mercedes' top star Lewis Hamilton and was certainly emotionally important criticism of the Finnish rider who collected this season.
It's a nice tour.
I don't know what happened to Lewis when he dropped out of a resolution round.
I feel good, I'm still shaking a little bit, Bottas figured out.
I've only been on poles once this year, in Austria (medium summer), so time has passed quite a bit.
This track has been good to me in the past, and I got some good laps again.
It's not easy to pass on the Sochi track, so the start plays a particularly big role.
And of course Bottas was prompted to answer the pleading whether he will drive tomorrow to win or if he's to jetbling Hamilton, who is approaching a World Cup title.
My starting point for the race is definitely trying to win.
When leaving pole, there can be no other goal, Bottas piled.
But as a stable, we're fighting for both championships.
Lewis' lead at Sebastian Vettel is pretty big and the difference between me very big, so keep it in mind.
Let's see what happens, Bottas added.
Hamilton was genuinely happy to succeed after the drive, and Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff also tasted like to.
Lewis had the intention to win Valtteri, but he failed to score a sevenfold.
Valtteri knows he has to tear everything out of himself to beat Lewis.
And he was so charged that the adrenaline burst out of his ears, Wolff enthused.
To the question of whether the team Bottas and Hamilton will drive straight, Wolff replied ducking.
We'll discuss tomorrow morning, and see how the race goes.
Erno Kinnunen from Kitee wins Finnish rally championship
The Finnish Rally Championship series ended in a rare way.
Never before have the brothers become Finnish champions at the same time.
Now it was made by Eerik and Henrik Pietarinen from Tusula residents in the winding row around Turku and Salo, as Eerik won the SM1- and Henrik SM2 class.
Erno Kinnunen from Kitee secured the best achievement of his career when the third place of the final race sealed him with a Finnish championship from the SM4 class of two-wheel-drive cars.
Kinnunen, who competes in the Honda Civic, and co-driver Ville Mäkelä started the Turku race with composure because the starting points were clear: the ranking would guarantee the SM title.
In the dark of Friday night, the two had to give an equalizer when some of the extra lights failed on another special stage.
There's a pretty blinder to snort a third bit.
In a situation like that, it's not appropriate to hunker down.
On Saturday, only the speed of Jussi Tepo, who was second in the series, Kinnunen said.
Syria calls on US, France and Turkey to withdraw troops
Syria's foreign minister is calling on the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops from Syria.
Speaking at the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday, Foreign Minister Walid Muallem said foreign troops must leave Syria immediately and without conditions.
Muallem said foreign troops are in Syria fighting terrorism, and the war against terrorists, he said, is "nearly over."
In a UN address, Muallem also appealed to Syrian refugees to return to their homeland.
But there is no end to a seven-year war.
More than 360,000 people have died in the war.
Chancellor Angela Merkel said Friday in Germany that a Syria meeting was planned for October to be attended by French, Russian and Turkish presidents.
Not exactly the Super Bowl, but tens of millions of Americans watched the Supreme Court Court Judicy drama on TV
Brett Kavanaugh, a judge running to the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, who pleads in the case of harassment, got an exceptionally high number of people at the screens.
The nomination drama of a Supreme Court justice in the United States received at least 20 million people to their televisions on Thursday.
At the time, Kavanaugh, appointed by Donald Trump, and Californian professor Blasey Ford, who accused him of harassment, were in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee to tell his story.
According to preliminary results, hearings were watched by a total of 20.4 million viewers on six main channels, CBS, CNN, FOX News, MSNBC and NBC.
They were joined by several million more online consultation.
NBC reported that 6.8 million people followed the livestries and CNN reported a year record of 8.2 million live broadcasts.
CNN's figure rises to more than 10 million, including those following broadcast via Youtube and Facebook.
Fox News Digital also got off to 8.0 million.
Digital startups are channelling, TV viewership figures come from research and data analysis company Nielsen.
Nielsen will release final readings on Monday, but they will be soaring anyway.
Few reach 20 million
In the United States, more than 20 million ratings are usually attended by sports matches, as well as the major Oscars and Grammy Awards in the entertainment world, as well as occasional political events such as presidential speeches and also 2016 presidential debates.
There is, of course, a distance to the U.S. Football League NFL Finals Matching Super Bowl.
This year, the Super Bowl gathered about 103 million people to NBC for screens.
Last year, according to Nielsen, Trump’s first speech to Congress was watched by nearly 48 million people and 30 million people.
Top priority
The Supreme Court's judicial appointment is an extremely significant case in the United States, as posts are lifelong.
Trump was able to appoint one new judge when Antonin Scalia passed away in early 2016 and Republicans managed to prevent then-President Barack Obama from appointing a successor to him.
Another seat opened when Judge Anthony Kennedy, 81, announced his retirement this year.
Kennedy was appointed by Republican President Ronald Reagan, but he was a so-called scale language on several issues, whose voice may have decided on the position of a nine-member court.
He was a supporter of abortion rights and the rights of sexual minorities and, for example, ruled in a vote in 2015 that same-sex people were given the right to marry throughout the federal government.
Kavanaugh is far more conservative in his position.
His election to the Supreme Court may lock the court of Conservative superiority for decades.
Children have the right to be informed to parents
Only parents of children under 10 see their children's health records from the Kanta service.
It's a big problem, it's wrong, and it's weird.
Originally, of course, the situation of Kanta service was even more worrying: parents were not able to look at even the health information or prescriptions of infants.
A temporary correction was identified as a temporary correction for under 10 years of age.
Since then, the practices have been promised to be corrected, but it has taken an astonishingly long remedy.
Now a correction is in store - in 2020.
Because the problem is clear, changing the legal basis shouldn't have been more than a shout-out.
After that, the layman's understanding is about clicking the button: when the wire is now held, it will be opened.
Of course, a child can show his or her knowledge to their parents if they have bank codes or an official ID card.
But how many 10 years do?
An identity card is subject to a charge, and a 10-year-old doesn't even get bank codes.
In practice, therefore, no one can see the data of a primary school fourth-grader except by asking them printed.
It is not so much about parental rights as children's rights.
It is extremely important for a child to be able to be involved in it.
The right of teenagers to privacy must be taken care of.
Minors can also have family situations where not all things can be freely discussed.
Often they relate to sexual health, for which free care is a profoundly relevant human right.
FBI in U.S. gutting harassment allegations against Kavanaugh
According to US media reports, the FBI is investigating harassment allegations made by at least two women.
One of the women appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this week.
Kavanaugh has denied accusations of alleged sexual harassment during his college hours.
U.S. President Donald Trump ordered the FBI to investigate allegations at the request of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
The report must not take more than a week.
According to the Washington Post, this is a more limited account than a criminal investigation and may not become public.
Man threatened to kill police at police station in Kajaani
The captured brawler continued to bun even at the chamber.
Police say they put the man in a police prison to "calculated."
Police were threatened by a suspected abuser in Kajaani on Saturday night.
Officials inform the court of an incident that originated when a man with a good 30-dollars violently challenged a dispute in a downtown restaurant.
The man first assaulted another customer inside a nutrition store.
This resulted in removal from the restaurant.
Outside a fighter attacked another man by knocking him to the ground.
When a third party sought to intervene, he was still hitting him.
Triple abuse led to the police being summoned.
The patrol apprehended the man and took the Kajaani police station to a police station, police say.
The suspect continued to behave aggressively at a police station.
The man kicked another cop in the foot.
He threatened to kill and assault the cops.
Police say they sent the man to a police prison to a "calculated."
The man is a suspect in three counts of assault and violently resisting an official.
Aid agencies prepare to start work at Indonesia's Sulawes - "Clean water is the most urgent"
UN Children’s Association (UNcef) and other international aid agencies are on standby to help on Indonesia's Sulawes island, says Kirsi Haru, Information Manager at UNICEF Finland.
Local authorities are leading rescue efforts, but the need for additional assistance is already evident at this stage.
Unicef operates in almost all countries, and we also have long-term programs in Indonesia.
In addition to normal operations, Unicef always has full emergency response, says Haru.
The first task now is to find people in the rubble, both survivors and dead.
In the town of Palu, Sulawesi, rescue efforts are under way, but in the Donggala region, the situation is less clear than that.
There are still places where connections do not work.
Aid measures are difficult because roads are also cut off, says Haru.
Buildings at Sulawes are often lightweight, so the damage caused by earthquakes and tsunamis is great.
Once the survivors have been found, they will need shelter - first of all, tents - and clean water, for example.
Clean water is the most urgent in crisis situations.
The first thing people are most often able to offer water purification tablets that Unicef has in storage.
Efforts are being made to repair water systems as soon as possible, but in an emergency, water is transported to a first-time source of goods, for example by trucks.
In crisis situations, many children are separated from their parents.
Searching for family members and reunification of families is one of Unicef's mission areas.
Food aid is organised by the World Food Programme (WFP), which is part of the United Nations.
In the initial phase, funds previously raised for emergency aid will be used.
But Unicef, among others, has already begun a fundraising to help victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia.
Billionaire Elon Musk quits Tesla as chairman of board of bucks - buck , bucks fined for tweets
Elon Musk, the founder of companies producing space rockets and electric cars, avoids fraud charges with the US Securities Commission.
Billionaire Elon Musk is quitting his position as chairman of the board of Tesla, an electric car company, and agrees to a burq. fine of bucks.
Musk will step down as part of a deal he signed with a U.S. securities regulator.
By agreeing to, Musk avoids fraud charges.
The US Securities Commission (EC SEC) threatened Musk for securities fraud over tweets he sent in August.
In them, Musk wrote that he was preparing to withdraw electric car company Tesla from the stock market, prompting a rapid rise in the company's share price.
Under the deal, Musk will not be allowed to serve as president of Tesla board for three years.
In addition, Tesla must appoint a new "independent member" of its board and take on two "independent executives" to its management team.
Tesla must also set up a committee to oversee Musk's communications.
Musk will continue to be Tesla CEO.
In addition to Musk's personal fines of quid, Tesla's company will also have to pay a similar fine of 20 million to a financial regulator.
Tweets mislead investors
The SEC said Musk's tweets misled investors and Tesla shareholders.
Musk claimed he would have secured financing to buy Tesla back from the stock exchange as a private limited liability company.
The billionaire's tweets suggest the company would have been bought off the stock exchange for n4,000.
Tesla's stock rose more than ten percent in 24 hours after tweets, but later fell.
The SEC said Musk's claims had no basis whatsoever.
The supervisor said he had not actually negotiated the funding he claimed.
Nor had he discussed withdrawing from the stock exchange with another management team or company board.
On Friday of this week, the rate dropped 14 percent when the Securities Superintendent The SEC reported a fraud charge.
The settlement of the news is expected to confirm the company's rate again.
The last verdict is not a reason.
The bells of the cathedral do not, of course, ring when the hands do not move.
It's a technical fault.
The clock at the Helsinki Cathedral tower has stopped.
The wise men point to 12 o'clock.
It's like a mediocre horror movie: even as the church's cryptic famous exorcism and the organ messed up on its own.
Of course, this is not the case, but the clock has stopped for a technical reason: it has broken.
It has been visited by a repairman to see, but some parts have broken down and a new part is expected to be there, says the Suntio Eveliina Jamsen.
At the same time, Jamsen confirms the fact that the Church Helsinki Twitter account has already mentioned.
The account mentions that the last verdict is not a reason to stop the clock.
Jamsen says the church bells don't ring because of a fault.
