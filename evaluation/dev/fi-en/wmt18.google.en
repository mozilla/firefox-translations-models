Camille Auer wanted to correct her gender, was diagnosed as mentally ill and now she makes art on the subject - &quot;A person should have the right to their own body&quot;
Dozens of patient reports hang from the ceiling of the Academy of Fine Arts&#39; Project room gallery.
Camille Auer&#39;s name is written on each of them.
The papers tell the multi-year story of how outsiders have written down their interpretation of Auer and his identity.
Decided for him who he is.
&quot;I wanted to tell my personal treatment history to make the violence of the process visible,&quot; says Auer.
By process, he refers to the gender reassignment process.
It is often a research period lasting years, which includes meetings with psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses and doctors.
The process starts with a referral to diagnostic tests for &quot;gender identity disorder&quot;, which are carried out in Tampere and Helsinki.
For Auer, the process started four years ago.
Even before this, she had used estrogen she had ordered via the internet and was already very far along in her own repair process.
She thought she was a woman, but according to Finnish law, a person must go through the correction process in order to legally correct their gender.
The Trans Act, i.e. the law on confirming the gender of transsexuals (563/2002), obliges transgender people to undergo forced sterilization in order to obtain the correct gender in, for example, the population registry center and passport.
At the moment, a psychiatric diagnosis and a certificate of infertility are required from everyone undergoing gender reassignment.
A person has the right to decide about his own body.
&quot;This situation is intolerable and violates human rights,&quot; says Auer.
There has been talk about reforming the Translaw in Finland for a long time.
The UN Human Rights Council has issued eight observations on the law and the European Court of Human Rights has a preliminary ruling that obliges the parties to the European Convention on Human Rights to observe the right to self-determination.
Finland&#39;s previous government prepared the amendment of the law under the leadership of the then Minister of Social Affairs and Health, Susanne Huovinen.
Elections came and the Basic Finns took over the government.
Now the law change is stuck again.
These are internal political disputes that are not even related to this law in question.
&quot;The government does not want to put it on the table because there are disagreements within the government about changing the law,&quot; says Frank Johansson, executive director of Amnesty&#39;s Finnish department.
The front of the exhibition space is dominated by two large installations.
One of them consists of the packaging and instructions for use of the medicines used by Auer.
In the Patient Narrative installation, any visitor can read, for example, the interpretation of Auer by the transpol psychologist at Tampere University Hospital.
The psychologist met Camille Auer twice and based on these, wrote a report that would define Auer&#39;s right to receive treatment and help.
The subject&#39;s sense of reality appears to be susceptible to wavering.
The subject&#39;s self-perception appears fragmented in a borderline-like manner, and the unstable features related to personality are highlighted.
Auer did not recognize himself from these descriptions.
&quot;It was a shock to hear that I was diagnosed as mentally ill,&quot; says Auer.
An even bigger shock was when Auer was not granted gender reassignment treatment.
According to the nursing staff, his resources were not sufficient to start the process.
He was denied his own identity.
That&#39;s when, on February 11, 2015, Auer walked out of a meeting and kicked the television in the waiting room of the transpol.
Later, from that television came an artwork called Monument for the Excluded, in which Auer reflects on his experience of power and its use.
&quot;It&#39;s crazy that anyone defined as female at birth can enlarge their breasts, but to remove them you need a diagnosis,&quot; says Auer.
Your body is not yours if you feel that you are something other than the sex assigned to you at birth.
Unfortunately, Auer&#39;s experience is not the only one of its kind.
For many, the gender reassignment process is more difficult for spiritual reasons than for purely medical operations.
Those who go through it meet dozens of people to whom they have to justify their own existence and their right to their own gender experience.
&quot;It&#39;s crazy that people who are in need of support and help are denied treatment on the grounds that they don&#39;t have enough resources,&quot; says Auer.
Many of those who applied for the process have psychological symptoms behind them: depression, anxiety, possible experiences of bullying.
Referring to these, the medical staff can order that the treatment cannot be started.
&quot;Preventing getting treatment and help can put a person in an even worse situation than they were before starting the process,&quot; says Auer.
Auer&#39;s personal exhibition also deals with anxiety and thoughts of suicide.
In the text of the exhibition publication, Auer writes: &quot;I&#39;ve had suicidal thoughts throughout my adult life and that&#39;s something that people usually have a hard time digesting.&quot;
Depression has been treated with medication and when Auer started using hormones, he felt better.
He had finally been able to put into words the feelings that had already existed in childhood and adolescence.
Why a wide chin didn&#39;t seem to fit my body and why the pectoral muscles had to be round instead of a flat chest.
The most important thing for Auer has been that there are people near him who see him.
Being seen is a basic need.
&quot;You have to justify yourself so much by talking, dressing, using your voice and movements,&quot; he says.
Today, Auer already feels that she will be seen, she exists as a woman.
However, in the early stages of the process, random comments from loved ones could hurt a lot.
It hurts the most when loved ones misgender.
&quot;They should know and they know who I am, but they won&#39;t or can&#39;t internalize it,&quot; he continues.
However, not all trans people need physical changes.
They do not suffer from body hysphoria, i.e. body discord, where the body or its parts can cause anxiety and even physical pain.
However, without using hormones and a long research process, you cannot get official confirmation of your own gender.
&quot;There is absolutely no medical basis for these studies,&quot; says Auer.
And it&#39;s true.
In Denmark, for example, in June 2014, the parliament approved a new procedure for recognizing legal gender.
The new legislation is based on the right to self-determination regarding legal gender.
An adult applicant submits a written application for a new personal identification number, stating that he/she feels that he/she is of the other gender.
After the six-month consideration period, the applicant confirms his application in writing and the ministry issues the applicant with a new personal identification number.
This right to self-determination is demanded in Finland as well, and Auer&#39;s exhibition also encapsulates this demand.
It has not been a therapy experience for the artist, but the exhibition is a collection of political and artistic works.
I want to believe that art still has weight and that it can be used to bring about political changes in a time when politicians have forgotten human rights.

A civil rights organization issued a travel warning for Missouri
The NAACP, a national organization that advocates for African-American civil rights, has issued a travel warning for Missouri. The reason is the discriminatory practices of the state and the racist attacks that happened there.
&quot;The NAACP Travel Advisory for Missouri, effective August 28, 2017, urges African-American travelers, visitors and locals to pay special attention and exercise extreme caution when traveling in a state that has recently experienced numerous questionable racial incidents,&quot; the organization&#39;s release states.
A law recently enacted in Missouri makes it more difficult to take discrimination cases to court. Additionally, state law enforcement disproportionately targets minorities. According to the NAACP, these factors led to the issuance of the travel warning.
&quot;People&#39;s civil rights are being violated.
They are stopped and beaten or killed because of the color of their skin,‚Äù NAACP Missouri President Rod Chapel told the Kansas City Star.
&quot;We have never heard of so many cases in such a short time before.&quot;
The travel advisory for Missouri is the organization&#39;s first warning for a US state.
The organization cited as examples the racist comments made against African-American students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a 28-year-old black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under questionable circumstances earlier this year. He was driving across the state when his car ran out of gas. Missouri police arrested him, although he was not charged with a crime.
The travel bulletin also referred to a study by the Missouri Attorney General, according to which the police are 75 percent more likely to stop a black driver than a white one.
&quot;The purpose of the travel advisory is to tell people to be on the lookout and to warn their families, friends and co-workers about what could happen in Missouri,&quot; says Chapel.
&quot;People need to prepare by, for example, bringing money to pay bail or telling relatives they plan to travel across the state.&quot;
According to the FBI, 100 hate crimes were recorded in Missouri in 2015, which is the 16th highest number of US states.
The travel warning is also a response to Missouri&#39;s new law that makes it harder to sue companies for discrimination in housing and employment.
The ACLU, which defends constitutional civil rights, recently issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after they passed immigration laws that require police to arrest people for immigration violations. According to the organization, this increases racial profiling.
Generally, travel warnings are published by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and they apply to other countries. Recently, however, NGOs have published them in response to certain laws and developments in the United States.
General: Lintil√§ has asked Finnair for an explanation of the CEO&#39;s additional pension
Minister of Economy, Mika Lintil√§ (center), responsible for state ownership management, has asked Finnair for an explanation of the additional pension payment received by the airline&#39;s CEO Pekka Vauramo, Yle reports.
According to the minister, it is in conflict with the state&#39;s expression of will.
Vauramo&#39;s additional pension of 130,000 euros came to the fore this week, when Helsingin Sanomat reported on the development of compensation for directors of listed companies.
Suomen Kuvalehti reported on Vauramo&#39;s additional pension in February.
Finnair announced that it would give up supplementary pensions in 2013.
The state has ruled that additional pensions are not used for rewards.
The state owns more than half of Finnair.
According to the company, the decision is in line with last year&#39;s decision in principle regarding ownership control.
The sanctions immediately intensified the talks
Until a while ago, it seemed that relations between the United States and Russia were on the way from cold to warm.
US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, who met in connection with the G20 meeting of industrialized countries in Hamburg, seemed to get along perfectly well.
Since then, the atmosphere has cooled considerably.
Russia reacted bitterly to the new economic sanctions approved by the US Congress last week and signed by Trump on Wednesday.
The most shocking answer so far has been heard from Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, according to whom the sanctions law signed by Trump means a &quot;full-scale trade war&quot;.
Even if the Russian reactions are dismissed only as escalations and excesses belonging to political rhetoric, the tension between the United States and Russia is a fact after the short honeymoon period after Trump&#39;s election.
In the United States, the passage of the sanctions law concerning Russia, Iran and North Korea was not simple.
Although Congress passed the law with considerable unanimity, it was reportedly much more difficult for the president to pass the law.
Trump criticized the law he had just signed as &quot;significantly flawed&quot;.
Russia in particular must have been the reason for President Trump&#39;s grumpiness, although the approval of a law limiting his own powers must also have been repulsive.
As is well known, there is an investigation in the United States into Russia&#39;s possible interference in the presidential election as well as the Trump campaign&#39;s connections to Russia.
The tension between the United States and Russia is a fact after a short honeymoon.
When the staff of the White House has changed rapidly and various scandalous twists and turns have been revealed almost without update, it seems increasingly clear that foreign policy in the United States is not made under the leadership of the president, but in spite of the president.
Such a situation is by no means desirable.
If the relationship with Russia is a mess in the United States, the same applies to the European Union.
In addition to economic sanctions, the tense security situation in the Union&#39;s core area in the Baltic Sea is also straining relations.
The EU has visibly highlighted Ukraine&#39;s situation in its relations with Russia and demanded the implementation of the Minsk Agreement.
Although the Union has so far remained unified in its Russia policy, at least on the surface, the interests of the member countries are quite different.
For a member country like Finland that trades a lot with Russia, economic sanctions have been a real problem.
The effects of the recent sanctions law in the United States are still unclear.
It has been feared in the EU that the sanctions will make it difficult for many European companies to operate.
In Finland, the effects may be felt, for example, in the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project and possibly in the Fennovoima nuclear power plant project.
Acidity in Europe has been caused by the fact that, for example, liquefied natural gas lng, which is important to the US economy, has been left out of the sanctions.
Trade sanctions are a way in world politics to show disapproval.
However, economic sanctions must be well thought out and carefully considered.
Otherwise, they easily do more harm than good.
Is nothing sacred anymore?
Trump&#39;s White House now has the Statue of Liberty in its sights
Tampering with the statues is the surest sign of a change of power.
Americans know it as well as anyone: Iraqis, together with American soldiers, toppled the statue of Saddam Hussein in Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the main ideologues of the Trump administration, knew very well what he was doing in a heated debate with CNN&#39;s Jim Acosta. The Statue of Liberty came under Miller&#39;s attack in a barrage of words about the president&#39;s proposal to greatly reduce legal immigration.
Miller didn&#39;t really criticize the statue itself.
Had he done so, he would have been attacked by huge hordes of cruise operators and Statue of Liberty impersonators.
The object of his attack was the meaning of the statue and especially the fact that in 1903 a poem by Emma Lazarus was added to the pedestal of the statue - 17 years after the statue was completed.
This is how Miller put Acosta: &quot;I don&#39;t want to go into history in more detail now, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that lights up the whole world.
The poem was added later and does not belong in the original Statue of Liberty.&quot;
Miller wasn&#39;t wrong per se, but it&#39;s not all about history, as he himself said.
What is essential are Lazarus&#39; touching words, the only ones of their kind in which the state does not invite only immigrants but &quot;the poorest of the poor&quot;: &quot;Your tired, your poor, / Your huddled masses yearning to Breathe free, / The Wretched refuse of your teeming shore.&quot;
The poem is now more relevant than ever.
Miller was by no means practicing literary criticism. He made it clear that the &quot;poorest of the poor&quot; are not welcome in Trump&#39;s United States.
The controversy over the meaning of the Statue of Liberty is part of a larger political and cultural controversy over the meaning of the United States.
Friends of Lazarus campaigned after his death to have the poem affixed to the statue&#39;s pedestal. They were well aware that the act was strongly political.
The purpose of the statue was to embody the connections between French and American republicanism with a classical metaphor, the feminine embodiment of freedom.
Lazarus changed its meaning: in his poem, the female figure is no longer abstract, but has a voice.
And it gives itself a new name: the mother of the deportees.
Attaching the poem to the image was a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on the American idea of nationhood.
Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, and the right has long wanted to change it back to the original.
Rush Limbaugh ‚Äî a mouthpiece that can now be seen as something of a Trump harbinger ‚Äî claimed in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is not an invitation to anyone, but an early pioneer of neoconservatives, carrying America&#39;s torch into a world shrouded in darkness: ‚ÄúLady Liberty steps forth.
He takes the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch does not show the way to the United States.‚Äù
Rarely, Limbaugh was partially right.
The meaning of the Statue of Liberty depends entirely on perspective.
Lazarus saw it like the poor and exhausted but hopeful immigrants from the deck of a ship after a long and trying journey.
He saw it from the perspective of people seeking shelter and a better life.
His Statue of Liberty comforts by giving hope and welcoming.
And that&#39;s definitely not what Miller and Trump want.
Their torch does not show the way but fan the flames of anger, their only source of power.
Athletics World Championships 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of Great Britain&#39;s national team
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots made the Great Britain national team
Neil Black, UK Athletics&#39; director of performance, says the 16 Scottish members of the national team for the world championships are a &quot;significant boost&quot;.
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for the World Athletics Championships starting in London on Friday.
According to Black, &quot;there is something special happening&quot; in Scotland that UK athletics needs to learn from.
&quot;This is welcome, and we&#39;ll continue to investigate it until we understand what&#39;s going on,&quot; says Black.
‚ÄúI spoke to representatives of the Scottish Institute of Sport and they thought it was related to the institute&#39;s activities.
The Scottish Athletics Association, on the other hand, believes that it is related to the activities of the association,
and the British Athletics Association believe that it is their actions that are behind it.
And the common street person thinks that he must have something to do with it.
However, it is something absolutely amazing, whatever the reason for it.&quot;
Many Scottish athletes are seriously competing for medals in London, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who will compete with Sir Mo Farah in the 5,000 meters. Eilidh Doyle, on the other hand, was chosen as the captain of the national team.
&quot;Eilidh is unnecessarily modest.
His captain&#39;s speech was amazing,&quot; says Black.
&quot;The athletes left the event proud of their achievements and strongly motivated, regardless of where they happen to live and train.
Eilidhi&#39;s words had genuine feeling and passion for sports.&quot;
Eilidh Doyle is a Commonwealth Championships silver medalist in the 400m hurdles and this is her fifth World Championships. He thinks it is &quot;unbelievable&quot; that there are 16 Scots in the national team.
The previous record was seven from 1983 and 2015.
Middle distance runner Laura Muir has run five British and two European records during the year.
He will compete in London at 1,500 meters and 5,000 meters.
Chris O&#39;Hare runs 1,500 meters in London. You should also keep an eye on him: the man has an excellent season behind him, which includes victories in the Great Britain World Cup qualifiers and the Anniversary Games competitions.
Doyle remembers his first World Cup, when Lee McConnell was the only Scot in the national team besides him.
The captain of the national team says he is &quot;hugely proud&quot; to have so many Scots involved, some of whom are seriously competing for final places and medals.
&quot;Becoming captain is a great honor anyway, but it&#39;s even more special because the members of the national team voted for the captain,&quot; says Doyle.
&quot;Of course, I am very proud of all the Scots who made it to the national team.
It shows how far we&#39;ve come.
They are involved as distinguished athletes who compete for prize positions.
My captain&#39;s speech?
I think it went just fine.
I focused on how lucky we are to have home games.
It is important to enjoy the support of the home crowd and the fact that we are back at the Olympic stadium.
I&#39;ll get another chance to compete there and I know the atmosphere will be insanely great.&quot;
Blocking critics on Facebook: Don&#39;t run for public office if you can&#39;t handle criticism
The father of our country knew what bad publicity was.
Americans loved George Washington, but newspapers soon began criticizing him for everything from his domestic policies to his political principles.
Criticism must have irritated me,
but he did not silence his critics.
‚ÄúIf freedom of speech be taken away, we may be led as dumb and silent as sheep to the slaughter,‚Äù Washington said in 1783.
Which brings us to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who should take a lesson from Washington.
Hogan&#39;s staff has removed at least 450 comments from his official Facebook page and blocked those who made them.
The American Civil Liberties Union sued Hogan earlier this week.
His staff consider the challenge unfounded, and the attitude was belittling online as well.
&quot;Who cares? This is just Facebook&quot;, many commented.
But it matters,
especially in Hogan&#39;s case.
Hogan is an incredibly popular Republican governor of a Democratic-controlled state.
He has received the second best evaluations for his activities among 50 governors.
Hogan is not sensitive to heat.
He has led the state steadily and strictly adhered to principles.
He has also skilfully used Facebook as the main channel of communication with his voters and published there a picture of his head bald from chemotherapy.
Therefore, blocking users coming to the governor&#39;s Facebook page is unnecessary and even dangerous. The governor&#39;s page is a public and official forum maintained by his staff with tax dollars.
Hogan&#39;s spokeswoman, Amelia Chasse, defended the governor&#39;s actions in an interview with the Washington Post. According to him, it was just about moderating the comments.
However, labeling commenters as trolls, spammers or haters is too easy a solution.
The Washington Post interviewed users blocked by Hogan on Facebook.
They turned out to be ordinary people who wanted to talk to their elected leaders. They were not trolls, but for example teachers, entrepreneurs and pastors.
They reported that their comments were respectful, considerate and to the point.
The pastor quoted the bible in his comment; he wanted to appeal to Hogan&#39;s Catholic faith.
Attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Maryland was not hostile, but raised the issue of hate crimes.
&quot;I politely commented that I was disappointed that Hogan had not addressed the hate crimes and other recent news,&quot; he wrote in comments to the Washington Post story.
&quot;I also cannot accept that when several people comment on the same issue, they are immediately considered an organized group in some way and ignored as a large group of concerned citizens.&quot;
The governor&#39;s staff called the comments a &quot;focused attack.&quot; Someone else might call them promoting things that are considered important.
In the age of Facebook, it is easy to control communication by blocking a reviewer or deleting a critical comment.
In the old days, staff would have had to be sent to collect and burn newspapers that had published critical editorials, or to arrest and silence protesters.
However, it&#39;s actually the same thing, only digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be accused of shackling Facebook and other social media channels.
Twitter users blocked by President Trump have sued him.
The first major decision on the subject was made last week in Virginia.
According to Alexandria District Court Judge James C. Cacheris, the Loudoun County government violated the First Amendment of the United States Constitution by blocking a voter on Facebook.
And the American Civil Liberties Union went to talk to Kentucky Republican Governor Matt Bevin about the use of Twitter and Facebook.
This shouldn&#39;t be difficult.
In Washington&#39;s time, cheap postage had a similar effect to the internet today.
The number of newspapers quadrupled from 1776 to 1800, and anonymous writers plagued Washington.
Even back then there were trolls.
The nom de guerres Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius and Portius wrote letters to newspapers berating Washington&#39;s decisions.
The president&#39;s office was flooded with petitions criticizing the Jay Treaty, a cooperation, trade and maritime agreement between the United States and Britain. This is evident from documents collected by the Papers of George Washington online project.
However, he did not silence his critics.
Freedom of speech, freedom of opinion and freedom of discussion are the cornerstones of our nation.
True leadership means accepting this fact.
Summer feeding of birds should be stopped immediately
Samples have come from about fifty places, and in addition online announcements from a couple or three.
Most of them have come from Southern and Western Finland, but then there are also individual ones from Haapavedi and Sein√§joki, says specialist researcher Marja Isomursu from Evira.
Green finches have died from a parasitic disease called trichomoniasis.
It is caused by a protozoan known scientifically as Trichomonas gallinae.
It has previously been known to attack pigeons, and pigeons in particular.
However, in the 21st century, the disease also began to be observed in finches.
In 2009, it really boomed.
Then trichomonosis caused a big collapse in the Finnish greenfinch population, after which the populations of the species have been on the way to recovery.
There have been sick greenfinches now, but at least not yet on a large scale, says Juha Honkala, Curator of the Central Natural History Museum (Luomus) of the University of Helsinki.
It is to be feared that the previous epidemic of greenfinches will be repeated again if something is not done.
What needs to be done now is a very simple thing that anyone can do: stop summer feeding the birds immediately.
More on that later.
Ronan Rafferty will be hoping to capitalize on home ground advantage at the Renaissance Club
Former European No.1 Ronan Rafferty will be hoping to capitalize on home court advantage over the next three days when the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th Scottish Senior Open.
Rafferty, from Northern Ireland, led last year&#39;s tournament at the neighboring Archerfield Links before the final round, but eventually lost to Paul Eales. Rafferty has liked the new location and acts as an ambassador for the tournament on behalf of the club&#39;s founder and CEO Jerry Sarvad.
‚ÄúI watched the Renaissance Club build, and with this event it will reach its full glory,‚Äù says Rafferty.
&quot;The players see the field at their best. It is in fantastic condition.
Jerry has done a great job with this place.
He is an avid ambassador for the game and is proud of his achievements here.
The tournament is a wonderful presentation opportunity for this field.&quot;
Englishman Eales is defending the championship for the first time, although he has won both the European Tour and the European Challenger Tour in his 32-year career.
&quot;This feels like a really special occasion,&quot; says the Southport-based player.
&quot;I couldn&#39;t defend my Extremadura Open victory because the tournament is not part of the tour this year.
It&#39;s great to be back here.
This is a great place to play golf.
The memories of last year come back to mind: winning the tournament was a wonderful thing for me and my wife Sharon.
It was a great time that we will always remember.‚Äù
Gary Orr returns to real action on his own soil. He joined the tour after turning 50 earlier this year.
This will be his first appearance in Scotland since the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open.
&quot;Playing at home is always more meaningful than usual,&quot; says Orr, who lives in Helensburgh.
&quot;You want to succeed, but you also feel extra pressure.
I have enjoyed playing again and played quite strongly.
I&#39;m happy with my game so far.&quot;
The trio will be joined by former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior major tournament winners Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Six Scots will take part in the tournament: Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance, along with Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Entry to the tournament is free. Car parking costs ¬£5 if there is only a driver in the car and ¬£10 if there are two or more people in the car.
All proceeds will be donated to Prostate Cancer UK.
In S√§kyl√§, possible indoor air problems in the barracks were investigated
In S√§kyl√§, at least so far, no indoor air problems have been found in the barracks of the Pori brigade&#39;s signal company, the brigade said on Thursday.
Indoor air investigations are still being continued.
The investigations began when a man who interrupted his conscript service for health reasons thought that his health had deteriorated due to the bad indoor air in the barracks.
According to Pori Brigade Chief of Staff Lieutenant Colonel Mika Holma, no problems have been detected in the health of the other conscripts.
It turned out that it was an isolated case, and the other people who served in that unit have not had health problems.
Every report is taken seriously and we wanted to thoroughly investigate this issue.
At the moment, it is not known that we have any indoor air problems, says Holma.
The brigade&#39;s press release says that due to the arrival batch in July, goods have had to be moved to the barracks, which is why the dustiness may have temporarily increased.
The air may have seemed stuffy because of that, Holma states.
Poverty and death in the golden land of Indonesia
Bardina Degei does not use heat when cooking.
He rarely uses the pot either.
Degei lives in a wooden building in Enarotal, the capital of the Paniai region in Indonesia&#39;s restive Papua province. When he cooks dinner, he usually puts the sweet potato ‚Äì locally known as ‚Äúnota‚Äù ‚Äì directly on the stove.
After half an hour, the charred sweet potato is eaten greedily with bare, unwashed hands.
There is no furniture in Degei&#39;s home. He sits on the muddy dirt floor, where he also usually takes care of his daily chores, such as washing clothes in murky water fetched from a nearby swamp.
The toilet function is provided by a bucket in the roofless room.
Degei is the youngest of her husband&#39;s four wives and is not assigned to tend the fields.
Polygamy is common here.
Working late can be dangerous: most of the men in the village are unemployed, and many drink heavily. In addition, there are soldiers to consider.
&quot;No one dares to walk in the village after five in the evening,&quot; says Degei.
This is a rare glimpse into daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was annexed by Indonesia in 1969. The annexation was preceded by a controversial referendum in which 1,026 village elders were forced to vote in public in front of occupation forces.
A local independence movement opposed to Dutch rule quickly turned its anger on the Jakarta government, which tightly controls the area and prevents foreign journalists and human rights monitors from entering.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua. The eastern part of the island belongs to Papua New Guinea.
Enarotali is remote and in a corner. The journey there starts with a one-and-a-half-hour flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire and continues with a stomach-churning five-hour drive in a rental car.
There is no public transport here.
In the town of about 19,000 inhabitants, there are wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, whose corrugated iron roofs have been stained yellow-brown by rust.
Few Indonesians have been here, let alone journalists and foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, the Mee Pago tribesmen of Papua worshiped the god Uga Tamee.
There have been other changes as well.
&quot;We didn&#39;t have clothes like this,&quot; says Degei. She means her colorful, handwoven wrap headpiece, dark skirt and brightly colored blouse.
&quot;Before, we only had leaves to cover our bodies.&quot;
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia. 28 percent of its residents live below the poverty line, and infant mortality and illiteracy are among the highest in Asia.
But it is also the golden land of Indonesia.
Paniai is an upland region roughly the size of New Jersey with a population of 153,000. Only about a hundred kilometers from Paniai is Grasberg, the world&#39;s largest and most profitable gold mine. It is owned by the Freeport McMoran company based in Phoenix, USA.
In 2015, the mine produced $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper for Freeport.
In addition, Papua has an estimated 78 billion dollars worth of wood reserves.
For the Papuans, however, these riches bring misery, as they mean the stifling presence of Indonesia&#39;s powerful military.
The New York Times revealed in 2005 that Freeport paid local military personnel and local units of the military nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004. Individual officers were paid up to $150,000.
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten this source of income and are being ruthlessly silenced.
According to human rights activists, since 1969, the Indonesian army has killed more than 500,000 Papuans and raped, tortured and imprisoned thousands.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, mass killings in the highlands of Papua&#39;s tribes in the 1970s reached the proportions of genocide.
Last year, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 people in the region during peaceful protests.
The Brisbane Archdiocese&#39;s 2016 report, We Will Lose Everything, details the previous year&#39;s atrocities, including extrajudicial executions, torture - rape and electric shocks being particularly popular methods - and relentless attacks on peaceful protests.
&quot;Calculating the number of victims is difficult because there are cases every week,&quot; says Andreas Harsono, Indonesian researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have been tightened as Papua&#39;s natural resources attract migrants from other parts of Indonesia.
Of the province&#39;s 3.5 million inhabitants, 83 percent are Christians, but the demographic structure is changing, as Muslims from Indonesia&#39;s populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi move to the region in the hope of a better livelihood.
Javanese warung food stalls sell fried chicken and gado-gado mixed vegetables in peanut sauce.
It&#39;s hard for locals to compete.
&quot;The immigrants have started selling chicken and vegetables at the market cheaper than the locals,&quot; says 24-year-old Abeth You, who is from Paniai and moved to the provincial capital for work.
&quot;Local women lost their customers.&quot;
In his 2014 election campaign, Indonesian President Joko Widodo ‚Äì nicknamed Jokowi ‚Äì promised to address injustices and human rights violations in Papua.
Papua consists of 29 districts and this former carpenter won the vote in 27 districts, including Paniai, on his way to the presidential palace in Jakarta.
But little has changed in Papua, and locals feel betrayed.
&quot;Our hearts were broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014 and expected him to fulfill our wishes and restore justice,&quot; You says.
Paniai experienced some sort of trough only two months after Jokowi&#39;s inauguration in October.
Eleven children were singing Christmas carols by the campfire in Enarotal on December 7, 2014, when two Indonesian soldiers on motorcycles appeared out of the dark.
The frightened children told the soldiers that they should use their headlights.
One of the soldiers did not like the remark. According to local pastor Yavedt Tebai, the man returned to the scene with four soldiers.
According to the accounts of the victims and witnesses, the drunken soldiers caught the children and beat them with rifles.
So one of the soldiers fired at the children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, fell into a coma as a result of the abuse.
A couple of hours later, the State Election Commission building located near the scene was set on fire, and the next day things began to happen.
About a thousand Papuans ‚Äì young men and women and children ‚Äì gathered on the soccer field in front of the local police station and army command center to demand justice.
They had hunting bows with them for parties, and they started to perform the traditional waita dance of the Papuan Mee Pago tribe, which involves dancing in a circle and imitating birdsong.
Some of the protesters started stoning police and army buildings.
As the atmosphere heated up, the soldiers received an order over the internal radio system: &quot;If the crowd resists more than three times, shoot them dead.&quot; The information is based on an official document seen by TIME magazine, which has not been released to local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, resident leader of the Kego Koto area, foresaw the situation getting out of hand and asked the crowd to calm down and return to their homes.
No one wanted to listen anymore.
&quot;When I turned around, I was shot in the left wrist,&quot; he told TIME magazine on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn&#39;t know who shot him, but the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers.
&quot;Several shots were fired in the crowd.&quot;
Alfius Youwi was shot three times. His cousin saw the shootings.
&quot;I ran to him and made sure that it was really him,&quot; Yohanes told TIME magazine sadly. Like many Indonesians, he only uses one name.
&quot;I saw that he was dead... I kissed him.&quot;
Papua Inspector General of Police Yotje Mende told reporters that officers were only &quot;protecting&quot; the police station because it was under attack.
&quot;We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us,&quot; Papuan police spokesman Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015.
&quot;Then it&#39;s a matter of life and death.&quot;
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many were injured.
News of the deaths reached Jakarta the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave an emotional speech in Jayapura, in which he expressed his condolences to the families of the victims and promised that the violence in Papua would be addressed.
&quot;I want the case to be investigated immediately so that it never happens again.&quot;
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he would initiate investigations into human rights violations outside the legal system.
However, he immediately began to retract his words.
&quot;Most of the violations happened a long time ago,
In the 1990s and early 2000s.
The important thing is that we have decided to investigate the violations, but certain processes are needed for that,‚Äù he said.
In an interview with TIME magazine in Jakarta on June 5, 2017, Wiranto had already changed his mind. He said he did not intend to start investigations in Papua.
&quot;Everything will be settled in court,&quot; he said.
The UN accuses Wiranto of &quot;crimes against humanity&quot;. The crimes are related to the death of more than a thousand people in East Timor&#39;s bloody independence referendum in 1999. Wiranto told TIME magazine that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have already been investigated, including the events in Paniai.
The families of Paniai&#39;s victims react to the claims with dark disbelief.
&quot;I have been interviewed four times in the last three years, but things have not progressed in any way,&quot; says Yohanes.
&quot;I&#39;m already tired of this.&quot;
He says that he still lives in fear, even though it has been years since the incident.
&quot;Yes, I&#39;m afraid,&quot; he says.
&quot;I&#39;m afraid the army will arrest me. I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ll be shot.&quot;
His brother Yacobus confirms that the Panianians do not dare to discuss the event.
He says that the soldiers had abused him when he had helped bury four of the victims.
&quot;Soldiers searched for me after burying the victims,&quot; he says.
The shootings have not stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers in Paniai&#39;s neighboring district of Deiyai.
One person died and 17 were injured in a clash between villagers and the manager of a construction company, which started when the manager refused to take an unconscious man to the hospital. Children were also among the injured.
The man who needed hospital treatment was 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who had fallen into the water while fishing in a nearby river. He died on the way to the hospital.
Angry villagers demonstrated at the construction site in front of the company&#39;s office.
According to the police, the villagers pelted stones at the policemen, who responded with warning shots.
According to locals, however, a mobile police unit of the Indonesian paramilitary police opened fire on the crowd, killing one villager.
&quot;We are terrified. We fear retaliation,&quot; says 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and saw the wounded being brought in for treatment.
&quot;I&#39;ve been hiding at home for two days.&quot;
Deiyai&#39;s parliament has demanded that the policemen who fired the shots be held accountable and that the mobile police unit be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a problem point for the Indonesian government.
The lack of real development is fueling discontent among the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes who live in Papua&#39;s lush central highlands.
Many have joined the Liberation Papua Movement (OPM), a rebel army that claims to defend the rights of Papuans through sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian army soldiers.
Some of OPM&#39;s leaders are from Pania, such as Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
The army has responded to the rebellion by arbitrarily arresting and imprisoning thousands of people in Paniai in the name of &quot;safeguarding national sovereignty&quot;.
Some of those arrested never return.
Among Papuans, Paniai is known as a &quot;sad, forgotten place&quot;.
Poverty breeds discontent.
There is little rice for sale in Enarotali, and even that is too expensive for the locals,
like bread.
People grow their own food: mainly sweet potatoes and some fruits and leafy vegetables.
Farming is women&#39;s work, and one woman can be responsible for four or five sweet potato fields.
Most of the harvest is for the family, and the rest is sold at the market.
Ten sweet potatoes cost just 10,000 rupees (75 cents).
Over time, the differences in the livelihoods of locals and migrants have grown, and the number of migrants has increased since new routes to Nabire Airport were opened.
Jobs are few, and they usually go to immigrants who are better educated and wealthier than the locals.
Only a few Papuans have enough capital and know-how to run their own company competitively.
&quot;Young people don&#39;t want to stay in the village because there is no work or money here,&quot; says John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai Tribal Council.
Remote Papua gets little attention in the world.
In addition, restrictions on international reporting are still strict.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua despite being granted a rare filming permit. The official reason was the inability to cooperate with local institutions.
According to Phelim Kinen, deputy director for Asia at Human Rights Watch, Jokowi has not kept his election promises. He has not increased transparency or promoted development by removing restrictions on reporting.
&quot;Journalists reporting from Indonesia&#39;s troubled easternmost provinces of Papua and West Papua face new risks: visa denial and blacklisting,&quot; Kine said in a statement.
The lack of press freedom means that the Indonesian government is only pressured by Papua&#39;s immediate neighbors.
In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate Papua&#39;s &quot;numerous and widespread violations&quot;, including the Paniai shooting scene.
These countries have also traditionally supported the Papuan liberation movement.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir denied the accusations and told reporters in Jakarta that &quot;Indonesia is still a democracy with freedom of the press, so covering up evidence of human rights violations would be difficult.&quot;
Locals want foreign governments to intervene.
When the official Dutch delegation led by Human Rights Ambassador Kees Van Baar visited Jayapura on May 4, 2017, the locals broke their silence and expressed their desire for freedom, says a source who participated in the meeting and remains anonymous.
There are presidential elections in Indonesia in 2019, but Papuans say that they are not likely to vote for Jokowi anymore.
&quot;Jokowi means well, but there are people around him who are involved in the shooting scene in Paniai,&quot; says Gobai, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know the situation of the people of Pania: they live under the rule of a greedy and unpredictable army in want and poverty, practically without health care services and educational opportunities.
According to Gobai, the people of Pania, like other Papuans, consider their votes for Jokowi a &quot;debt&quot; that must be repaid.
‚ÄúThey don&#39;t want money. They just want justice,‚Äù he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Paniai shooting scene once again showed their resistance in a symbolic way: they buried one of the victims on the land opposite the police station and the army post.
They know they may never get justice, but at least they won&#39;t let those responsible forget their crimes.
&quot;My family members were killed,&quot; Yacobus says with his head down.
&quot;What else could we do?&quot;
Dereck Chisora barks about the cancellation of the Robert Helenius rematch: &quot;Even their own fans don&#39;t want to see&quot;
Heavyweight boxers Robert Helenius and Dereck Chisora were scheduled to fight on May 27 at the Hartwall Arena.
However, the match was canceled due to commercial reasons.
In a recent interview with IFL TV, Chisora places the reason for the flopping of the rematch entirely on Helenius&#39; shoulders.
My match in Finland flopped, but it wasn&#39;t my fault.
I don&#39;t live in Finland, I don&#39;t want to sell tickets there.
The reason was my Finnish opponent.
Even his fans don&#39;t want to see him fight because he&#39;s miserable, chides Chisora.
Helenius and Chisora met for the first time in a packed Hartwall Arena in December 2011.
Helenius won the match with a controversial points decision.
Ticket sales for the rematch were slow, and its promoter Nisse Sauerland told Ilta-Sanom in May that the match has been moved to autumn.
Nothing new has been heard about the match.
However, the cancellation no longer upsets Chisora.
The match probably would have had to be canceled anyway after Chisora got sick.
On Thursday, three days before the match, I woke up in severe pain.
My hernia was about to explode.
The hospital said I had to be operated on, Chisora says.
Britti says that he is currently about 45% in shape.
Judging by everything, he is not interested in a rematch with Helenius, but Dillian Whyte is in his sights.
Chisora suffered a unanimous decision loss to Whyte in December.
Fire once again engulfed the Torch skyscraper in Dubai
Flames engulfed one of the world&#39;s tallest residential buildings in Dubai on Friday. Hundreds of residents had to flee from the 337-meter-high, 79-story building.
This was already the second fire in two years in the building, which happens to be called Torch.
The building was evacuated and no one is known to have been injured. There was no idea about the cause of the fire immediately after the incident.
&quot;We were sleeping and woke up to the sound of the fire alarm and people&#39;s screams.
We ran down the stairs from the 50th floor, which took ten minutes,&quot; a resident named George told Reuters.
According to Dubai rescue authorities, the fire brigade was able to put out the fire at 4 am local time and stayed to cool the building.
The government announced that it would arrange accommodation for those who left their homes.
The case may raise questions again about the safety of materials used on the exterior surfaces of tall buildings around the world.
After the 2015 fire, the board of the Torch building conducted an investigation, which revealed that the boards used for facade cladding and insulation suffered the most damage.
In the UK, police believe insulation and cladding panels at London&#39;s Grenfell Tower may have contributed to the rapid spread of flames in a fire that killed 80 people in June.
A moped was stolen from the parking lot in Joensuu during the night
A moped was stolen from the Joensuulainen parking lot between 9 p.m. on Tuesday and 5 a.m. on Wednesday.
The moped disappeared from Niinivaara at Tikkam√§entie 2.
The moped was made by Sky Team Monkey.
Its color is red, and the registration number is 27-REV.
The moped was found later on Thursday.
The police is asking for observations about the moped or its hijacking by e-mail to This e-mail address is protected from spambots.

In the United States, more than 20 percent of air passengers take prohibited items on board, a survey reveals
A survey of airline passengers reveals that more than 20 percent of travelers in the United States had knowingly or unknowingly taken prohibited items onto planes past the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) checkpoints. At least six percent of passengers had knives or other sharp objects that they did not know were prohibited.
Less than one percent said they only found out later that they had mistakenly transported weapons, ammunition or explosives.
More than a thousand passengers answered the survey, and it was carried out by the charter airline Stratos Jet Charters. The results also reveal that young passengers are more likely to defy the rules than others.
Of the passengers who knowingly violated TSA rules, 19.7 percent were representatives of the Y generation and less than 15 percent belonged to the X generation.
The most common rules were broken by bringing food and liquids onto the plane.
More than three percent admitted to knowingly taking objects with a blade onto the plane. In addition, 2.2 percent of women and 3.7 percent of men said that they knowingly took prohibited medicinal substances on the plane.
Travelers from all over the United States took part in the survey. The company that carried out the survey wanted to find out how many people had accidentally taken contraband goods past the security check and how many had done so knowingly.
Not surprisingly, those who travel the most are also the most likely to take contraband goods past security ‚Äì knowingly or unknowingly.
But as the company that conducted the survey notes, TSA&#39;s instructions are quite complicated and confusing.
Passengers often do not know which liquids can be taken on the plane and how much.
So it&#39;s no surprise that the majority of TSA seizures are liquids.
For a while, there was also a belief that books were not allowed on the plane.
Liquids can be taken on domestic flights but not on international flights.
US Environmental Protection Agency Director Scott Pruitt reversed his decision to delay Obama-era decisions to reduce emissions
A day after 15 states sued EPA Director Scott Pruitt, Pruitt reversed his earlier decision to delay the implementation of smog-causing decisions made during the Obama administration.
According to Pruitt, the change shows that the agency he leads takes better account of the needs of state environmental decision-makers than previous administrations.
Pruitt made no mention of the lawsuit filed against his earlier decision in federal appeals court.
States should begin complying with the 2015 level of ground-level ozone on October 1. from
Pruitt announced in June that he would postpone the implementation of the decisions by a year to give his agency more time to study the plan because the agency &quot;does not want to interfere with local decision-making or hinder economic growth.&quot;
Pruitt was the attorney general of the state of Oklahoma before President Donald Trump appointed him to head the EPA. Pruitt is known as an opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since coming to Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly tried to block or delay the implementation of decisions opposed by the chemical and fossil fuel industries.
Wednesday&#39;s sudden change of heart is the latest setback to Pruitt&#39;s plan to loosen regulations.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the EPA director overstepped his authority in trying to delay implementation of the Obama administration&#39;s decision on oil and gas companies. The decision obliged the companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement Wednesday night, Pruitt argued that his reversal on the ozone regulations will only strengthen the EPA&#39;s cooperation with states in a complex process aimed at meeting the new requirements on schedule.
&quot;Under previous administrations, the EPA often failed to meet deadlines and then waited for activist groups and others to sue it in court to reach an agreement on the timelines,&quot; Pruitt said. In his previous position, he sued the Environmental Agency more than ten times.
&quot;We don&#39;t believe in regulation through lawsuits and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously the regulation concerning our operations and the powers it grants us.&quot;
However, the EPA statement said Pruitt can still use his &quot;authority to delay the implementation of the decisions, as well as his other statutory powers&quot; to ensure that the regulations &quot;are reasoned and based on the best available information.&quot;
Republicans are pushing for a broader overhaul of ozone regulations in Congress.
The aim of the legal initiative approved last month is to delay the implementation of the 2015 decisions by at least eight years.
The proposal has not yet been voted on in the Senate.
New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states suing the EPA this week, said the group plans to keep up the pressure.
&quot;The EPA&#39;s change of heart as a result of our lawsuits is a significant victory for the 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans who are exposed to the direct effects of smog in their communities,&quot; Schneiderman said.
In addition to New York, the suit included California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and the District of Columbia.
Ground-level ozone is created when, for example, emissions from cars, power plants, oil refineries and chemical plants react with sunlight in the atmosphere.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems for sensitized groups of people. It also contributes to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health promoters and environmentalists rejoiced at Pruitt&#39;s surprising change of direction.
&quot;It&#39;s disturbing how much pressure it took to get the guy responsible for our breathing air to use common sense,&quot; says Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
&quot;We still have to fight against the Trump administration, because its ideological goal is to act on the terms of polluters and other self-interested groups.&quot;
An SUV coming from the supercar manufacturer - &quot;happening in the style of Ferrari&quot;
It also plans to invest in hybrid sports cars as well, as it seeks to hold on to its exclusive status.
That will probably happen, but it will happen in Ferrari style, CEO Sergio Marchionne said of the plans at a press conference on Wednesday.
The details of the new strategy will be revealed next year, when the Italian supercar manufacturer presents its new five-year plan, Automotive News reports.
All measles cases in It√§-Savo have the same virus type
The measles infection in Rantasalmi is of the same type of virus as the previous cases in It√§-Savo, informs THL.
The virology laboratory of the Institute of Health and Welfare has confirmed on Thursday that the fifth measles infection in It√§-Savo is the same virus strain as the previous infections.
THL has confirmed that the confirmed measles infection in a person from Rantasalmi on Friday, July 28, is of the same type of virus as the previous cases in It√§-Savo.
Based on this information, all the infections found in It√§-Savo are related to the first measles found in the region in June.
The news is good because it means that we have not had any other types of measles virus emerge.
However, it is possible that after the fifth patient, new infections may appear until mid-August, and the epidemic is therefore not over yet, says Mirkaleena Erkkil√§, the doctor responsible for infectious diseases at Soster&#39;s primary care.
No new measles infections or suspected cases have been reported since the fifth confirmed case.
However, it is still important that everyone takes care of their own vaccination coverage, reminds Erkkil√§.
More on the topic: Three new measles infections were confirmed in Pirkanmaa - &quot;Additional infections or epidemic very unlikely&quot;
Finland is preparing for the authorized production of kilju
Pontika&#39;s soup was not even considered to be legalized.
In the background, the argument is that the process produces methanol, which is toxic, along with alcohol.
Making kilju at home will be legal next year, but legalizing pontika soup is not even considered.
Kilju is made by fermentation, while pontikka is made by distillation.
The reason behind the regulation of distillation is that the process produces methanol, which is toxic, along with alcohol.
There has been no visible political will to enact pontika soup as a right for every man, comments government adviser Ismo Tuominen from the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
When the ministry was preparing the reform of the alcohol law, pontika distillation was not considered to be legalized.
The matter was not brought to the political table either.
There was no discussion about the liberalization of distillation, says MP Outi M√§kel√§ (council).
He is in the negotiating group of the parliamentary groups of the governing parties, which took a position on the reform of the alcohol law.
In the future, permission to distill pontika at home cannot be granted even on application.
Commercial manufacturing will also remain subject to a permit.
Tuominen says that there will be a simple rule for the home production of alcoholic beverages: alcohol can be made at home by fermentation.
This means that now, in addition to beer, cider and wine, you can also legally make kilju at home.
The government has wanted to simplify the regulations.
The new law removes the requirements for flavors and aromas and enables the production of kilu, M√§kel√§ elaborates.
The preparation must still take place in such a way that the raw materials or the flavors and aromas created during their fermentation are clearly noticeable in the drink.
According to the new law, you can make as many drinks as you want, and you can give homemade alcohol as a gift.
It is still not allowed to be put up for sale.
Screaming is no longer a public health problem in Finland, Tuominen believes.
A much bigger change took place in 2004, when passenger imports from Estonia and other EU countries were liberalized.
75 percent of the alcohol used in Finland is imported from Estonia.
The draft alcohol bill is now under review by the Ministry of Justice.
The alcohol law will be considered by the parliament as soon as the autumn term begins.
The plenary session is on 5.9.
The law will enter into force at the beginning of 2018.
The law is well prepared.
It&#39;s as if the parliament has already taken a stand, M√§kel√§ is happy.
Oscar Pistorius was rushed to the hospital, escorted by armed guards
Oscar Pistorius, who suffered from chest pains, was rushed to a South African hospital due to suspected heart attacks.
Pistorius has already been released from the hospital.
Oscar Pistorius is serving his prison sentence in Atteridgeville Prison.
According to the British Mirror magazine, Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital this morning, escorted by armed guards.
Pistorius suffered from chest pains, but was released from the hospital in the afternoon.
A prison spokesman confirmed that Pistorius was taken to hospital for tests.
The spokesman for the Pistorius family said that the former top athlete is fine.
Last summer, the Supreme Court sentenced the six-time Paralympic gold medalist to six years in prison for the murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp.
Pistorius shot Steenkamp in February 2013.
Transcribed phone conversations reveal that Trump pressured Mexico to build a border wall
Transcripts of phone conversations between US President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia have been leaked to the Washington Post.
In a phone call on January 27, 2017, Trump urged Mexican President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto to stop making public statements about not paying for the proposed border wall.
The US president scolded Nieto for publicly rejecting the wall project. &quot;You can&#39;t say that to the press,&quot; Trump said.
Trump launched his presidential campaign by promising to build a wall on the southern border of the United States at the expense of Mexico.
The Washington Post also published a transcript of Trump&#39;s first call to Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. There was a tense exchange of words during the call.
Mr Trump told Mr Turnbull the deal to see the US take in refugees heading to Australia was &quot;ridiculous&quot;, &quot;miserable&quot; and &quot;stupid&quot;. According to Trump, the agreement negotiated during the Obama era would make him look like an &quot;idiot&quot; because he had proposed a ban on the settlement of refugees in the United States.
Trump ended the call by telling Turnbull that &quot;this was the most unpleasant call of the day.&quot;
Georgia massacre: Activists re-enact racist lynching in hope of justice
A Ford Mercury car passes the crowd in the small town of Monroe in rural Georgia and continues its journey towards the small Moore&#39;s Ford bridge.
There are four black passengers and a white driver in the car. Four armed men block the road before the car reaches the bridge.
The leader of the group, a middle-aged man in a striped suit, takes a deep breath from his cigar and peers through the windshield.
Passengers are scared.
&quot;Roger, f---u!&quot; the man is full of shit.
&quot;Get out of the car!&quot;
Screams break the silence as a young black man is pulled from the front seat.
Fortunately, this shocking event is only a re-enactment, which was shown on July 22, 2017.
However, the gasps of shock are genuine when the noose is strung around &quot;Roger&#39;s&quot; neck.
Since 2005, human rights organizations have returned to Moore&#39;s Ford Bridge to re-enact the events of 1946. At that time, two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey, were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan.
No one has been charged with the murders.
&quot;It&#39;s baffling that no one has been arrested all these years - even though the killers live among us and many need to know who they are,&quot; says Tyrone Brooks, who is helping organize the re-enactment.
&quot;It is a disgrace to history, but above all it is a burden that weighs on our souls.&quot;
Brooks is a 71-year-old civil rights activist and former Georgia congressman.
For him, the re-staging is a startling call to action. It also reminds the people of Monroe that wrongs have never been righted.
&quot;We want the culprits to be brought to justice. We want things to finally come to an end, and we want to heal and reconcile, but most of all, we want justice,‚Äù says Brooks.
&quot;We cannot recover and reconcile until we get justice.&quot;
A coroner covers the body of a victim who died in the Georgia massacre on 27 July 1946.
According to FBI documents obtained by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties were suspected in the lynching.
However, no one was charged with the murder.
Although the perpetrators have been free for decades, according to activists, the motives of the lynching have been known to the locals all along: politics and sex.
In 1946, blacks in the state of Georgia were allowed to vote in presidential elections for the first time by a Supreme Court ruling. The Supreme Court issued its decision in April, and elections were held in the summer.
According to the FBI, there was an incident around the time of the election in which a black tenant farmer, Roger Malcom, stabbed a white landowner, Barnett Hester, in a fight that apparently involved Malcom&#39;s wife, Dorothy.
According to Brooks, it was rumored in town that Hester had had an affair with Dorothy and that Dorothy was expecting a child by him.
According to the FBI, on July 25, 1946, influential white landowner Loy Harrison paid Malcom&#39;s $600 bail, in exchange for which he was released from prison.
On the way home Malcom and Dorothy were accompanied by their cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
A mob stopped their car before Moore&#39;s Ford Bridge.
&quot;It has emerged that Harrison ordered and orchestrated the murders,&quot; the FBI report states.
‚ÄúIt is also apparent that there was collusion between state and local authorities. The authorities were complicit in the murders and destroyed the evidence and did not reveal the identity of the witnesses.&quot;
Brooks puts it more succinctly.
&quot;It was suffrage murder,&quot; he says.
&quot;They were murdered because they wanted to send a message to black people that the same thing will happen to them if they intend to vote.&quot;
Cassandra Greene has been directing re-enactments of the Georgia massacre for nearly a decade.
The show is extremely realistic and captivating. It is a description of the shocking racism that many would like to believe has already disappeared from today&#39;s United States.
It&#39;s hard to watch the show, but even harder not to watch it, which according to Greene is the point.
&quot;We don&#39;t want to talk about lynching because we would have to face our own dark sides,&quot; says the director.
&quot;But I can&#39;t have a relationship with you if you don&#39;t hear me or don&#39;t want to hear what I&#39;ve been through.&quot;
Rehearsals for this year&#39;s show began in June. On the first day, about 30 actors ‚Äì a dozen black and twenty white ‚Äì gathered to listen to Greene&#39;s routine summary of the performance.
Wade Marbaugh serves as Greene&#39;s assistant director.
He has played the local Ku Klux Klan leader in a re-enactment for years, but the role is always as difficult and repulsive.
&quot;I feel dirty because I&#39;m not myself,&quot; Marbaugh says.
&quot;However, it is important that this side of history is kept on display so that it never happens again.&quot;
On the other side of the room, Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, aka Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, practice their turns.
The show opens with a scene where Malcom is yelling and shoving Hester. He is furious that Hester has had an affair with Dorothy.
‚ÄúDidn&#39;t you hear? I said get off my land, n---u!‚Äù
Rascona, or Hester, answers.
Then the punch goes off.
And then everyone (at least all the black actors) burst out laughing.
Greene laughs the loudest.
&quot;What?!&quot; Rascona asks.
He is embarrassed.
&quot;Did I hit too hard by accident?&quot; He asks.
&quot;You don&#39;t,&quot; Greene insists.
&quot;I just don&#39;t think white people used the word n---u back then.&quot;
&quot;That&#39;s right,&quot; confirms another black actor.
‚ÄúIt&#39;s slang. You must use the longer version.‚Äù
The topic of the show is unpleasant, but the room is filled with camaraderie.
Everyone wants to succeed, and not just for the show. They want to honor the memory of those who were killed.
The scene starts over.
Now Rascona&#39;s words are sarcastic.
Nobody&#39;s laughing.
The reenactment ends quickly and violently.
Screams, gunshots ‚Äì and silence.
A woman dressed in a black funeral outfit stands next to the corpses and sings Billie Holiday&#39;s Strange Fruit.
His voice breaks with every other word.
A few ten meters away, fifty spectators are wiping sweat and tears from their eyes.
Almost exactly half of the audience is black and half is white.
There is a couple who have come to see the show from Ithaca, New York, but most are locals.
Guided by Brooks, they have visited the graves of the victims in the oppressive humidity of Georgia.
The murders have turned from fiction to reality. The atmosphere at the venue is heavy.
After the song, Greene invites the crowd to inspect the bodies.
Children crouch down to look at fake blood and motionless bodies and whisper to each other.
&quot;They&#39;re not really dead,&quot; the little boy mutters as if to remind himself.
After a few minutes, Greene thanks the crowd.
The Actors who played the lynchers take off their cloaks and wipe away tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man who played the local Ku Klux Klan leader.
Nick Rascona hugs two actors and then breaks down in tears after a tough performance.
&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; comforts the woman who participated in the show.
‚ÄúWe know you&#39;re not him.
You did this for a good reason.‚Äù
Later, the audience and the Actors gather for a joint dinner.
The white couple who arrived from Altanta are talking animatedly about the show with the black couple they just met.
Denise Duplinski finds it difficult to find words when she describes the feelings evoked by the performance.
‚ÄúIt&#39;s hard to listen to horrible words and watch horrible things being said and done by people who look like you ‚Äî just because they look like you,‚Äù she says.
&quot;The show made me realize that lynchings still happen,&quot; he added. &quot;They&#39;re just called arrests.&quot;
Across the room, Brooks recounts the evolution of civil rights to listeners sitting at the same table.
He says that he has already started planning next year&#39;s show.
‚ÄúReenacting is a powerful experience because it depicts the horrors we experienced, but it&#39;s also a learning experience,‚Äù says Brooks.
‚ÄúIts message is that this can happen again if we don&#39;t learn from it.
Those who do not know their history are doomed to repeat it.‚Äù
Hanging plants in stores is annoying: This is how much you really save by removing &quot;extra parts&quot;.
Is it allowed to remove the cauliflower leaves in the store before weighing?
How about removing the big hat part from the pineapple - it weighs no matter how much?
The answers divide opinions strongly: for some, it&#39;s a sign of extreme snobbery, while others don&#39;t want to pay for the parts of the vegetables that they don&#39;t use and that nevertheless end up in the trash at home.
The phenomenon is recognized in stores.
For example, in the vegetable department of K-Citymarket in Ruoholahti, Helsinki, you can find cardboard boxes, because many people tear off the leafy parts of, for example, cauliflower.
From the box, the leaves are taken to the store&#39;s bio waste.
According to the news published by Taloussanomit, shopkeepers are surprised by sniffing at the vegetable counter.
But how much does removing excess parts of vegetables before weighing really save you money?
How significant a sniffing device is it really?
Me Naiset tested how the price changes when you remove the leaves or stems from pineapple, artichoke, champignons, broccoli and cauliflower.
Cauliflower: Cauliflower, which cost 2.10 euros, became 1.80 euros when I peeled off all the leaves.
Pineapple: The price of a whole pineapple costing 2.30 euros dropped to 1.95 euros when the stem was removed.
Latva artichoke: the price of 2.60 euros became 2.40 euros when Lyhyk√§inen&#39;s stock was cut off.
Mushrooms: Two mushrooms cost a total of 75 cents.
Without the stumps, the price was 60 cents.
Broccoli: A medium-sized broccoli cost 1 euro and 80 cents without the stem.
The end result: If leaves and stems start to be pulled off, you save a few tens of cents for one vegetable at best.
Thinking about it as a percentage, the price of the vegetable fell by up to 20 percent.
So you would have saved a total of 1.20 euros from these purchases!
Neymar was bought out of Barcelona - the brass star signed a five-year contract with PSG
The Brazilian star Neymar has signed a five-year contract with the French football club PSG, reports news agency AFP.
Earlier on Thursday evening, it was reported that Neymar&#39;s representatives had paid a buyout price of 222 million euros to FC Barcelona, which plays in the Spanish soccer league.
The whopping transfer amount of 222 million euros is the largest in football history.
Previously, the record was held by Manchester United, who paid 105 million euros for Frenchman Paul Pogba last summer.
The Spanish league stalled the move earlier on Thursday after rejecting the first payment attempt by Neymar&#39;s representatives.
According to the league&#39;s rules, the buying club cannot pay the buyout price directly to the seller, but the player must buy out his contract himself, which is done by circulating the money through the league.
In practice, PSG has paid the amount to Neymar and his representatives, who delivered the money through the league to Barcelona.
Neymar is believed to arrive in Paris on Friday.
He will potentially be introduced to a new home crowd in PSG&#39;s season opener against Amiens on Saturday.
Uefa is looking into the details
In addition, Barcelona said in its announcement that it will provide the information about the payment to UEFA, so that the association can determine the disciplinary measures that may result from the case.
Among other things, the president of the Spanish league, Javier Tebas, has suspected that PSG is violating UEFA&#39;s rules of financial fair play with their money.
Uefa can punish a club that makes a loss of more than 30 million euros over a three-year period.
According to UEFA, Neymar&#39;s transfer does not automatically violate its financial clauses.
Neymar&#39;s transfer to PSG will affect the club&#39;s finances for several years, but the impact cannot be estimated in advance.
For example, PSG may sell several players for considerable sums, Uefa was informed.
PSG is owned by the state-owned Qatari company Qatar Sports Investment.
The chairman of the club is former tennis professional, Qatari Nasser al-Khelaifi.

Austin, 21, suffered severe burns from a lightning strike - the flash was caught on an airport security camera
Austin Dunn was doing routine work procedures on the plane at the Southwest Florida International Airport with a couple of coworkers when suddenly the plane was struck by lightning from a rainy sky.
The force of the lightning threw Dunn, who was near the plane&#39;s wing, to the ground.
Dunn was rushed to the hospital.
He had third degree burns all over his body.
My father called me and said that my brother was electrocuted and he is in the hospital.
I just asked if he was alive, Austin&#39;s sister Autumn says.
Austin spent two weeks in the hospital.
In addition to the burns, he had muscle damage and brain bleeding.
The experience was tough for the whole family.
Can&#39;t wait for that.
It&#39;s traumatizing for everyone, Autumn says.
According to the airport&#39;s representative, the lightning risk warning system was on at the time of the incident, and Kuljetusliike itself decides whether to comply with it.
Pearson cuts 3,000 jobs and revives business by cutting dividend
British education group Pearson said on Friday it would cut 3,000 jobs and cut its dividend by 72 percent as it embarked on a new restructuring program in response to pressures on its business.
According to CEO John Fallon, the job cuts will mainly be made at the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019. The company already reduced 4,000 jobs in connection with the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced another ¬£300m cut in costs in May as part of its third austerity program aimed at reviving a business weakened by rapid digitalisation.
Last month, Pearson decided to sell its stake in the Penguin Random House publishing house to its partner Bertelsmann. The company announced that it would keep its outlook for the current year unchanged. Its turnover in the first half of the year increased by one percent and was 2.05 billion pounds.
Attack on a convoy in Kabul: A NATO soldier died in a suicide attack
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan. According to the authorities, a NATO soldier was killed in the attack and several others were wounded.
According to NATO&#39;s statement, five soldiers and an interpreter were injured in the attack.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians were also killed in the attack in Kabul&#39;s Qarabagh district.
The blast is the latest violent attack in Afghanistan this month. On Tuesday, 30 people were killed in an explosion at a mosque in Herat.
On Monday, two people were killed in an attack by a suicide bomber at the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
According to NATO&#39;s statement, Thursday evening&#39;s explosion happened when a joint patrol of NATO and the Afghan army came under attack by an &quot;improvised explosive device carried by a person&quot;.
The statement said that all the injured were in stable condition and were being treated at the US military hospital at Bagram Airfield.
Correspondents say the strengthening of the Taliban and the presence of the ISIS terrorist organization in Qarabagh are major concerns for NATO forces near Bagram.
According to the UN, at least 1,662 civilians were killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, 20 percent of them in the capital.
At the end of July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in a suicide attack in Kabul, an area predominantly inhabited by Shiite Muslims.
The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack.
On the last day of May, more than 150 people were killed in a bombing in central Kabul, the country&#39;s deadliest attack by a militant group since US-led forces ousted the Taliban in 2001.
The violence underscores Afghanistan&#39;s volatile situation as President Donald Trump considers whether the United States will send more troops to the country to help the local army and police.
According to correspondents, the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also significantly weakened people&#39;s confidence in the government, its policies, and especially in President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA reverses decision to delay enforcement of smog regulations
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reversed its decision to delay the implementation of Obama-era decisions to reduce smog-causing emissions, a day after 15 states sued the agency.
The EPA announced its decision to implement the 2015 so-called &quot;ozone specifications&quot; late Wednesday. According to the agency, the decision is an indication of its commitment to cooperation with the states.
&quot;We believe in dialogue and we want to address the needs of states,&quot; Director Scott Pruitt said in a statement from the agency.
In June, Pruitt announced the agency&#39;s intention to delay the implementation of ozone standards by one year to October 2018. According to the standards, smog pollution will be measured in certain parts of the country to determine where pollution must be reduced to meet stricter air quality standards.
On Tuesday, 15 predominantly Democratic states, including the District of Columbia, sued the agency. According to them, the postponement of the execution was illegal.
President Donald Trump&#39;s administration has been looking for ways to ease environmental regulations from the Barack Obama era. According to Trump, the measures are part of a broader program aimed at economic growth.
Trump&#39;s measures have been opposed by Democrats and environmentalists who are concerned about the health effects of increased emissions.
According to the EPA&#39;s website, breathing ozone-containing air &quot;can impair lung function and increase respiratory symptoms,&quot; such as asthma.
According to the Sydney Morning Herald, a person belonging to the leadership of ISIS had also sent building parts for the bomb to Sydney.
According to the suspicions, the bomb was supposed to be put on the plane on July 15, but the attempt was stopped before the security check.
The police do not say in more detail why the attempt was stopped.
Another plan of the suspected terrorists was to build a device that emits a poisonous colorless gas and take the device to a crowded public place, such as public transportation.
Australian Assistant Federal Commissioner Michael Phelan says the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever carried out in Australia.
Due to suspected terrorist plans, four men were arrested in police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but he is also being questioned.
CEO of Neste: Renewable fuels did well
Oil refiner Neste&#39;s profit before taxes fell, but beat forecasts in the second quarter.
According to CEO Matti Lievonen, the company made a good result in oil products, the sales volumes of renewable products reached a record level, and the development of the Marketing &amp; Services segment&#39;s operating profit was in the right direction.
Last year, the comparable operating profit was improved by the US Blenders Tax Credit.
According to Lievonen, the operating profit of renewable products remained at a good level this year thanks to higher sales volumes and a more favorable market, even though the tax relief ended.
The implementation of our strategy is progressing well.
We will continue to focus on our customers and growth projects and we will complete the strategic investments we announced earlier in 2017, Lievonen said in the press release.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko discuss a possible match in their first meeting
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course for the most interesting boxing match of the near future in the under-66.7-kilogram division, met each other for the first time on Thursday.
The men were in their own rooms at the ESPN sports network&#39;s Los Angeles offices until undefeated WBC lightweight champion Mikey Garcia walked down the aisle to greet Lomachenko, the WBO featherweight champion.
Garcia defeated former four-weight world champion Adrien Broner by unanimous decision on Showtime on Saturday. Since then, Garcia and Lomachenko have been in the top five on a list comparing boxers of different weight classes.
Garcia extended his right hand and asked, ‚ÄúHow are you, Master?
Good luck for the match!‚Äù
Lomachenko defends his title against Miguel Marriaga on ESPN at 7 on Saturday.
As the two posed for photographers, Lomatchenko&#39;s manager Egis Klimas remarked that the match between the men would be &quot;perfect in terms of sizes.&quot;
&quot;I&#39;m a former featherweight,&quot; Garcia reminded.
‚ÄúI moved up [63.5kg] for Broner, but I&#39;m not that big.
I am petite at 63.5 kg.
I want to go back to lightweight.
He has to move up to lightweight [61.2 kilos]. Then we can take it.
That&#39;s what our fans want.
Let&#39;s fulfill their wishes.&quot;
Lomatchenko agreed.
&quot;Boxing needs this match.&quot;
Klimas asked if the match should be organized on a pay channel. It&#39;s part of his strategy for Lomachenko, who will make his lightweight debut later this year and face Garcia (37-0, 30 KOs) next summer. Garcia would also be interested in facing the winner of the match between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell. Linares and Campbell will fight in the lightweight division at the Forum on September 23.
&quot;The fight could be on pay-per-view because the fans have been asking for it,&quot; Garcia said, later stating that he would be willing to fight on the channel that offers the best prize package.
&quot;We are the most interesting names.
No one else gets as much attention.
I&#39;m fine as soon as we reach an agreement...‚Äù
Garcia said he appreciates Lomachenko as an &quot;unbelievable fighter&quot; and may be planning to go see Saturday&#39;s match.
Lomatchenko cut short Garcia&#39;s praise, saying the three-weight champion from Riverside looked ‚Äúreally slow. Sorry Mike...but you needed that knock out‚Äù.
Garcia said he focused first on showing striking power and then on boxing.
The men said they felt that the match between them wanted to be realized more and more strongly.
&quot;This is the match that is expected.
No other match attracts as much attention and interest.
I&#39;m definitely on board with this,‚Äù Garcia said.
Lomachenko said he expected to fight the best. ‚ÄúMikey is a legend.
It will be a great match.‚Äù
Average salary 5,300 euros, education whatever - the investment advice situation was &quot;wild and free&quot;
The quality of investment advice has been talking a lot lately.
Most recently, Helsingin Sanomat told about Ritva, 68, to whom the banker&#39;s investment advisor talked a lot while selling investment products.
The rules regarding investment advisors and the sale of various investment products will be tightened at the beginning of next year.
The strictures are based on the new financial market directive, which will be applied from the beginning of next year.
Currently, the evaluation of the skills of investment advisors and employees selling investment products is mainly based on self-regulation.
The law does not specify competence requirements.
The Financial Industry (FA) itself recommends that those working in the investment service complete its own APV1 or APV2 degree.
The financial industry has authorized the organization of the degrees to a company called APV-sijoitust√§g√§ut Oy, whose degree working group includes experts from the Financial Supervisory Authority (Fiva), universities and industry players.
The degrees are 12-15 credits in length, and their exams are prepared by Aalto EE, i.e. Aalto University Executive Education Oy, which offers business management development services.
Its website states that, in general, both exams are &quot;quite extensive in terms of requirements&quot;.
The learning material for the degrees includes 10-15 books and numerous other guides and works.
Markku Savikko, the CEO of APV-sijoitust√§g√§ut Oy, says that the passing percentage of the exams is roughly estimated to be around 70.
Of the personnel of the largest banks, almost all who provide investment services have completed either the APV1 or APV2 degree, as their completion is mandatory according to the companies&#39; own rules.
Then there are smaller banking firms, without mentioning names, whose personnel seem to have shied away from completing degrees, says Savikko.
According to him, there are &quot;a few&quot; such bankers.
According to Saviko, 13,000-14,000 people have completed the APV1 degree since 2000, and about 3,000 people have completed the more demanding APV2 degrees recommended for investment advisors.
Some banking firms consider having a degree as an advantage.
Several other industries have significantly stricter competence requirements.
Savikko says that the Financial Industry&#39;s recommendation requires the completion of APV degrees, because then the expertise related to the investment industry is ensured.
According to Statistics Finland, financial and investment advisors earn several thousand euros per month on average, including commissions, fringe benefits and performance bonuses.
The average salary for regular working hours of monthly workers is around 5,300 euros.
On average, men working in these positions earn more than 5,900 euros per month, and women earn more than 4,500 euros, respectively.
The top ten earners earn around 8,100 euros on average.
One tenth of the highest earning men earn more than 9,000 euros per month or more, one tenth of the highest earning women earn 6,400 euros or more.
Investment advice according to the Investment Services Act can only be provided by a licensed company.
Until now, self-regulation has been relied on at the employee and task level.
According to Fiva, in its inspection, individual cases were encountered where the investment adviser&#39;s professionalism and qualifications were not sufficient based on the adviser&#39;s activities.
In principle, you can also work as a seller of investment products, even if your skills and qualifications are at a poor level.
Basically, in this respect, the situation has been wild and free.
Several other industries have significantly stricter skill requirements, Savikko states.
According to Saviko, from the beginning of next year, this will be tightened with the new financial market directive (MiFID II).
It requires that each company is responsible for ensuring that the personnel providing investment services are sufficiently competent.
The Financial Supervisory Authority, on the other hand, gets the authority to determine what needs to be done.
Fiva&#39;s market supervisor Marko Hovi says that one of the clear changes to the current one is the regulation on the requirements for the skills and experience of investment advisors and sellers of investment products.
According to Hovi, the new requirements apply to both investment companies&#39; own staff and tied agents who sell products on behalf of a company.
Hovi says that according to the government&#39;s proposal given by the Ministry of Finance, Fiva will have the authority to determine competence and experience.
What exactly they are will probably be decided during the coming autumn.
The company must also in the future take care of the necessary training and, if necessary, follow-up and further training.
This must all be documented, and the company has an obligation to demonstrate that this has also been done.
Hovi clarifies that in practice the company must, for example, map the staff&#39;s job descriptions on an individual level.
There will certainly be different levels of requirements depending on whether it is investment advice or the sale of products.
According to Hovi, the requirement to work with someone more experienced for a certain period of time is also new, if the skills or experience are not at a sufficient level.
That is, if the company hires a new employee who does not quite meet the defined criteria, the employee must work for a certain period with a person who meets the criteria.
According to Hovi, with the change, the rules will become stricter and more specific.
The legislation regarding the sale of investment products will become stricter at the beginning of 2018.
Photo: The 787 Dreamliner passenger plane &quot;drawn&quot; a gigantic plane over the United States
The route flown by the plane was plotted over the United States in the Flightradar24 service.
The flight was carried out on Thursday with a 787 Dreamliner, with which Boeing tested the endurance of the aircraft&#39;s Rolls Royce engines on a long flight.
The plane, which left Seattle, flew 15,700 kilometers in 18 hours and 1 minute, which is longer than any regular commercial flight in use in the world.
The flight stayed within the borders of the United States the entire way.
It flew through a total of 17 states.
Imatra&#39;s persistent coastal swimming school students are not deterred by rain or scorching sun - Iines Kaikkonen Polski perseveres with the help of uimap√∂tkyl√§
Iines Kaikkonen advanced at a good pace, Taina Itkonen followed.
Imatra beach swimming schools are running in Liette and Lempuka this week and next week.
Even though sometimes it rains and then it shines again, the young swimmers are not in the mood, praises Taina Itkonen, head of swimming schools.
A total of 13 children will improve their swimming skills in this week&#39;s swimming schools, and a dozen next week.
The number of children for the coming week was influenced by the fact that school and summer school already start then, estimates Itkonen.
The Imatra beach swimming school is organized in cooperation with the Liikunta utsari project and the city of Imatra.
On Thursday, there was a nice atmosphere at Liette&#39;s beach.
The sun was shining and the young swimming school students were practicing staying on the surface with swim trunks, some even without.
The younger siblings also enjoyed themselves in the water.
Iines Kaikkosta, 5, first thought about going deeper into the water.
However, Taina Itkonen encouraged him to walk towards the shore.
It&#39;s going great!
Iines Kaikkonen said that he went swimming a lot this summer.
Liette&#39;s beach is good for him.
Like Iines Kaikkonen, Vili Huhtanen, 5, persistently practiced swimming with the swimming pool.
You too can be satisfied with today&#39;s achievements, the swimming teacher praised.
Jami Kallio, 4, sometimes wanted to go to water wars.
Ilona Villberg, who watched her daughter Anna Villberg, 6, swim from the beach, considers the beach swimming school a good start for learning to swim.
Even though the weather has been terrible, Anna has liked going here every day.
Sometimes you had to warm up.
The swimming school students packed up on the pier.
The boys had enough to do with the frog they found on the beach.
Milja Luukkonen, 3, and Anna Villberg spread towels on the pier, nibbled on fruit and basked in the sun.
The teaching continued already in the water, but there was no hurry on the pier.
The kind that doesn&#39;t belong in summer.
An unknown soldier sells toilet brushes - &quot;Here&#39;s a similar unifying story&quot;
You can see all kinds of it.
Sinituote, which manufactures cleaning products, launched the Unknown Soldier product line a couple of days ago.
That is, dish brushes and clothes racks - as well as a &quot;toilet brush with border brush&quot;.
The unknown soldier refers to the movie premiering in the fall and the marketing of the movie.
Still, there is something special in the combination, and the products have been mocked on social media: When will the Unknown sanitary napkins come?
I have to call the company and ask what this is all about.
What does Aino M√§√§tt√§, vice president of Sinituotte, say?
We are the film&#39;s partner.
We are supporting this movie, like many other companies.
We wanted to support domestic production and cult films, M√§√§tt√§ says.
According to him, the products will have a special display in stores, and the film will thus gain visibility.
Isn&#39;t there something a little funny about this - often when you think that products and the stories attached to them would have something in common?
Yes, there is such a unifying story here that we are a Finnish operator and these are Finnish products, M√§√§tt√§ says.
According to him, the company supports his same basic Finnish values, which are supported by those who have seen the old Unknown Soldier.
And cleaning is not foreign to army culture either, M√§√§tt√§ points out.
Other corporate partners of the Unknown Soldier film include Valio, Hartwall, Saludo, VR and Sato.
Until now, for example, Hartwall&#39;s vichys have been introduced to the market, which can be found under the names Rokka, Hietanen and Koskela.
Suomen Kuvalehti&#39;s blogger Kalle Kinnunen has already broken records of the Unknown products
Coffee and watches are already available.
Kinnunen points out that there is still time for the film&#39;s premiere, so there is still hope for a sequel.
Among the unknown&#39;s partners, Valio, Jalostaja, Neste and the German retail chain Lidl have not yet revealed their military products, Kinnunen writes.
The results of the new age tests for Swedish asylum seekers were announced
The latest results of medical age tests for asylum seekers in Sweden have been announced. The results of tests carried out using the new evaluation method reveal that more than 80 percent of those tested were determined to be over 18 years old. However, not everyone finds the tests reliable.
Sweden&#39;s National Office of Forensic Medicine began testing earlier this year.
With the tests, the asylum seeker&#39;s age can be assessed more precisely than before. The new test was introduced after the Swedish Immigration Service was criticized for failing to determine the true age of applicants who claimed to be minors.
The Finnish Immigration Service has carried out 6,880 tests so far, and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of 2,481 tests. The tests were conducted between mid-March and the end of July in 2017.
Of those tested, 80 percent, or 2002 asylum seekers, were determined to be over 18 years old. In addition, the Office of Forensic Medicine determined in 25 cases that the test subject was &quot;possibly 18 years of age or older&quot;.
In 432 cases, it was concluded that the asylum seeker is &quot;possibly under the age of 18&quot;.
Tests were only performed in cases where there was reason to doubt the age stated by the applicant.
Johan G√∂ransson from the Office of Forensic Medicine says that the results are consistent with the results of previous months.
&quot;The figures are quite consistent. There are no big differences from the previous months&#39; statistics,&quot; he told The Local magazine.
Although a large number of applicants were determined to be over 18 years of age, it does not necessarily mean that the applicants lied about their age.
In May, the agency released the results of 581 tests and announced that in 442 cases there were &quot;indications that the subject is 18 years of age or older.&quot;
When Svenska Dagbladet investigated the same results, it turned out that in 243 cases the applicant had openly said that he would turn 18 this year.
In the medical age assessment method used in the tests, x-rays are taken of the wisdom teeth and magnetic images of the knee joints. The images are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists. The method has also been criticized.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at the Karolinska Institutet, whose work includes assessing people&#39;s biological maturity. With the evaluation, it can be determined whether the person reached puberty earlier or later than usual.
&quot;I have had reason to think about it, and I am of the opinion that the method used is not the right one.
Determining biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can&#39;t determine the age with certainty, we shouldn&#39;t pretend we can,‚Äù he told the Metro newspaper.
However, G√∂ransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests: &quot;In general, you can say that the risk of determining a child as an adult is small.
The risk is greatest in a situation where the subject will soon turn 18. Then the risk is about 10 percent.&quot;
Ilonen fell 30 places in Scotland
A five-over-par result in the third round sent Mikko Ilonen down 30 places on the scoreboard in the European golf tour competition in Scotland.
Ilonen started on Saturday in the 11th place, but at the end of the round he found himself in the 41st place.
In the difficult weather, Ilose had three bogies followed by one double bogey.
Others had a hard time too.
Englishman Ian Poulter shared the top spot with a one-under-par round, although he said that holding the umbrella was a lot of work.
The weather was rough, but I hung in there and in the end it was a good day, Poulter said.
He shares the top spot with his compatriot Callum Shinkwini and Australian Andrew Dodt.
West Virginia&#39;s governor is switching parties
West Virginia Democratic Governor Jim Justice announced Thursday night at a Trump campaign event that he is switching parties.
&quot;The Democrats simply rejected me,&quot; Justice said.
&quot;Today, after much prayer and deep thought, I can tell you... Today I tell the people of West Virginia that I can no longer help you as a Democratic governor.&quot;
The audience burst into thunderous applause.
&quot;Tomorrow as a member of the registered Republican Party,&quot; Justice added.
&quot;As a coach, I would tell you that it&#39;s time for a new game.&quot;
Trump previously promised a major announcement at a campaign event in West Virginia.
Trump won in West Virginia by 42 points because Justice did not support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice was elected governor in 2016. According to Forbes, he is the only billionaire in his state.
He inherited his father&#39;s mining business and owns coal mines in five states.
His net worth is around $1.59 billion.
The Republican National Committee (RNC) released a statement Thursday night saying, &quot;Governor Justice&#39;s defection is yet another blow to a Democratic Party that would rather build obstacles than a better America.&quot;
‚ÄúDemocrats have only 15 governors and fewer states than ever before. In this context, Justice&#39;s announcement is the latest setback for a party that has no leadership whatsoever and is unable to find a positive, unifying message,&quot; RNC Representative Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
Lightning caused damage - Thursday is even becoming the most thunderous day of the summer
At the end of the week, there will be more thunderstorms in Southern Finland as well.
During the past week, there have been thunderstorms especially in the central and northern parts of the country and in the region of Finland proper.
During the night between Wednesday and Thursday, lightning strikes ignited several fires.
According to the meteorologist, Thursday may be the most thunderous day of the summer so far.
Thunderstorms have finally found Finland too.
During the past week, there has been lightning especially in the central and northern parts of the country and in the region of Finland proper.
At the table, lightning struck the townhouse&#39;s electrical switchboard, causing a small fire.
The rescue service received a report of the fire about a quarter to midnight on Wednesday.
The electricity center was located in the sauna area at the end of the terraced house.
The rescue service dismantled the roof and wall to find the fire and extinguished the fire with skill.
A total of eleven apartments were left without electricity, but personal injuries were avoided.
In Loimaa, on the other hand, lightning ignited an outbuilding in Harjulantie before midnight.
When the fire department arrived at the scene, the building was already in the full stage of fire, and the fire department could do nothing but prevent the fire from spreading.
The outbuilding, about fifty square meters in size, burned to the ground.
In R√§√§kkyl√§ in the direction of Kuopio, lightning struck a detached house again.
The residents of the house were outside the building and witnessed the blazing lightning strike.
The rescue service went to check the incident, but this time the lightning did not start a fire - only a few fuses blew.
In traffic, thunder caused problems on the train line between Sein√§joki and Vaasa, when a lightning strike damaged the traffic control system.
Information about the fault was received on Thursday morning between eight and nine, after which the trains in that interval were replaced by buses.
The problem was only fixed a little before five in the afternoon.
Since then, train traffic has been able to continue normally even on the section of track damaged by the thunderstorm.
Lightning has sown destruction in various parts of Finland.
However, there has been relatively little lightning this summer.
These summer thunderstorms have been absolutely miserable! assesses Jari Tuovinen, meteorologist on duty at the Finnish Meteorological Institute.
The thunderstorms on Wednesday and Thursday were mainly moderate in intensity, but thanks to the low amount of lightning during the summer, they also seem strong to many.
This might seem like a really loud thunderstorm, but that&#39;s what it has been compared to this summer&#39;s thunderstorms, says Tuovinen.
On Wednesday, ground lightning struck 1,700 times, and on Thursday there was even the potential for the summer&#39;s heaviest thunderstorm day: by around 4 p.m., there were 1,790 ground lightning strikes in the plakar.
If the lightning still continues into the early evening, then we can reach more than two thousand lightning strikes, Tuovinen predicts.
The previous record weak thunderstorm year was experienced in 2015, when the number of lightning strikes was around 30,000.
By Wednesday, this year&#39;s lightning count had risen to 18,386.
So there is still a lot to be done so that this year does not break the &quot;record&quot; of two years ago.
However, you can expect the thunderstorm to continue.
According to Tuovinen, the air mass over Finland will also remain warm and humid during the rest of the week, which is a favorable breeding ground for thunderstorms.
The main focus of thunderstorms will shift from the northern parts of the country to the south on Saturday, where you can get about 2,000 lightning days on both Saturday and Sunday.
A more uniform rain front is expected in the central parts of the country.
According to Tuovinen, there is rarely thunder in such places.
Coe praises Russia&#39;s &quot;candid&quot; apology for the doping scandal
World athletics boss Sebastian Coe praised what he described as an open-minded apology by Russia over the doping scandal on Thursday. However, Coe added that it was not yet time to end the ban on Russia.
Russia&#39;s director of athletics, Dmitri Shlyakhtin, said at the IAAF Congress held on Thursday, the eve of the World Championships, that Russia&#39;s ban is appropriate and that it intends to fight resolutely against doping.
He said he was sorry &quot;for all the athletes who had their gold or silver medal taken away in competitions.&quot;
Despite his comment, the IAAF Congress voted to extend the ban. Russia was banned from athletics competitions in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency WADA presented evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
‚ÄúI think his answer today was very direct. It was a very open-minded presentation,&quot; IAAF President Coe told reporters.
&quot;The entire Council and Congress were pleased that the Russian Athletics Federation acknowledged that the country had gone through difficult times and announced that it would do everything to reorganize its operations.&quot;
Coe said he was also &quot;satisfied&quot; that Russia accepted the terms of ending the ban.
&quot;I think we had a really constructive day and progress has been made, but Congress supports the task force&#39;s recommendation that now is not the time to end the Russia ban,&quot; Coe said.
&quot;We have to do everything in the coming months to normalize the situation.
The main principle has always been that we want to keep clean athletes apart from the corrupt system,‚Äù he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes will compete with the status of neutral athletes in the World Athletics Championships in London starting on Friday. They have met the strict criteria of the IAAF.
Rune Andersen, head of the IAAF task force, said on Monday that Russia still needs to meet many requirements before its status can be restored.
&quot;The testing is still insufficient and the suspended coaches are still operating freely,&quot; he told reporters after a presentation to the IAAF Council in London on Friday.
The production company was disappointed by the weak success of the Tom of Finland film
The Tom of Finland movie was not as successful as the creators had hoped, reports Yle.
To be honest, I&#39;m disappointed, admits Annika Sucksdorff, CEO of Helsinki Film, which produced the film, in an interview with Yle.
I was afraid that the Finnish film audience might be conservative, and it seems that it is.
The film premiered in February 2017.
By the end of June, it had reached a good 100,000 viewers, which is small compared to the film&#39;s budget of around five million euros.
This did not result in any lottery winnings, but now it is important that the investors get theirs back.
If the film had done better domestically, they would have already received their money.
Now we have to wait for small streams from foreign distributions, says Sucksdorff.
Tom of Finland is a film directed by Dome Karukoski.
How football&#39;s financial rules affect Neymar&#39;s move to Paris
Regulations limiting the use of money by European football clubs do not prevent Neymar&#39;s transfer from Spain&#39;s Barcelona to France&#39;s Paris Saint-Germain. It is the most expensive player transfer ever in football.
Its possible sanctions against Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) will be decided by European football governing body UEFA, which can prevent teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League.
In 2011, UEFA introduced the financial rules of fair play. According to them, PSG must be able to demonstrate that Neymar&#39;s transfer has been financed without major losses.
Barcelona was paid 222 million euros for terminating the Brazilian&#39;s contract, and Neymar&#39;s annual salary at the new club is in the tens of millions of dollars.
Neymar&#39;s transfer to France involves many financial aspects.
PSG will have no problem paying Neymar&#39;s transfer fee and adding him to their star guard, as the club is funded by Qatar&#39;s oil-rich ruling family.
Clubs are allowed to spend large sums of money to acquire players, but they must be balanced with real sources of income so that football-related business is not loss-making.
The financial rules of fair play were drawn up on the initiative of the Frenchman Michel Platini, who was elected UEFA president in 2007.
As a former footballer, Platini believed that pursuing success through debt was cheating and would lead to serious problems if the banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, the focus of the financial rules of fair play shifted from clubs&#39; debts to monitoring their losses.
The change meant that the implementation of the business model first used by Roman Abramovich at Chelsea in 2003 became significantly more difficult. Abramovich bought a promising team, spent huge sums on player acquisitions and created a global brand.
The current three-year review period for the Financial Fair Play Rules runs until 2018. During that time, the clubs are allowed to make a maximum loss of 30 million euros.
Although Platini had to leave the position of UEFA president amid scandal in 2015, his successor Aleksander Ceferin also wants to curb the clubs&#39; reckless spending of money.
&quot;The rules of fair play are still in use, and we will also apply them in the future,&quot; Andrea Traverso, who is in charge of financial rules of fair play at UEFA, told the Associated Press news agency last week.
Although PSG paid Neymar out of his contract with a one-time payment, it can amortize the amount in the accounts for the entire duration of his new contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so the transfer amount can be recorded as an annual expense of 44.4 million euros for the next five years.
Based on the economic rules of fair play, the first sanctions were handed out in 2014. The biggest sanctions were imposed on PSG and Manchester City, which is financed from Abu Dhabi.
PSG was fined 60 million euros, which was later reduced to 20 million euros. In addition, the club was ordered to limit its Champions League squad to 21 players for the 2014‚Äì15 season instead of the usual 25 players.
UEFA is monitoring clubs that may try to circumvent its financial regulations by increasing their income through companies linked to the club&#39;s owners.
If, for example, a Qatari company supports PSG, but the value of the support is considered to be higher than the usual level of the market, UEFA does not count the support as actual income.
That&#39;s what happened when UEFA decided in 2014 that Qatar&#39;s tourism authority&#39;s support for PSG was excessive.
It has also emerged that some of Neymar&#39;s earnings at PSG could be funded by fees available from the organizing committee for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar.
However, PSG and the organizing committee have denied that Neymar is being made an ambassador for the World Cup. It would be very easy for UEFA to expose such an arrangement.
Due to PSG&#39;s previous sanctions, UEFA is following even more closely than usual attempts to circumvent the rules.
Sources familiar with the situation said on Thursday that UEFA has not negotiated with PSG regarding Neymar&#39;s transfer.
The sources gave an interview to the Associated Press news agency on the condition that their identities not be revealed because they are not authorized to discuss the situation at PSG.
According to the latest published financial statements, PSG&#39;s turnover in the 2015‚Äì2016 season was 542.4 million euros and the operating profit was more than 10 million euros.
Last season&#39;s financial statements have not yet been announced.
PSG expects Neymar&#39;s arrival to attract new sponsors and boost sales of club merchandise and jerseys.
The club estimates that its turnover will increase by at least 30 percent with Neymar&#39;s contract.
The Spanish league, clearly irritated by the departure of one of the best players in the world, tried to make Neymar&#39;s transfer difficult. It was argued that it violated the financial rules of fair play.
&quot;This is a clear financial doping case for both the club and the state,&quot; Spanish league president Javier Tebas told the Spanish AS newspaper. With the state, he referred to PSG&#39;s Qatari ownership.
Arsenal&#39;s manager Arsene Wenger also has reservations about the state financing the football club&#39;s operations. Arsenal is owned by an American sports tycoon.
&quot;The case is the result of an ownership that has completely changed the operating environment of football over the last 15 years,&quot; Wenger said on Thursday.
&quot;Everything is possible after the state owns the football team.
Adherence to financial rules of fair play becomes very difficult. There are so many different interests related to the fact that a famous player represents the state.&quot;
It&#39;s urgent now: the coach of Finland&#39;s World Cup athletes is stuck in Helsinki
Long jumper Arttu Pajulahten and triple jumper Kristiina M√§kel√§&#39;s coach Suren Ghazaryan is stuck in Helsinki, even though he should be coaching at the World Athletics Championships in London.
Kristiina M√§kel√§ may have to compete without her coach&#39;s advice.
Pajulahti will compete in the long jump qualification tomorrow and M√§kel√§ will compete in the triple jump qualification on Saturday.
However, the duo&#39;s coach, Armenian Ghazaryan, has not received a visa to Great Britain.
Ghazaryan has tried to handle the matter at the British Embassy without success.
The coach has an invitation from the organizers of the World Cup as a document, but even that has not been valid for obtaining a visa.
Are these the first symptoms of Brexit, or what, coaching director Jorma Kemppainen said.
He has always handled the visa matters himself successfully, but now there are some problems.
He will do anything to get there.
Ghazaryan has worked for the Finnish Sports Confederation SUL for years.
It doesn&#39;t matter that much.
As long as someone looks at the step marks in the stadium, Arttu Pajulahti said about his coach&#39;s possible absence.
A World Cup medal for Finland from London requires a miracle
The World Athletics Championships start in London today, Friday, and last for a good week, ending on Sunday, August 13.
Athletics, cross-country skiing and ice hockey are the sports that Finnish bench athletes manage to be passionate about year after year, whether they are successful or not.
In the hearts of bench athletes, success is measured in medals.
Of course, there are other metrics.
Less noticed are the beautiful growth stories of young athletes from one prestigious competition to another, where by gaining experience, the athlete&#39;s performance is matured to the level that an adult World Cup medal is truly possible.
Now, Finland&#39;s small World Cup team does not have such young athletes, and certainly not strong ones either.
A World Cup medal for Finland requires a miracle.
Fortunately, the interesting and surprising nature of sports is that miracles can happen.
It draws the bench athletes to the television screen and glues them to follow the games, even though the London medals are decided only late in the evening due to the time difference.
From the previous World Championships in Athletics 2015, Finland received one bronze medal.
It was brought by javelin thrower Tero Pitk√§m√§ki.
Daredevils expect a medal from Pitk√§m√§ki even now, although his and other throwers&#39; recent results and Pitk√§m√§ki&#39;s failure to qualify in last summer&#39;s prestigious competitions tell otherwise.
No matter how he went at these games, Pitk√§m√§ki will go down in history as a great Finnish sports hero.
For the other Finnish athletes of the Games, getting to the finals or setting your own record is a good enough performance.
Hope and faith in the realistic medal hunt of Finnish athletics in the coming years will be given by good success in the prestigious youth international competitions this summer as well.
Cultivating young talent and financially supporting that work is more important than maintaining a small elite group of representative athletes.
Success does not come in an instant, but requires years of sweaty work from the athletes and patience from both coaching and bench athletes.
Finns also know how to appreciate international sports stars and enjoy their unique performances.
Hopefully, the London Games will go down in history as Usain Bolt and Mo Farah&#39;s games, and not because of, for example, deterrence of terrorism or random attacks.
Enni Rukaj√§rvi second in Copper&#39;s big Air - &quot;But it&#39;s sad&quot;
Snowboarder Enni Rukaj√§rvi has finished second in the big air competition in Colorado, USA.
The second place at Copper Mountain is Rukaj√§rvi&#39;s best in the Big Air World Cup.
The women&#39;s race was won by Jamie Anderson of the United States.
Rukaj√§rvi collected 147 points in the competition.
On his final jump, he attempted a caballerial 1080 for the first time at the Games and was very close to succeeding.
It feels good and I&#39;m in a good mood now, but it&#39;s sad that the last jump didn&#39;t go well.
Yes, I&#39;m going to try it again in the games from now on, said Rukaj√§rvi.
In snowboarding big air, the competitor jumps from a jump made for the sport.
Viking Line&#39;s new high-speed ship docked in the harbor in Helsinki
Shipping company Viking&#39;s new high-speed ship FSTR is badly behind schedule.
The fast ship was supposed to leave Helsinki for Tallinn at 6 p.m.
The ship was loading eight ashore.
The ship arrived in Helsinki already late.
I&#39;ve been waiting at least an hour and a half for you to get on the ship.
Now the line of cars is moving a little, Johannes Rebane, an Estonian waiting to board the ship at the port of Helsinki, said at 7:30 p.m.
Rebane guessed that the new ship had developed a technical fault.
Rebane said that the shipping company had brought bottles of water to those waiting to board the ship in their cars.
Christa Gr√∂nlund, Viking&#39;s communications manager, tells IS that there was a technical fault on the side.
It was repaired in the port of Helsinki.
The ship leaves Helsinki a couple of hours late.
Gr√∂nlund says that the ship will also be late for the return trip to Tallinn by a couple of hours.
The ship was supposed to leave Tallinn back to Helsinki at 20:15.
A 42-meter special transport will disrupt traffic on Kuutostie on Thursday evening
A 42 meter long special transport moves from Muuko to Mustola harbor during Thursday evening.
The transport that leaves at nine should arrive by eleven in the evening.
The police directs traffic on Kuutostie, and traffic may be stopped from time to time.
From M√§lki√§, the transport proceeds along road 13 to the port of Mustola.
Small Circle Nostalgia: Wet Hot American Summer and Comrade Detective
The story simultaneously longs for the characters&#39; glory days in the 80s and the grunge of the 90s (around the time David Wain and Michael Showalter made the excellent The State sketch series for MTV) and its own time - the year 2001, before Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, Paul Rudd and the other stars of the series moved on to bigger things in their careers.
As a cultural product, it is both a parody and a description of the constant reminiscence we are stuck with in the Facebook era.
As a commercial product, it feels out of date.
First Day of Camp worked surprisingly well, and not just because of its absurd humor (it, among other things, told the backstory of a vegetable can that speaks with the voice of H. Jon Benjamin).
The core of the joke is that the middle-aged Actors play lusty teenagers approaching adulthood. Emphasizing it makes the impossibility of reaching the past part of the joke.
Ten Years Later, in which adults play adults, is less emotionally based and its parody is more fragmented: it parodies, for example, 90s stalker flicks, such as the horror film The Hand That Rocks the Cradle.
At one point, one of the characters digs out an Apple Powerbook, inline roller skates and &quot;other stuff from 1991&quot;.
Many of the stories are the same as before.
Good-hearted Coop (Michael Showalter) is now a writer but still hasn&#39;t gotten over Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
And one crazy plot involves Ronald Reagan (aka Michael Showalter) as his accomplice George HW Bush (played aptly by Michael Ian Black).
As always in series like this, the best part is the side paths.
It&#39;s especially funny to see the ever-young Paul Rudd, who has a beard tassel under his lower lip, i.e. Matt Dillon&#39;s &quot;soul patch&quot; from the movie Singles. Andy, played by Rudd, the king of the camp, is starting to be an old man.
Moments of random insanity might make this series take off as a sort of recursive Seven Up! series until it reaches its obvious conclusion: Wet Hot American Summer ‚Äì Twenty Years Later. In its final scene, a group of friends go to the premiere of Wet Hot American Summer.
Amazon&#39;s Comrade Detective series, on the other hand, appeals to a different kind of nostalgia: the Cold War spirit of The Americans, the film Atomic Blonde, and even the wrestling imagery of the GLOW series, where East meets West.
The comedy series was created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka and directed by Rhys Thomas. It is made into a Romanian police drama of the 1980s, where a couple from Bucharest fight for truth, atheism and Marxism-Leninism.
Florin Piersic Jr and Corneliu Ulici play the lead roles as hard-faced Gregor and idealistic Iosefi. Their lines have been dubbed into English by Channing Tatum (executive producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
That&#39;s a great idea,
but it&#39;s not much else.
The series has some good visual jokes (cops spend their time watching chess on TV the same way Americans watch football).
Featuring a host of famous voice actors, including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chlo√´ Sevigny. Their banter makes for a really fun game.
However, Comrade Detective gets too caught up in imitating a clumsy socialist drama ‚Äì for example, there is a killer hiding behind a Reagan mask. That&#39;s why the series often really starts to feel like clumsy propaganda.
Six long episodes are too long, and the humor in the series is not fast enough or plentiful.
Condensed, the series might work better as an agitprop satire, for example when Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the American embassy and there are always two fat men in the lobby munching on hamburgers.
The message to the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can turn everything into consumer goods and fast food.
The fictional Romanian creators of the series were not wrong: we devour our own recent history and their history like a turd.
Toni Tauru from Kouvola will step into the ring on Saturday in Macau - against a former UFC fighter
Toni Tauru wants to keep the match standing.
Toni Tauru will face a tough fight in Macau, as Brazilian Leandro Issa fought in the UFC organization last year.
The Brazilian also has a jujutsu black belt and a world championship in the sport.
For once, I&#39;m pitting myself against a parent.
It&#39;s a funny story, 32-year-old Tauru says.
Kouvolainen was supposed to get into the ring in Indonesia last Saturday.
The bout was canceled due to logistical issues, but the three fights were fast-tracked to the Chinese autonomous region of Macau.
Tauru has never faced anything like this before.
This was the first time my match was cancelled.
It was annoying, because preparation and training took a lot of time.
However, the opponent is satisfied that a new date was found for the fight.
Waiting a week has little effect on preparation.
The move does not affect the condition, because it does not improve in a week.
Your condition can get even worse if you train too much now.
In a few of his previous fights, Tauru has faced opponents whose strengths lie in vertical fighting.
This time the situation is different.
The Kouvola resident describes Issa as a typical Brazilian.
He is quite an aggressive fighter.
My guess is that he will come out hard in the first round and try to take him to the mat.
He has won the jujutsu world championship, so he knows how to wrestle.
Kouvolainen&#39;s previous match did not go according to plan.
Filipino Kevin Belingon hit Taurua badly in the corner of the eye, and the victory went to the Philippines.
I&#39;ve never fought so well, especially standing up: he didn&#39;t land a single hit.
As I went to pour, he caught the corner of my eye.
It hurt for a really long time.
New motivation
Some of the free fighters fight once a year, some enter the ring more often.
For example, future opponent Issa fought last time in September.
Tauru, on the other hand, had three matches last year.
Now the second struggle of the current year is ahead.
Sometimes the pace has become heavy.
In recent years, I have been working out and have been in good shape all the time.
However, I have only fought for the sake of fighting.
When the 32-year-old heard about the upcoming match, he decided to change scenery for a while.
I was in Espoo to train and I got the joy of doing things back.
We got really good training when there was one guy from Sweden.
The training was a big help, because on Saturday the Kouvola resident has to prepare for a physical struggle.
I have been able to train against opponents of the same size and practice vertical combat.
Fighting upright is the 32-year-old&#39;s main tactic.
You have to hit sensibly.
If the opportunity arises, I will of course take it to the plot myself.
Down exports must not be given for free, as they consume the most.
Macao attracts Tauru, who has competed in China before.
It is said to be the Las Vegas of China.
I believe that a big and wonderful evening is ahead.
The Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0.25 percent
The Bank of England is expected to announce that it will keep interest rates unchanged as economic growth has been lackluster and easing inflation has ended speculation about rate hikes.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will continue to be slow. The bank postponed interest rate hikes because there is even more pressure on the income level of families.
The decision-makers of the central bank&#39;s monetary policy committee decided by a vote of 6-2 to keep interest rates at 0.25 percent. The interest rate hike received even less support this month, as economic growth has been lackluster.
In its quarterly inflation review, the bank lowered its 2017 growth forecast to 1.7 percent and its 2018 forecast to 1.6 percent. It also warned that there will be even more pressure on household income levels, as inflation is still expected to accelerate to close to three percent in the fall.
However, according to the bank, interest rate increases are needed in the next few years to curb the inflation accelerated by Brexit. In addition, the bank announced that loan costs may have to be increased more than expected in the financial market.
In addition, the members of the committee decided to cancel part of the massive economic package, which began to be implemented a year ago in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum.
The bank will end the Term Funding Scheme in February 2018, although it is now expected to provide ¬£15m more low-cost funding to banks through the scheme, for a total of ¬£115m.
The following is stated in the minutes of the bank&#39;s interest rate decision: &quot;According to the forecast of the committee responsible for monetary policy, the slow development of the gross domestic product will continue in the next few years, when the decline in real household incomes will reduce consumption.&quot;
With regard to interest rates, the bank reiterated that in order to contain inflation, a &quot;some degree of tightening of monetary policy&quot; is needed &quot;slightly more&quot; than the market&#39;s expectations.
The market is currently predicting the first increase in the third quarter of 2018 and the second in 2020.
However, the bank emphasized that possible increases are &quot;gradual&quot; and &quot;limited&quot;.
In May, the bank predicted 1.9 percent growth for this year and 1.7 percent growth for next year.
Now it kept its 2018 growth forecast at 1.8 percent.
The pound weakened against the dollar and the euro as a result of the news.
Against the dollar, the pound weakened by 0.5 percent and was $1.31. Compared to the euro, it weakened by 0.4 percent and was 1.11 euros.
The decision to keep interest rates unchanged was made after weaker-than-expected growth figures dampened increased expectations for interest rate hikes. GDP grew by 0.3 percent in the second quarter and 0.2 percent in the first quarter.
The bank expects growth to remain at 0.3 percent in the third quarter, but to pick up slightly at the end of the year.
Its most recent inflation survey gave little hope to households suffering from accelerating inflation and meager wage increases. According to the bank, the situation will get worse before it gets better.
The bank added that monetary policy &quot;cannot prevent&quot; the decline in income in the next few years. However, it expects wage growth to recover &quot;significantly&quot; at the end of the three-year forecast period.
The economy will also be strengthened by the strong growth in demand for British products as a result of the weak pound. It cancels out part of the effect of the decline in private consumption.
The decision comes a year after interest rates were cut to 0.25% in the wake of a shock EU referendum result that sent the pound plummeting.
The bank estimates that the overall effects of the decision will probably start to be seen in prices and the economy only after four years.
Before the central bank&#39;s most recent decision, interest rate hikes had started to be demanded more and more loudly, as inflation tightened the pressure on households. In July, three decision makers demanded a 0.5 percent interest rate hike.
Inflation eased last month to 2.6 percent from 2.9 percent in June. However, according to the bank, it was expected and inflation will tighten again in the coming months.
According to the bank, exceeding its two percent target level was &quot;entirely&quot; due to the weak pound.
‚ÄúGiven the recent decline in swap rates, competition in the mortgage market looks set to intensify further as lenders frantically seek customers and look to finish the year strong,‚Äù says Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers.
&quot;The market looks particularly good for those whose current loan agreement is coming to an end. Renewal contracts are even more popular, their interest rates are low and there are also cost-free options available.&quot;
NHS to prescribe 10,000 controversial HIV drug
Starting in September, patients can be prescribed a &quot;breakthrough&quot; anti-HIV drug. A dispute over the funding of a drug in England&#39;s public health system (NHS) was settled in the Supreme Court.
The NHS announced that around 10,000 people will be prescribed pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) during the first three-year trial. The medicine taken before intercourse has been found to reduce the risk of infection by about 86 percent in high-risk individuals.
The NHS agreed to fund the trial after the Court of Appeal upheld a High Court ruling last year. It says the NHS is able to pay for PrEP, although it says local authorities should fund it.
Simon Stevens, the head of NHS England, called the decision announced on Thursday a &quot;significant new intervention&quot; and the National AIDS Society described it as a &quot;crucial moment&quot;.
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first to start accepting applications for the trial, which will expand to other clinics in October. The trial will reach its full scope in England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an HIV medication taken before intercourse that reduces the risk of infection.
Trials have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV infections in at-risk groups.
Taking the medicine before intercourse means that the body has enough medicines during intercourse to prevent HIV infection.
The medicine can be taken daily or two hours before sex.
The target group of treatment includes gay men, bisexual men and transgender people, as well as people with an HIV-positive partner who is not receiving effective treatment.
Clinics select eligible applicants for the trial from men, women and transgender people, as well as those whose HIV-positive partner is not known to be receiving antiretroviral treatment for their disease.
People living in England and registered with a general practitioner can also apply for a trial at their local sexual health clinic.
The program costs ¬£10m and NHS England this week signed a contract for the drugs following an international tender.
The purpose of the trial is to evaluate the potential of the PrEP drug by gathering extensive clinical evidence on its targeting, uptake and treatment implementation.
&quot;This significant new intervention should complement and enhance the already existing diverse and increasingly effective means of preventing HIV,&quot; says Stevens.
&quot;It&#39;s yet another significant achievement in the struggle that has been going on for more than 30 years in solving one of humanity&#39;s greatest health challenges.&quot;
&quot;This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV,&quot; says Deborah Gold, director of the National AIDS Society.
‚ÄúIf PrEP is targeted correctly to those who need it and are at risk, it could have a game-changing impact on the HIV epidemic in England.
Starting in September, those in the risk group will receive a drug through an NHS-funded trial, the use of which they can decide independently without the need to consult with a partner. It has an empowering effect that will improve the lives of a great many people.
This was welcome news.‚Äù
&quot;Now the most important thing is to make sure that the experiment is started quickly throughout the country and no one belonging to the risk group is left out,&quot; says Ian Green, director of the Terrence Higgins Foundation.
&quot;The PrEP drug used in the trial has been acquired, and we will soon be able to protect ten thousand people belonging to risk groups from HIV infection.&quot;
&quot;The start of the PrEP trial is a welcome event, which was needlessly prolonged by several months due to the government&#39;s slowdown,&quot; says Shadow Government Health Minister Sharon Hodgson.
&quot;We have evidence that the drug can have a game-changing effect on the work we do to prevent HIV and stop the spread of this menacing disease.
The experiment helps us to better understand the real benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that the experiment be started as soon as possible throughout the country. This way we can protect those exposed to HIV and get one step closer to a situation where the spread of HIV in society has been successfully stopped.&quot;
Quality of living: the mezzanine floor and smart interior solutions have turned a small Earl&#39;s Court apartment into a spacious home
Ex-banker Joanne Leigh, who was keen on renovating properties, moved from Knightsbridge to a smaller flat in Earl&#39;s Court in 2014.
The apartment is on the first floor of a Queen Anne style house. The success of the renovation is indicated by the fact that Joanne has not yet packed up her bags and moved.
&quot;Before this, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger apartment,&quot; says Joanne.
&quot;I was looking for something similar in my price range.
I visited the apartment screen here and noticed that the rooms were the same height as my apartment at the time.
I immediately fell in love and made an offer the same day.&quot;
Since then, the approximately 90 square meter apartment has undergone a complete makeover.
It was a two-room apartment, where the bedroom could only be accessed from the kitchen. Joanne wanted more storage space and a mezzanine to make use of the room height.
&quot;I wanted space, big windows and lots of light.
Those were my demands,&quot; he says.
He hired Erfan Azad from the Duck &amp; Shed design office in Notting Hill for the job. Erfan was given the task of utilizing the space of the nearly four-meter-high rooms and creating an apartment that would not only be a renovation and sales target, but a home.
The room height was not quite enough for two overlapping spaces, so the challenge was to build an intermediate floor where you could stand.
The solution required creative thinking from Erfan.
&quot;Steel structures are quite complicated.
The facilities had to be arranged on top of each other so that you don&#39;t have to crouch in them.
The structures had to be modified so that the height is just right both above and below them.&quot;
Erfan was able to place two full-height rooms on top of each other in the space with fascinating details.
On the mezzanine floor, a Retrouvius copper grid window opens into the elegant living room.
Mirror gold furniture, silver effects and vintage lamps by Serge Mouille create a signature style.
The use of mirrors brings theatricality, a sense of space and light.
The mirrors at each end of the short corridor make the corridor seem longer than it really is.
The mirror in the intermediate space of the kitchen is like a window that opens up a view into another room.
The mirrored furniture in the entrance has storage space for Joanne&#39;s cutlery and glassware.
The fact that the kitchen can be hidden when it is not in use adds to the elegance.
Kitchens equipped with folding doors are not a new solution,
but what is unique about Joanne&#39;s kitchen is that the door is raised in the same way as a garage door.
&quot;It required a bit of planning,&quot; says Erfan about the steel-reinforced veneered MDF door.
&quot;It&#39;s balanced, which means it slides into place very easily when lifted.&quot;
With the sensible use of space and the design of the storage space, Joanne got 16 extra square meters, a second bedroom and an even better floor plan.
&quot;When selling an apartment, the area is decisive - or the valuation of the property,&quot; says Erfan.
&quot;In the basic case, the real estate agent walks into the apartment and calculates the price based on the surface area.&quot;
In Joanne&#39;s apartment, the surface area was increased by using high-quality materials that bring luxury to the space.
&quot;The resident is in contact with the materials of the apartment, and an emotional bond with the apartment is partly based on them,&quot; says Erfan.
&quot;No one gets attached to the electrical wires running through the walls.
They are also important, but not in the same way.&quot;
Joanne&#39;s apartment is an example of how good design and extra square footage can make a basic apartment exceptionally nice.
Then it can also happen that you no longer want to move out of the apartment.
Pregnant Princess Sofia beamed in her summer look
Princess Sofia&#39;s choice of outfit hit the spot.
Princess Sofia represented Sweden in B√•stad for the last time before her birth.
For the dinner of the A Sustainable Tomorrow event, the princess had chosen a delicate light blue dress.
Sofia represented the event with a smile.
Princess Sofia of Sweden has visited B√•stad in Sweden this week.
On Wednesday afternoon, Sofia represented the A Sustainable Tomorrow seminar in a stunning blue figure-hugging outfit that beautifully dressed the late pregnant princess.
Sofia arrived at the event in a dark blue outfit.
It is the last representation event where Sofia represents before her birth.
His calculated time is in September.
For the event&#39;s dinner, Sofia had chosen a beautiful pastel blue dress, which fell beautifully.
The style was crowned with big earrings and a stylish little bag.
Pastel blue suited the princess nicely.
Sofia has been in B√•stad, Sweden this week on a representative trip.
Sofia completed her outfit with a small bag.
Sofia literally radiated in her fresh summer look.
Sofia even got excited to talk to the photographers at the event.
Now I&#39;m just holding my stomach, Sofia stated with a laugh and referred to her late pregnancy.
He raises us with sweet chili
In the summer of 1996, a stall selling Thai food appeared on Lahti market.
The people of Lahti did not dare to taste, but walked by.
Food was sold in the stall by Panya Suamsri-Penttil√§, among acquaintances Panja.
He didn&#39;t know much Finnish, and Finns didn&#39;t know Thai at that time.
Since the people did not dare to go out to eat, Panja offered free tastings.
This is how he taught the people of Lahti to eat Thai food, one spring roll at a time.
Taste it, he said.
I was hooked.
I went more and more often, eventually every day.
In the summer of 1997, Panja opened his Thai restaurant in Lahti&#39;s shopping hall.
It had two small tables, probably fewer than 20 customers.
He taught us not only how to eat Thai food, but also how to sit next to a stranger.
When you&#39;re hungry and places are limited, you can&#39;t leave an empty chair between yourself and a guest.
Little by little we got to know each other better and became friends.
In the end, I was sitting at a plate with a dictionary, learning Thai.
Two years passed on the side of the shopping hall, but then the restaurant had to move, because the spice pastes made by themselves reportedly smelled too much in the hall.
A new place became available at the end of the shopping hall.
There is room.
Now we chatters get to sit at our own tables again, only at the busiest times we have to shyly ask guests if there is room next to them.
Panja knows his customers.
He is told the news, where he has been and who he has seen.
He knows what food everyone eats.
He has seen how customers&#39; life stages change and the food company changes.
He remembers the man whose name I went to eat my first spring rolls with.
He remembers me skinny and fat, and remembers what I was like when I was young.
It&#39;s nice to go to lunch a little later than the others, sit in my place next to the kitchen door and exchange stories with Panja leaning on the counter.
Food is not the most important thing we get from him.
He has taught tolerance and internationalism with sweet chili sauce.
He has opened not only our sense of taste, but also our thoughts and hearts.
Nowadays, many people speak Thai to him - thanks to the increased popularity of tourism.
I adore Panja.
Even though he&#39;s had a hard time, he&#39;s always kind.
He is a hard worker.
In addition to his restaurant work, he goes to mushrooms and blueberries.
Last week, the restaurant quietly celebrated the completion of two decades.
We customers got strawberry cake for dessert.
This significant day passed without fuss or attention, at work.
The discovery of an underground base revealed 173 ISIS terrorists who were ready to strike in Europe
At the beginning of the year, the security authorities got their hands on a list that is significant in terms of anti-terrorism work.
The list contains the information of more than 170 ISIS fighters who are ready to attack Europe.
According to the German newspaper Die Welt, there are a total of 173 people and the document contains not only their personal information but also pictures of each one.
More than 130 of the persons mentioned in the list are Iraqis, but there are also six Europeans.
They come from Belgium, Holland, France and Germany.
The rest are from Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Tazdhikistan and Saudi Arabia.
Ilta-Sanomat reported on the list a couple of weeks ago.
Now the L√∂yt√∂paiksa list and the information it contains have been clarified.
According to the newspaper, the special forces of the Iraqi army found the list containing the personal information and pictures of the terrorists while investigating the terrorist organization&#39;s underground base in Mosul.
US intelligence officials assessed the authenticity of the papers and forwarded them to Interpol.
The list was distributed by Interpol to all security authorities of European countries in May.
The background was the fear that something big and serious would be planned by terrorists in Western countries after the defeat of ISIS in the Middle East.
According to Die Welt, in addition to the names and pictures of all the people, the list also includes their date of birth, invented aliases and information about the person&#39;s country of origin.
The list also details the specialties of terrorists.
For example, for the 27-year-old German Sami J. on the list, the battle name is Abu Assid al-Almani, i.e. the German.
He is said to have left Germany in 2012, traveling first to Egypt, then to Libya and later via Turkey to Syria to join the ranks of ISIS.
Suicide bomber is written as a specialty next to his picture.
There is no more detailed information about the man&#39;s fate.
A total of around 6,000 fighters have left Europe to join ISIS, whose fate is uncertain.
A man sank below the surface in Helsinki&#39;s Tokoinranta
Based on interviews with the rescue service, the man had wanted to show that he could swim.
Even a bucket can save a drowning life.
In Helsinki&#39;s Tokoinranta, a person who fell under water was rescued on Thursday.
According to Ville Estlander, the fire marshal on duty at the Helsinki Rescue Service, the situation was over quickly.
The person was found underwater about 15 minutes after the notification.
A rescue diver found him below the surface, Estlander says.
The rescue service received the notification after half past four in the afternoon.
The person was handed over to the first aid.
Estlander says that it was a man about 50 years old.
Based on the interviews, the man had wanted to show that he could swim.
The situation in Tokoinranta is already over.
Estlander praises the official cooperation with the Border Guard and the police.
It was a mission led by the Border Guard.
Those present also guided the divers excellently.
The situation was over in 15 minutes.
The man was rescued from the water together with the Border Guard and the police.
Two passenger cars collided in Eura - nine people were in the cars, three were seriously injured
There were a total of nine people in the cars, the rest of whom received minor injuries, says the fire marshal on duty.
Among the injured are both men and women.
The accident happened at the intersection of three roads at four o&#39;clock in the afternoon.
The crash happened when another car turned behind the warning triangle in front of the other car, says the fire marshal on duty.
According to the rescue service, there is a speed limit of 80 kilometers per hour in the crossing area.
The brothers are fighting over more than $500 million in real estate assets
Two brothers are fighting over one of Victoria&#39;s biggest real estate empires, worth more than $500 million. The dispute is related to the family business founded by their Italian family 40 years ago.
Former Carlton Football Club chairman and property developer Colin De Lutis lives in the prestigious Toorak area just three houses down from his younger brother Paul. The younger brother has taken the dispute to the Supreme Court regarding the division of real estate and business assets between the brothers.
Paul has wanted to leave the family business since 2014, but there is a bitter dispute about the separation.
Together, the brothers and their mother Anna own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars. The family began to accumulate wealth when they bought a shop on Collingwood&#39;s Smith Street in 1973.
The family founded the Westco Jeans store there, which expanded into a chain of 160 stores.
The chain of stores was sold for 85 million dollars in 1999.
The money was spent on real estate, and the family now owns offices, property developments in Brunswick and Sorrento, and apartments on the Gold Coast and Mt Buller, as well as suburban shopping centres.
According to the agreement with the family&#39;s late father, Colin owns about two-thirds and Paul about one-third of the company&#39;s assets. Paul describes his father as &quot;the supporting force and central figure of the family&quot;.
According to court documents, the property split means Colin owns properties worth about $316 million and Paul owns about $176 million.
Paul is not happy with the division of real estate and money.
‚ÄúI think Colin left the best properties for himself in his proposal,‚Äù Paul wrote in his first affidavit to the court in 2015.
The case was heard last Friday for the first time in the Supreme Court after several attempts at mediation.
The brothers are now also arguing over who controls the existing business. Paul claims that Colin has put him out of business.
According to Colin, the claim is not true. He accuses Paul of mismanaging some properties.
Colin writes in one of his first affidavits that he would like to reach a resolution in the case.
&quot;According to our Italian traditions, family is the most important thing to me,&quot; Colin states in his statement.
The costs of the case are constantly increasing. There are hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails and reports. Consulting companies such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, as well as the best and most experienced lawyers in the country, such as Allan Myers, are investigating the case.
Anna De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who set up milk bars and delicatessens in the late 1950s. In the early 1970s, they bought a store in Brunswick.
They were used as collateral when the family bought a property in Collingwood, where Colin established the family&#39;s first jeans store.
Colin says he started the shop &quot;in the last years of high school, when Paul was still a kid (about 10 years old)&quot;.
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, wanted to transfer the properties to their sons by agreement.
&quot;Luigi often stated that he did not want the brothers to end up in court,&quot; Anna writes in her statement.
The other two sons of the family, Mark and Luke, are no longer involved in the De Lutis group&#39;s business. According to Colin, Mark received $10 million and Luke $26 million when they left the company.
According to Paul, Luke and Mark are &quot;bitter about the financial terms of their departure&quot;.
Colin has kept a low profile despite being a former Australian Football League board member and best friend of TV star Eddie McGuire, according to his 2015 biography.
Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers were contacted by Fairfax Media on Friday.
Only Colin answered. He said in his text message that he cannot really comment on the matter because it is being discussed in court.
&quot;It is very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and drag our family&#39;s name into the legal battle,&quot; she wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to agree to his brother&#39;s demands.
&quot;Our father wouldn&#39;t have wanted us to argue like this,&quot; Colin continued and said that he still hoped that a solution would be found in the matter.
On Friday, hope seemed extinguished.
&quot;Our case will be settled in court in the near future,&quot; Colin wrote.
Trump&#39;s new chief of staff plans to limit the president&#39;s media access.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly will finally make it.
First.
According to Poltico magazine, the White House&#39;s new chief of staff plans to limit President Trump&#39;s media access and news coverage so that the boss doesn&#39;t get into trouble as often.
Reporter Josh Dawsey reports:
&quot;When new White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly met with senior staff on his first day on the job, he addressed the central issue he plans to tackle: He plans to limit President Donald Trump&#39;s access to information.
Kelly told White House staff that all information ‚Äî whether in print or heard at briefings ‚Äî must go through him because the president makes better decisions when he&#39;s well informed.&quot;
Kelly&#39;s words make sense, but others have tried to limit Trump&#39;s media access and failed.
President Trump has had a decades-long relationship with television ‚Äî and as president, he still watches a lot of television.
&quot;If presidential candidate Trump was nervous about unfair coverage, it was worth showing him that the sympathetic media handled things more evenly,&quot; Sam Nunberg, who worked as an adviser to Trump&#39;s campaign, told Politico magazine in February.
At the time, Politico reporter Tara Palmeri wrote that &quot;a steady stream of praise is essential to controlling Trump&#39;s use of Twitter, according to six former campaign staffers.&quot;
Clear.
But it&#39;s ludicrous to suggest that Trump&#39;s use of Twitter was ever under control.
Maybe these campaign workers know something the rest of us don&#39;t ‚Äî maybe Trump&#39;s Tweets would have been even wilder without their efforts.
We will probably never know what kind of messages Trump missed.
If his staff has been able to keep him from causing trouble even a few times, their work has not been in vain.
However, no one has been able to consistently stop Trump from causing an uproar.
Part of the problem is that there are competing factions in the White House who are trying to push their case by providing Trump with information that supports their point of view. That information may or may not be reliable.
In May, Politico wrote that advisers are deliberately giving the president questionable information.
Reporter Shane Goldmacher reported on one incident:
‚ÄúTrump&#39;s current and former staffers say he can become extremely enraged by newspaper clippings criticizing him ‚Äî especially if they feature damaging leaks. Then he absolutely has to find out where the information comes from.
That&#39;s what happened in late February, when someone mischievously gave the president a copy of a story from the website GotNews.com, founded by Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, that blamed Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh for several White House leaks.
Johnson had been permanently removed from Twitter for harassment and had previously made false allegations and later retracted them. Nor did he present concrete evidence.
Nevertheless, after reading the story, Trump had started to ask the staff about Walsh.&quot;
Goldmacher added that then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Staff Secretary Rob Porter &quot;had been trying to implement a document management system going to Trump.&quot;
And what was the result?
Kelly tries the same thing three months later.
Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective leader than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self and his aides are still pushing their own agendas.
These immutable facts make Kelly&#39;s task very difficult.
Neymar signed a five-year contract with PSG
The Brazilian star Neymar has signed a five-year contract with the French football club PSG, reports news agency AFP.
Earlier on Thursday evening, it was reported that Neymar&#39;s representatives had paid a buyout price of 222 million euros to FC Barcelona, which plays in the Spanish soccer league.
Neymar&#39;s contract with Barcelona had thus been terminated and he was free to join Parisian club PSG.
The whopping transfer amount of 222 million euros is the largest in football history.
Previously, the record was held by Manchester United, who paid 105 million euros for Frenchman Paul Pogba last summer.
PSG is owned by the state-owned Qatari company Qatar Sports Investment.
The chairman of the club is former tennis professional, Qatari Nasser al-Khelaifi.
Neymar is believed to arrive in Paris on Friday.
Successful author Raija Oranen solved alcoholism and fear of flying with hypnosis: &quot;I&#39;m fine with my life&quot;
The successful author Raija Oranen, known for the TV series Ruusu aika and Puhtaat valkeat lakanat, just celebrated her 69th birthday.
Hypnosis helped Raija Ora.
The five grandchildren keep grandma so close to writing, that Raija and her husband Jyrki gave up the Spanish sun and the apartment in Fuengirola after 18 winters.
First they sold their house, but now in the spring they also left a rental apartment.
In the light and sun, away from the old circles, Raijan was once taken by depression and alcoholism, from which he has survived.
The exterior is also 20 kilos lighter.
The weight started to fall off when the serotonin drugs were stopped, they were mood drugs.
I once got help with alcoholism from hypnosis, which also helped me with my fear of flying, I overcame it.
I have now been without alcohol for 15 years.
Alcohol takes a person away, the radiant writer says openly.
Raija and Jyrki Oranen have traveled the same journey for over 45 years.
I feel better than ever.
Raija and Jyrki Oranen, who also worked in the tourism industry, have traveled together for more than 40 years.
I proposed, and it was to get married in two weeks, Raija laughs.
She has always been such a drama queen, she ended her life because of that, Jyrki laughs at his wife.
Oranen, who has had an extensive career as a writer, only fondly remembers the 44-part Puhtaat valkeat lakanat TV series, which touched and moved Depression-era Finland.
I decided once and for all that the Raikka family company&#39;s business was the clothing industry when I read Liisa Sepp√§l√§&#39;s 50th anniversary interview on the plane.
I was the daughter of a seamstress myself, my mother also had a clothing store and I sometimes worked as a mannequin, Oranen recalls.
For him, the plot and story of the series changed the attitude of Finns towards entrepreneurship.
Anita Savelainen&#39;s research and dissertation revealed it, says Oranen.
Raija Oranen lives an active time as a writer, she has many manuscripts in the works - hundreds of ideas.
The tourists returned across the ditch to &quot;millionaires&#39; alley&quot;
Homeowners who are among the wealthiest in the West Midlands are once again at loggerheads with stubborn vagrants who managed to cross a ditch dug by the council and return to the field next to their houses.
Tourists park their twenty caravans near a street called Millionaire&#39;s Alley in Solihull.
They were driven out of the area in May, but they managed to cross the moat dug by the municipality as a roadblock. They brought children, horses and an army of vans.
The tourers managed to cross the barrier at a point that had been left unprotected by the path.
Outraged residents have accused Solihull municipality of &quot;complete inability to solve the problem&quot;.
The resident, who remains anonymous, says that the vagrants came from Bentley Heath on Monday evening, where they had thrown stones at passers-by.
&quot;The municipality must be forced to act, because it seems to be completely incapable of solving the problem.
The tourers were here in May, then they left but came back again.
More of them came in the evening and probably even more today.&quot;
The resident said that the city of Birmingham had solved the problem by banning access to the parks.
&quot;I live in Streetsbrook Road and it&#39;s frustrating to pay council tax when the council can&#39;t do anything about it.&quot;
According to another resident, who remains anonymous, it is ridiculous that the vagrants returned so soon after being driven away.
&quot;There are more of them than before, and they have even let a horse graze in the park.&quot;
According to a Solihull council spokesperson, the council is aware of illegal camping near Streetsbrook Road. ‚ÄúWe are taking the necessary legal action with Solihull Police to evict the campers as soon as possible.
In terms of gathering evidence, it is very important that as many locals as possible report disturbing or criminal activity to the police.
It helps to form an overall picture of the situation for legal proceedings.&quot;
Enraged people surrounded the Portuguese wrecker
The men who made a forced landing on a beach full of people in Portugal have been questioned in court today.
Two people died yesterday as a result of the forced landing.
The two men who flew the plane may be charged with manslaughter.
At most, it can lead to 16 years in prison in Portugal.
A small plane flown by men had to make a forced landing yesterday due to a technical fault on the beach of Sao Joao da Caparica near Lisbon.
There were hundreds of people on the beach at the time of the incident, some of whom ran the landing plane to escape into the water.
When landing, the plane hit a 56-year-old man and an 8-year-old girl, who died instantly.
The plane first hit the man who had his back to the plane.
Immediately after that, the plane went up and when it landed again, it hit the child&#39;s head, Filipe Janeira, who was on the beach, told Jornal de Noticias.
The little girl who was killed was on the beach with her parents.
The girl&#39;s parents were not injured.
The people on the beach surrounded the small plane immediately after the crash, angry.
The girl&#39;s father and other people went to the plane and started beating on it, said Celia Rocha, who witnessed the incident, in the Correio da Manha newspaper.
The man called the pilot a criminal, he was desperate.
It&#39;s a wonder more people didn&#39;t die.
The two men on board were not injured in the forced landing.
The Finnish star who tragically lost his leg won the World Championship gold again: &quot;Without the accident I wouldn&#39;t be world champion&quot;
Early on Wednesday morning, Matti Suur-Hamari celebrated Finland&#39;s World Cup gold in banked slalom in the competition held in Big White, Canada.
Suur-Hamari also won the Cross World Championship gold in the games earlier.
A total of three World Cup titles have now been accumulated.
Pretty incredible World Cup!
Twice the honey was taken care of, it is pulled with a pretty good heart rate, Suur-Hamari, who was reached by phone, was happy.
The 30-year-old calculator thanked his coach and the very successful preparation in Finland.
According to Suur-Hamari, the number of challengers in the sport is growing all the time.
The whole of parasnowboarding has grown and developed a lot recently.
The differences are getting smaller, and there are a lot of new calculators.
Always wondering if a black horse is coming from behind.
Every race seems to have a different winner.
Suur-Hamari lost one of his legs in a motorcycle accident in 2009.
He had enthusiastically skied since he was young with his friends, and the accident did not take away his desire to get on the slopes.
From time to time, I remember what my life would be like without that accident.
But my attitude has always been that it&#39;s pointless to bother.
The cards that have been dealt are played with, Suur-Hamari emphasizes.
It would be cruel to call a serious accident and the loss of a limb a stroke of luck, and Suur-Hamari does not do that either.
But he turned the harsh hardship to his advantage.
Yes, I would say that the situation turned into a win.
I wouldn&#39;t be a three-time world champion without an accident.
Before the accident, the 23-year-old Suur-Hamari&#39;s biggest passion for snowboarding was already fading.
Duuni towards the top started in earnest only after the accident.
I trained with my friends when I was young, and we always clapped excitedly for the X-Games.
But they were distant dreams that dimmed somewhat over time.
After the accident, I somehow found myself there at the start of the X-Games.
I couldn&#39;t have imagined beforehand.
I was 23 years old and I thought that this would be a really long life if I stayed here to be bitter and sad.
I decided to pull on my overalls and start working.
I&#39;d say I&#39;ve done pretty well.
Laskija was very happy with the selection of wheelchair bowler Leo-Pekka T√§hti as athlete of the year.
The four-time Olympic champion received his award at the sports gala held in January.
According to Suur-Hamar, T√§hti&#39;s victory is an important signal for the para sports community.
It was a really big deal, and the win was definitely deserved.
This will surely also open your eyes to the world of para sports.
When is it time to start the athlete of the year campaign of double world champion Matti Suur-Hamari?
It will be seen in time.
I try to do my best to succeed.
Suur-Hamari has not yet conquered all the peaks it craves.
Next year, that&#39;s a big goal.
In a year, the Paralympics will be held in South Korea.
Yes, we will go there to get a medal!
The majority of Syrian refugee youth do not believe that they will return to their homeland permanently unless the war ends and Isis leaves the country
The A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees study explored the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
Syrian refugees baking bread in a refugee camp in Jordan.
The majority of young Syrians do not think they will return to their homeland permanently.
According to them, the end of the war in Syria and the departure of ISIS from the country are the most important things that should happen in order for them to return to their homeland.
The Trump administration is not seen to bring change to the Syrian conflict.
The communications agency chain Burson-Marsteller investigated the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees in an international survey.
Burson-Marsteller has already been researching the opinions and attitudes of Arab youth for nine years.
This year, the A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees survey explored the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
In February-March 2017, a total of 400 Syrian youth aged 18-24 responded to the survey, half of whom are women and half are men.
Half of the interviews were conducted in Jordan and half in Lebanon.
According to the study, more than half of the young Syrian refugees do not believe that they will return to their homeland permanently in the future.
42 percent of the respondents can think of returning to their home country and four percent could not say.
According to the study, the war going on in Syria and the presence of ISIS in the country have the most influence on the young people&#39;s decision to return home.
Almost half (47%) consider the end of the war to be the factor most influencing permanent return home, while a quarter think the most important thing would be ISIS leaving the country.
Only less than a tenth mention the improvement of the economic situation or the departure of Bashar al-Assad from Syria as the most important factors influencing the decision.
Military action alone will not resolve a conflict
Syrian youth were asked which factor is the most important in terms of ending the conflict.
The majority is of the opinion that the cessation of hostilities is more essential than President Bashar al-Assad&#39;s relinquishment of power.
A good quarter consider al-Assad&#39;s presidency an obstacle to the peace agreement.
Almost half feel that both political and military solutions are needed to end the ongoing Syrian conflict.
Only a quarter believe that the conflict can be resolved through military measures alone.
The majority of young Syrian refugees see that ISIS&#39;s power has weakened over the past year, while a fifth feels that its power has strengthened.
According to the respondents, the most important thing in the fight against ISIS, and terrorism in general, is for the media to convey information to people that ISIS has nothing to do with the Islamic faith.
Almost as many raised military measures and educational reform as the primary means.
More than a tenth think that the most important thing would be to create better-paid jobs for young people.
When asked about the effects of the Trump administration on the Syrian conflict, 66 percent of respondents believe that the conflict will not change during the Trump administration.
Almost one in four believes that the Syrian conflict will worsen under Trump.
Opinions are divided as to whether the involvement of Russia and Iran has improved or worsened the conflict.
Monty Widenius spends half of his time coding to keep the internet organized - the database he developed is used by e.g. Wikipedia and Google
The Espoo company MariaDB develops the &quot;world&#39;s fastest growing&quot; open source database.
Founded by coder entrepreneur Michael &quot;Monty&quot; Widenius, MariaDB&#39;s main product costs users nothing and can be developed online by any skilled programmer.
For example, Google and Wikipedia are users of the Finnish database, but they are not necessarily paying customers.
With the help of databases, huge masses of information remain organized and quickly available.
For example, if you use Linkedin, Twitter or Booking.com, they use the MariaDB or MySQL database.
&quot;All information that is not in image form comes from the database, and the images are also linked there,&quot; explains Widenius.
Working as CTO of MariaDB, Widenius spends about half of his time coding.
The man who works remotely from Kauniais does his part to ensure that the internet works smoothly.
Widenius developed the world&#39;s most popular open source database, MySQL, together with Swedish David Axmark.
In 2008, the technology company Sun bought MySQL for a billion dollars, and a year later, the software giant Oracle gobbled up Sun for 7.4 billion.
When the Oracle acquisition happened, a large number of MySQL developers announced they were leaving.
&quot;They didn&#39;t want to work for Oracle, which didn&#39;t make a firm promise about MySQL&#39;s future,&quot; Widenius recalls.
At this point, he had already founded a company that started developing MariaDB.
He didn&#39;t want his life&#39;s work to die.
I hired twenty of the best developers from Sun and thus ensured that the continuity of the code was secured with the help of the same guys who created it.
Since MySQL is an open source database, MariaDB was able to develop its own branch of it.
The name just had to be changed.
A foundation was established to oversee the freedom of MariaDB&#39;s code development.
&quot;During MySQL, these backups were not made,&quot; Widenius laments.
Although many have heard of Widenius and MySQL&#39;s billion-dollar deal, few Finns know anything about MariaDB.
&quot;In recent years, our growth rate has been around 50 percent per year,&quot; says MariaDB&#39;s CFO Kenneth Paqval√©n.
Focused on growth, MariaDB is not making a profit yet, and Paqval√©n is tight-lipped about the company&#39;s key figures.
That&#39;s how much he reveals, that in the current fiscal year, MariaDB estimates that it will receive orders worth 20 million euros.
Since the database is free, the company has developed services around it that business customers are willing to pay for.
MariaDB also helps with changing databases, which can be more than a year&#39;s work if the customer has been using a closed database.
Switching from MySQL to MariaDB can be done in no time, because they are versions of each other.
Among other things, the Spanish operator Telef√≥nica and Southeast Asia&#39;s largest bank DBS are MariaDB&#39;s paying customers.
The most popular cloud services, such as Amazon&#39;s AWS, Microsoft&#39;s Azure, Alibaba&#39;s Cloud, offer MariaDB to their customers.
At the same time, MariaDB is distributed to new users automatically in the distribution packages of Linux operating systems, where MariaDB has largely replaced MySQL.
Although we are a small company, we have connections with the biggest gamblers.
&quot;Among our customers are the world&#39;s largest telecom operators, gaming companies, banks and even some central banks,&quot; Paqval√©n lists.
The database market is still dominated by giants like Oracle, Microsoft, IBM and SAP with their closed databases.
Even for Oracle, MySQL is a modest side business compared to the company&#39;s traditional closed database.
Although, according to the research company Gartner, the largest database companies have lost market share in recent years, in terms of revenue players like MariaDB are still insignificant, if fast-growing companies.
In a database market of about 50 billion dollars, open source databases don&#39;t even reach a billion.
However, the value of open source cannot be measured only in money, because the majority of users do not pay anything for this software.
The research company Gartner predicts that in 2018, companies will already develop more than 70 percent of their internal applications on top of open databases.
In addition, more than half of the old databases would have been changed to open ones at that time, or the transition would have at least started.
Big companies don&#39;t get new customers because most of them choose open source code next.
This has led to skyrocketing license fees for commercial databases.
Companies want to make as much money as before with a smaller number of customers,&quot; Widenius reflects.
Since changing a closed database is difficult, the majority of customer companies have obediently swallowed the price increases.
&quot;There are many customers for whom the transition is really difficult, because their old applications and others are stuck in a closed database,&quot; says Widenius.
He still believes that the measure of customers is getting full.
As the license fees increase every year, sooner or later the customer will switch to an open source database.
The price is 10-20 percent of the previous one, and the service is better, because the customer can easily switch to another database if they wish.
In addition, many companies are facing major system changes when they transfer their operations to cloud services.
At the same time, many people change database software.
Last spring, MariaDB received a EUR 25 million loan from the European Investment Bank, EIB.
It was the largest growth financing ever granted by the EIB to the Nordic countries.
The company has around 115 employees worldwide and plans to hire more now.
One of the reasons for the EIB&#39;s financing was MariaDB&#39;s impact on public IT procurement.
The company has public sector customers in Britain and Germany, for example.
The public sector in Europe pays billions of euros annually for databases.
&quot;Many countries want to switch to open source solutions and thus use tax money more efficiently,&quot; says Paqval√©n.
Widenius is saddened by how money is wasted in Finland, for example, on closed healthcare systems, when open systems are cheaper, and the subscriber is not at the mercy of one software company.
Some say open source is an ideology, but I think it&#39;s a better way to code.
The community helps and does what one cannot invent or be able to do by oneself.
The 55-year-old Widenius is one of the most well-known promoters of open source code, along with another Finn, Linux developer Linus Torvalds.
Widenius helps other companies develop functional business models on top of open source code.
I still give 4-5 speeches every year in different parts of the world on this topic.
Italy is toughening its approach to NGO rescue ships
Italy has warned NGOs that use their ships to rescue refugees in the Mediterranean that they will not be allowed to continue operating unless they commit to complying with new rules governing their activities.
&quot;If the non-governmental organizations do not commit to the new guidelines, it is difficult to see how they could continue their activities,&quot; Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with the Turin newspaper La Stampa.
Minnit&#39;s warning came a day after Italian authorities seized a vessel belonging to the German aid organization Jugend Rettet. Its crew is suspected of collaborating with human smugglers, which promoted illegal immigration.
The aid organization, which has only been in business for a year, declined to comment on prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio&#39;s detailed charges.
&quot;For us, saving lives is and will be the most important thing. We are very sorry that we are currently unable to operate in the search and rescue area,&quot; the organization announced in a statement published on social media.
&quot;We can assess the accusations only after we have gathered all the necessary information and are able to assess the situation.&quot;
Italian authorities had been monitoring the Jugend Rettet vessel Iuventa since October.
The crew is suspected of having taken boatloads of refugees on board directly from people smugglers, who were able to use the boats again.
One such incident allegedly happened just a couple of kilometers from the Libyan coast. The information appears in the prosecutor&#39;s document, the content of which has been published by the Italian media.
The crew is suspected of defying the Italian Coast Guard, which oversees rescue operations in the area. The motivation is the passion to help.
According to the operating instructions, ships like the Iuventa must be accompanied by the Italian police, who supervise the operation.
Only three of the nine non-governmental organizations participating in the search and rescue operations have so far agreed to follow the guidelines: Save the Children and Malta&#39;s MOAS and Spain&#39;s Pro-Activa Open Arms,
who announced on Thursday that he considers the new rules unnecessary but acceptable because they do not cause &quot;significant changes or obstacles&quot; to the organization&#39;s rescue operations.
Among those who refused to comply with the guidelines is the Nobel Prize-winning organization Doctors Without Borders.
Minniti, for his part, noted that the number of migrants arriving in Italy as a result of rescue operations has dropped sharply in recent weeks, which he sees as an indication that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast guard and cooperation with local mayors are beginning to produce results.
&quot;In the last few days, the light at the end of the tunnel has started to appear,&quot; the minister said.
He revealed plans to continue discussions this month with Libyan mayors on economic development projects and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of refugees heading for Europe.
A seasonal employee is suspected of having killed his common-law partner in Enonteki√∂, the suspect was found in the countryside - story for the prosecutor
The suspected crime took place in Enonteki√∂&#39;s Kuttase last December.
According to the police, a 36-year-old Czech man is suspected of killing his 26-year-old Scottish common-law partner.
Earlier it was reported that both were seasonal workers.
The police have also said that the suspect would have fled into the countryside with two dogs after his act.
The man was found cold on the ground, and he did not resist when arrested.
Charges in the case must be filed within a week.
The case may still be heard in the district court of Lapland during August.
Robert Hardy, known for Harry Potter and My Furry Friends, has died
British actor Robert Hardy has died at the age of 91.
The actor&#39;s death was announced on Thursday by his family.
Born in 1925, Hardy began his acting career at the age of 24 in the theater.
During his long career, he also acted in films and television.
Hardy is especially remembered for his role as the Minister of Magic Cornelius Toffee in the Harry Potter films and for his role as a veterinarian in the television series My Furry Friends, based on the book by James Herriot.
The popular BBC series was filmed for a total of seven seasons.
Michelle Carter was sentenced to prison for text messages that incited suicide
A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison for text messages and calls she used to incite her boyfriend Conrad Roy to commit suicide.
Michelle Carter, 20, will serve 15 months of her sentence in prison and five years on parole.
Carter was convicted of manslaughter in June. Her boyfriend Conrad Roy committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
&quot;My family is broken,&quot; Conrad&#39;s father said at Thursday&#39;s hearing.
&quot;My son was my best friend.&quot;
Carter appealed the sentence and was allowed to await the hearing of the application in prison.
He faced a 20-year sentence, but his lawyers say both Carter and Roy suffer from mental health issues.
Dressed in red pants and a cream-colored sweater, Carter listened to his sentence with his hands folded, his eyes fixed on the ground in tears.
&quot;His actions killed Conrad Roy,&quot; the prosecutor told the court.
‚ÄúHe ended Conrad&#39;s life to improve his own.
He has not taken responsibility for the act,&quot; the prosecutor continued.
&quot;He has shown no remorse.&quot;
According to Carter&#39;s lawyer, the case arose out of &quot;shocking circumstances that Carter deeply regrets.&quot;
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz was of the opinion that Carter&#39;s &quot;age or maturity level, or even mental health issues, had no significant effect on his act.&quot;
The prosecutor read the statement of Conrad&#39;s mother, Lynn Roy, in which the mother said that ‚Äúnot a day goes by that I do not mourn the death of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I&#39;m getting through all of this. I will try my best to comfort his sisters in this pain that we will always carry.‚Äù
Conrad&#39;s sister Camdyn Roy told the court she is &quot;haunted&quot; by the thought of never seeing her brother&#39;s wedding or being an aunt to his children.
&quot;It is painful to lose a person who has been in my life every day since I was born. That pain never goes away,‚Äù Camdyn said.
The case looks set to set a precedent, as Massachusetts does not have a law that makes it a crime to encourage suicide.
Carter was 17 when Roy was found dead from carbon monoxide poisoning in a car in 2014.
The case attracted national attention when it turned out that Carter had encouraged her boyfriend to commit suicide in her text messages.
‚ÄúHang yourself, jump off the roof, stab yourself. I don&#39;t know, there are many ways,‚Äù Carter wrote in the many messages he sent to Roy in the two weeks before his death. Roy was on vacation with his family at the time.
Just before Roy&#39;s suicide, Carter wrote: ‚ÄúYou&#39;ve got to do it, Conrad‚Äù and ‚ÄúAll you have to do is turn on the generator and you&#39;ll be free and happy‚Äù.
Judge Moniz said Carter was seeking attention with Roy&#39;s death. The judge ordered that Carter not be allowed to profit from the case by giving interviews.
The case has divided experts&#39; opinions.
Few have defended Carter. One of the defenders is Amanda Knox, 30, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007. She was acquitted two years later.
The Los Angeles Times published Knox&#39;s op-ed in which he states: &quot;Michelle Carter needs compassion and help, not prison.&quot;
NATO Secretary General: Relations with Russia the worst since the Cold War
Relations between the military alliance NATO and Russia have clearly deteriorated, commented NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on Thursday.
Stoltenberg blamed Russia and its position in the Ukraine conflict.
I think it can be said that NATO&#39;s relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War, Stoltenberg stated in an interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could strive for close cooperation with Russia.
But especially after the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the ongoing instability caused by Russia in the eastern Ukraine region, NATO&#39;s relationship with Russia has deteriorated significantly.
However, according to Stoltenberg, NATO is still committed to acting so that tensions do not escalate to their peak.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can have a political dialogue with Russia to avoid an escalation and a new cold war.
Before Stoltenberg&#39;s comments, US President Donald Trump had time to state that the relationship between the US and Russia had drifted to a dangerously bad level.
Trump called to thank Congress, which last week approved new sanctions against Russia, for the bad relations between the two countries.
Audi is making changes to 850,000 diesel engines due to the backlash experienced by automakers
A day before Audi&#39;s announcement, BMW offered to update the software of more than 350,000 cars.
BMW&#39;s director said the company believes that &quot;there are more reasonable alternatives than driving restrictions&quot;. He pointed to European cities, including BMW&#39;s hometown of Munich, which are considering restricting or banning the use of diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will make changes to the engines of more than three million Mercedes to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies talked about the recall.
European automakers have heavily marketed the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to meet CO2 emissions targets.
Nitrogen oxide emissions from diesel engines are considered to cause cancer and asthma.
The installation costs of emission neutralizing devices rise, making it difficult to price cars competitively.
German car manufacturers are closely monitored, and Chancellor Angela Merkel has been accused of pandering to the big car companies and ignoring the problems.
The companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen&#39;s mistakes. Volkswagen installed cheating devices in the cars, which reduced the emissions to comply with the regulations in tests. Emissions were higher in normal driving.
Several Volkswagen executives have been indicted in the United States, but their actions are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics at Audi&#39;s engine development department was arrested in Germany.
Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian, so he could be extradited to the United States for possible trial.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in the criminal investigation concerning Volkswagen. The authorities suspected that Audi had installed a system in its cars that could be used to circumvent European emission requirements. The accusation was based on a similar investigation in the United States.
Audi&#39;s investigation can significantly weaken Volkswagen&#39;s position: the luxury car manufacturer&#39;s share of Volkswagen&#39;s profits is disproportionately large.
A fraud investigation began about the vote in Venezuela, large demonstrations are expected
According to the company, the number of voters reported by the Venezuelan authorities is at least one million higher than the number of real voters.
This is an unheard-of opinion from a company that has no role in the election result, National Election Commission President Tibisay Lucenan told reporters.
Maduro assures that the crisis will end
In Venezuela, a representative council was elected in a controversial vote on Sunday, which is supposed to change the country&#39;s constitution.
The opposition has strongly criticized the vote and organized demonstrations against its change.
The anti-Maduro opposition has postponed its own protests so that they would be underway at the time of the appointment.
According to the newspaper El Pais, the country&#39;s national security forces began to take over the country&#39;s parliament building on Wednesday evening local time.
The troops are supposed to ensure the security of the appointment ceremony.
Climate change threatens Provence lavender
Lavender has become a symbol of the Provence region of southern France, but now it is threatened by climate change.
Lavender had declined due to drought and disease-carrying insects. Scientists and farmers are frantically trying to find a solution to the problem.
&quot;Lavender is downright endangered in the Provence region because it has suffered from the effects of climate change in recent years. As a result, spring and especially autumn rainfall has clearly decreased,&quot; says Eric Chaisse, an expert at the CRIEPPAM research institute in Provence, which specializes in agriculture.
&quot;This shortens the lifespan of lavender.
In addition, the drought has brought a lot of small mounds to the area, which spread micro-bacteria.&quot;
The stakes are high.
Lavender oil attracts travelers and is also a highly sought-after ingredient in perfumes and cosmetics.
&quot;Instead of long spikes and large flowers, we now have smaller flowers that are poorly developed or weakened or completely absent,&quot; says Chaisse.
&quot;In other words, there are even fewer parts containing essential oil.&quot;
A solution is sought by increasing irrigation, slowing down the evaporation of soil moisture and spraying the plants with a protective mixture of clay and water. In addition, varieties that are even better resistant to drought are being developed.
The journalist&#39;s murder epitomizes a growing threat in Mexico
The editorial board of the weekly Riodoce newspaper usually meets on Wednesdays to discuss how the paper handles the latest cases involving organized crime, corrupt officials and the never-ending drug war in the state of Sinaloa.
However, today we are discussing safety due to the recent tragedy.
Reporters have been urged to change their daily routines.
Two seasoned journalists discuss which is safer: leaving the children at home or taking them with them to the office that was bombed in 2009.
Security experts have written three words on the blackboard at the front of the room: adversaries, neutrals, allies.
They ask journalists for names for each group. Evidence is not needed, observations and feelings are sufficient.
The names of drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and journalists who are suspected to be on the payroll of the government or drug cartels are written on the board. They are the criminals who make reporting on the chaos in Mexico a life-threatening situation.
The violence is unrelenting, and journalists are increasingly being targeted. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, at least 25 journalists have been murdered since President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto took office in December 2012. There are 589 journalists under federal protection who have been attacked and threatened. At least seven journalists have been murdered in seven states this year.
Among the latest victims is Javier Valdez Cardenas, founder, editor and source of inspiration for Riodoce.
&quot;The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist,&quot; Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug violence.
He is deeply missed, even though he is present everywhere. A huge picture of Valdez showing the middle finger covers the facade of the Riodoce building. The picture reads: &quot;Justice&quot;. Journalists Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, in their thirties, are wearing T-shirts emblazoned with Valdez&#39;s smiling face. Valdez wears glasses and a trademark Panama hat.
The meeting comes less than two months after Valdez&#39;s death. The journalists discuss their shared trauma, nightmares, insomnia and paranoid fears.
In 2010, a federal prosecutor&#39;s office was created specifically to handle journalists&#39; cases, but only two prosecutions have been filed so far, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.
The murderers of journalists are rarely brought to justice, just like the thousands of murders related to drug trafficking and organized crime every year, only a few end up in court.
Riodoce journalists plan to continue writing about the violence in Sinaloa, even though they are grief-stricken and the situation is even more dangerous.
According to Ibarra, the security meeting is of little use because the killers are unknown and there is no hope of justice.
&quot;This meeting is frankly a waste of time,&quot; he says.
&quot;We can&#39;t trust anyone as long as we don&#39;t know the reason for the incident.&quot;
Valdez had left Riodoce delivery in the state capital Culiacan on the morning of May 15, 2017.
He had only driven a couple of blocks in his red Toyota when two men stopped him and forced him out of his car and fired twelve shots. The number is presumably related to the name of the magazine: Riodoce means twelfth river.
The shooter drove away in Valdez&#39;s car and crashed it some distance away.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He was survived by his wife and two adult children.
Rumors move fast and run wild in Culiacan.
However, Valdez&#39;s death is being kept quiet.
Sinaloa has been one of Mexico&#39;s bloodiest battlegrounds since Guzman was arrested last year and deported to the United States in January. Competing factions want to fill the void.
On the streets of Sinaloa, one or more people are shot dead every day, and the cemetery has ornate two-story mausoleums of drug lords larger than many homes.
In a coastal state, it is &quot;peaceful&quot; when only one cartel controls the ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Although Valdez was well aware of the dangers of his job, Riodoce founder and director Ismail Bojorquez, 60, feels guilty for not being able to protect his friend.
He believes two mistakes led to Valdez&#39;s murder.
In February, Riodoce published an interview with Damaso Lopez. He leads a rival faction waging war against Guzman&#39;s sons.
The story might have angered Guzman&#39;s sons: customers suspected of being members of the gang bought every issue of the magazine as soon as it hit the newsstands.
Another mistake was not forcing Valdez to leave the country after another newspaper that published the same story was attacked.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder is considered a turning point in violence against journalists.
He had survived so much that his friends and colleagues could no longer fear for him.
He had a long career in Noroeste when he decided to found Riodoce with five colleagues in 2003. The magazine&#39;s shares were sold for $50 at the time.
In Sinaloa, &quot;it was impossible to do journalism without dealing with the drug problem,&quot; says Bojorquez.
Over time, the magazine became known for its brave and honest stories, and its sales and advertising revenue grew.
Journalists appreciated the opportunity to publish hard-hitting investigative journalism without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by stories in the magazine that no one else dared to publish.
Eight years after its founding, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for its coverage of Latin America.
That same year, Valdez received the International Press Freedom Award from the Committee to Protect Journalists for his courage in relentlessly following the story of the Mexican drug trade.
He openly admitted that he was afraid.
&quot;I want to be able to move on with my life,&quot; he said after receiving the award from the Committee to Protect Journalists.
Drug trafficking is a &quot;way of life&quot; in Sinaloa, Valdez said in an interview with Rompeviento TV last October.
&quot;The reporter has to accept the task that falls to him - or play stupid.
I don&#39;t want anyone to have to ask me where I was when death was being sown here ‚Äì why didn&#39;t I tell them what was going on?‚Äù
Riodoce&#39;s staff misses Valdez - a jokester who cursed like a dockworker. They miss a friend who always gave them a hug and advice. They need a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted his routines.
He always wore a Panama hat.
He went to the El Guayabo bar opposite the delivery and always sat at the same table.
Now they ask if the routines were his destiny.
The death of a colleague has also made them think about how they can best do their work and stay alive.
&quot;Criminals don&#39;t like it if we cover their wives and children and their clean business operations, their secret drug-trafficking runways in our stories.
They were left out of the stories,&quot; says Bojorquez.
At best, it meant strong self-censorship and self-protection,
trusting one&#39;s instincts.
If you feel that everything is not right, you should stay away.
The problem, according to Riodoce journalist Andres Villarreal, is that &quot;impressions can be deceiving, and that was the case with Javier&quot;.
The old rules no longer apply in Sinaloa, nor do they apply in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states with dangerous networks: attractive smuggling routes, weak agencies and corrupt officials.
The operating environment is constantly changing.
Mobile phones were not allowed in the room where the Riodoce safety training was held. A few days earlier, it had emerged that activists and journalists in Mexico were being monitored by spyware sold only to governments.
Outside the building, two policemen had sought shelter from the 40-degree heat under the shade of a tree.
They had been assigned by the state government to guard Riodoce&#39;s offices, located in a four-story building in the middle-class district of Culiacan.
Some of the journalists half-jokingly speculated whether these two police officers were among the 50 percent that the state governor did not consider trustworthy.
It had been months since reporters had visited the mountainous countryside controlled by drug gangs.
For this week&#39;s issue, Riodoce&#39;s editor planned three main stories.
Boxing great Julio Cesar Chavez&#39;s brother had been killed in Sinaloa.
The newspaper also intended to reveal that the government&#39;s spending was concentrated in the governor&#39;s hometown.
Also, in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, just a block away from the prosecutor&#39;s office, a group of people had been kidnapped.
There was no official information about who had been kidnapped and how, so it was necessary to proceed with caution: everyone in the city knew that the restaurant was popular with both drug dealers and the authorities.
The reporter found out from public documents that the restaurant was registered in the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). The PRI has dominated Mexican politics at all levels for nearly a century.
Its governors have recently been accused of corruption in highly publicized cases.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in the same place. In one of them, the son of &quot;El Chapo&quot; Guzman managed to escape and avoid an army raid.
A few months earlier, readers would have known they would get reliable information about the abduction from Valdez&#39;s column.
&quot;In the past, we would have already known what had happened,&quot; says 46-year-old Villarreal, who has received the nickname &quot;El Flaco&quot;, Ohukainen, due to his slender body structure.
&quot;Now all connections to our data sources are broken.&quot;
Valdez&#39;s office has been turned into a warehouse where signs and stickers against the persecution of journalists are stored. The newspaper&#39;s employees have received a new, unexpected task: they have become activists pushing for press freedom.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez took a few signs with her when she left the next morning in front of the local prosecutor&#39;s office for a protest over yet another murder of a journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after Valdez&#39;s murder.
After the disappearance, a burned body was found, which, based on the DNA tests carried out by the authorities, is Adame.
Journalists have started to protest more loudly across the country. At demonstrations, &quot;SOS Press&quot; texts appear on sidewalks and buildings.
Today, Director Bojorquez is in Washington, where he is trying to get international support for the investigation of the Valdez case.
The day after Valdez&#39;s murder, Ramirez met with the governor of Sinaloa and accused authorities of spying on and killing journalists for telling the truth.
He has since asked to be removed from stories about the government because he worries that his anger will make him unable to be objective.
Valdez had repeatedly stated that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organized crime, crime-enabling authorities and an indifferent society.
In his last remaining book Narkojournalismi Valdez writes that drug gangs kill journalists, but they are also killed at the behest of politicians and security forces in collusion with organized crime.
According to the Articulo 19 monitoring group, more than half of the attacks on journalists last year were perpetrated by the police and authorities.
&quot;In Mexico, people are silenced by killing,&quot; says Ramirez.
Murder has a debilitating effect.
No one will forget the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Next to his body was a message signed by the Zetas cartel: &quot;I am here for my writings.&quot;
Next to his severed head was a computer keyboard and headphones.
Some newspapers have decided to close their operations, such as the El Norte newspaper in the northern border state of Chihuahua, after the murder of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Some continue to operate, such as Nuevo Laredo&#39;s El Manana, although its leader was assassinated in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez published a message to the drug cartels on its front page: &quot;What do you want from us?&quot;
Some of the journalists have fled their states or the entire country.
The decision is difficult.
It&#39;s hard to find work in exile, and you have to be on your guard all the time.
Sometimes criminals seek out a reporter, as apparently happened to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered along with four women in a Mexico City apartment in 2015, three months after fleeing Veracruz.
For those who continue their work, each day is filled with dangerous decisions.
Ibarra ‚Äì who once wanted to become a poet ‚Äì admits that writing about the drug trade is scary.
&quot;I became a journalist because Mexico is going to hell,&quot; he says.
Some time ago, the editors of Riodoce were sitting on the sidewalk with a beer at midnight on Friday, when the latest issue of the magazine was finished. Suddenly their phones started vibrating as a sign of a message.
Nineteen people had died in a shootout between rival gangs and security forces in the beach resort of Mazatlan.
The war escalated, as promised in the cartel messages found in the area.
Reporters put the news on Riodoce&#39;s website from the sidewalk with their smartphones.
The front page had to be replaced the next day.
Sirens wailed nearby ‚Äì yet another shooting scene.
Bojorquez glanced at the police officers guarding the delivery:
if they were scared, they covered it up very well.
Riodoce&#39;s editorial continued the tradition of the newspaper&#39;s murdered founder under this massive portrait of a man showing the middle finger to all of Sinaloa.
Bojorquez says he can&#39;t even consider shutting down. &quot;How could I shut down the magazine when our intern asked to go out on the street to do the story on the same day that Javier was murdered?&quot;
Hannu Manninen&#39;s Olympic project started with a huge setback - &quot;Tough place&quot;
The celebrations of Hannu Manninen, who turned 39 in April, were cut short, as the professional pilot started preparing for the Olympic season.
However, the training season started disastrously when Manninen fell ill with the flu.
That was the start of a long period of illness, which lasted almost five weeks.
May was spent practically entirely sick.
First there was a flu and finally a childhood disease like an ear infection, for which I had to take a course of antibiotics.
I was only able to do ten percent of the planned exercises.
I can&#39;t remember the last time I was sick for so long.
It was a tough place when I couldn&#39;t make use of the joy of training, Manninen tells Ilta-Sanom.
The test result collapsed
The 2007 world champion did not get a training permit until the second week of June, which was reflected in the KIHU&#39;s roller mat test conducted on June 12.
In the test, the athlete skis on roller skis on a mat whose speed is increased every three minutes.
After every three minutes, the mat stops for about ten seconds, and the tester takes a lactic acid sample from the athlete&#39;s fingertip with a needle.
Last fall I spent 32 minutes on the mat, but now I only stayed for 28 minutes.
A wall came up against me, says Manninen.
For the better
After the initial difficulties, Manninen says that he stayed healthy.
I have done a variety of calm aerobic exercises, with which I have tried to normalize the body&#39;s metabolism.
Now a really good five-week period is behind us.
At Midsummer, there was also a week and a half off from flying duties.
I also had time to visit the cottage with my family.
Last season, Manninen participated in only four World Cup competitions before the World Cup home games in Lahti.
The best result was seen right away in the opening competition, when Manninen took 18th place in top skiing.
Guidelines drawn
Manninen and the national team&#39;s head coach Petter Kukkonen have made a training and competition plan that will last until next February.
We are now looking for a different rhythm in training compared to last season.
After the Ensilume Games, Ruka would have a weekend of three world cup competitions.
In December, the intention would be to participate in at least one World Cup weekend, perhaps in Ramsau.
At the end of January, the plans would be to still participate in Seefeld.
Hopefully, after that, the name will be found on the list of the Olympic team, Manninen says.
The Pyeongchang Olympics would be Manninen&#39;s sixth career Winter Olympics.
Now the most important thing is to stay healthy, underlines the person from Nummel, who celebrated gold in the team competition in Salt Lake City in 2002.
The dinosaur protected itself from its enemies by camouflage
At first it looks like a scary statue.
Now scientists have revealed the first results of a rhinoceros-sized creature found by a Canadian miner that was so well preserved that experts are calling it the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs.
It was so well preserved that researchers were even able to determine that its scaly skin was reddish brown and had a &quot;troubled past&quot;.
According to Current Biology magazine, it is the best-preserved armored dinosaur of all time and one of the best representatives of its species in the world.
The recently found fossil is a nodosaurus, which lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period 110-112 million years ago.
Scientists consider this amazingly well-preserved fossil a truly remarkable discovery.
According to National Geographic magazine, the armored herbivore is the best-preserved fossil of its kind ever.
It was found on March 21, 2011 in the Suncor Millennium mine in northern Alberta, Canada, and was discovered by a miner named Shawn Funk.
He hit something that didn&#39;t seem to be a natural part of the surrounding rock and decided to investigate his find further.
The fossil found in the rock was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Palaeontological Museum.
There, the beast was excavated for six years from a 1,100 kg boulder.
The results of the hard work are now visible.
&quot;If you squint, you could almost believe it was sleeping,&quot; says science writer Caleb Brown, who works as a researcher at the Royal Tyrrell Museum.
&quot;It will go down in the history of science as the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs, one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs.
Studies of the skin revealed that meat-eating dinosaurs were likely a significant threat to this herbivore, even though it had armor and resembled a walking tank.
Its red-and-white armor camouflaged it from predators, and it was also protected by the darker coloration above and lighter below, which is still present in many animals.
According to experts, it was thus better able to blend in with its surroundings and avoid its enemies, the larger dinosaurs.
The 110-million-year-old nodosaurus hit the headlines in May and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrell Palaeontological Museum.
The researchers have named it Borealopeta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell. Mitchell was part of the team that took more than 7,000 hours to unearth the dinosaur.
Nodosaurus is so remarkably well preserved that Mitchell and an international team of researchers have been able to determine the patterns and shape of its body scales and armor.
They found that it was protected by a coloration still common in the animal world, where the body is darker on top and lighter underneath.
The discovery was still a surprise because the Borealopeta is significantly larger than modern animals with similar coloration.
It can be concluded that meat-eating dinosaurs preyed on it to such an extent that evolution favored hiding rather than fighting as a means of survival.
Among the current animals, for example, deer, zebras and armadillos have similar coloring. They are significantly smaller and therefore easier prey, which suggests that the nodosaurus was also seriously threatened.
&quot;Predation by a large, heavily armored dinosaur shows how dangerous Cretaceous dinosaurs were,&quot; says Brown.
Chemical analysis of the organic compounds in Nodosaurus&#39; scales reveals that its skin was reddish-brown.
Scientists are continuing to study the nodosaurus in order to draw conclusions about its life. Among other things, they examined the contents of its gut to find out what it ate at its last meal.
Scientists believe that when it died, it fell into the river and drifted out to sea, where it sank on its back to the seabed.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as Florida is today, and the rivers and seas probably extended much further than they do today.
&quot;This nodosaurus is really remarkable because its scaly skin has been preserved and it has also been preserved three-dimensionally in its original form,&quot; says Brown.
&quot;That&#39;s why it looks almost the same as it did in the early Cretaceous period
It doesn&#39;t take much imagination to figure it out: if you squint a little, you can almost believe it was sleeping.&quot;
The Cretaceous period was the age of theropods, huge bipedal, meat-eating dinosaurs.
Although their king, Tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years before the Borealis, its mighty predecessors may have preyed on this armored dinosaur.
Tyrannosaurus rex&#39;s predecessors included, for example, Acrocanthosaurus, a six-ton monster about 11.5 meters long.
The latest findings of Nodosaurus researchers have been published in Current Biology. They believe that Borealopela was washed into the sea after her death and mummified in the mud.
It was found on March 21, 2011 in the Suncor Millennium mine in northern Alberta, Canada, and was discovered by a miner named Shawn Funk.
According to the museum, it is the world&#39;s best-preserved armored dinosaur with skins and armor from snout to hip.
Nodosaurs were an average of five meters long and weighed up to 1,300 kilograms.
Two half-meter spikes rose from their platforms.
Scientists believe this armored herbivore traveled through what is now western Canada until a flooded river carried it out into the open ocean.
Its armor has been preserved down to the smallest details in an underwater tomb.
Its fossilized remains are so well preserved that its skin still remains in the pitted plates of its armor along its skull.
Michael Greshko wrote in the National Geographic magazine that such preservation is &quot;as rare as winning the lottery.
The closer you look at it, the more amazing it seems.
The pitted plates of its skull armor still contain fossilized skin.
Its right front foot is at its side, five toes up.
I can also count the scales on the soles of its feet.‚Äù
How did one activist learn to answer the question: to whom do the streets belong?
Brittany Ferrell was deeply shocked on August 9, 2014.
He had arrived in New York the day before from his home in St. Louis and was sitting on the bed of his airbnb apartment browsing Facebook on his phone.
That&#39;s when he noticed a message from a high school friend:
&quot;The police just killed an 18-year-old, and his body is still in the street.&quot;
Confused, he noted that no one else had posted the same information on his feed. That&#39;s why he closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
His timeline had numerous retweets from @TheePharoah.
The username belongs to the St. Louis-based rapper who tweeted in real time about the death of Michael Brown. Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man, had been shot by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
The user in question had also posted a picture of Brown&#39;s lifeless body on the street, where it was left for four hours.
‚ÄúThis is incredible,‚Äù Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to him and his community.
He put his phone away. When he returned to Twitter later that evening, there were reports of people gathering on Canfield Drive.
Users posted photos of police cordons and people screaming, as well as a man claiming to be Brown&#39;s father holding a sign that read: &quot;Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!&quot;
Ferrell followed live video footage of a police officer standing in front of protesters with a barking dog.
He says he also saw a video in which another officer cocked his rifle and yelled, &quot;I&#39;m going to kill all of you... animals.&quot;
&quot;This is not normal,&quot; Ferrell remembers saying.
&quot;It was not the kind of murder that we are already used to and that could be called typical.
Then I felt cold shivers.
I was angry and I cried.‚Äù
He booked a return flight home for the next day.
The plane landed at eleven in the evening. Ferrell picked up his six-year-old daughter from her father and decided they would leave for Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years has been the subject of a documentary called &quot;Whose Streets?&quot;. It premiered in cinemas on August 11, 2017.
The film is a story of survival and expression, love and loss, strength and perseverance from the perspective of the local people who took to the streets to demand answers.
As Ferrell drove toward Ferguson with his daughter, who was wearing a floral dress and matching crown, they had another conversation about &quot;what it&#39;s like to live as a black person and in what circumstances.&quot; They had talked about it countless times before that morning.
&quot;Remember when I told you how black people have had to fight for the things they believe in?&quot; Ferrell remembers telling his daughter.
&quot;We&#39;re going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, and that&#39;s not right.&quot;
&quot;I couldn&#39;t help but take my daughter with me,&quot; Ferrell later said.
‚ÄúThe events of today are... the culmination of the events of the past.
My daughter has a right to know that and grow up with it.
He needs to get the skills for activism and organizing, but he also needs to know the different layers and conditions of the experience of living as a black person. And he needs to know what we have to do to be free, to free ourselves.
Although I&#39;ve thankfully been able to protect her from blatant racism, she&#39;s still just like any other black girl.
I feel like I would be harming him if I shielded him from reality.‚Äù
Their first stop in Ferguson was South Florissant Road, across from the police station. It became a camp site for activists as they waited for word on how the case would be handled and eventually learned that the police would not be charged.
From there, Ferrell and her daughter went to help a local entrepreneur who was making packed lunches.
They packed lunches in bags and distributed them to the protesters.
Ferrell gradually began to approach activism in a new way.
&quot;My activism changed completely after August 9,&quot; he says. While studying at the University of Missouri in St. Louis, Ferrell was president of the Minority Nursing Student Association. At that time, he focused on food justice and health disparities in black communities.
&quot;I had no experience in organizing.
Somehow it just happened.‚Äù
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, the documentary&#39;s assistant director, at an evening protest.
Folayan said he and cinematographer Lucas Alvarado-Farrar &quot;simply wanted to tell&quot; what was happening.
A doubt crept into Ferrell&#39;s mind. He asked, &quot;Do you really want to tell what&#39;s going on, or do you want a story that you can exploit?&quot;
The suspicion was based on the countless times that people, usually white, had appeared in the local community who only wanted to profit from its hardships and perseverance.
&quot;We had heard that those born and raised in Ferguson did not have a common voice,&quot; Folayan said in a recent interview. &quot;We wanted to do things differently.&quot;
Folayan had already contacted assistant director Damon Davis, who is known for his activism among death row inmates.
Davis&#39; presence prompted Ferrell to join the project along with six other locals. The film crew followed the events in the years following Brown&#39;s shooting.
‚ÄúThis is not a documentary where someone speaks to us or speaks for us, it&#39;s us speaking,‚Äù says Davis.
&quot;The most important thing for me was how the local people are presented in the film, because I am presented in the same way.&quot;
According to Folayan, the intention was not to focus on Ferrell&#39;s experiences, because it was wanted to show that the people&#39;s movement &quot;is not about a charismatic leader but about the community&quot;. However, Ferrell proved to be the most open of the cast.
That&#39;s why the documentary shows surprisingly private aspects of Ferrell&#39;s life, such as falling in love and getting married.
&quot;I felt pretty naked,&quot; Ferrell laughs as he describes what it was like to see the film for the first time.
&quot;But I understood that this work and the humane portrayal of black people requires a certain vulnerability.&quot;
In addition, Ferrell&#39;s story reiterates and re-centers the role of Black queer women in the larger Black Lives Matter movement.
The movement was born on social media (#BlackLivesMatter) after the police had shot the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012. Two of the three founders of the movement identify with a queer identity.
&quot;Black queer women&#39;s leadership has kept the whole movement going,&quot; says Ferrell. &quot;It&#39;s because we have to constantly fight on many fronts.
Black queer women have had to endure everything.‚Äù
Folayan agrees: &quot;The movement is really run by black women, with a lot of queer women among them.&quot;
However, he emphasizes that Ferrell was not chosen for the documentary &quot;on purpose&quot; because of his queer identity.
&quot;He got the energy going,&quot; says Folayan.
&quot;However, it is no coincidence that he was on the front line. Black queer women live at the intersection of many things, and they have a lot at stake.
His energy is transmitted from the screen.&quot;
News crews have long since left Ferguson, but tensions between the community and the police remain.
Ferrell still has two and a half years left on parole. He was convicted of blocking a highway during a protest.
His description of the socio-political atmosphere in his home corner is short and concise: &quot;A mess.&quot;
Yet he still relies on a slogan he learned by heart on the streets of Ferguson three years ago:
&quot;Our duty is to fight for our freedom.
Our duty is to win.
We must love and support each other.
We can only lose our chains.‚Äù
Fitting Likeness: Artist Creates Portraits of Chelsea Manning&#39;s DNA
In the Fridman gallery in New York, faces are hung in the middle of the exhibition space - white, black and brown faces, between which, on closer inspection, you can see similarities.
These 30 works are portraits made by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg based on DNA samples taken from Chelsea Manning&#39;s cheek and hair.
Manning sent the samples from the prison at Fort Leavenworth, where he was serving a 35-year sentence. Manning was convicted of leaking classified diplomatic cables to WikiLeaks.
Dewey-Hagborg&#39;s A Becoming Resemblance exhibition opened on August 2, 2017.
It is based on two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg and Manning. Dewey-Hagborg combines technology, information technology and art in her work. Manning is a trans woman and trailblazing dissident whose prison sentence was commuted by Barack Obama on the third and final day of his term.
Dewey-Hagborg analyzed Manning&#39;s DNA algorithmically and created 30 portraits based on his genetic information. They are a sharp, if somewhat theoretical, stance on the editability of DNA data, the ambiguity and the cause-and-effect relationships behind the interpretations, as well as identity.
Chelsea Manning, whose birth name is Bradley Edward, has openly said that she has identified with women since adolescence. In 2013, he was found guilty of 20 crimes, including violating the Espionage Act, computer fraud and theft.
There was only one photo of Manning, who was sentenced to prison: a grainy, black-and-white selfie of a distressed Manning sitting in the driver&#39;s seat of a car. She wears a platinum blonde wig, which became her trademark.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg had behind her the highly popular Stranger Visions project, which she realized in 2012.
In it, he created portraits based on forensic information. He obtained DNA data from, for example, cigarette butts and chewing gum and created images of what the people in question might have looked like.
Then the artist received an email from Paper Magazine.
&quot;They were interviewing Chelsea Manning and needed a picture for their story,&quot; Dewey-Hagborg said at a press conference for the new exhibit.
Manning could not be visited or photographed in prison. So the magazine contacted Chelsea and asked if she would be interested in doing a DNA portrait of Manning.
The artist and his imprisoned muse unexpectedly became pen pals. They wrote to each other for a couple of years.
They even did a Suppressed Images comic book together, illustrated by Shoili Kanungo. It depicted a future where the president would have commuted Chelsea&#39;s sentence and she would be able to watch the show.
In reality, Obama commuted Manning&#39;s sentence just days after the comic book was published. It was a lucky coincidence after seven tough years spent in a Kansas military prison.
It&#39;s also impressive that the exhibition is opening right now, when Donald Trump is waging his own war against whistleblowers and transgender soldiers, finding ever new ways on Twitter to reinforce the powerful divisions he was supposed to be mitigating.
Dewey-Hagborg believes that &quot;everything has a purpose&quot;.
On the gallery wall is an artist&#39;s statement, and beneath that is Manning&#39;s large autograph, with a heart as the dot of the last name&#39;s i. In his statement, the artist demands an end to the &quot;automatic division on which gender, race, sexuality and culture have been based&quot;.
On the opposite wall is Manning&#39;s DNA sequence: a long string of C&#39;s, G&#39;s and A&#39;s written in pencil.
With this combination of 200 letters ‚Äì or nucleotides, as the artist uses the scientific definition ‚Äì Dewey-Hagborg wants to illustrate how similar we all are, at least in our biology.
&quot;I hope my exhibition will help people understand that we are equal in terms of our genetic heritage and that genetic information is very personal and open to interpretation,&quot; says Dewey-Hagborg. The exhibition also features his video work Spurious Memories from 2007.
&quot;DNA tells countless stories. 30 of them are on display here.‚Äù
The last work in the exhibition is in its own room: a page from Manning and Dewey-Hagborg&#39;s comic book.
In it, Manning&#39;s character rises from prison like King Kong, holding a megaphone.
&quot;If they silence you, they&#39;ve won,&quot; the image reads.
&quot;Never be silent.&quot;
&quot;The text is from a letter I received from Manning,&quot; says the artist from Philadelphia.
&quot;It&#39;s so impressive that I still get chills.&quot;
Contrary to what was portrayed in the comic book, Manning has yet to see the show. When Manning arrives, he is greeted by faces based on his own genetic information like a crowd of protesters in the middle of an exhibition space.
It&#39;s intentional, like everything else in this exhibit: for example, Manning&#39;s DNA sequence is written in pencil at a height equal to his height (157.5 cm).
&quot;The faces were previously on the wall, but I wanted to give them the feeling of a crowd,&quot; says Dewey-Hagborg.
&quot;I wanted to portray the mass movement created by Chelsea, which was also behind her release.&quot;
A Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee are wanted on suspicion of murder
Police say they have launched a nationwide search to find a Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee who are suspected of stabbing a man to death in a luxury Chicago apartment.
Arrest warrants were issued Monday for Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, who are suspected of involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, Cook County court records show. Arrest warrants have been issued for first-degree murder without the possibility of bail.
Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after being stabbed multiple times, according to the documents.
According to a local news release published by the Chicago Police Department, the body was found on July 27, 2017.
Officers called to the Grand Plaza apartment building found the victim with multiple stab wounds to his body.
According to authorities, Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead at the scene and the stabbing is being investigated as a homicide. Police are actively looking for two suspects.
Lathem has worked as an assistant professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the university&#39;s vice chancellor for community affairs, said in an emailed statement that Lathem is now on administrative leave and banned from Northwestern University campuses.
&quot;This is a criminal matter that authorities are investigating and Northwestern University is assisting with the investigation,&quot; Cubbage wrote.
Warren works as a senior financial assistant at the University of Oxford.
A university and Somerville College spokeswoman said in an emailed statement that &quot;we have been in contact with the police in the United Kingdom and are ready to assist the authorities investigating the case in the United States in any way we can.&quot;
Additionally, the statement said Warren&#39;s colleagues are shocked and hope she surrenders.
Anthony Guglielmi, director of public information for the Chicago Police Department, said he strongly urges suspects to surrender to authorities.
&quot;The police have an idea of their whereabouts and we are constantly refining our search,&quot; Guglielmi said.
According to Guglielmi, local, regional and national authorities are assisting in the search for the suspects.
He said the police received a call from the property manager of the Grand Plaza building who had received a vague tip that something had happened in apartment 1008.
The police described the scene at the scene as horrific.
According to Guglielmi, it is unclear whether the victim was murdered on the same day or earlier.
He said security cameras revealed that Lathem and Warren had been in the building.
&quot;We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship,&quot; says Guglielmi.
The management team of Grand Plaza issued the following information to the residents: &quot;The police are currently investigating the course of events and the victim&#39;s background as well as possible motives, including the possibility of domestic violence.&quot;
A man threatened to blow up an Islamic bookstore and &quot;kill Muslims&quot; in London
&quot;I&#39;m not anti-Muslim, I&#39;m Catholic,&quot; the convict told the police.
Moffatt must complete one hundred hours of unpaid community service.
A 39-year-old man was sentenced for threatening to blow up an Islamic bookshop in London and &quot;kill all Muslims&quot;.
According to the Independent magazine, David Moffatt was convicted of aggravated harassment, among other things.
According to the police, they were alerted to the scene on May 23 by bookstore staff.
According to the staff, the man had &quot;threatened to blow up the bookstore and kill the Muslims&quot;.
The suspect left the store after the threats.
Moffatt was caught when he called the police about the threat.
The threat was not related to events at the bookstore.
Officers noticed that Moffatt was wearing the same outfit as the suspect in the bookstore incidents, a police spokesman said.
I&#39;m not anti-Muslim, I&#39;m Catholic, Moffatt told police during questioning.
As a punishment, the man must perform a hundred hours of unpaid community service and pay legal costs of 620 pounds, or about 690 euros, and compensation of 85 pounds, or about 95 euros, to the victims.
According to a Scotland Yard spokesperson, many hate crimes go unreported.
&quot;We will complete the actions according to WADA&#39;s road map in the near future&quot; - Deputy Prime Minister of Russia Vitaly Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko has said that Russia will soon complete the actions according to the World Anti-Doping Agency&#39;s WADA roadmap, which can restore the powers of the Russian Anti-Doping Commission RUSADA.
&quot;Part of the measures according to the road map have already been implemented, and RUSADA got the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD, the British Anti-Doping Commission.
WADA&#39;s road map has been updated in these respects,&quot; Mutko stated on Thursday.
The Deputy Prime Minister commented on the second part of WADA&#39;s road map, which defines the conditions for restoring RUSADA&#39;s powers. The second part of the road map was recently published on the organization&#39;s website.
According to Mutko, it does not contain anything worrying for Russia.
&quot;Everything has been announced, and everything will be implemented.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee and WADA in the near future,&quot; added Mutko.
However, one of the points of the road map requires that the Russian anti-doping authorities publicly accept the results of the investigation by the Canadian jurist Richard McLaren, ordered by WADA. McLaren is investigating the state&#39;s alleged involvement in Russian sports doping.
To that, Mutko stated: &quot;The investigation is ongoing because our anti-doping system has admitted failure.
All measures have been taken.
There were no state programs, and we cannot grant something that did not exist.&quot;
Mutko&#39;s words had echoes of the statement of Vitaly Smirnov, chairman of Russia&#39;s independent public anti-doping commission.
Speaking to the Russian sports media RSport earlier in the day, Smirnov admitted that there have been problems with Russian anti-doping bodies. &quot;We have said several times that there are controversial statements and provisions in the report.
However, we are not going to accept the report unconditionally,‚Äù he added.
WADA ordered RUSADA to stop doping control in Russia in November 2015, after the extent of the doping scandal had been revealed.
However, last June it received permission to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and UKAD.
The head of WADA, Olivier Niggli, visited RUSADA&#39;s headquarters in Moscow in July. After the visit, he stated that the organization is &quot;on the right path&quot; towards restoring its powers.
British organization skeptical about the innovation beloved by Finns: &quot;There is no evidence&quot; of the health benefits of maternity packs
A British organization doubts the benefits of Finnish-style maternity packs.
Among others, the BBC and the Guardian report that the Lullaby Trust, an organization that fights against stillbirths, forbids the use of its own brochures in maternity packages distributed in Britain.
The distribution of maternity packs to all pregnant women will start this month in Scotland.
In England, too, the package is distributed in some areas.
According to the Lullaby Trust, there is no evidence that maternity packs reduce the risk of stillbirth.
Sudden death means the unexplained sudden death of a baby.
The Lullaby Trust acts as an expert for the British health authorities in the field of children&#39;s safe sleep.
We no longer allow our official brochures to be packed in them, because that would imply that we recommend this product, the organization announced.
Finland has one of the lowest child mortality rates in the world, only two deaths per thousand births.
According to the Lullaby Trust, Finland&#39;s good reading is the result of many different reasons, such as the low number of teenage pregnancies.
The fact that each family is given a box there might be a factor.
However, you can&#39;t say for sure, Francine Bates, chief executive of the Lullaby Trust, said.
We are concerned that maternity kits are marketed as products that reduce infant mortality and hidden deaths.
The maternity package is a Finnish invention, and it has been given to all mothers for free in Finland for 80 years.
The package contains various accessories, such as children&#39;s clothes.
This year there are 53 products in the package.
The package itself is a cardboard box in which the child can be put to sleep.
According to the Scottish Government, the boxes it distributes meet all safety standards.
The Lullaby Trust, on the other hand, says that there is no safety standard for cardboard boxes as a place to sleep.
According to the Lullaby Trust, a pack can be the best option for a place to sleep if a bassinet or cot is not available.
The organization recommends using the pack only for naps and to stop using it when the child is able to turn over.
The organization also recommends keeping pets away from the package and making sure it doesn&#39;t get wet or dirty.
A cunning villain escaped from a Japanese zoo for the second time
Staff at a Japanese zoo are searching for an escaped turtle.
The giant tortoise has surprised the staff with its speed and has already escaped for the second time in two weeks.
A turtle escaped from the Shibukawa Zoo in Okayama, western Japan, on Tuesday morning.
Security cameras revealed that the villain left the zoo through the main entrance.
It won&#39;t die immediately because it eats the grass around the zoo, but we are very worried, Yoshimi Yamane, who works at the zoo, said.
The escaped 35-year-old villain is female, weighs 55 kilograms and is about a meter tall.
Yamane describes the deserter as quiet and gentle.
During opening hours, the villain is allowed to roam freely in the shelter area.
The zoo has not received eyewitness observations of the turtle.
The villain&#39;s previous escape happened the other week.
Yamane found the runaway walking along the road 150 meters from the zoo.
I noticed it on the way to the zoo.
I stopped my car and asked my colleagues for help, Yamane said.
It can walk faster than we could ever imagine.
These startups will help your business avoid Uber&#39;s mistakes
Amy Errett wanted to measure employee satisfaction at her e-commerce startup, but the surveys weren&#39;t working.
The answers were often vague, unhelpful or even misleading.
Although he assured that the surveys are anonymous, some employees were suspicious of them.
&quot;The surveys were simply not consistent or objective,&quot; says Errett. Her hair care company, Madison Reed, focuses on online shopping. The company has 75 employees.
Errett decided to turn to outside help.
More and more new types of HR startups have entered the market, helping other companies find out how their employees are doing.
They develop and license software that can be used to measure employee engagement. Companies can conduct surveys and target them to specific teams and demographics, and offer their employees anonymous reporting services and, in some cases, direct access past senior management to the board of directors.
&quot;You can monitor your health with applications like Strava and Fitbit, but where is the corporate Fitbit?&quot; asks Jim Barnett, founder and CEO of Redwood City-based startup Glint. Glint offers companies analytics software to measure employee engagement.
Errett has been using Glint&#39;s software for three years. He says that he gained an even deeper insight into the thoughts and feelings of his employees.
The program can be used to make quick polls and votes for certain teams. In addition, you can use it to create a map that shows at a glance which departments the employees are most dissatisfied with and which managers have received the lowest ratings. Based on these, Errett has been able to drill down to the core of the problems.
Companies have realized that they need to monitor workplace culture to avoid becoming the next Uber. The transportation company has been in turmoil since a former employee wrote on his blog about a culture where employees are harassed and those who speak up are punished.
For startups like Glint, such omissions are an attractive business opportunity.
Corporate governance, regulation and compliance is a global industry that could reach over $118.7 billion by 2020, according to the Let&#39;s Talk Payments website.
Based in Denver, Colorado, Convercent is a startup that helps companies detect and prevent inappropriate behavior. Interest in the company grew earlier this year when Uber&#39;s reputation took a hit.
Convercent has almost 600 customers, which include, for example, Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
It recently signed a deal with Uber as well.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to conduct customized surveys, collect responses confidentially in real time, and map out problem areas.
In addition, employees can report inappropriate behavior anonymously by text message.
And if there is reason to suspect the manager of improprieties, the complaints go directly to the company&#39;s board.
&quot;Public opinion has superseded the authorities,&quot; says Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent.
He reminds that if a company treats its employees badly or acts unethically, the consequences can be expensive, even if the authorities do not intervene. Consumers may start boycotting the company, and it may also lose employees and be sued.
The Ruby Tuesday restaurant chain has more than 25,000 employees in 500 locations. The company has been using Convercent for more than a year because it wants to make sure that employees are aware of operating principles and procedures and can easily contact the head office.
Previously, the practice was that if an employee wanted to report a problem, they first had to find out a phone number or email address that could be used to report to the head office. Then he had to file a formal complaint and hope it would be taken seriously.
&quot;It was often a scary and unpleasant experience,&quot; says James Vitrano, general counsel of Ruby Tuesday. According to him, it was difficult to follow up on complaints made by employees.
In the past, problems remained hidden from managers working in another city or state. Now problems like discrimination, harassment and unfair wages can be detected and dealt with more quickly.
&quot;I get an even more comprehensive and comprehensive understanding of the employee&#39;s reality,&quot; says Vitrano, who heads Ruby Tuesday&#39;s risk management group.
&quot;At the same time, we protect our shareholders from lawsuits related to employment relationships.&quot;
According to Quinlan, companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously after accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to unethical practices during the Enron scandal.
It was only with the advent of social media that companies realized that they could no longer prevent their dirty laundry from being aired publicly.
&quot;Hope was used as a strategy before technology came to control ethics,&quot; says Quinlan.
Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, which is billed regularly.
It is a business model and opportunity accepted by venture capitalists. Both Glint and Convercent are backed by venture capitalists.
In February, Convercent raised $10 million in funding from the likes of Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital. It has raised a total of $47 million in capital.
Glint received EUR 10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November and has raised a total of USD 60 million in funding.
The rankings come as no surprise given the connections between companies, corporate culture and venture capital.
According to several studies, employees expect more from their jobs than before.
In a competitive market like Silicon Valley, good salaries and interesting projects are just the beginning.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and valued and that they are giving their time to a genuinely useful company.
&quot;Employees are more committed to the company&#39;s success if they feel comfortable in the company and feel that they are listened to and that their work is rewarding,&quot; says Nina McQueen, director of employee rewards and well-being at LinkedIn.
Investors get returns when companies succeed. Companies succeed when employees are engaged.
Third-party analytics tools promise to boost employee engagement, so it&#39;s no wonder they&#39;re attracting investors.
According to workplace culture experts, knowledge about employee commitment is important,
but it is useless if it is not acted upon.
If a company asks its employees for feedback, it can be seen as a sign of change.
And if change doesn&#39;t come quickly enough, or nothing changes at all, disappointment can reduce employee engagement.
&quot;If you ask for four thousand proposals, you have to be prepared to have four thousand conversations,&quot; says Russell Raath, CEO of management consulting company Kotter International, who has seen companies rely too much on just gathering information.
&quot;If the company doesn&#39;t take action, employees start to wonder if they were heard
and whether their opinions matter.
If the company doesn&#39;t care about them, why should they care about the company?‚Äù
According to Errett, Madison Reed now conducts staff surveys on a monthly basis and is able to address a problem the same day it is reported to Glint.
After collecting feedback from employees frustrated with the slowness of decision-making and the quality of communication, Errett was able to make changes to the teams and organize communication training to solve the problems.
Ruby Tuesday understands its employees even better and hopes that deeper understanding will help it improve long-term staff retention in an industry known for high employee turnover.
&quot;If a company does not commit to creating a culture of transparency, it will lose employees,&quot; says Vitrano.
&quot;If it loses employees, it also loses customers.
And without customers, there are no companies.&quot;
In Sweden, a 20-year-old man is suspected of spying on his naked female neighbor, reports news agency TT.
A woman living in Gothenburg had come out of the shower at home when she noticed a mobile phone hanging by the end of a string outside her window.
According to the woman, the cell phone&#39;s camera filmed the apartment.
The woman, startled by the incident, had run to another room to get dressed.
When the woman had arrived to check the situation, the cell phone had first been pulled up, but shortly afterwards had been placed on the window again.
A 20-year-old man suspected of surreptitious photography has admitted that he photographed a woman.
However, he claimed that he only photographed the woman&#39;s face.
The cell phone video had been deleted, and the police had not managed to return it as evidence.
During interrogations, the man admitted the act, but denied that he had committed the crime.
The man had justified his filming by saying that he loves his neighbor &quot;absolutely crazy&quot;.
According to the news agency TT, charges will be brought against the man.
The teachers demand more liksa in the autumn negotiations
Wage development cannot be lower than, for example, in the export industry, but the difference should be narrowed, said OAJ chairman Olli Luukkainen on Thursday.
The temporary cut in public sector holiday pay highlights the difference, he points out.
We do not have the possibility to enter into such agreements, in which the vacation pay cuts would not be included in the review in some way.
In the municipal sector, contracts are only created when the private sector&#39;s papers are signed and the increase percentages are clear.
Luukkainen predicts that, for example, OAJ&#39;s working conditions will be agreed upon in January.
Luukkainen did not reveal percentage goals yet.
Luukkainen is also the chairman of Juko, the public sector trained negotiation organization.
Luukkainen: The holiday pay cut increases differences in earnings development
According to OAJ, statistics and forecasts show that the purchasing power of public sector wage earners is weakening, while at the same time the purchasing power of the private sector is increasing.
According to Luukkainen, the temporary cut in holiday pay will further exacerbate the differences in earnings growth.
In Finland, it is necessary to define how many students can be per one teacher
OAJ also points out that the equality of basic education must be ensured, because the differences between the best and the least successful are growing all the time.
According to the organization, learning results are deteriorating, and the differences between students and regions are constantly growing.
The day for Bruins players got longer when the NCAA reduced daily practices from two to one
It&#39;s almost eleven o&#39;clock in the evening. A group of UCLA football players are left chatting on the other side of the new practice fields on campus.
Some have taken off their jerseys. Their backs are glistening with sweat after the first day of training camp.
For quite a few of them, this chat session of a few minutes is a midday break.
The players studying in the university&#39;s summer courses return to the dormitory after three hours of practice to study for the final exams. The next morning they meet at half past seven at the Wasserman Soccer Center.
&quot;The next three days are going to be tough for these guys,&quot; Bruins coach Jim Mora says shortly before Monday turns into Tuesday.
The umbrella organization of university sports reduced the number of daily practice times from two to one. The purpose of the change was to lighten the players&#39; workload, but it has lengthened their days - at least until Friday, when the final exams are held.
That&#39;s why UCLA&#39;s first three practices started at a quarter past seven in the evening. It was difficult to find space in the players&#39; already full schedules.
Limiting training times to one per day means that there are more training days than before. Camp started almost a week earlier this year than last year, marking the first time in Mora&#39;s six-season coaching tenure at Westwood that practices have been held at the same time as summer classes.
Practices are scheduled to be held 18 times before August 20, when the actual preparation for the season opener begins: UCLA will face Texas A&amp;M University in September.
Mora says he supported the NCAA&#39;s rule change, even though it made the players&#39; schedules even stricter.
&quot;We load them really hard for three or four days, and it&#39;s very challenging,&quot; says Mora.
&quot;But the players are ready to work. They are great guys.
I think the situation will get easier when we get to Saturday. Then we have more time.
UCLA closes practices to outsiders after camp. That won&#39;t be easy, given the direct view from the practice fields to the adjacent parking lot and the Luskin Center, an upscale hotel that has already been bombarded with footballs flying over the protective netting behind the goal posts.
The Bruins players are supposed to move into the hotel this coming weekend, but Mora admits that problems can arise during the season when the rooms are available to outsiders.
&quot;We have security arrangements,&quot; says Mora.
&quot;The concern is that people can book a room and film exercises from there on video. It&#39;s not an exaggerated concern.
The video of the exercises is paid quite a lot.
But we have security guards there and in the parking lot.
We are doing our best.
I&#39;m not going to worry too much about it.
We have a plan.‚Äù
Freedom to Rwanda
Presidential elections will be held in the Central African country of Rwanda on Friday, the winner of which is already considered clear.
Paul Kagame is officially seeking his third term, but in practice he has been influencing the country&#39;s leadership since 1994.
That&#39;s when the rebel group RPF stopped the genocide organized by the Hutu extremists.
Kagame was the commander of the RPF.
Kagame has been criticized for, among other things, crushing the opposition and restricting freedom of speech.
He has also been accused of distorting poverty statistics, for example.
Kagame can run for a third term because the constitution limiting the presidency to two terms was changed.
In Rwanda, however, Kagame is also a genuinely liked leader.
During his time, social reforms have been carried out in Rwanda and international investments have flowed into the country.
In addition, Kagame has played a major role in reuniting the country divided by genocide.
Rwanda&#39;s success has led many Africans to question whether liberal multi-party democracy is the right model for African states.
However, Kagame has also promised his people more freedom after the country has been put on its feet.
Now might be a good time to start.
Facebook is fighting fake news by strengthening fact-checking
Facebook plans to increasingly send potential fake news to independent fact-checkers and display the results below the original article. The world&#39;s largest social network made the announcement on Thursday.
The company published a statement on its website that it will start using updated machine learning to identify fake news. Possible fake news will be sent to fact checkers and the results may be published under the original article.
Facebook has been criticized for being one of the biggest spreaders of fake news. Many believe that fake news influenced the outcome of the 2016 US presidential election.
The topic has come up in the political debate in Europe, where French voters were bombarded with fake news ahead of May&#39;s presidential election and Germany, which is gearing up for elections in September, is backing a plan to fine social media networks if they don&#39;t remove hateful content quickly.
On Thursday, Facebook announced in a separate statement published in Germany that fact-checking is being tested in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
&quot;People want to see which stories don&#39;t pass the independent inspectors&#39; screen. They also want more background information so they can make more informed decisions about what they read and share,&quot; Sara Su, product manager of Facebook&#39;s news feed, wrote on the company&#39;s blog.
He added that Facebook will continue to test the Related Articles feature and make other changes to its News Feed to reduce fake news.
The birth of a comic book: The story of a castle
The small Scotney Castle in Kent is now known for the Squeeze music video and Margaret Thatcher&#39;s hideout from the 1970s and 1980s.
However, it has 700 years of turbulent history behind it. Now this charmingly situated castle in the valley of the river Bewl is the subject of a comic book written by Jamie Rhodes, a mop-haired writer with a penchant for old documents.
&quot;I think it&#39;s great to be able to study a text written by a person who died more than 300 years ago,&quot; says Rhodes wistfully.
&quot;I feel a personal connection when I hold the letter in my hand.&quot;
Rhodes&#39; book, A Castle in England, tells the stories of the families who lived in Scotney from the Middle Ages to Edwardian times. Each story is illustrated by a different artist, a promising British cartoonist: Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer or Isabel Greenberg.
This is not Rhodes&#39; first book based on archives. In 2014, he published Dead Men&#39;s Teeth and Other Stories, whose sources of inspiration were the documents of the British National Library. The project was sensitive.
&quot;I was moved to tears when I noticed a thumbprint in the letter. The letter was written by a double agent who worked for the Jacobites in the 18th century,&quot; says Rhodes.
‚ÄúIt was his fingerprint!
And the letters smell like smoke, because at that time fire was used as lighting.
Three centuries later, the scent makes the reader feel like he is there himself.
I love archives!‚Äù
The writer, fascinated by old documents, was able to live in the castle for almost four months with the support of the National Trust and the National Arts Council of England, which seemed too good to be true. He admits that he couldn&#39;t bear to stay in the castle a little longer than expected.
He spent his days exploring the Victorian &quot;new&quot; castle, archives, treasures and rarities such as hyena heads hung on the walls and bottles that had been in the moat for centuries.
He toured the ruins of the old castle and chatted with the forest rangers, gardeners and sometimes also the artists who illustrated the book.
In the evenings, he &quot;took a whiskey and started writing&quot;.
Scotney&#39;s closer history is fairly unknown, as the castle was not fully transferred to the National Trust until the death of the last heiress, Elizabeth Hussey, in 2006.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the foundation&#39;s staff was just starting to go through the archives. Rhodes describes that the archives had been kept for hundreds of years using the same method: taking all the excess to the attic.
The archives contained diaries, letters from the days of the English Empire, and maps of who owned what. &quot;You&#39;d think that land disputes are boring,&quot; says Rhodes. &quot;Here, however, families would even fight over a single birch tree.
It occurred to me that we shouldn&#39;t just let it be.&quot;
Some of the stories in the book progress from the castle to English history, such as The Labourer. It tells the story of a man who joins the English peasant revolt in 1381 shortly after the castle was completed.
&quot;The Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex mentions that there was a riot in the castle in 1380,&quot; says Rhodes.
&quot;The peasant revolt in England started in the same area, and it occurred to me that a revolt can start with a riot.
Maybe these events are connected?‚Äù
Other stories in the book are closely related to the history of the castle - such as The Priest, the story of a priest who was hidden by the Darrell family for seven years during the English Reformation.
The Smuggler, on the other hand, tells the story of smuggler Arthur Darrell from the 18th century. He is said to have staged his own funeral by filling the coffin with stones (this was discovered years later when his grave was opened).
The Darrells are Rhodes&#39; favorite family in Scotney. &quot;The men in the family seem to have been quite scoundrels. They kept going into debt and buying things they couldn&#39;t have afforded.
The men in the Darrell family solved their debt problems by marrying wealthy old women. I see them as handsome guys who knew how to seduce an heiress.&quot;
Now Rhodes is looking for new writing experiences.
He spent two weeks in Finland writing a comic book about El√§m√§nm√§ki, a sanatorium that operated at the beginning of the 20th century, of which only a lush plot remains.
Scotney Castle holds a special place in his heart.
&quot;It was sad to leave there,&quot; he says.
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t have wanted to go back to this evil everyday life.&quot;
Relations with Russia the worst since the Cold War
Relations between the military alliance NATO and Russia have clearly deteriorated, commented NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on Thursday.
Stoltenberg blamed Russia and its position in the Ukraine conflict.
I think it can be said that NATO&#39;s relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War, Stoltenberg stated in an interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could strive for close cooperation with Russia.
But especially after the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the ongoing instability caused by Russia in the eastern Ukraine region, NATO&#39;s relationship with Russia has deteriorated significantly.
However, according to Stoltenberg, NATO is still committed to acting so that tensions do not escalate to their peak.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can have a political dialogue with Russia to avoid an escalation and a new cold war.
Before Stoltenberg&#39;s comments, US President Donald Trump had time to state that the relationship between the US and Russia had drifted to a dangerously bad level.
Trump called to thank Congress, which last week approved new sanctions against Russia, for the bad relations between the two countries.
Vladimir Klitschko quits - the rematch against Anthony Joshua will not take place
The long-time heavyweight world champion of professional boxing, Vladimir Klitschko, ends his career.
Ukrainian Klitshko, 41, announced his decision on Thursday morning.
Klitschko, who struck gold at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996, fought 69 times as a professional, winning 64 of the matches.
He held various World Cup titles in 2000-02 and 2006-15.
Klitschko lost the last two fights of his career.
Tyson Fury beat him on points in November 2015.
In April of this year, Klitschko faced Anthony Joshua at Wembley Stadium and lost by knockout in the 11th round after a wild match.
Joshua and Klitschko were expected to meet in a rematch in November in Las Vegas.
However, Klitschko could not find motivation for the match.
I deliberately used a few weeks to make a decision, so that I could get enough distance for the Wembley match, Klitshko said in his press release.
I achieved everything I dreamed of as an amateur and professional boxer, and now I want to start my second career after sports.
I could never have imagined that I would have such a long and incredibly successful boxing career.
I am very grateful for that.
Watch Klitshko&#39;s reasons for his decision in the video.
Klitshko&#39;s manager Bernd B√∂nte said in the press release that the decision to quit was difficult for Klitshko.
However, he has always emphasized that he wants to stop if he no longer has enough motivation.
Therefore, this is definitely the right decision, B√∂nte stated.
Klitschko has been dating the American actor Hayden Panettiere since 2009.
The couple has one child, daughter Kaya, born in 2014.
Klitschko&#39;s older brother Vitali is also a former world heavyweight champion.
In the years 2008-12, the brothers held the World Cup titles of different federations at the same time.
Finland&#39;s weather vandal bewitches the conditions: &quot;Takes away the mood&quot;
Pole vaulter Minna Nikkanen has suffered from the conditions during the summer outdoor iron season.
Minna Nikkase has had problems with the conditions.
The wind and the cold have taken away the feeling from the woman.
There are also unstable conditions at the World Championships in London.
Minna Nikkanen talks about the weather.
The conditions have been against pole vaulter Minna Nikka this summer.
I wouldn&#39;t want to blame the track, but it was incomprehensible that I couldn&#39;t get even the small wings to move properly, Nikkanen said after the race in Innsbruck.
I have competed and trained here many times and I have never experienced such a variable wind in this place, Nikkanen told Paavo Nurmin Games.
This season, it has been really difficult to standardize the jump, when the winds have been so unstable even in training, Nikkanen stated at the Kaleva Games.
The weather also spoke in London on Thursday.
It has been quite a challenge to get the technology together - is it cold freezing or what.
It&#39;s been cold and windy, and it&#39;s taken the mood away.
It makes no sense to waste energy in a bad situation.
Thanks to his indoor jump 455, he made it to the World Championships.
445 have gone outside.
The situation in London is not the same for everyone.
You have to be calm and wait for better winds.
The goal is to exceed 460 in Friday&#39;s qualifying.
Why don&#39;t you train abroad?
It&#39;s not necessary.
Last summer I was in Italy and Germany at the beginning of the season.
I got the jump together and the technique became standard.
I probably should have done the same now.
Normally I have been able to go to the gym to practice, but now the gym has been closed.
What would the ideal weather be like to race?
25 degrees warm.
Even a little wind will do, as long as it is constant.
An experienced ex-civil servant annoyed the politicians at Yle: &quot;We don&#39;t have any money to share now and for many years to come&quot;
Despite the positive economic climate, Juha Sipil√§&#39;s government must keep a cool head and beware of inflating the state budget with debt money, warns Erkki Virtanen, who has prepared budgets at the Ministry of Finance for decades.
According to him, there is no margin.
In 2015, Yle interviewed the retired Virta on Wednesday&#39;s Ykk√∂saamu.
Construction of next year&#39;s state budget is just beginning.
Recently, Virtanen considers proposals from politicians, such as raising the guaranteed pension, lowering the car tax and subsidizing electric bikes, to be election speeches.
They mostly tell us that the elections are getting close, because when ten percent of the state budget is financed with additional debt, we have nothing to distribute now and for many years.
I think it&#39;s even a fraud to talk about distribution assets when taking on debt, Virtanen told Yle.
Virtanen emphasized that all debt is debt from children.
Virtanen has a long experience in preparing state budgets: he started in 1978 at the Ministry of Finance as a budget secretary and then worked as deputy head and budget manager of the budget department.
Most recently, before his retirement, he served as head of the Ministry of Labor and Economic Affairs.
In an interview with Yle, Virtanen pointed out that the now predicted three percent economic growth is likely to be temporary.
All the forecasters estimate that this is a peak from which we will start to go downhill already next year, and Finland is expecting one percent growth for decades.
Washington is changing the rules for permanent residency
According to the media, President Donald Trump announced that the rules of the permanent residence permit, or Green Card, will be changed with the new immigration plan.
The purpose is to reduce the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, tighten the requirements for temporary work permits and limit family visas.
The new rules have been proposed by Republicans and are backed by the president.
The draft law is scheduled to be debated in the two chambers of Congress.
‚ÄúThis law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars in taxpayer money by changing the way permanent residency is granted to citizens of other countries.
It also reduces chain immigration and replaces the current program.
The new application process will benefit applicants who know English and are able to support themselves and have skills that benefit our economy,&quot; Trump said, according to media reports.
The consort of the Queen of Denmark does not want to be buried in the same place as the Queen
Prince Henrik does not want to be buried with Queen Margareta.
In the picture, Prince Henrik and Queen Margaret taken in April.
Denmark&#39;s Queen Margaret, 77, and her husband Prince Henrik, 83, will not be buried next to each other, says the Danish court.
Traditionally, the monarch couples in Denmark are buried in the same place.
The Royal Palace has announced today that Prince Henrik does not want to be buried in the Roskilde Cathedral, Hovi states in his press release on Thursday.
According to BT magazine, the reason for this is the prince&#39;s dissatisfaction with his role in the royal family.
It is no secret that the prince has been dissatisfied with his role and title in the Danish monarchy, Lene Belleby, the court&#39;s communications manager, commented in the newspaper.
For the prince, the decision not to be buried next to the queen is a natural consequence of not being treated as an equal with his spouse.
According to the court, the queen has long been aware of her spouse&#39;s wish regarding the burial place and understands the decision.
Horror moment on the road: The car was about to turn on on the highway
Tommi had a common-law partner and two small children on board.
They were not injured in the accident, but they will not receive money from the insurance if the other party is not reached.
The accident happened near Keimolanporti in Vantaa.
Archive picture from the construction site of Ring III.
Tommi from Vantaa says that his family miraculously survived a car accident on Tuesday.
Tommi, his common-law partner Riina and the couple&#39;s two small children were driving on the highway near Keimolanporti in the direction of H√§meenlinna in Vantaa.
From the exit of ring road III to H√§meenlinnanv√§yl√§, a white car drove along the acceleration lane, which was driven into the side of the family&#39;s car, Tommi says.
According to Tommi, the car would have turned over without the evasive maneuver.
I braked and turned the car at the same time, and it went out of control, says Tommi.
The family&#39;s car hit a guardrail at high speed.
The parents and the two small children in the back seat were not injured.
One of the children is a little less than 3 years old, the other less than a year old.
It was apparently quite lucky that nothing happened to us.
No one passing by even drove towards us, even though there was a lot of traffic in the place.
The accident happened around 17:20.
According to Tommi, no one stopped for them, and the family called 911.
They got out of the car on their own.
Ambulance and rescue service personnel came to the scene, and the family&#39;s condition was checked.
The car went into salvage condition.
Tommi says that he and his common-law partner have a small income, and they received help from their family to buy a car a couple of years ago.
According to Tommi, without the other car&#39;s information, the family won&#39;t get any money from the insurance.
That&#39;s why the family is hoping for observations from eyewitnesses about the car that drove the family into the guardrail.
We need a car every day.
It&#39;s difficult to take the children to daycare and go to work without it, says Tommi.
Tommi saw that the car was a white, old car.
It was probably from the late 1990s or early 2000s.
In his opinion, the beginning of the car&#39;s registration number was SIG.
If the culprit is not caught, I don&#39;t know how we will manage financially, even today we have to count every cent.
Tommi hopes that those who saw what happened or know something about it will contact the police.
The police department of It√§-Uusimaa and the rescue service of Central Uusimaa confirm that they have been on duty at the scene of the accident on Tuesday evening.
Headline and story corrected at 9:15 p.m.: Contrary to what was originally stated in the story, according to Tommi, the other car did not enter the oncoming lane, but drove from the acceleration lane into the side of the family&#39;s car.
The show, directed by Lotta J√§ppinen, deals with human relationships through humor - Self-revealer will be seen at the K√§√§? theater on Friday and Saturday
Lotta J√§ppinen from Kouvola brings her first directorial debut to the K√§√§? theater.
Self-revealer is a musical theater performance about relationships gone wrong and inadequacy.
According to director Lotta J√§ppinen, it still leaves a good feeling.
The subject is treated with humor.
You can&#39;t dwell on bad feelings, he says.
According to J√§ppinen, the touring summer theater performance was realized with a small budget and a big, young heart.
The name of the show challenges you to think about what a person reveals about himself when getting to know a new person.
Is he perhaps pulling a role or approaching someone else with his jacket open?
The plotless show mixes fact and fiction
J√§ppinen has both directed and dramatized the show.
He is also responsible for the lights.
The presentation consists of the texts of the working group and has no plot.
The director believes that although the show draws on the thoughts of young people, it speaks to people of all ages.
J√§ppinen emphasizes that the Self-Discloser does not directly tell about his own or the working group&#39;s interpersonal relationships.
Fact and fiction mix.
My own world of values will certainly be conveyed by the show.
I don&#39;t think that relationships are bad, but I also don&#39;t think that a relationship, especially a relationship, is a prerequisite for happiness.
Many learn from their divorced parents
J√§ppinen believes that Itsens√§paljastelija paints a current picture of young adults living in hundred-year-old Finland.
According to him, many have learned a lot about relationships from their parents, many of whom are divorced.
At least that you have to listen to yourself.
You don&#39;t have to stay in a bad relationship.
The show stars Minea L√•ng, Niklas Raut√©n and Otto Rokka.
The working group also includes Costume Designer Ella Snellman.
The music is arranged by J√§ppinen and Roka.
The love for theater was ignited in Kouvola
Lotta J√§ppinen, 26, from Kouvola, is studying theater expression at the Art Academy of Turku University of Applied Sciences.
Two years behind and another mokoma ahead.
J√§ppinen&#39;s enthusiasm for theater began during the Kouvola years.
The music class graduate has been an assistant at the Kouvola theater and acted, among other things, at the Ylioppilasteatteri in Helsinki and most recently at the Linnateatteri in Turku.
Steering has become more and more interesting.
Self-revealer had its premiere last week in Helsinki on Narri&#39;s stage.
In the future, the show, which lasts about 45 minutes, will also be seen at least in J√§ppinen&#39;s study city, Turku.
Self-revealer in Kouvola&#39;s Mik√§? theater on August 4. at 7 pm and 5.8. at 2 and 7 p.m.
The Finnish Olympic champion spent a year recovering from a terrible motocross accident - he broke his neck
Few athletes in Finland are the same unstoppable force of nature as Janne Lahtela.
The ace of kumparelasku toured the world hundreds of days a year for twenty years and chased his dream of Olympic gold.
The dream came true in 2002, but Lahtela&#39;s business continued.
He was not only a tireless practitioner, but also an experimenter of new sports.
There aren&#39;t many forms of exercise on earth that a Kemij√§rvi person hasn&#39;t tried at least once.
It has inspired me to practice.
There is always something new, Lahtela says.
In the end, one hobby was to stop Lahtela completely.
In 2014, Lahtela had a motocross accident.
As a result, his collarbone and both arms were broken.
I wasn&#39;t working anywhere.
I licked my wounds at home for a year, says Lahtela.
Lahtela had bad luck.
He also admits that age may have played a role in the crash.
Driving a Pr√§tka can sound wild.
But I didn&#39;t seek limits with it.
It&#39;s just that the sport is so hard that someone in her forties shouldn&#39;t do it too much!
After the accident, Lahtela found itself in a special situation.
His busy life stopped like a wall.
Behind him was a long start as the head coach of the Japanese freestyle national team.
Lahtela started at Pest right after finishing his own career in 2006.
For the first time since I was 15, I had to be in my place.
I didn&#39;t really do anything at all, Lahtela says.
Even during his training period, Lahtela often challenged his prot√©g√©s on the slopes and in physical tests.
Surprisingly, the stop was a good experience.
I was physically and mentally so tired that even my own thoughts didn&#39;t make sense.
Not even in the sport.
It was good to be still.
I actually enjoyed it because I really got to just be for once.
The mandatory break inspired Lahtela to become Finland&#39;s head coach.
Without stopping, he fears he would have burned out.
It is easier to find parts of the body that have been cut than intact ones!
Without the accident, I would not have realized that I needed rest so much.
Lahtela started coaching the Finnish national freestyle team about a year ago.
Around the same time, he found a safer hobby instead of speed sports.
I changed motocross to frisbee golf!
It came right out of the box.
At my worst, I was throwing seven hours a day.
Although Lahtela has always been a super-enthusiastic trainer herself, she does not require her trainees to be the same as her.
I don&#39;t force everyone into the same mold.
In our sports culture, there is room to be unique and ways to become the best in the world.
Freestyle is a free style, and the mentality has always been according to it, says Lahtela.
Sex robots are coming and we should be worried
It&#39;s here: a report on the evolution of technology in the sex-robot industry‚Äîjust when it was starting to feel like 2017 couldn&#39;t get any weirder.
Indeed.
Sex robots are a big deal now.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next 5-10 years.
&quot;We need to start getting serious about the proliferation of sex robots,&quot; says founding member of the foundation and Emeritus Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Noel Sharkey from the University of Sheffield.
Customers can choose the color of the robot&#39;s eyes, the shape of the nipples and the type of fingernails.
&quot;Sex robots are hyped, but they are already sold quite a lot, and we will see more of them,&quot; Sharkey said at the report&#39;s launch event.
Sex dolls have evolved from inflatable dolls to robots with warm-feeling silicone skin and features created by artificial intelligence that resemble human behavior.
The user can also adapt the robot to their own preferences, from the color of the eyes to the shape of the nipples and the type and color of the fingernails.
Even more troubling is that the robots have a ‚Äúpersonality‚Äù that makes the Stepford women look like progressive freedom fighters.
Sex dolls have evolved into robots with silicone skin.
For example, the character traits of the RealBotix robot can be adapted to the user&#39;s preferences, for example shyness.
True Companion&#39;s Roxxxy Gold robots have pre-programmed personalities: Frigid Farrah seems shy, Wild Wendy is adventurous, and so on.
&quot;Roxxxy Gold&#39;s personality adapts as perfectly as possible to the user&#39;s personality,&quot; the company&#39;s website advertises.
In other words, the robot likes the same things as the user.
It also has different moods:
it can be, for example, tired, chatty or &quot;in that mood&quot;.
The proliferation of sex robots has many worrying features. They replace real human relationships, but even more dangerous is the subjugation of women and outright rape fantasies when the user approaches, for example, a robot programmed to be shy and resistant.
On its website, True Companion compares the Roxxxy robot to a vibrator:
&quot;Women have vibrators. Why shouldn&#39;t men have a sex robot?&quot;
However, sex robots are not just a fetish or a new type of sex toy.
Their proliferation and development tells of something darker and deeper in our culture: a decline from gender equality towards sexual intercourse, where subjugation is one option among others.
Of course, the majority of men do not buy sex robots, and their popularity is still marginal, even though the FRR report indicated that they are growing in popularity.
Marginal phenomena, however, tell a lot about the spirit of the times.
And many people only start behaving strangely or offensively when the market allows it.
It is no coincidence that sex robots have started to become more common at the same time when women&#39;s rights are threatened in different parts of the world and a president is sitting in the White House who has bragged about harassing women.
In the TV series The Handmaid&#39;s Tale, the most disturbing thing is not its strong imagery, for example the images of hanged bodies and gouged out eyes. The most disturbing thing is how realistic the world of the series feels.
The Republic of Gilead is far from our reality, but right now it feels like a surprisingly short distance.
They try to make sex robots as much like real women (with the dimensions of porn stars) as is technically possible.
Robot developers want their skin to feel real and their movements to imitate human movements as well as possible.
However, their &quot;personalities&quot; are far from reality.
A robot cannot leave a relationship or situation.
They have no will of their own and no history ‚Äì nothing to suggest independence or violate the fantasy of total submission.
They are pleasant servants.
Slave girls.
The police suspect: two acts of terrorism were planned in Australia, the group was led by the head of ISIS
The head of the extremist organization Isis led a group of Australian men suspected of planning to plant a bomb on an Etihad Airways plane.
According to the Sydney Morning Herald, a person belonging to the leadership of ISIS had also sent building parts for the bomb to Sydney.
According to the suspicions, the bomb was supposed to be put on the plane on July 15, but the attempt was stopped before the security check.
The police do not say in more detail why the attempt was stopped.
Another plan of the suspected terrorists was to build a device that emits a poisonous colorless gas and take the device to a crowded public place, such as public transportation.
Australian Assistant Federal Commissioner Michael Phelan says the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever carried out in Australia.
Due to suspected terrorist plans, four men were arrested in police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but he is also being questioned.
Trump&#39;s good points?
Makes Mitt Romney look like the epitome of common sense
In the Trump era, it has already been repeated ad nauseam that the strong division of the electorate has also broken up families on an everyday level.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, advice columns in American newspapers provided guidance on how to get along with relatives who voted for Trump.
We all want to burst our information bubble.
Less noticed is Trump&#39;s ability to unite families.
I&#39;m telling you about this because my cousin visited me in New York this week. He is a left-leaning poet living in Chicago who has long been at odds with the Republicans of our generation.
He reminded us that a common enemy can have a powerful unifying effect.
Now that Trump is in the White House, everyone my cousin knows‚Äîincluding the pro-Republican sibling with whom he&#39;s argued about politics for decades‚Äîis suddenly and unexpectedly on the same side.
At the dinner table, it&#39;s a good thing, but on a larger scale, it comes with significant risks.
Trump has reinvigorated the left, but the distorting effect of his presidency may actually push us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and &quot;normalization,&quot; we&#39;re talking about the terrifying possibility that one day we&#39;ll no longer be horrified by his antics.
In the long term, there is an even scarier possibility that Trump will normalize the far-right Republicans, who suddenly seem quite reasonable compared to Trump.
I wistfully recall Mitt Romney&#39;s restrained version of insanity: a dog on the roof of a car, a 14 percent income tax (and we&#39;ve seen his tax returns anyway). Compared to Trump, they seem like very minor violations.
With the Trump era over, all the next Republican presidential candidate needs to do is be clear-headed, and that immediately feels like a significant improvement.
When my cousin was visiting me, we took our children to the Keskuspuisto carousel. It&#39;s the largest carousel in the New York City Parks Department and the best thing you can get in New York for three dollars without caffeine.
The merry-go-round horses are huge, the characters in the middle ‚Äì grim clowns and animals looking back in terror ‚Äì are ominous, and the tinkling music in the background is strangely fascinating.
Over time, many of New York&#39;s characteristic districts turn into disappointments: the views from tall buildings become boring, the city skyline becomes too familiar and the reality of the city does not match the dreams.
And I still, after 35 years, haven&#39;t quite gotten over the fact that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss cottage but a large roundabout in North London. Ye Olde Swiss Cottage may be a pub with a Swiss spirit, but it doesn&#39;t count.
The carousel in Keskuspuisto, on the other hand, is still a strangely magical experience - even to the extent that two two-year-olds, one eleven-year-old and two women in their forties enjoyed it enormously.
I would have given the carousel full marks if someone had asked for my review, but luckily no one came to ask.
Instead, this week at a department store I was asked to rate my ‚Äúpayment experience‚Äù on a scale of one to five stars before I put my credit card in the reader.
The same thing at the coffee shop around my home, but there they also give me the option to add a 15 percent service fee to the estimate when I go to pick up a coffee from the counter myself.
This slows down everyday interaction and puts pressure on the customer service person to put their personality into play in a situation where it is not needed.
The saleswoman at the department store smiled apologetically when I tiredly gave the experience of using my credit card five stars.
Shefki Kuqi was fired from Inter - &quot;There was no trust of the management&quot;
FC Inter has today released Shefki Kuq from the duties of coach of the club&#39;s representative team.
Fabrizio Piccareta, who was previously an assistant coach, will take over the coaching responsibility.
The rest of the coaching team will continue in their current roles.
The Italian Piccareta has worked as an assistant coach in the past, for example, in the English Sunderland.
The 51-year-old Piccareta, who joined Inter&#39;s coaching staff in January, completed his UEFA Pro license last year.
FC Inter&#39;s board chairman Stefan H√•kans regrets what happened.
Changing coaches is never an easy or pleasant task.
However, Shefki Kuq no longer had the trust of the club&#39;s management, so there was no other option, H√•kans commented in the club&#39;s press release.
Piccareta&#39;s contract is valid until the end of the season.
Together with the rest of the coaching team, he is already responsible for tomorrow&#39;s home match against HIFK.
According to Ilta-Sanomi&#39;s information, the team has been buzzing all Thursday.
Kuqi told the players on Thursday morning that the club&#39;s assistant coaches Piccareta and John Allen have been moved aside.
Kuqi and Piccareta clashed strongly in Inter&#39;s match against PS Kemi last Saturday.
Linda Lampenius published a photo of her youth from the 80s - would you recognize a serious violin student?
Violinist Linda Lampenius published a photo of her youth on Instagram.
Several hashtags have been added to the picture, based on which it can be concluded that the musician in the picture is a 16-year-old student of the Sibelius Academy.
Lampenius himself seriously wonders at the young woman looking at the camera.
A long time ago, seriously, he messages.
If the image is not visible, you can view it here.
Lampenius has previously published pictures of his past and also talked about painful topics.
More than a year ago, he published a couple of pictures of himself on Instagram.
In one picture she is seen 20 years ago, in the other she is posing now, as a mother of two children.
In his caption, Lampenius reflects on his own growth as a person and refers to the eating disorders he suffered from when he was younger.
Exactly 20 years ago and today...
I still look a lot like that 26-year-old girl, but the difference is that I&#39;ve learned to like myself and the way I look, Lampenius wrote.
After the text, she had added the hashtags in English: life, eating disorder, insecure, self-confidence, self-esteem, love yourself, 1996, 2016, aging, girl, woman, aging is cool.
Lampenius has spoken openly about his eating disorders in previous years.
He was already in the hospital at the age of 14 because of anorexia and orthorexia.
A little later, she also fell ill with bulimia, which was finally revealed only in 2006.
The healing began little by little.
In addition to therapy and peer support, Lampenius was helped by a new love.
Oscar Pistorius was sent from prison to hospital due to chest pains
This is the second time Pistorius has been taken from prison to hospital.
Last year, he received hospital treatment for cuts on his wrists, which prison officials say he suffered after falling in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after prosecutors appealed the original manslaughter verdict.
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine&#39;s Day in 2013 by firing several shots through the toilet door at his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed he mistook his girlfriend for a nocturnal intruder hiding in the toilet.
Prosecutors have said they plan to appeal again, as they consider Pistorius&#39; six-year sentence too lenient.
The Attorney General plans to appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the appeal may be heard as early as this year.
If the appeal is accepted, Pistorius&#39; sentence could be extended to 15 years.
The death penalty is not used in South Africa.
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians who had camped illegally were arrested in Greece, the country&#39;s foreign ministry announced, according to the bTV channel.
The police arrested a number of people who had camped illegally in Sithonia on the morning of August 1. Among the campers were two Bulgarians.
They were released the same day, but the investigation of the case continues.
According to television channel bTV, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs later announced that it had released the Bulgarians.
The Greek authorities have tightened the rules on free camping sites and are already issuing significant fines to anyone who camps outside of designated areas.
Inspections will continue until the end of the season.
The ministry announced that the court may impose a fine.
Neste&#39;s share sinks - already down -7.7%
The oil refiner Neste&#39;s share has sunk 7.7 percent around 11 o&#39;clock.
Its pre-tax profit fell but beat a forecast compiled by Inquiry Financial.
The stock market has started today slightly below freezing, both in Finland and in other parts of Europe.
Shortly after the stock markets opened, the broad European Stoxx 600 index had fallen by 0.2 percent.
After about half an hour of trading, the Helsinki Stock Exchange&#39;s general index OMXH had fallen by 0.3 percent to 9,509.48 points, and the OMXH25 of the most traded companies had fallen by 0.3 percent.
The stock exchange&#39;s total turnover was 41 million euros, of which nine million belonged to the morning&#39;s earnings announcer, Nestett.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate may relieve irritable bowel syndrome
Red meat and chocolate may sound like nightmares for your digestive system.
However, a recent study claims the opposite: a diet rich in meat protein and dairy products may ease irritable bowel syndrome.
Irritable bowel syndrome is an incurable condition that affects around 1.3 million people in the US and 300,000 people in the UK. It causes abdominal cramps, bloating, frequent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss, and extreme fatigue.
People with irritable bowel syndrome are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products. However, researchers at the University of Washington discovered that tryptophan, an essential amino acid contained in protein, helps the body develop immune cells that strengthen the intestinal tolerance.
According to Marco Colonna, the leader of the study, immune cells guard the intestine and ensure that harmful microbes hidden in food do not enter the body.
Cells that cause inflammation are balanced by cells that strengthen tolerance. They protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance falls too close to inflammation, the result can be irritable bowel syndrome.
In the experiments, it was found that mice with certain bacteria in their intestines have immune cells that strengthen tolerance.
The bacterium in question needs tryptophan so that immune cells start to appear. Tryptophan is one of the building blocks of proteins.
&quot;We found a connection between Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria and the development of cells that promote tolerance. Lactobacillus reuteri is part of the normal microbiome of the intestine,&quot; says Professor Colonna.
&quot;The more tryptophan the mice had in their diet, the more immune cells they had.&quot;
If the same works in humans, the combination of Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria and a diet rich in tryptophan can strengthen intestinal tolerance and reduce inflammation sensitivity.
Studying immunity-boosting immune cells, researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan found that while one group of mice had such cells, mice of the same species that were kept separate from the other group did not.
He suspected that the difference was related to the mice&#39;s gut microbiomes, or the normal community of bacteria, fungi and viruses in the digestive tract.
When the mice&#39;s gut DNA was examined, six species of bacteria were found that were present in the mice with immune cells, but not in the other mice.
When Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria were given to mice raised in a sterile environment with no gut microbiome and no immune cells developed, they began to develop immune cells.
The researchers wanted to find out how bacteria affect the immune system. They grew Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria in liquid and transferred small amounts of liquid ‚Äì without bacteria ‚Äì to immature immune cells isolated from mice.
Immune cells developed into cells that strengthen tolerance.
When the active ingredient was purified from the liquid, it turned out to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism, known as indole-3-lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice&#39;s diet, the number of cells that strengthen endurance increased by about 50 percent. When the amount of tryptophan was halved, the number of cells halved.
According to Cervantes-Barragan, humans have the same immune-boosting cells as mice, and most of us have Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria in our digestive tracts.
It is not yet known whether tryptophan byproducts from Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria cause cells to develop in the same way in humans as in mice. However, genetic defects related to tryptophan have been found in people with irritable bowel syndrome.
&quot;We probably want to promote the development of such cells, because they regulate the inflammation on the inner surfaces of the intestines,&quot; says Cervantes-Barragan.
&quot;The high level of tryptophan combined with Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria may contribute to their proliferation.&quot;
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United got a &quot;genius&quot; in their ranks after signing Nemanja Matic
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United got a &quot;genius&quot; in their ranks after signing Nemanja Matic. The midfielder made his debut for Manchester United in the match against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
Matic, a ¬£40m move from Chelsea, started in the 2-1 win in Dublin, United&#39;s final pre-season game before their UEFA Super Cup clash with Real Madrid on Tuesday. He impressed as a defensive midfielder against stars like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira.
However, Matic was not yet in top form as he was not involved in the blue shirts&#39; pre-season tour of Asia. He managed only 45 minutes on the field - according to Mourinho, that has to change before the start of the Premier League season.
&quot;He needs time, but his experience, his intelligence and his way of thinking make him a genius - he has an innate ability to think about football,&quot; says Mourinho.
&quot;We&#39;re helping him be ready sooner rather than later.&quot;
In addition to Matic, newcomers Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku were also starting the game at the Aviva Stadium when Mourinho began filing his starting line-up for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wants three more new players, despite the club having already done a &quot;brilliant job&quot; of signing three of his four preferred players.
&quot;Three out of four - you have to thank the club for that,&quot; he added.
&quot;I&#39;ll be more satisfied if I get all four, but they did an excellent job.&quot;
The volleyball women bullied Germany for two sets
The Finnish women&#39;s national volleyball team lost their fourth match of the World Cup qualifying tournament to Germany straight away 0-3 (23-25, 23-25, 14-25).
Germany&#39;s routine level of playing is high.
Their game was even in every sector, Finland&#39;s head coach Tapio Kangasniemi said in the press release.
In the first two sets, Finland kept their opponents tight, but in the third set, Germany was clearly stronger.
Germany leads the group.
When we played patiently and aggressively enough in certain places, we were able to play along, Kangasniemi said.
The most efficient player in Finland was Piia Korhonen, who collected 14 points.
Having lost three out of four matches, Finland will face Slovenia again on Sunday.
Reuters: Grand jury already sent subpoenas related to Trump Jr.&#39;s meeting with Russia
A grand jury in the United States has issued subpoenas regarding the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.
The grand jury convened by special prosecutor Robert Mueller has already issued subpoenas regarding the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and Natalia Veselnitskaya, a Russian lawyer known for her ties to the Kremlin.
This is reported by the news agency Reuters, which at the same time confirms the information revealed by the Wall Street Journal earlier on Thursday about the summoning of the grand jury.
According to Reuters, a grand jury has issued subpoenas related to a meeting between Trump Jr. and Veselnitskaya, known for her Kremlin connections, which took place in the middle of the US presidential election in June 2016.
Donald Trump Sr.&#39;s campaign manager at the time, Paul Manafort, and his son-in-law, current White House adviser Jared Kushner, were also present.
According to Reuters sources, the fact that special prosecutor Robert Mueller has convened a grand jury in Washington means that the pace of the Russia investigation is intensifying.
Sources add that Mueller wanted a grand jury to assist in the investigation, which aims to find out about Russian interference in the US presidential election and whether the Trump campaign or his inner circle cooperated with Russia in the case.
A grand jury expands Mueller&#39;s powers to gather evidence, issue subpoenas and compel people to testify under oath.
A grand jury is a group of ordinary citizens who work behind closed doors.
The grand jury will weigh the evidence uncovered by the prosecutor in the investigation and decide whether charges should be brought in the case.
A British inventor microchipped himself to get into his home and car with a wave of his hand
A British inventor has become the first in the country to microchip himself so that he can open the front door of his home, enter his office and start his car with a wave of his hand.
The microchip is between the thumb and forefinger of 33-year-old Steven Northam. Now he offers a service to companies and individuals who want to make their lives easier with the technology of Northam&#39;s BioTeq company.
Northam is working with Geoff Watson, a consultant anesthetist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the microchip is medically compliant.
The microchip uses the same technology as cat and dog microchips and takes just 30 seconds to install.
Northam&#39;s company also makes house and car locks compatible with the microchip. Processing one lock costs ¬£300.
Northam is married with one child. He has installed microchip technology in both his home and his BMW Z4, which starts when he puts his hands on the steering wheel.
The White House exhibit cost taxpayers thousands of dollars
The White House&#39;s decision last month to fly a Navy helicopter onto the South Lawn of the White House for an event showcasing American manufacturing cost taxpayers $24,000. The information appears in military documents obtained by TIME magazine.
The green and white Sikorsky VH-3D helicopter is called Marine One when the president is aboard. It was the highlight of an event held at the White House on July 17, 2017, where American construction programs were presented.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and a host of White House officials toured products from all 50 states.
In addition to a helicopter made in Connecticut, the exhibits included a sailboat from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi.
The White House military office had requested the helicopter to the scene with a mission-specific order just about 36 hours before it was due to land on the South Lawn for an &quot;extraordinary&quot; event. This is evident from the documents of the Navy&#39;s HMX-1 helicopter squadron.
&quot;I just wanted to make sure you are aware of the matter because it is an extraordinary event that is getting a lot of visibility,&quot; the commander of the HMX-1 unit wrote in an email the day before the event to his superior, who is the Deputy Commandant of Naval Aviation.
The message said that the helicopter would arrive at the southern grass field on July 17. at seven in the morning and the event would start at three in the afternoon. The helicopter would leave the scene only after the grass field was cleared between six and nine in the evening.
In addition, the message mentioned that if the helicopter&#39;s departure from the White House was delayed, another crew would be needed due to service time restrictions.
The original crew was on board the helicopter during the incident, and unit security personnel were with the helicopter while it was on the ground.
From the documents obtained by TIME magazine, it is not clear whether a second crew was needed in the end.
The US Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.
According to the documents, HMX-1 inquired whether the event violated the law.
‚ÄúOne of our questions was whether there was a violation of the Hatch Act. We were told not to break,&quot; the commander wrote.
&quot;Sounds like you can participate,&quot; the deputy commandant replied.
Made in America was an official White House event, so it was not covered by the Hatch Act.
But even official events have political overtones.
At the event, the president spoke in favor of the health care reform that was being considered by the Senate at the time, as well as looser state regulation.
The use of Marine One and Air Force One for political purposes is not a new phenomenon.
Presidents must wear them when they travel,
but using them only for photographs is unusual.
Trump&#39;s actions drew attention in February when Air Force One taxied into the background of the president&#39;s campaign event in Melbourne, Florida. Trump has strongly criticized his predecessor&#39;s use of the presidential plane on Twitter.
&quot;The White House is very pleased with the Made in America event, which showcased products made by American workers from American materials in all 50 states,&quot; said White House Press Secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews regularly conduct training flights in the Washington area and practice on the South Lawn bringing the president to the White House to within centimeters.
While Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 made 58 practice landings at the White House.
According to one official, the flights to the Made in America event were part of the crew&#39;s monthly training quota.
On that day, the unit&#39;s helicopters were also flown for 11 hours in &quot;non-presidential support missions&quot;.
According to the White House, the event caused no other costs to taxpayers.
Sikorsky&#39;s spokesperson said that the company was not involved in organizing the presentation of the helicopter on the south lawn of the White House.
HMX-1 has no records of flights related to the president&#39;s duties, and an accurate estimate of the event&#39;s expenses is difficult.
According to the Department of Defense&#39;s 2017 hourly compensation, the compensation level for the VH-3D helicopter is $24,380 per flight hour.
According to HMX-1 documents, flights from the Quantico base in Virginia to the White House and back took a total of one hour.
According to the White House, the operating costs of the helicopter are clearly lower.
&quot;Calculating the costs to taxpayers according to the compensation level is misleading,&quot; says Walters.
&quot;The estimated compensation level includes personnel, maintenance and many other so-called sunk costs that are taken into account in the annual appropriations.&quot;
According to a 2015 study by the research firm RAND, compensation levels do not include personnel costs, but do take into account fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
Around the time of the event, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of a helicopter at the event.
&quot;The idea is to showcase American production,&quot; Spicer said.
‚ÄúI know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud to be involved in ensuring national security and probably employ hundreds or thousands of people as a result.
And I think, like most Americans, we are proud of the helicopter and other defense equipment that many Americans have worked so hard for.
It is completely appropriate to bring it up.&quot;
It is not certain if Trump was in the helicopter during the event, but at least he sat in the driver&#39;s seat of the fire truck.
In the White House, Trump joked to the press about his own Sikorsky fleet.
&quot;I know Sikorsky very well,&quot; the president said. ‚ÄúI have three of them.‚Äù
Lightning struck the Vaasan railway - the trains have to be replaced by buses
The passenger train service between Sein√§joki and Vaasa is interrupted due to a technical fault, the Rail Transport Center reports.
Trains will be replaced by buses for the time being.
The fault in the traffic control system was caused by thunder.
In the morning, the Finnish Railways Center still had no estimate of the duration of the repair.
Venezuela&#39;s state prosecutor claims the right to block the appointment of the country&#39;s new representative council
Venezuela&#39;s state prosecutor has sought a court ruling that would prevent the country from appointing a new representative council.
Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has announced that the representative council elected in last Sunday&#39;s vote is to be appointed on Friday.
In the controversial vote, a representative council was elected for the country, which can, among other things, change the country&#39;s constitution.
According to Chief Prosecutor Luisa Ortega, the blocking decision has been requested due to suspicions of election fraud.
Ortega has also started an election fraud investigation into the vote.
He appointed two judges to the post after the British company that organized the House of Representatives vote said that the results had been manipulated.
According to the company, the number of voters reported by the Venezuelan authorities was about one million higher than the number of actual voters.
Only Maduro&#39;s allies were nominated for the House of Representatives, and the elected 545-member House of Representatives includes, among others, Maduro&#39;s son and wife.
In addition to changing the constitution, the House of Representatives can dissolve the opposition-led Congress and change laws.
Maduro has been described as a dictator
Maduro&#39;s actions have been widely condemned.
The opposition sees amending the constitution as Maduro&#39;s way to strengthen his position.
The US has imposed sanctions on Maduro and called him a dictator.
The European Union, Great Britain, Mexico, Colombia and Argentina have announced that they will not recognize the new representative council.
Maduro claims that the new representative council is the solution to the country&#39;s political and economic crisis.
The unrest in Venezuela has been going on for months.
Numerous people have been wounded in them and more than a hundred have died.
Venezuela was plunged into an economic crisis after the price of oil fell.
Now many people cannot afford food or medicine.
The opposition is also expected to demonstrate on Friday, when the new representative council is supposed to begin.
The Russian man extradited by Finland was sentenced to 4 years in prison in the United States
On Thursday, the Minneapolis court in the United States sentenced 41-year-old Maksim Senah to almost four years in prison for his involvement in a global computer scam.
Senah was arrested in Finland in August 2015 as a result of the US demand.
According to the Russian newspaper Fontanka, Senah had been on vacation in Finland.
The Finnish border authorities arrested him when he was returning home.
Finland handed over Senah to the US judicial authorities in February 2016, despite the objections of the Russians, reports news agency AFP.
In March of this year, he was found guilty of computer fraud that had benefited millions of dollars.
Senah received 46 months in prison.
According to the US Department of Justice, Senah will be deported after serving his prison sentence.
The Russian Foreign Ministry strongly criticized Finland after the arrest and said that the man must not be extradited to the United States.
In the statement, Finland and the United States were criticized for the fact that the arrest was made in Finland without Russia knowing about it in advance.
According to the prosecutor, Senah had used a computer virus called Ebury, which infected tens of thousands of computers around the world.
Usernames and passwords were fished with the help of the virus.
Fraudsters then used the information to redirect internet traffic, which was used to create click scams and spread spam.
Acting Director of the Crime Department of the Ministry of Justice. according to director Kenneth Blanco, the case shows that the United States is capable of pursuing cybercriminals operating in other countries as well.
We have the ability and desire to identify, find and bring them to justice, Blanco said in the press release.

Kari Kola realizes an exceptional light art work in Paris
Joensuu-based light artist Kari Kola (pictured) will create an exceptional light art work in honor of the first Light Day established by the UN in Paris next year on May 16.
Kola is making a light art work in Paris called Day and Night.
The themes of the work are light and darkness - day and night - sun and moon.
The work illuminates the UNESCO headquarters Fontenoy building and the Globe monument in front of it.
With my work, I want to emphasize not only light but also darkness.
Today, light pollution in cities of millions is a significant problem that affects the well-being of all of us.
With the help of my art, I can make things I find important visible in a tangible way, says light artist Kari Kola about her work.
I am very pleased with the invitation to participate in the first international Day of Light and to bring light art as part of the theme day, Kola continues.
Kari Kola was involved in the opening of Valo&#39;s theme year in 2015, when he lit up the UNESCO headquarters in honor of the holiday.
I feel very privileged to be able to implement my art again at the UNESCO headquarters, says Kari Kola.
The work may still expand significantly.
We will inform about this later during the coming autumn, Kola continues.
The goal of the International Day of Light is to highlight the importance of light for humanity and increase people&#39;s awareness of the fields of science, art, culture and sustainable development.
For the first time, the Day of Light will be celebrated at the UNESCO headquarters in the center of Paris on May 16.
Two men fought in the parking garage of a shopping center in Espoo
Two men had an argument in the parking garage of the Iso Omena shopping center in Espoo on Wednesday morning.
According to the parties, the dispute started when the other party accidentally drove in the forbidden direction.
A verbal dispute arose between the drivers.
The driver driving in the prohibited direction would yell at the driver of the other car, as a result of which his car started moving and collided with the hitman&#39;s car.
After that, he hit the hood of the car that hit him.
In the preliminary interview, the man has admitted that he caused the damage and that he did something wrong.
An article from Timo Soin titled with a question mark: &quot;After that came the flood&quot;
Foreign Minister Timo Soini (retired) published a blog post on Thursday, which is titled with a question mark.
The writing is short, only two sentences long.
During my time, the party grew from zero to a governing party of thirty-seven MPs.
After that there was a flood, now everything floats, Soini writes.
Soin&#39;s text has references to 18th century France.
King Louis XV or his mistress Madame de Pompadour are known to have used the flood simile.
Depending on the interpretation, the statements &quot;the flood after us&quot; or &quot;the flood after me&quot; have gone down in the history books.
According to the UN, Afghanistan&#39;s democracy depends on the political role of women
Elections are representative only if all members of society, including women, can vote in them, said the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, interim head of the UN aid mission, stated that there are hundreds of women running in the provincial council elections, three women are running for vice president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
&quot;The role of women cannot be overemphasized,&quot; Haysom said in a statement Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate fully and are included in all parts of the electoral process.
Afghanistan&#39;s provincial council and presidential elections will be held on April 5, 2017.
The Taliban have issued threats about the election at a time when international forces are moving into an advisory role.
This year&#39;s elections will be the first time that power has passed peacefully from one democratically elected government to another.
Haysom said the contribution of women strengthens Afghanistan&#39;s democracy.
According to Afghanistan&#39;s Independent Election Commission, out of 3.6 million registered voters, 1.2 million are women.

The influx of certain types of tourists is a threat to the region&#39;s culture
The authorities are considering limiting the number of tourists in Venice.
The anger of the locals is directed especially at the form of tourism represented by cruise ships.
The Italian Minister of Culture calls it &quot;eat and flee&quot; tourism: you only spend a few hours at the destination and rush through the sights in large groups.
Venice is choked with tourists taking quick day trips to the city.
It is difficult to move through the narrow streets and the beautiful squares are so full of visitors that the residents of Venice can no longer fit in.
They have been forced to move further and further away from the historic center, while their homes have been replaced by hotels.
The New York Times and The Guardian write about the problems brought by tourism in Venice.
The authorities are considering restrictions on the number of tourists.
They call the current phenomenon low-quality tourism.
When arriving on a large cruise ship, two or three hours are given.
You follow a guide holding a flag from Piazzale Roma to the Rialto Bridge and St. Mark&#39;s Square, and you turn back, describes the prevailing and problematic tourism, Italian Minister of Culture Dario Franceschini.
The beauty of Italian cities is not only in the architecture, but also in the functioning of the place, shops and workshops.
We need to preserve this part of the cities&#39; identity.
Saint Mark&#39;s Square is also one of the most popular places to visit in the historical center of Venice.
St. Mark&#39;s Church is located on the edge of the square.
Also, the anger of the locals is mainly aimed at cruise ships.
Only 50,000 locals live in the historic center of Venice.
In 1951, there were approximately 175,000 inhabitants.
In July, an estimated 2,000 Venetians demonstrated against mass tourism.
According to them, tourism has weakened their quality of life, destroys the environment and drives residents away.
About 2,000 residents leave every year.
If this continues, in a few years Venice will be nothing but tourists.
It would be a social, anthropological and historical disaster, says Carlo Belframe, who organized the demonstration.
The equation is difficult, as the ships bring much-needed income to Venice and create the need for numerous jobs in various fields.
In addition to limiting the number of tourists, the solution is that the cruise ships would go further away from the historic center.
According to Luciano Bortot, who lives in Venice, the situation would certainly change if the administrative region of Veneto, where Venice is also located, got more power to decide its own affairs - if not full autonomy.
About 20-30 million tourists visit Venice every year.
Are you driving towards Kuopio?
On the highway, bad traffic jams lasting kilometers
The northbound lane on the highway between Kuopio and Siilinj√§rvi has been jammed for kilometers on the way back from work on Thursday afternoon.
In the area, highway resurfacing work is being done, which slows down traffic, says Savon Sanomat.
For road works, there is a 50 km/h speed limit instead of the usual 120 km/h.
Even in the 50-kilometer restricted area, traffic had progressed on Thursday afternoon at practically walking speed in some places.
Roadworks progressed on Thursday afternoon on the Siilinj√§rvi side at the Ilmestys statue, i.e. the golden deer.
I get along fine without that kind of attention
The 23-year-old runner has had to notice the curses of publicity.
Amalie Iuel has published wonderful pictures of herself in the landscapes of the Grand Canyon, among others.
Danish-Norwegian Amalie Iuel has become a popular athlete in her current home country of Norway, not least because in March she broke the 26-year-old Norwegian record in the 400-meter run by completing a lap of the track in 51.81.
A month later, he improved the Norwegian record time of 55:38 in the 400-meter hurdles.
Iuel, who uses social media a lot, noticed soon after his records that fame and publicity have their downsides.
Men from all over the world started sending Iuel pictures of their genitals, apparently in the hope that the young runner would be interested in them.
Iuel was forced to close his Snapchat account from outsiders.
I received a lot of &quot;shocking photos&quot; from unknown people, so I had to change my account to private, Iuel told VG magazine.
In an interview with VG, Iuel did not want to specify exactly what kind of pictures he received.
You can probably guess, Iuel laughed.
It&#39;s nice to get feedback after a run, but I can get by without that kind of attention.
Iuel was born in Denmark in 1994.
His mother is Danish, father Danish-Norwegian.
Iuel&#39;s family moved to Norway when Amalie was 2 years old.
When Amalie was 12 years old, the family moved first to Namibia, then to Pakistan because of the father&#39;s work.
After that, it was Dubai, Thailand and the United States.
Iuel spent four years as a university athlete (University of Southern California) in Los Angeles, from where he returned to Norway.
In June 2015, he changed his Danish citizenship to Norwegian citizenship.
In Norway, Iuel trains under the guidance of three coaches, namely Leif Olav Alnes, Karsten Warholm and Elisabeth Slettum.
In Norway, people are much more open to discussion than in the United States.
In the US, coaches don&#39;t ask anything, they just give orders.
In Norway, the coach has much more time to personally deal with the athlete, Iuel told VG.
Amalie Iuel holds the Norwegian records in 400 meters and 400 meters hurdles.
A foot injury put snowboarder Janne Korve&#39;s entire career in the balance - now participating in the World Championships: &quot;It&#39;s nice when it doesn&#39;t hurt anything&quot;
Now it has been nice to count when nothing has happened!
Janne Korpi, 31, one of Finland&#39;s most successful snowboarders, has been able to really enjoy his beloved sport again this season.
As recently as last summer, the continuation of his career was at stake.
A stress injury to the foot had forced Korve to the operating table in January, and the foot did not want to heal at all.
The hand had also taken a hit on the race slope.
In the summer, I didn&#39;t know what I was doing, whether I would continue to board or not.
The sponsorship deals were on hold and many things were open, Korpi says.
But that&#39;s what they say, things tend to work out.
The leg got better, the sponsor extended the contract for two years, and the blood started to draw again to the slope.
The decision to continue was easy after that.
I knew it at the latest when I went on the snow for the first time.
I was like, damn, yes this is so much fun again, let&#39;s drag it out for a couple more seasons.
Korpi was only able to land properly in September-October, but after a long break in land, simply training pain-free has been a big deal.
Korpi has toured only a few competitions.
It does not matter.
Competitions have never been the most important aspect of boarding for Korvelle.
I have never counted because of one race.
I think it&#39;s frustrating to aim for one race for four years, and then you&#39;re in a fever that week.
I can&#39;t bear to think like that, Korpi says.
Today, Korpi competes in the halfpipe of the World Championships held in Sierra Nevada, Spain.
Even if individual competitions don&#39;t keep him involved in boarding, he always gets fired up about competing in a tough company.
According to Korve, the popularity of the competitions organized by the International Skiing Federation has grown in recent years, even though some snowboarders chose the Norwegian X-Games held at the same time.
Yes, these are important competitions, the visibility is big.
However, in my opinion, the rating always depends on what kind of conditions and what kind of level the games are.
Korpi is the oldest athlete of Finland&#39;s 12-member team in Sierra Nevada.
The mainstays of the team, 17-year-old Rene Rinnekangas and Emmi Parkkisenniemi, are 14 years younger than Korpea.
It&#39;s nice to watch the progress of the younger guys.
I remember when I was at that stage myself, when everything was new and I was so sickly excited about everything.
It also brings new energy to yourself, Korpi thinks.
On the slope, I can still somehow keep up, but otherwise not, that&#39;s how much power the guys have!
Janne Korpi has also built a different kind of sports career in the background of his boarding career.
The son of guide legend Pekka Korve is hooked on trotting: the boarder has his own trotting horses, for which he makes training programs.
When I&#39;m traveling all the time, I don&#39;t have time to be at the trade fair anymore.
But every day I at least look at the nutrition results and usually some results as well, says Korpi.
According to Korvi, trotting guidance and trotting coaching are a potential career plan when the boarding career comes to an end.
I don&#39;t feel like planning that far, but it&#39;s at least a likely option.
I feel like I&#39;m studying it here along with snowboarding.
I&#39;m trying to keep up with the times and develop, maybe I&#39;ll do some starts in the summer.
If it&#39;s my future profession, then it&#39;s not difficult to start when you&#39;re already in the sport.
The trotting stories also include the Elitloppet trotting cruise organized with host Jaajo Linnonmaa.
The two have rented a cruise ship, which will head to Stockholm for the Elitloppet trotting competition at the end of May.
Korpi and Linnonmaa decided to revive the old tradition.
The cruise has sold well, and people have been excited.
Now we are already at the point where at least there will be no bankruptcy.
There are still a few months to go, let&#39;s hope that the ship will be full, says Korpi excitedly.
Attendo&#39;s nursing home project for Kitee has surprised everyone
Attendo Esteri is the name of the new, 41-bed care home for the elderly to be built in Kitee.
A building with more than 1,700 square meters will be completed by next summer on the other side of Terveysti, the neighbor of the health center.
A common cause of wonder in Kite is where there will be enough clients for the new care unit, because now during the Siu wars, many private nursing homes are suffering from a lack of clients.
Regional Director of Care Services Anne Flink from Attendo commented that in the future, Kitee will have more demand not only for alternatives but also for enhanced serviced housing.
All kinds of services are needed, and when there are alternatives, freedom of choice also works better, says Flink.
Attendo bought the private care homes Kanervikkola and Eerika from Kitee last year.
The deal was about business, but the properties are known to have a five-year lease.
Flink says that Attendo does not have an acute need to move operations out of these facilities.
More on that later today.
GMB is concerned about the continued operation of the Scottish factory of the McVitie&#39;s brand
The union is seeking confirmation from the managers of the McVitie&#39;s biscuit manufacturer for a long-term commitment to production at the Glasgow factory.
According to the Scottish branch of the British general union GMB, the company has not disclosed its plans for the future of the Tollcross factory.
The factory that produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits and other products has more than 500 employees.
The Pladis company, which owns the McVitie&#39;s brand, said it had invested more than five million pounds in the factory in recent years.
The company added that employees and union representatives &quot;will certainly be the first to be told&quot; if there are changes to operations.
In its letter to the factory manager, GMB urges the company to &quot;respond to the concern that no funding has been allocated for the modernization of the production lines&quot;.
Drew Duffy of the GMB trade union finds it very worrying that the factory manager does not get clear information about Tollcross&#39;s business needs and future investment plans.
‚ÄúFamilies have worked here for generations, and the workforce is strongly concentrated in the local community and the Glasgow metropolitan area. The factory is a significant employer in an area with high unemployment and poor livelihoods.
From the point of view of jobs, wages and livelihoods, as well as Brexit, the rising cost of living and the continued downsizing of production, East Glasgow badly needs a successful McVitie&#39;s production.‚Äù
According to a Pladis spokesperson, the plant manager had only received the union&#39;s letter the day before and the company is responding to the letter directly because it values continuous interaction with employees and union representatives.
‚ÄúWe had a regular meeting with workers and GMB representatives in Tollcross two months ago where we openly discussed a number of issues.
We discussed with the employees, among other things, that like other companies operating in highly competitive and uncertain markets, we constantly evaluate all our business operations and locations in order to maintain our competitiveness.&quot;
According to the spokesperson, the company has invested more than ¬£5 million in the Tollcross factory in recent years, especially in its production lines and operational improvements.
&quot;We are aware of Tollcross&#39;s long history as a production plant, and we will certainly be the first to tell the employees and union representatives if we intend to make changes to the operation of the factory.&quot;
Did PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar transfer three years ago?
LaLiga may regret interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain are not giving up on their pursuit of Neymar after paying a ¬£189m transfer fee to end the deal. But did PSG warn Barcelona of a record transfer three years ago?
The sensational transfer is the most talked about case of the summer. The French Ligue 1 football team is ready to break the world record for transfer fees. The previous record was less than half that: it was set when Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United for a transfer fee of ¬£89 million.
Following the move, Neymar will become the world&#39;s most expensive footballer and also the world&#39;s highest-paid professional athlete, with PSG offering him over ¬£500,000 a week after tax.
Barcelona are known to be furious with PSG&#39;s actions and the way Neymar has been forced out of the club. A source close to Barcelona says the club have taken very good care of Neymar since he arrived at Santos in 2013.
Did the PSG chairman warn the football world about this move three years ago?
When Manchester City announced their interest in Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned clubs chasing PSG&#39;s top players.
&quot;I&#39;m not worried because they know that if they target our players, we will become their opponents and contact their players,&quot; Al-Khelaifi said.
&quot;We respect all clubs.
But if they molest our players, they will have to face the consequences.&quot;
Barcelona appear to be guilty of doing just that, expressing interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not let the Italian leave under any circumstances. It could very well be that Barcelona will lose their star player Neymar because of this.

NOW: Trump&#39;s glowing calls were made up - White House spokesman: &quot;I wouldn&#39;t say it was a lie&quot;
The White House admits that the two phone calls mentioned by US President Donald Trump never happened, reports the New York Times magazine.
Trump&#39;s incensed phone calls with both the Mexican president and the head of the scouting organization have turned out to be made up.
White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed that no calls had taken place.
However, he said that Trump was not lying.
According to Sanders, many of the Boy Scouts&#39; leaders spoke to Trump personally, and Trump had talked with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto at the G20 meeting in Hamburg.
I wouldn&#39;t say it was a lie, that&#39;s a pretty harsh accusation.
Those conversations happened, they didn&#39;t just happen on the phone but face to face, Sanders argued.
The speech to the scouts aroused disapproval
Trump said on Monday that the president of Mexico called him and praised Trump&#39;s success in eradicating illegal immigration.
According to Trump, Pena Nieto said that few people cross the southern border of Mexico anymore, because they know that the journey to the US border is boring anyway.
The Mexican government issued a statement on Wednesday saying the call in question had not taken place.
On Tuesday, Politico published the full version of Trump&#39;s interview with The Wall Street Journal.
In it, Trump was glowing about his speech at a large meeting of the national scouting organization in West Virginia.
I got a call from the leader of the Boy Scouts, he said it was the best speech he had ever given them.
They were very grateful, Trump said.
On Wednesday, the scouting organization announced that it is not aware of a call from any of its executives to Trump.
According to the release, the previous statement of Michael Surbaugh, the leader of the organization, in which he had apologized to the Scouts for Trump&#39;s speech, speaks for itself.
Trump&#39;s speech at the meeting of the scout organization caused a lot of consternation, as it was exceptionally political considering the nature of the event.
Among other things, he praised the results of last fall&#39;s presidential election.
