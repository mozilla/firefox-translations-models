Eemeli Kouki led Hurricane to home win in opener - second win for Savo Volley
Hurricane-Loimaa, who have won medals in the Men's Volleyball Championship League seven times in a row, started the 2018-19 season with a home win, as Raision Loimu fell 3-0 on Saturday.
All-rounder Eemeli Kouki, who returned to Finland from Romania, was the Hurricane's most efficient with 22 points.
There were some tune-ups abroad, but they didn't materialize, and then came a call from Loimaa.
We were able to get things done pretty quickly," Kouki said.
Like Kouk, Tomi Rumpunen, who played for Loimu, supported Kouki with 18 points.
The most effective for the guests was national team chipper Samuli Kaislasalo, who plays on a match-by-match contract, with 17 points.
Winning the opening game is always important.
Many players also had experience from the opposing side, which added an extra touch to the game.
Our game is not finished yet, but of course continuing the medal streak is the goal," Kouki said.
Määttänen Savo Volleyball's most powerful
Miro Määttänen was Savo Volley's most efficient with 18 points as the team downed Vantaa Ducks 3-0 in Vieremä.
Our game was erratic, especially on the offensive end, but luckily we were able to squeeze out the win.
At least I didn't have any conscious different charge when I played against my former team," Määttänen said.
Antti Siltala, who started his career in Vieremän Volleyball 3-liiga in the 2000-01 season, scored 12 points.
Head coach Jukka Tuovinen was satisfied with many things.
The hall was small, meaning the atmosphere was on the ceiling all the time.
The good feeling remained from the home opener.
Miro was king, and Silli also played a good game, Tuovinen said.
Siltala's previous season in the league was in 2006-07, when he won silver with Pielavesi Sampo while Tuovinen was also head coach.
Thiago Maciel was the most efficient for the Ducks with 14 points.
Mikkonen again star of Akaa-Volley
Joni Mikkonen, who won the league scoring title in the 2012-13 season, has made a strong start to this season as well.
The chipper scored 25 points as Akaa-Volley picked up their season-opening win after downing the Kokkola Tigers 3-2.
The season has started quite well for me.
Of course, today was close to defeat, as we were down 17-21 in the fourth set.
We dug out a set win somewhere, and the fifth set came at the same time," Mikkonen said.
The most effective player for the Tigers, who were still in the finals a few seasons ago, was chipper Edvarts Buivids, who scored 28 points.
Compatriot Aleksandrs Kudriashovs supported with 17 points.
We didn't get much of a grip on the guy's chipper, Mikkonen praised.
Finland number one in the world in human capital comparison
Finland is at the top of the world in the comparison of human capital, according to the scientific journal Lancet.
The study compared the development of human capital from 1990 to 2016.
Over the years, 195 countries were compared.
In both years, Finland was number one in statistics.
In 2016, the top five were almost the same as in 1990.
Previously, Finland was followed by Iceland, Denmark, Canada and the Netherlands.
Later, the Netherlands finished one higher and instead of Canada, Taiwan was on the list.
In 2016, Niger and South Sudan ranked worst.
When measuring human capital, the level of education, access to education, skills and health of the population is examined.
The World Bank has stated that human capital is linked to economic growth.
Real Madrid's Thibaut Courtois kept Atletico in check, local play ended goalless
Real Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois made some brilliant saves and the local game between the Madrid teams ended in a goalless draw late on Saturday in the Spanish football league.
Atletico Madrid's Antoine Griezmann and Diego Costa came closest to scoring, but Belgian keeper Courtois made the save.
Courtois played three seasons at Atletico on loan while playing for Chelsea.
At the beginning of the week, the International Football Federation (FIFA) named him Goalkeeper of the Year.
At Real, Gareth Bale got the best goal, but his shot deflected past the end of the opening half.
Bale was substituted after the break due to a thigh injury.
According to ESPN, disappointed Real supporters shouted the name of goalkeeper Cristiano Ronaldo, who transferred to Juventus, during the match.
US now under attack on abortion rights - Powerful documentary explains why
The U.S. Senate is currently trying to determine whether President Donald Trump's nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, could be chosen as one of the nine members of the Supreme Court.
In the Republican Party, many hope that Kavanaugh's decisive vote will overturn the decision known as Roe v. Wade, which made abortion legal in the U.S. in 1973.
Ricki Stern and Annie Sundberg's documentary film Reversing Roe - The United States and Abortion Rights tells how we got to where we are today over the years.
As incredible as it may seem, the topic is also topical in Finland.
Minister for Foreign Affairs Timo Soini (sin) has done publicity work against safe abortion and has received varying degrees of support from the majority of Finnish MPs.
The powerful documentary begins with a meeting with gynecologist Colleen McNicholas, who has become the only abortionist doctor in the state of Missouri due to tightening laws.
The clinic's armed guard says he defends religious freedom in the United States.
News videos remind us of deadly terrorist attacks on clinics.
Let's go back to the time when abortion was illegal in the United States.
At the time, a coalition of Lutheran churchmen guided women to trusted abortion doctors.
The arguments of the pastor interviewed are good, but really they are not even needed, a photograph of a woman who died of a self-performed abortion is enough.
There were about 5,000 deaths a year in the United States.
The legalization of abortions was advocated especially by the Republican Party.
As early as 1967, in California, the abortion rights law was signed by Governor Ronald Reagan.
Later, it was Reagan, during his presidential campaign in 1980, who began to revolutionize religion with politics in order to attract voters.
His stance on abortion was also reversed by his successor, George Bush Sr.
And so did Donald Trump.
The documentary reaches the heart of the matter in its search for the root cause of the politicization of the abortion issue.
When apartheid religious organizations were denied tax exemption, they became politically active.
Abortion was chosen as the hobby horse.
Religion has brought extraordinary knots to politics.
At the time of writing, the U.S. is in a situation where the president, who bragged about his sexual harassment but won the votes of the religious right with his position on abortion, has chosen Kavanaugh, who is now being accused of sexual harassment by several women, as a candidate for the Supreme Court.
Kavanaugh could gain the power to decide the rights of 164 million American women and girls.
Israeli army shot dead seven Palestinians, including two children - on the border of large demonstrations
Nearly 200 Palestinians have been killed in six months as Israel fired on demonstrators in the border zone.
Israeli soldiers shot dead seven Palestinians in the Gaza border zone on Friday, the Palestinian Health Ministry said.
Among the dead, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry, are two children: boys aged 12 and 14.
According to the ministry, 505 people have been wounded.
Of these, 89 were wounded by bullets.
The Israeli army has confirmed that it opened fire and carried out an airstrike on the border zone after protesters threw stones and explosives at Israeli troops.
The military says it has started using force to prevent protesters from breaking down the border fence or trying to reach the other side of it.
At least 191 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza protests since March, when Palestinians began weekly protests at the border.
According to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, 12 000 people have been wounded.
Demonstrators demanded that Palestinian families be allowed access to areas from which Palestinians were forced to leave when the State of Israel was established in 1948.
A Palestinian sniper has killed one Israeli soldier.
Explosives dropped by kites and helium balloons sent from the Palestinian side have ignited forest areas and farmland in Israel.
Teemu Pukki scored a penalty - could not shoot himself
Wigan striker Chey Dunkley appeared to have knocked him down with a tackle from behind in the penalty area.
Referee Gavin Ward allowed the game to continue.
According to his interpretation, the tackle was clean.
Teemu Pukki couldn't believe his eyes.
The situation must have been bothering referee Ward, who awarded Norwich a penalty in the 85th minute when Pukki was brought down.
Ward showed the penalty spot and Mario Vrancic rattled off the 1-0 winning goal.
Pukki has scored five goals for Norwich in the Championship.
The former came last Saturday against QPR in style with a pectoral muscle.
Pukki enjoyed working again.
After losing the ball, he continued until the end of the situation.
He created scoring situations and defended tirelessly.
For Norwich, the match was the fifth in two weeks.
The team continues in the League Cup.
Behind them is a five-win streak.
The help service for paedophiles was immediately filled with bookings - in Finland, about 40,000 people feel interested in children
It is estimated that two percent of men and a small percentage of women experience at least some sexual interest in pre-teens.
In Finland, this means about 40,000 people.
Until now, it has been difficult for people who are sexually interested in children or young people to get help.
The joint SeriE project of the Criminal Services Support Foundation and Sexpo trains professionals in encountering paedophiles as clients and helps people who are sexually attracted to children.
When the project was announced in the spring, Sexpo, which offers counselling and therapy, started flooding in emails, and appointments were booked out very quickly, Yle reports.
However, these are promised to be released during the autumn.
Sexual preference for children causes shame for many.
Most of those who notice pedophilic feelings in themselves have not fulfilled their fantasies and thus have not done anything criminal.
However, preference is usually a permanent characteristic.
Most of them hope to get rid of those thoughts that haunt and depress them.
They also complicate normal life," says Patricia Thesleff, a sex therapist who works as a specialist in the project.
In my opinion, the work is valuable if even one child is spared sexual violence," Thesleff says.
Korean leaders or Congolese gynaecologist?
US President Donald Trump as Nobel Peace Prize winner - The idea may sound strange at first, but Trump is one of the big favourites for the prize based on the betting odds.
The background is Trump's role in getting North Korea to commit to denuclearization, at least in speech.
Based on the odds, the biggest favourites for the Nobel Peace Prize are South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, who have already met three times this year and pledged to seek a peace agreement between their two countries.
The warming of relations between the two Koreas is remarkable, as only last year the relations were freezing.
Yet rewarding Kim, who has been threatening nuclear weapons for years and leading his country with an iron fist, would undoubtedly also raise criticism.
The winners of the Nobel Prizes will be announced from Monday onwards, and on Friday it will be the turn of the one that will receive the most attention, the Peace Prize.
If the prize is not awarded to those involved in diplomacy on the Korean peninsula, one of the top candidates will be Congolese doctor Denis Mukwege.
The respected gynaecologist has treated thousands of women who are victims of gang rape in her hospital in the Democratic Republic of Congo and has become a leading expert in her field worldwide.
Through her work, Mukwege has drawn attention to sexual violence, which is a terrible byproduct of many conflicts.
The UN Refugee Agency, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1954 and 1981, has also been considered a strong candidate.
The Nobel Committee has announced that there are 331 candidates for the prize this year.
The names of the candidates will not be made public.
Trump himself wouldn't mind if he got the Nobel.
In May, a reporter asked him at the White House if he thought he deserved the Peace Prize.
Everyone thinks so, but I would never say it," Trump said with a smile.
I want to finish this.
The prize I want is a victory for the whole world," the president continued, referring to the North Korea talks.
However, there are factors that make Trump's Nobel laureate unlikely.
The Norwegian Nobel Committee, which decides on the prize, has often recognised individuals and organisations representing liberal democracy and a multipolar world order – the very kind of international cooperation that Trump has been seen as opposing.
In the 2000s, the prize has been awarded to three American politicians, all of whom were Democrats: Jimmy Carter in 2002, Al Gore in 2007 and Barack Obama in 2009.
Awarding Trump would therefore require an ideological U-turn on the part of the Nobel Committee.
Fire report in tunnel: Motorists behaved like lemmings and drove in the wrong direction
The traffic chaos on Highway One in Lohja took place on 8 September.
Due to the notification, traffic in the tunnel area was cut off in the direction of both Turku and Helsinki.
When it became clear that it was a system failure, the fire department tried to bring traffic back to normal.
However, it did not work out very quickly.
We tried to open the road once before, but the Finnish Road Traffic Centre said that it could not be opened because there are motorists on the road in shock and they drive as they please," Pasi Kääriäinen, the on-duty fire marshal, told STT at the time.
At that time, the motorway was even driven in the wrong direction after only a short wait.
When the first one starts to go against traffic rules, a few others often follow," says Tapio Heiskanen, Traffic Safety Liaison Manager.
According to traffic rules, stops on motorways and tunnels are only allowed for compelling reasons.
Liikenneturva reminds that in exceptional situations, you cannot start endangering traffic with hasty solutions.
Emergency vehicles must always be given as unhindered access as possible.
In particular, driving in the opposite direction on the motorway is prohibited, as well as making a U-turn and reversing.
The same prohibitions apply in tunnels, where the headlights must always be switched on.
Stopping without a compelling reason is also prohibited, as is parking, of course.
In the past, there have even been cases where a driver has stopped in a tunnel to brush snow from his car.
It should be clear that this is the wrong place and time for the activity in question," Heiskanen says in a press release from Liikenneturva.
Lynx fans would have liked to continue their celebrations even though the ship got stuck on the lakebed
The Ilves fans transported by the inland waterway vessel M/S Tampere would have liked to stay on board to continue their victory celebrations, even though the ship had been caught in the lakebed by its bow, says Juho Syrjä, who was the ship's captain at the time of the incident.
M/S Tampere, which was travelling from Hämeenlinna to Tampere, drifted off its route late on Saturday evening and got stuck in the bottom of Vanajavesi in Akaa, Finland.
The 19 passengers and five crew members on board were evacuated to the mainland during the night.
No one was injured in the accident.
The Ilves fans would have liked to continue their celebrations on the ship until morning, but of course it made more sense to send them to the harbour by the fire department and home by bus," Syrjä told STT.
Ilves fans had been in Hämeenlinna to watch the match between Ilves and HPK, which ended in a 4-3 win for Ilves.
According to Syrjä, Saturday's accident was caused by the fact that the water level in Vanajavesi was about half a metre lower than normal.
According to Syrjä, navigation was also complicated by the fact that the nearest fairway marker was covered with seagull droppings, which meant that its reflectors were not normally visible in the dark autumn evening.
No collision to mention
The accident took place west of the narrow Jumusensalmi strait shortly after the shipping route had passed the motorway bridge between Tampere and Helsinki.
According to Syrjä, there was no major drama involved in the incident, as the vessel's speed was very low at the time of the incident and hitting the bottom did not cause a more significant collision.
According to Syrjä, getting stuck on the bottom has not caused any leaks or depressions on the ship, and it looks like the ship's cruises will continue normally.
On Saturday morning, a diver checked the condition of the ship before it began to be towed away from the shallows.
As a precaution, we will visit the shipyard to check that no damage was caused," Syrjä says.
Syrjä believes that M/S Tampere's next cruise, booked for next weekend, can be handled as agreed.
According to him, the ship's cruise season will continue until Independence Day.
No use for ambulances
The emergency services were alerted to the incident on Saturday evening shortly after half past twelve.
Ambulances were called to the port of Viiala to receive evacuated passengers, but ambulances were not used.
Matti Willman, the fire chief on duty, said late at night that the evacuation conditions on the lake were difficult due to darkness and fairly strong winds.
The Pirkanmaa Rescue Department announced after half past three on Sunday night that everyone on board had been evacuated and the passengers had been transferred by bus to Tampere.
The cruise ship, built in 1957, has been restored in 2001, 2014 and 2017.
Trump's nominee for justice, accused of harassment and drinking, may miss out on top office
Brett Kavanaugh, who has been nominated as a Justice of the United States Supreme Court, may well miss out on the position he is aiming for, estimates Programme Director Mika Aaltola from the Finnish Institute of International Affairs.
So far, at least three women have accused Kavanaugh of sexual harassment and inappropriate behavior during their college days.
According to Aaltola, the suspicions have brought so much political pressure to the Republican Party that President Donald Trump may end up running for another person.
In the United States, it has happened from time to time in the past that the President's nominee for Supreme Court justice has provoked a great deal of controversy.
In this case, the candidate for judge has usually withdrawn, says Aaltola.
In this way, the president has been able to maintain face.
The nomination would rain down on the Democrats
The U.S. Supreme Court seeks to be above politics, but at least in Kavanaugh's case, choosing a new justice has become a very politically sensitive process.
If Kavanaugh is nominated, the decision will likely rain down on the Democratic Party in the upcoming midterm elections in Congress.
That would boost voter turnout among young people and women, who would be more likely to vote Democrat.
On the other hand, the nomination of a conservative justice to the Supreme Court would be a long-term victory for Republicans.
Not every presidential term has the opportunity to be nominated, because in the United States, Supreme Court justices are appointed for life.
In practice, some of them have retired at their own request at the age of 70-80.
Some Republicans are also hesitant about the nomination
Background checks are normally carried out on candidates for justice on the U.S. Supreme Court, Aaltola says.
Even though Trump has set only a one-week deadline for the FBI's further investigation, Aaltola says it can still bring up something essential.
Yes, it might bring.
There is rarely smoke without fire, says Aaltola.
According to Aaltola, what is certain is that Kavanaugh's suitability or unsuitability for office will still be the subject of lively debate before the Senate makes its decision.
Republicans have a 51-49 majority in the Senate, but at least two female Republican senators are thought to be skeptical of Kavanaugh's nomination.
The most embarrassing thing of all would be for the nomination to be put to the vote and the Republicans lose.
Woman identified Salisbury suspect as military intelligence agent
A Russian woman has told the BBC that she identifies a Russian man suspected of poisoning Salisbury as an agent of Russian military intelligence.
Based on photographs, the woman said it was Anatoly Chepiga, who works for the GRU military intelligence.
Online community Bellingcat and Russian community Insider Russia previously said they had revealed one of the two men suspected of poisoning as Chepiga.
Earlier, they said they had found evidence that the men's current identities were cover identities.
The BBC group travelled to the Far East to the village near the Russian-Chinese border, where Chepiga grew up.
A woman living in the village recognized the young Tshepigan from the pictures posted by Bellingcat.
He identified the same man from British police photos of a man now calling himself Ruslan Boshirov.
Russian men are suspected of poisoning former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter with the Novichok nerve agent in March.
The Skripals survived.
Colonel Chepiga has been awarded the Order of the Hero of Russia in 2014.
Russia continues to deny the suspected GRU connection.
The men suspected of poisoning said in an interview with Russian TV earlier in September that they had been in Salisbury as tourists.
Elderly people as throwaway bags in the health and social services reform
This is a vivid example of what the change limiter for the health and social services reform defined by Sipilä's Government means in practice.
The health and social services of Vaala, my municipality of birth, are provided by the Oulunkaari Joint Municipal Authority, whose former Regional Director of Attendo was appointed as its Health Services Director in 2016.
The leaders of the joint municipal authority warn the council about the change limiter.
If health and social services expenditure rises now, municipal state subsidies will be cut in the future.
The decision-makers in the centre of the municipality were frightened, and most of them are ready for a major structural change in elderly care that would end the inpatient care and small units for memory disorders at the health centre's inpatient ward.
Home health care would be increased, which means that elderly people living in remote villages would be uprooted next to the health centre to be treated "at home" over long distances.
Attendo relied on the municipality to pay its customers.
Vaala's Left did not swallow the poor preparation, but organised a good public event, which was attended by many relatives, practical nurses and also councillors from other parties.
On the slides of the preparation of the health and social services county, I presented how the municipality of Vaala already cares for the elderly at home most in the whole of North Ostrobothnia.
Councillor Carina Läntinen from the neighbouring municipality was also present.
The local newspaper made a big story about the event, and that again put the draftsmen of Oulunkaari on the back foot.
The health and social services draftsmen do not write in any papers that Attendo has built a new nursing home in Vaala, which is now waiting empty for residents.
There are no other service providers.
The draftsmen only talk about the service voucher, but do not say what level of care it will provide or what kind of personnel structure Attendo will use to care for the elderly up to terminal care.
Without a nurse?
Namely, the institutional beds of the health centre will be closed down because there is no night-time emergency service for doctors.
Attendo will also rely on doctors from Vaala Health Centre.
Vaala's example illustrates how centrist officials run councillors with incomplete information and councillors are put with their backs against the wall with a change limiter.
In this way, the Centre Party empties Vaala of residents, because who will stay there voluntarily if they have the opportunity to move out?
Was it one election slogan of the Centre Party that the whole country would be kept inhabited?
Turkish President Erdogan opens Grand Mosque in Cologne
In the German city of Cologne, thousands of people demonstrated when Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, visiting the country, opened one of Europe's largest mosques.
Several hundred people had gathered on the banks of the River Rhine since morning.
Erdogan you are not welcome, read the signs of the protesters, and the slogans condemned fascism.
Several demonstrations have taken place during Erdogan's visit, which began on Thursday, and security measures have been tight.
In Cologne, some 10 000 people were expected to take to the streets in advance to protest, among other things, about the human rights situation in Turkey.
Supporters of Erdogan had also gathered near the Grand Mosque.
However, the police had cordoned off a large area around the mosque for security reasons.
In his opening speech, Erdogan praised the success of his visit to Germany and said it had strengthened relations between Germany and Turkey.
During his visit, Erdogan met with Chancellor Angela Merkel twice.
Erdogan and Merkel vowed on Friday to rebuild relations between the two countries, which have deteriorated significantly since Turkey's 2016 coup attempt.
However, Merkel stressed that there are deep differences between the two countries, including on human rights issues.
Review surrounds the visit
Both Cologne Mayor Henriette Reker and North Rhine-Westphalia Prime Minister Armin Laschet cancelled their attendance at the opening ceremony as criticism of Erdogan's visit intensified.
Cansu, a 30-year-old student from Turkey, said he came to the anti-Erdogan demonstration from Switzerland.
I want to be a voice for those who cannot take to the streets in Turkey.
They have been arrested, killed and oppressed.
For Erdogan, anything that deviates from his own thinking is terrorism.
During the final leg of Erdogan's trip to Germany in North Rhine-Westphalia, a significant part of the population is of Turkish origin.
Three charged with murder of journalist in Slovakia
In Slovakia, three people have been charged with the murder of journalist Jan Kuciak.
Prosecutors said Friday that three people will be charged with the February murder of Kuciak and his fiancée and other crimes.
Earlier this week, police arrested eight people in the investigation into the murder, but five of them have been released.
In February, Kuciak was found shot dead with his fiancée in his home in Bratislava.
He had investigated the links between politicians and the Italian mafia.
Police have suspected that the murders are related to Kuciak's investigations.
The case and Kuciak's published article have raised concerns about media freedom and corruption in Slovakia.
There may be problems with the distribution of Karelian on Sunday in sparsely populated areas
Due to a fault in printing, Sunday's Karjalainen also has to be mailed unaddressed.
This may be reflected in the distribution of the magazine in sparsely populated areas, where distribution to communal boxes has to be carried out from memory.
The situation was the same for Saturday's paper, and the problem may continue on Monday.
Mailing puts extra bouquets of magazines in the province.
The magazines of subscribers to the rest of Finland will not be mailed separately until Monday.
The distribution of these newspapers will be significantly delayed.
Vesa is a Finnish astronaut
Today, journalist Arto Nyberg will interview Vesa Heilala, among others, live on his upcoming talk show.
Vesa is in the studio talking about his upcoming space trip, which he booked with Virgin Galactica back in 2010.
The price was EUR 151,000, which required a bank loan.
If the original plans had been correct, Vesa would have visited space a long time ago.
However, the departure date has been postponed year by year.
Now it seems that after the unfortunate test flight in 2014, which also claimed a life, things are in order.
If all goes well, commercial flights will start this year or next year at the latest.
Vesa's flight number is 300, which means that his trip takes place about a year after his first departure.
The flight will last 2.5 hours and we will be in weightless mode for 5 minutes at an altitude of 100 kilometres, the Finnish astronaut says on his website.
At the same address, he also explains his longing for space.
As a child, I read a comic book called Space Travel and saw the Star Trek series on TVs.
We've seen Star Wars and that's where the idea came from...
Why not?
Everyone has their own dreams.
Manchester City were rude hosts
Manchester City continued their unbeaten run in the Premier League as they thrashed Brighton 2-0 at home on Saturday.
The reigning champions' sixth win of the season was guaranteed by goalkeepers Raheem Sterling and Sergio Agüero.
Sterling was allowed to direct his fourth goal of the season into an empty goal from close range when Leroy Sané found him at the back post of the Brighton goal in the 30th minute.
Agüero increased his own goal tally to five when he sawed the Brighton defence to pieces with Sterling in the 65th minute of play.
The Argentine was able to put the final score 2-0 at the penalty spot with ease.
City, who started the season with six wins and one draw, lead the Premier League with a haul of 19 points.
However, Liverpool, who played one game less, lurk just one point away.
Liverpool face third-placed Chelsea in their own seventh-round match on Saturday evening.
Youth clubs elected new decision-makers in Joensuu
In its meeting that ended on Sunday, the Finnish Youth Clubs elected new decision-makers for its next three-year term 2019–2021.
Anu Sivonen from Ylä-Savo was elected as Chairman and Petra Mäkeläinen from Häme as Vice Chair.
The council elected 40 full members and 40 deputy members, the Finnish Youth Clubs announced on Sunday.
The youth club meeting was held in Joensuu.
We want our cultural leisure activities to be known for quality and safety.
In its three-year operational goals, the Joensuu Youth Association Meeting makes three promises: We will keep the doors open for everyone, organise equal leisure activities regardless of their place of residence and background, and support volunteer activities and people on their own growth paths, says the Finnish Youth Clubs in its press release.
Lewis Hamilton praised Kimi Raikkonen and marvelled Ferrari: "Losing a very important driver"
In an interview with Swiss newspaper Blick, the British Mercedes driver was asked if he believes releasing Kimi Raikkonen from Ferrari would help Hamilton for the rest of the season.
Hamilton leads Ferrari's other driver Sebastian Vettel in the championship points standings by 40 points.
Just under three weeks ago, Ferrari announced that Raikkonen would not continue with the team next season and at the same time Raikkonen announced his move to Sauber.
Hamilton, of course, doesn't think Raikkonen would put the gloves on the counter.
I don't think Kimi will change in the remaining races.
He is an exceptional professional - a fantastic driver.
He remains one of my favourite drivers and I am convinced that Ferrari will lose a very important driver.
It doesn't make sense to me.
Hamilton has previously said that Raikkonen has been one of his role models.
I don't know if Kimi knows this, but when I was young and dreamed of Formula One, I played F1 on PlayStation all day.
I was always Kimi, which is pretty crazy," Hamilton said in June.
The F1 season continues on Sunday with a race in Russia.
Mercedes' Valtteri Bottas will start from pole position for the 2pm race.
Iltalehti follows the race moment by moment.
The championship battle in the A-junior Finnish Football League turned into a complete farce: the opponent arrived with only 7 players
The boys' top division ends on Saturday with the final round of the season.
Before the round started at 1 pm, the starting points for the championship battle were clear: for FC Lahti Academy, practically even a point against Vasa IFK is enough for first place.
In order for the situation to turn around in the final round, the Ilves, who are second in the championship battle, must win the PK-35 and hope for a defeat for the Lahti residents.
In practice, however, the Lahti championship was already secured before the kick-off whistle, as Vasa IFK had arrived in Lahti with only seven players.
If there had been one fewer Vaasa resident, the match could not have started.
FC Lahti Academy won the match 16-0.
At the break, the Lahti residents led 7-0.
One of the reasons for the loss of players from Vaasa is that the team has played partly the same players in the A-junior Finnish Championship, i.e. P20 series, and men's Kakkonen in Group C.
Vasa IFK has played in Kakkonen practically the entire season against relegation.
In the final round of Kakkonen on Saturday, Vasa IFK must beat JBK in the away game and at the same time hope that Tampere United lose their own away game against KuFu in Toivala in Siilinjärvi.
The car ended up on its roof in Eno - according to the rescue department, luck was involved
A passenger car drifted off the road and ended up on its roof on Juttuvaarantie in Eno around 9 a.m. on Sunday.
Four people were involved in the accident.
Two of them were slightly injured, the rescue department said.
Good luck was involved, the release states.
According to the emergency services, the road was wet after the rain.
A police patrol visited the scene of the accident.
Supo expects new means of intelligence: Equipment purchases and recruitments have already been made, there is no hint of activities planned abroad
According to Supo Chief Antti Pelttari, preparations have been made for the Intelligence Act by purchasing equipment and training personnel.
When the intelligence legislation enters into force, there would be a permanent increase of approximately ten million euros in Supo's budget.
The Supo premises located on Ratakatu in Helsinki are already fully prepared for the entry into force of intelligence legislation.
Supo Coalition Party chief Antti Pelttari tells Lännen Media that equipment purchases have already been made for future intelligence mandates.
Serena Williams startles with video of herself singing topless - campaigning for breast cancer awareness
Tennis superstar Serena Williams is making waves again.
Now she is campaigning to raise awareness of breast cancer by posting a video on her Instagram account of herself singing with only her hands in front of her breasts, reports AFP.
The song is the 1991 hit I Touch Myself by Australian band The Divinyls.
In the video, Williams supports the Australian Breast Cancer Association.
"I recorded The Divinyls' worldwide hit to remind women to regularly do self-help [breast] checkups," Williams writes in an Instagram post.
And yes, this put me out of my comfort zone, but I wanted to do it because the topic touches all women, regardless of skin color, all over the world.
Early detection is the be-all and end-all - it saves many lives.
The song co-writer on The Divinyls is Chrissy Amphlett, who died of breast cancer five years ago at the age of 53.
The music video is part of the I Touch Myself project, made in honor of Chrissy Amphlett.
"She passed away from breast cancer but gave us a hit song to remind women to put their health first," Williams says.
The video has now been viewed 1.5 million times.
It was released early Sunday morning.
In the comments to the video, Williams is praised for her courage.
Williams opted out of the Beijing tennis tournament earlier this week.
The backdrop is the uproar at the U.S. Open tennis tournament three weeks ago.
Williams lashed out at the head referee of the match, claiming, among other things, that far harsher behavior is tolerated from men than from female players.
Chinese restaurant on a mountain trail is not suitable for altitude abusers
In addition to traditional Chinese delicacies, the restaurant offers stunning views.
An exceptional restaurant has opened in China's Zhejiang province.
It is located literally on a cliff ledge.
From there, if you wish, you can look at the spreading forest below.
The rugged scenery at the heights makes restaurant visitors gasp for breath in the Longquan Mountains.
To get to the restaurant, you need to hike among the peach trees.
The restaurant opened for hikers on 19.9.2018.
Youtube comments wonder where the restroom in the restaurant is located.
Hiking to the restaurant requires good ground condition, the site says.
Korpela's Alley Run ends today: This is how it all ends
All good things come to an end.
Today that is what happens to the Finnish country drama Korpela's Alley Run, which has been quite well-liked.
The third season has gone like hot rocks: last week, 722,000 Finns watched the episode on television.
The top figures as such no longer have any practical significance, as there will be no continuation of Heikki Luoma's and Jukka Mäkinen's series.
In the finale episode, Jaska and Mirku's relationship takes another big leap forward, and Jaska's mother seems to be the first to guess what is to come.
The relationship between Anssi and Miisa is also warm, downright romantic in light of recent events, but then Laiho once again appears.
Even the police are suspicious of the Slytherin man.
However, no one can foresee Laiho's fate in advance.
Anita, on the other hand, receives incredible news.
Kauko's last will is revealed, which brings the woman to the brink of tears.
After a week, Sorjonen will continue with new episodes on Sunday evenings.
Korpela Alley Run today on TV1 at 21.05.
Is it worth going to work tomorrow with a little flu?
Here are the facts for and against
The flu season is hot.
Many people guess whether to stay at home or not.
However, the workhorse should consider whether it is worth going to infect others, as the disease can be contagious even if one's own symptoms are small.
Sometimes the flu symptoms strike suddenly, sometimes they appear creeping in.
In the latter scenario, you may already infect others, even if your own symptoms seem minor, according to the journal Prevention.
So is it worth staying at home?
According to Prevention, the flu is contagious even when the person has no symptoms.
The virus is transmitted as early as the day before symptoms begin and from five days to a week.
Children may infect the disease for longer.
As soon as you recognize the symptoms, you should not be at school or at work.
You can return to work when your cough subsides and you no longer have a fever," says Gregory Poland, professor of medicine.
Training should also be avoided.
Returning to the gym too quickly slows down recovery.
In addition, remember to wash your hands, throw them in a handkerchief and throw away the rag paper.
Sore to start though?
If you have to leave your home when you are sick, consider wearing a protective mask.
The mask does not keep viruses in check, but keeps the wearer aware of the head area.
Then you don't put your fingers in your nose or mouth," Poland says.
Also, sneezing is limited with a mask.
So how can infections be avoided?
The best way is still to wash your hands and avoid touching your face.
However, the latter is difficult to avoid.
In the United States, for example, the average person touches their eyes, nose or mouth every 15 to 30 seconds, Poland warns.
New Miss Finland repeats miss tradition: "My husband is an ice hockey player"
Hockey player and misses are often associated with each other.
This was also the case with Alina Voronkova, 23.
The Miss Finland 2018 crown has been awarded to Alina Voronkova from Pertunmaa.
Kaunotar now lives in Lahti, where she moved at the age of 15.
Alina's mother is Ingrian Finnish and her father Russian.
About her father's Russianness, Voronkova was bullied at school.
My mother and father moved to Finland 25 years ago, but I was bullied because I was Russian.
I had no friends at all in Pertunmaa, Alina says at the announcement of the semifinalists of the Miss Finland competition.
After upper secondary school, Alina decided to start with a clean slate and move to Lahti to go to upper secondary school.
Soon she found new friends and everyday life started rolling as hoped.
At the age of 15, you think you're an adult, but in retrospect I really wasn't.
Three years ago, Alina met her current partner, Joonas Hurr, who is familiar from the Pelicans.
After his SM-liiga career, the ice hockey player has played abroad, such as Sweden and China.
In 2009, he was part of the Finnish team at the 18-year-old World Championships.
In the early days of dating, the couple lived in a long-distance relationship for almost a year, but later Alina was able to travel the world with her husband.
If I were to make it to the winning trio and that would give me a career, I don't want to believe that it would affect our relationship in any way.
Even if we have to live apart, our trust works well, and the good thing about a long-distance relationship is that the initial spark stays on all the time, Alina grinned in May.
Rejoicing in continuous growth, death at our heels
Almost everyone is concerned about the planet's resilience.
Yet there is almost no desire to give up anything.
Sustainable alternatives to continuous growth are being sought, but even the theory of degrowth runs into major problems.
Over the past few generations, the constant growth of the economy has brought ordinary people, especially in the northern hemisphere, a standard of living that could only be dreamed of before.
However, the prolonged overrun of the earth's carrying capacity and climate change are threatening to undermine the foundations of this market economy.
Two men were stabbed at Sitratori in Kannelmäki at four o'clock in the morning on Sunday night.
A man born in 1986 was seriously injured in the stabbing and another, born in 1968, was less seriously injured.
The older of the men has already been discharged from the hospital.
Police have apprehended one person whose possible involvement in the stabbing is being investigated.
Police are also looking for another suspect connected to the incidents.
The incidents are being investigated as attempted manslaughter and aggravated assault.
Important point for IFK Mariehamn - Inter coach regretted mistake
IFK Mariehamn's Simon Silverholt's equaliser against Inter brought the team an important point in the men's football league on Saturday.
Silverholt put the finishing touches on the equaliser in the 78th minute of the match that ended 1-1.
Silvelholt got through from the right wing and luckily lifted the ball over goalkeeper Henrik Moisander.
With the away draw, the Mariehamns closed the gap to Turun Palloseura, who are in the league qualifier, to two points.
An important goal and a valuable point," summed up Mariehamn head coach Peter Lundberg.
However, Lundberg noted that the team did not ignite the kind of battle he expected.
We made a lot of mistakes in the opening period, but luckily the goal from Turku brought us into the game more strongly.
Home Inter head coach John Allen said the game was under control, but scoring again was painful.
One defensive mistake took away our full point pot," Allen lamented.
Again, we were the best!

Lehterä showed his shorthanded skills, position not yet certain
Jori Lehterä's strong shorthanded play came to the fore when his NHL club, the Philadelphia Flyers, played their last practice game before the start of the season.
Philadelphia beat Boston 4-1, and Lehterä fed Michael Raffli twice to score.
In recent days, Lehterä has been in the spotlight due to suspected narcotics.
MTV reported on Wednesday that Lehterä is one of 23 suspects in a drug racket, some suspected of drug use and some of which include sales.
Lehterä has denied committing a crime.
The club and the player have discussed the matter and the NHL is investigating the incident.
Sam Carchidi, a reporter for the Philadelphia Inquirer who follows the Flyers closely, estimated after the game that Lehterä will be part of a group of six forwards, five of whom will get a spot on the NHL team.
According to Carchid, Lehterä was excellent in the practice match.
In the second period, Lehterä fought the puck to himself shorthanded, pulled on a defenseman and fed Raffli, who was waiting in front of the goal, into the open slot.
For the second time, the duo's collaboration brought a goal at the very end of the match.
The Flyers kick off the NHL season on October 4 with an away game against Las Vegas.
In Boston, defenseman Urho Vaakanainen is waiting for the team's coaching staff to decide whether he can join the NHL squad.
I thought training camp was good.
I did my best, and I can be proud of that.
Now the coaches will decide if I can play.
I think I'm ready for the NHL," Vaakanainen said in an interview posted on Boston's Twitter account.
Vaakanainen, who learned hockey in the River Boys, played 19.31 minutes against Philadelphia.
In Boston's goal, Tuukka Rask surrendered four times and made 20 saves.
Kärpät-backed defenseman Vili Saarijärvi scored a 1-0 power-play goal for Detroit as they downed Toronto 5-1.
Calgary's defenseman Juuso Välimäki had an assist, but Edmonton defeated Calgary 4-3.
The Oilers rested Jesse Puljujärvi and goaltender Mikko Koskinen, among others.
Florida's Aleksander Barkov played just over 20 minutes and had an assist in a local game against Tampa Bay.
Tampa won 3-2.
Columbus defenseman Markus Nutivaara provided an assist for his team's consolation goal midway through the final period as Chicago defeated Columbus 4-1.
In the losing goal, Joonas Korpisalo made 23 of 27 saves.
More than 180,000 responses to the time of day survey
Citizens have actively responded to the questionnaire concerning the decision on Finland's future.
The question of whether Finland should permanently apply winter or summer time in the future has already gathered more than 180,000 responses.
There is still less than a couple of weeks to answer the survey opened in the Otakantaa.fi service.
The respondents are also asked whether Finland should be in the same time frame as the other Nordic and Baltic countries, Central Europe or Western Russia.
A recent photo shows the change: The strongest man in the world lost tens of kilograms
Crowned the strongest man in the world in 2017, Eddie Hall is undergoing a striking makeover.
Briton Eddie Hall hunted for the title of the strongest man in the world long and purposefully.
Hall could eat up to 10,000 kilocalories worth of food a day and weighed up to 200 kilos, according to the Mirror.
The shirts were size 5XL.
Hall admitted before winning the title that he was doing damage to his body.
The human body is not created to be this size, Hall said.
The Briton hunted for victory in the World's Strongest Man competition by all means and the man with a family promised to end his career if he got the title.
Hall did not want her children to grow up without a father.
Hall kept his promise and was not seen again at the 2018 World's Strongest Man Games in April.
Recently, Hall posted a photo on Instagram of herself posing in much slimmer shape than her active career.
Hall writes that his current weight is 169.5 kilograms.
Hall wrote that he now works out five times a week aerobically.
The programme includes boxing, cycling and swimming.
In addition, Hall does four workouts a week at the gym.
This year, Icelandic Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson, also known from the Game of Thrones TV series, became the strongest man in the world.
The previous Finnish winner of the competition is Janne Virtanen, who was number one in 2000.
Restaurant ship M/S Tampere ran aground in Pyhäjärvi - "Firmly attached to the rocks"
The inland waterway vessel M/S Tampere ran aground late on Friday evening in Akaa in Pyhäjärvi.
The rescue department was alerted to a water traffic accident on Friday evening after half past twelve.
The 30-metre vessel M/S Tampere has run aground and is firmly attached to its bow on the rocks, described Matti Willman, the on-duty fire marshal.
There were 19 passengers and five crew members on board.
According to the rescue department, no injuries were sustained.
Passengers and almost all crew members have been evacuated to the mainland away from the ship.
Now they are being transferred by bus towards Tampere," Jari Nieminen, the on-duty manager, told STT after one o'clock at night.
Ambulances were called to the port of Viiala to receive evacuated passengers.
For some reason, the ship travelling from Hämeenlinna to Tampere had drifted off course west of the narrow Jumusensalmi strait.
The police are investigating the cause of the incidents.
Fire Chief Matti Willman on duty said earlier in the evening that conditions on the lake are difficult due to darkness and fairly strong winds.
According to the rescue department, the fate of the vessel is unclear.
The ship is apparently not leaking.
After the evacuation operation, divers begin to check the situation at the bottom.
Built in 1957, M/S Tampere is now an inland waterway vessel operating as a restaurant ship with a maximum number of 180 passengers.
There is also a private conference room on board.
According to the ship's website, the cruiser was restored in 2001, 2014 and 2017.

Ex-managers demand unpaid fees from Robert Helenius
Boxer Robert Helenius' tonight's fight against Erkan Teper is overshadowed by a money dispute.
Today, the Ilta-Sanomat newspaper reported on a summons filed by boxing manager Jaakko Helminen and deputy judge Jussi Kokkila, in which Helenius is charged a total of more than 80,000 euros in unpaid managerial fees, including interest on late payments.
According to the summons, Helminen and Kokkila worked for Helenius from 15.4.2014 to 30.1.2015.
We have tried to mediate, but there is no alternative.
There has been a clear mandate here, and a great deal of work has been done," Kokkila tells Ilta-Sanomat.
Helenius' current manager Markus Sundman sent a response to Iltalehti detailing the boxer's view of the events.
Helenius denies any obligation to pay the amount claimed.
According to the defence, Kokkila and Helminen had offered their services to Helenius in a financially difficult situation and promised that they would be able to arrange matches and sponsorship income for him.
It was verbally agreed that Helenius would only be liable to pay fees as percentages of his matches.
Repeatedly assured that Helenius does not need anything to pay, only to receive the income organized by them.
This is also the normal and only practice in the management of professional athletes.
Paid work has never been agreed upon, and such a thing would also have been absurd in Helenius' situation, Sundman explains in his message.
There was never a written agreement on cooperation.
According to the response, Helenius would have liked to agree on the distribution of income in writing from the beginning, but Kokkila and Sundman were not able to produce a draft until the end of 2014.
For his part, he found the proposal poor and broke off cooperation with Kokkila and Helminen.
Helenius never fought when dealing with Kokkila and Helminen.
A year after the collaboration ended, Helenius had been shown an "unspecified but sizable" bill for his manager's work.
This year, a lawsuit has been filed with the same allegations.
Helenius considers Helminen and Kokkila's subsequent actions to be cowardly, the defence states.
Helenius will face Erkan Teper, seventh on the IBF heavyweight challenger list, in Stuttgart today.
A heartfelt man and a good journalist
Entertainer and music producer Ilkka "Ile" Vainio knew the late radio host and journalist Erkki Päll for decades.
Long-time radio host and journalist Erkki Pälli died at the age of 83 from incurable liver cancer.
The presenter's obituary was published in Sunday's Helsingin Sanomat.
The announcement states that Pälli died on September 3.
Pälli announced the serious illness on his Facebook page in March 2018.
At that time, the publication was also seen by Ile Vainio, who was saddened by the news of his acquaintance's fate.
He said goodbye on Facebook earlier, says Ile Vainio.
Vainio considers Erkki Pälli to be a multi-talented expert who became an excellent journalist.
He remembers that Päll was a well-liked person with quick tricks and fun things.
I got to know Erkki already as a little boy when I visited Finnlevy for the first time at the age of 12 and started there as a warehouse worker.
We met then with Erkki.
At the time, he worked as Finnlevy's spokesperson and in various positions, Ile Vainio recalls.
When I progressed to making albums as a music producer, there were hundreds of occasions where Erkki Pälli was a regular journalist at every party, writing articles about the artists.
He was always knowledgeable and I saw how passionate he was for entertainment, music and people.
When Erkki interviewed someone, he got directly into the skin of his interviewees.
He was a cordial man and a good journalist.
He became known to many as a respected radio host for Yle, but he also wrote brilliant newspaper articles.
Erkki also interviewed me several times.
He was good at talking, Vainio praises.
Over the decades, in addition to working as a journalist, Pälli worked for the Fazer record label with Toivo Kärki.
He worked as a music producer on Vesa-Matti Loir's albums.
However, Päll's greatest passion was radio work, where he had a unique style.
He worked in radio since the 1960s, and he became known to numerous listeners in the ether of Yle.
Pälli retired in 1998.
The Finnish Ski Association announced on Saturday that the association's financial year, which ended in May, showed a profit of approximately 450,000 euros.
The union describes its financial situation as having undergone a "U-turn", even though the economy is of course burdened by "significant debt on the balance sheet".
Executive Director Mika Kulmala praises the quick reaction and strict financial discipline.
Last autumn, we reacted to the situation as quickly as possible by taking adjustment measures.
Careful planning of operations and financial management is ingrained throughout our organization, Kulmala says.
We have also succeeded well in finding partners, and in addition, the profit from the World Cup was maximum during the past competition season.
However, cost management must continue to be precise and, at the same time, we must constantly look for new financing models.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence
Dozens of bodies lie in the backyard of a hospital in the town of Palu on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Only one building separates them from the area where injured survivors are gathered to assess injuries and the need for care.
Patients are also treated outdoors for aftershocks.
One of those in the hospital area was Baharuddin, a 52-year-old from Palu, who was looking for his son.
Like many Indonesians, he uses only one name.
I have one child and he is missing.
The last time I spoke to him was when he was going to school," Baharuddin told AFP.
In the courtyard of the army hospital in Palu lay Dwi Haris, who has sustained injuries to his back and arm.
He was in a local hotel with his wife and daughter when the quake started.
The family had been invited to the Return wedding party.
I was probably pinched under a collapsed wall.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then silence came.
I don't know what has happened to her and my child.
I hope they are safe," Haris told the AP, according to British media.
Small shops are looted
At the Palu evacuation center, 35-year-old mother of a small baby, Risa Kumuma, tried to calm her feverish baby.
He described the atmosphere in the city as tense.
Clean water is scarce.
Small shops are looted everywhere, said Kusuma.
Many residents of Palu have slept outside or in temporary bamboo huts.
Even if the house is somehow standing, any aftershocks could destroy it forever and bury the occupants.
According to the AP news agency, more than half of the prisoners in Palu prison escaped after the prison walls collapsed.
There were reportedly about 560 prisoners, so there are possibly about 300 fugitives.
Some inmates at Donggala prison have also escaped, according to The Jakarta Post.
According to the newspaper, the prisoners became enraged and set fire to the prison after guards forbade them to go in search of relatives affected by the earthquake and tsunami.
Palu Airport has been reopened, mainly for relief flights.
Among the first to land on the field was an army C-130 transport plane bringing relief supplies.
Commercial flights to Palu Airport are allowed only to a limited extent.
The pilots are forced to land at the airport without the assistance of air traffic control, as the control tower was badly damaged in the earthquake.
Rain sweeps over Finland at night
A long area of rain will spread over the whole country from the west on Sunday night, according to the Finnish Meteorological Institute.
Rain will mostly come in the form of water, but sleet or snow is expected in central and northern Lapland.
The bitter frosts of the previous night are not about to be repeated, as temperatures remain higher under cloud cover.
Cloudier nights keep the lowest temperatures under control quite effectively.
In the west, we can temporarily visit the freezing side," said Ville Ilkka, meteorologist on duty.
On Sunday, the rain area will give way eastwards throughout the morning.
In the south and west it will be rainy or partly cloudy.
In the afternoon, temperatures move all the way to the height of Oulu around 10-13 degrees.
The week ahead looks similar in terms of temperatures in southern and central parts of the country, but the weather will become more unstable.
Wind and wave warnings are in effect in sea areas.
No actual autumn storms are expected for the next few days, but otherwise the weather is expected to be typical of autumn.
The autumn is now starting to kick in earnest, Ilkka said.
The Miss Finland final will not be seen on television
On IL-TV you can follow the glamour and sparkle of the red carpet of the Miss Finland competition.
Iltalehti's entertainment journalists will broadcast live on IL-TV from the red carpet of the Miss Finland final at Billnäs Ironworks.
The broadcast will begin at approximately 6:50 p.m.
The new Miss Finland will be crowned on Saturday from among the ten finalists.
The Miss Finland 2018 final will take place at Billnäs Ironworks in Raseborg.
Before the final begins, you can follow the atmosphere in person on IL-TV's live broadcast.
The live broadcast will begin at approximately 6:30 p.m. and continue for approximately one hour.
This year, a particularly large number of previous years' Miss Finland winners have been invited to the final.
They will be represented on the jury by Miss Finland 1998 Jonna Ziprus.
Other members of the jury are wellbeing entrepreneur Jutta Gustafsberg, photographer Nadi Hammouda, CEO of Jounin Kauppa Minttu Murphy-Kaulanen and Seiska news producer Katja Lintunen.
We hoped he would get to college before going to the Mississippi Games
Russian father Dimitri and mother Svetlana from Ingria believed in their daughter's success in the Miss Finland final.
The parents of the new Miss Finland Alina Voronkova, Dimitri Voronkov and Svetlana Voronkova, proudly watched their daughter's first moments with the crown on.
They arrived in the audience from Pertunmaa and planned to drive back home after the final.
Have a wonderful atmosphere!
We believed in Erika all the time, but half an hour before the result we started to get nervous, Svetlana laughed.
Svetlana is Ingrian and Dimitri Russian.
Alina speaks fluent Russian, even though she has lived in Finland all her childhood.
Svetlana says that when she was little, Alina was more interested in acting and many other things than her career.
Alina was often told that when she was so pretty she should miss it.
But he announced that he wanted to be a radio host.
Only later did Alina get excited about beauty contests.
The parents' wish was that Alina would be admitted to university before participating in the Miss Finland competition.
This happened, and eventually Alina wanted to do her bachelor's degree before the Mississippi Games.
We already asked last year why he wasn't participating, but he wanted to finish that bachelor's thesis.
The parents believe that Alina won the competition because she is a wholesome example for young people and adults alike.
He plays a lot of sports and eats healthy.
And Alina likes to be on display, it shows.
Alina's boyfriend Joonas Hurri plays ice hockey for a living in Japan and was unable to come to Finland to cheer on his beloved in the final.
Alina's parents believe that the relationship of the young will last for a miss year.
Yes, that is the intention!
The parents hoped that their daughter would soon be able to visit.
Now there has been such a long break in visits due to the miss rush.
It is already unfortunate, even though messages have been sent.
Young man killed in speeding in Lahti - police apprehend three people
According to police, three people have been apprehended in connection with the incident.
On Saturday, the Häme police did not comment on the course of events or the possible intentionality of the drive-over, citing the incomplete nature of the investigation.
The police also did not comment on whether the arrested persons and the man killed in the crash knew each other beforehand.
Further information on the case will not be available until early next week at the earliest.
Sari Piippo left her career in Brussels to become a housewife in Finland - the idea of a comic strip popped into her mind: lack of drawing skills did not slow her down
The organic fool started from my husband's statement in which he suggested it for a story I had developed as a person, says Sari Piippo, a comic blogger, housewife and former EU translator from Espoo.
Sari Piippo says that she worked as an EU translator in Brussels on financial and legal matters until the family returned ten years ago after her fourth child.
I have enjoyed being a stay-at-home mom very well.
This has been the best time of my life, but at some point I wondered what to do when I grew up, when even the smallest child was already getting big.
Then in 2014 a cartoon came into the picture.
Piippo says that he had never dreamed of making a comic, even though he had read Donald Duck, Tintin and Asterix since he was a child.
The last time I had drawn was as a child, but when these scripts for Luomuhömpä started to emerge then, the situation changed.
At first, I wrote a few dozen manuscripts in a desk drawer.
My daughter Viivi Valkama (b. 2000) is a skilled draughtsman, but I didn't get her to join until summer 2016, when I bribed Viivi with a drawing board.
His enthusiasm lasted for about ten strips, and then I had to start trying myself, laughs Piippo, who says that the drawing board was a great encouragement for him.
A drawing board is an easy and handy tool to try to get something done.
I didn't even try to draw on paper," says Piippo about his relationship with drawing, which he usually does in the evenings.
Manuscripts pop into my mind all the time, but usually I don't finish it all at once.
One three-frame strip takes up to several hours.
I might do one frame at a time and I like to play with colors.
Starting to draw is always the hardest thing because drawing is not my strongest sport.
Sari Piippo says that she appreciates Scott Adams' Dilbert, among others, among the contemporary comics in newspapers.
The characters in the organic humpa are an L-themed carrot-body mother with salad hair.
Other characters include Man, Pee, and Gemini.
In the world of organic fools, people are what they eat.
The ideas in the series come from one's own life and social media.
Sari Piippo doesn't want to preach or offer a forced bun, even though Luomuhömppa occasionally gets into it.
Piippo says she reads her series with her husband and children.
After all, it's such a great feeling when you look at a cartoon you've drawn and say, this is what I've done today.
And there are plenty of challenges for housewives!

Next week there will be €3.6 million in the lottery pot.
There were two 6 correct results in Saturday Joker.
Another €20,000 prize will go to Vantaa for the winner who played with a Veikkaus card at S-Market Tikkurila.
The other was picked up by an online player from Vaasa.
Indonesia earthquake: Air traffic controller sacrificed himself - did not leave cracked tower until he got hundreds of passengers to safety
The hero of the Indonesian earthquake is 21-year-old air traffic controller Anthonius Gunawan Agung.
Agung was left alone in the control tower until he was able to safely take off the earthquake-stricken island.
The youngster was on duty at Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie Airport in Palu town when the earthquake struck on Friday.
As the others fled the control tower, Agung refused to leave his seat until he was able to steer the Batik Air airliner off the runway.
This allowed him to save hundreds of lives, Indonesia's aviation administration told AFP.
Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie airport on Saturday after the earthquake.
The control tower trembled and cracked.
Eventually, Agung tried to save himself by jumping from the fourth floor of the tower.
His leg was broken and he suffered severe internal organ injuries.
Agung was rushed to a nearby hospital.
He was due to be transported by helicopter to a better-equipped facility, but died 20 minutes before the helicopter arrived, an aviation administration spokesperson told The Jakarta Post.
The quake intensified further after the flight took off, eventually measuring a magnitude of 7.5.
At least 832 people lost their lives.
The Indonesian Federal Aviation Authority has paid tribute to Agung's heroism on social media.
Rehn pondered on Yle that Europe ended up in a trade war: "You have to watch the next tweet"
The trade war between the United States and China is reflected throughout the global economy.
Growth forecasts have been lowered throughout Europe, and the Bank of Finland has also lowered its own economic growth estimates slightly.
Director General Olli Rehn said on YLE's first morning that although the escalating tension does not have a direct impact on European trade flows, it weakens confidence, which in turn is reflected in companies' investment decisions.
The situation also applies to the exports of Finnish companies.
In Rehn's opinion, Europe is well on its way so far.
It has been able to build an armistice with the United States and has also helped to calm the situation with China and Japan.
In Rehn's opinion, Europe does not seem to be grinding at the feet of a trade war.
Need to watch the next tweet and evaluate it afterwards.
We have a rather unpredictable partner in Washington, however, he said in an interview with Yle.
Europe also has its own risks.
One of them is Italy, the third largest economy in the euro area, which is also one of the most indebted countries in the euro area and in the Western world as a whole.
Yesterday, the markets reacted violently to the clearly deficit budget presented by the Italian Government on Thursday evening.
Next year's deficit will be more than 2.4% of GDP.
Rehn finds the situation in Italy worrying.
Five per cent of the country's loan stock is bad loans, and non-performing loans account for more than ten per cent.
In addition, its public finances are weak and the country again appears to be exceeding its commitments vis-à-vis its European partners.
It may not be worth painting yet more crises, Rehn replied when asked whether Italy would lead Europe into a new economic crisis.
Another issue facing Europe is Britain's withdrawal from the EU.
Rehn hoped that it would be reconciled.
A contentious separation would have much more negative effects.
Rehn started as Governor of the Bank of Finland in July.
Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank (ECB), will step down in just over a year.
Discussion about his successor has begun.
The names of both Rehn and his predecessor Erkki Liikanen have appeared in speeches.
It probably doesn't matter if Finnish names are included, Rehn said, adding that he would not comment further on the matter.
HS's super-popular Black Box performances will continue again next week - the last tickets to Helsinki are on sale
The popular Black Box performances organised by Helsingin Sanomat will continue again this week.
Other performances will take place at the Finnish National Theatre on 2, 8 and 11 October.
On 23 October, the Black Box will visit Tampere Theatre for the first time.
There are still some tickets for the National Theatre on sale.
The Tampere performance is sold out.
Tickets are sold by Lippu.fi.
During the evening, the journalists and photographers performing on stage will tell a true story they have been preparing for a long time, which has not previously been published in any HS medium.
Again, there's something no one has ever heard of.
"There is a strange spy in Helsinki Night, an impressive report from the other side of the world and a compelling story about a very topical health issue," says Esa Lilja, one of the producers of The Black Box.
After the presentation, the audience will have the opportunity to meet HS's journalists and photographers and continue the discussion.
Helsingin Sanomat has organised live journalism evenings for three years.
They have been popular from the beginning and often sold out.
More than 15,000 people have already visited the stands.
The black box was awarded journalistic act of the year at the Bonnier Awards.
The awardees praised the new way of doing journalism and journalists' desire to get close to their readers.
The Black Box of spring 2019 will be seen at the Finnish National Theatre in March-April.
The show will also visit Tampere and Turku.
The performance at that time has a different content than this autumn's evenings.
Lost mushroom picker found thanks to "open-minded experiment"
The Finnish police's drone expertise is among the best in the world: "People ask us for training"
According to the rector of the Police University College, in addition to searching for missing persons, the police can use drones in crime scene investigations and intelligence tasks, for example.
On Tuesday, the Oulu police managed to find a missing mushroom picker in Raahe with the help of a drone in just a couple of minutes.
The Rector of the Police University College, Kimmo Himberg, tweeted about the incident and mentioned, among other things, that "through open-minded experimentation and effective training, we are also world leaders in this".
The drone is quite new and even more recent in police duties.
Nowhere are there any statistics showing that the Finnish police are masters of drone use.
According to Himberg, there is a strong belief that this is the case.
This has become clear, for example, when the experiences of the Finnish police have been reported at international events.
There is a lot of interest in it elsewhere," Himberg says.
There would be a lot of visitors to watch the drone activities of the Finnish police.
We are asked for training.
Becoming even more common
Himberg points out that finding a missing person as soon as possible in Finland's winter conditions is very important.
As mentioned, in the case of Raahe, the lost person was found with the help of a drone in just a couple of minutes.
The Finnish police have already trained hundreds of drone pilots.
According to Himberg, the intention is to train them more.
Drones are already widely used in police tasks, and their use will become more common and increase in the future.
That's what I would dare to say," Himberg says.
According to Himberg, in addition to searching for missing persons, the police can use drones in accident or crime scene investigations and in certain kinds of reconnaissance tasks.
For example, you already have to check an area from a little further away, where there may be a fear of violence being encountered there.
In this case, the drone can be used for advance reconnaissance.
Karelian Rugby promoted to the first division
Karelian Rugby celebrated winning Division 2 in Kuopio on Saturday.
The Joensuu side were still 7-12 down to Helsinki Rugby Club halfway through the match, but found a plot in the second period and whispered the visitors from the south 26-12.
The 2nd division championship also meant a historic promotion to Division 1 for Karelian Rugby.
The club has previously played in the top flight, but at that time Finnish rugby league operations were divided into two levels, the SM-sarja and the multi-group Division 1.
The club intends to accept a place in the league, but that means quite a bit of work for next winter.
The current roster of just under twenty players must be increased to 25.
Division 1 also means an increase in the number of games and longer game distances, so fundraising must also be in line with that.
Kotkaniemi starts season in Montreal, confirms head coach
Claude Julien, head coach of the Montreal Canadiens of the National Hockey League (NHL), confirmed on the club's Twitter account that Finnish forward Jesperi Kotkaniemi will start the season in Montreal.
Montreal drafted super-promising Kotkaniemi, 18, in the first round, at number three in the summer draft.
The striker joined Montreal's training squad at the end of the summer and has shown strong performances in September's training matches.
Kotkaniemi managed to score a goal in his first practice match.
Head coach Julien praised the Finn for taking big steps forward since arriving at the rookie camp.
The NHL regular season starts on Thursday night next week, Finnish time.
Montreal will face the Toronto Maple Leafs in the opening round.
What makes a good leader?
There has been a lot of talk about leadership in Finland this week.
In an interview with HS, Risto Siilasmaa, Chairman of Nokia's Board of Directors, talked about his book Paranoid optimisti, in which he sheds light on his leadership philosophy.
At the same time, he criticises the leadership of his predecessor Jorma Ollila.
Ollila vehemently denied the accusations, but previous Nokia reports have also talked about the leaders' inability to work as a team; fear and lack of talk, which partly caused the collapse of the mobile phone business.
The company's risk-taking capacity and agility during the upward phase disappeared.
During the week, Helsinki also hosted the Nordic Business Forum, a giant business event, which drew the cream of Finnish business life to Messukeskus.
In addition to main star Barack Obama, 12 stars from the business world took to the stage.
There was plenty of talk about good leadership.
Management legend Gary Hamel said that a good leader must have the courage to take the company into the future even when the company is doing well.
The problem is that decisions are made by those who are most emotionally tied to decisions from the past.
John Mackey, founder of Whole Foods, a chain of stores known for its wide range of organic products, said a manager needs to be able to communicate the company's purpose to all staff.
And that purpose can't just be to make a profit for the owners.
Susan Cain, author of a bestselling book about introverts, said that studies show that the most successful leaders are humble.
They act calmly, quietly and purposefully.
Often they are introverts.
Professor of Finance Aswath Damodaran pointed out that the qualities of a good leader must coincide with the stage of a company's life cycle.
In the early stages of a company, the director must be able to tell the story on which the company's future is based.
A company that has grown to a mature stage needs a manager who knows the numbers.
These lessons were listened to by 7,500 visitors at the Nordic Business Forum – mainly Finnish executives.
They ran the risk of information overload.
A lot is required of a good leader.
That's why leadership so often goes wrong, even at the highest level.
Siilasmaa and Ollila were also present.
They talked to each other backstage in a comradely manner.
However, they hardly wondered whether they were the right leaders for Nokia at the right time.
And their humility was not easy for an outsider to judge.
Sara Chafak arrived stunning on the red carpet straight from Los Angeles — spending most of her year overseas
Model Sara Chafak arrived at the miss final in a stunning black dress.
The 2012 Miss Finland pageant dress also had a lace drapery.
A bit of poden jet lag.
I came again from Los Angeles.
I spend most of my time there," Chafak says.
Chafak says he goes to Los for an audition.
Among other things, he has done commercial photography.
He describes his works in the United States as interesting, and also similar to those in Finland.
However, according to him, the work needs to be done even harder, as it is easy to always find a replacement for the model's work.
You have to push harder and be aggressive," Chafak says.
Choreographer Sonya Lindfors wins €30,000 live art prize in Kuopio
Artist Sonya Lindfors won a cultural prize worth 30,000 euros on Saturday in Kuopio.
Lindfors, winner of the Anti Festival International Prize for Live Art, works with choreography, community activism and teaching.
Sonya Lindfors' art is vital to her immediate environment.
Her work allows others to work and create spaces for dialogue in environments they have previously lacked, the jury said of the winner.
In addition to Lindfors from Finland, a number of international artists were nominated for the prize.
The prize is awarded annually to an exceptionally strong artist or group operating in the field of live art.
Danish police find Volvo wanted in major operation: "We can't tell you where"
Extensive searches by the Danish police have yielded results.
At the beginning of the operation, traffic was closed on the Öresund and Great Belt bridges.
All land and ferry traffic from the island of Zealand was closed to Sweden, Germany and the rest of Denmark.
The police were looking for a black Volvo V90 registered in Sweden.
IS reached out to the shift manager of the Copenhagen police media centre.
The wanted car has been found.
We cannot yet say where the car was found," Henrik Storm from Copenhagen police told Ilta-Sanomat.
According to Storm, the wanted black Volvo has no direct connection to the threat, according to police.
According to him, the greatest danger has passed.
The Danish newspaper Ekstra Bladet reported on Saturday's police press conference.
Investigator Jørgen Bergen Skov was silent about the operation.
He did not want to say under what criminal title the matter is being investigated.
However, Skov said it was a "serious crime."
It was a threat to people's lives.
Three people have been searched for in the operation.
Police do not say whether they have already been apprehended.
According to the newspaper, restrictions on ferry services have been lifted.
Copenhagen police also followed the events on their Twitter account.
However, according to the police, the general public no longer has cause for concern, as the threat targeted certain people.
The name Macedonia has been divisive for decades - now the people vote on it in contentious elections
Macedonia in the Balkans is currently voting on a proposal for a new name for the country.
According to the agreement between the Macedonian and Greek governments, the name would be the Republic of North Macedonia.
Greece has so far vetoed Macedonia's efforts to become a member of NATO and the EU.
According to Greece, the name Macedonia belongs to its northern province.
The question of the referendum does not mention a new name, but asks whether the voter is in favour of Macedonia's membership of the EU and NATO by approving the agreement.
Voting started slowly, at least at the school in the centre of the capital, Skopje.
Olivera Argirosvka, a retired nurse who voted at the school, hoped for support for the agreement.
A referendum will mean change if it opens the doors to Europe and NATO.
It means change, especially for young people, he said.
Macedonia, which became independent in 1991, has been officially referred to as the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev's government has campaigned for the agreement to be approved.
The nationalist right-wing opposition, including President Gjorge Ivanov, has called for a boycott of the referendum.
In addition to the result, there is also tension as to whether voter turnout will rise above the required 50%.
The referendum is not binding, but a 'yes' vote would give a mandate to amend the constitution.
A two-thirds majority in Parliament is required for a constitutional amendment.
The agreement has also yet to be approved by the Greek Parliament.
Polling stations close at eight o'clock Finnish time.
Handsome victory!
Robert Helenius knocked out Erkan Teper
Robert Helenius faced Erkan Teper late Saturday night in a professional heavyweight boxing match in Germany.
The 34-year-old Finn took on his 36-year-old German opponent in Waldenbuch near Stuttgart.
The main fight of the evening was the IBF heavyweight Intercontinental title bout.
The winner may have the opportunity to compete in tougher tasks than those seen on Saturday, which have considerable financial significance.
Helenius settled the match in the eighth round, knocking out Teper with a fierce left-hand strike.
Teper could no longer get up from the floor.
"Nordic Nightmare" hurt his opponent already in the third set, when the German's nose began to bleed.
Helenius and Teper met in the ring for the first time.
They were supposed to fight back in December 2015.
That's when Teper cited injury and withdrew from the match.
After that, it turned out that the German had failed a doping test twice.
Helenius has taken 28 matches in his professional career and suffered two defeats.
Teper, who went into the match as a clear favourite, has won 19 professional fights in his career and lost three times.
Hamilton wins by team order - gap to Vettel already 50 points
The Formula One championship title was once again nearing securing as Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton won the Russian Grand Prix and stretched his World Championship points lead over Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel to 50 points (306-256).
There are only five races left.
Valtteri Bottas, who started the race from pole position, drove second.
Bottas, who took his career-opening win in Sochi last year, held the top spot near the halfway point of the race, but Mercedes told Bottas to let Hamilton pass.
Vettel drove third, Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen fourth.
Red Bull's Max Verstappen, who started from the last starting row, was fifth.
Two assaulted Jewish man in Joensuu - caught a block away
Two men punched and kicked a 31-year-old Jewish man at Siltakatu 12 in Joensuu just after 6pm on Saturday.
According to police, the men also stole the victim's phone, among other things.
The police caught up with the suspects, a 35-year-old man with hay water and a 39-year-old man from Ilomantsi, a block away shortly after the incident.
They were taken into custody on suspicion of robbery, police said.
The victim suffered contusion injuries that did not require a visit to a doctor.
Elon Musk, CEO of electric car company Tesla, is leaving his position as chairman of the company's board.
Musk has reached an agreement with US officials.
Meanwhile, Musk has been fined $20 million for tweeting that he secured funding to pull Tesla off the exchange.
The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has accused Musk of securities fraud.
Musk will continue to serve as Tesla's CEO, but the company will also have to pay a fine of €20 million if the deal between the authorities and Musk is confirmed in court.
Canada fights against time to reach agreement on NAFTA with USA
Time is threatening to run out in the middle of negotiations between the United States and Canada on a free trade agreement on NAFTA.
The United States has set a deadline of Sunday, and the countries' negotiators have held intensive talks throughout the weekend.
Canada's chief negotiator, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, postponed her speech to the UN General Assembly in order to focus fully on trade negotiations.
At the insistence of President Donald Trump, the United States, Canada and Mexico began negotiations about a year ago to reform the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
At the end of August, Mexico and the United States reached an agreement, but no agreement has yet been reached with Canada.
The United States and Mexico want to bring the agreement into force before Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who won the Mexican presidential election, takes office in early December.
Trump has said Canada's participation in the agreement is not necessary.
He has previously informed Congress that there are plans to sign the agreement at the end of November – whether Canada is involved or not.
Given these timetables, the text of the agreement between the United States and Canada should be ready on Sunday in order to give the US Congress sufficient time to assess it.
A neighbour thought candles were blazing into a fire in Kaakkuri - the fire brigade was alerted
Candles burned in an apartment building in Kaakkuri, Oulu, caused a fire alarm on the night before Sunday.
A dozen units of the rescue department were alerted to the scene due to a possible fire in an apartment building.
At the scene, it was discovered that the candles burned in the sauna of the apartment building had looked like a fire in the house opposite, which is why the emergency response centre had been notified.
There was no fire on the property.
Police apprehend 11 people after the Honka-HJK match - brawls at the airport and metro station
Eleven people were apprehended by the police after the Honka-HJK men's football league match played in Espoo on Saturday, Detective Chief Inspector Teemu Värtinen of the Western Uusimaa Police Department confirmed to STT.
The grounds for apprehension were protection from crime and disturbance.
Those arrested were released after the situation had calmed down, Värtinen said.
The apprehensions were previously reported by the Ilta-Sanomat.
The match ended 0-0.
After the final whistle, a large number of spectators rushed onto the pitch from the stands reserved for HJK supporters.
The situation led to pushing and fistfights between supporters of the teams.
Among other things, mounted police were needed to end the situation.
In addition to the airport, brawls took place in the area of a nearby metro station, where some of the apprehensions also took place.
I wasn't there, but from what I saw in the pictures, the situation was unpleasant," Värtinen said, referring to the brawl that took place on the field.
According to Värtinen, no police reports have been filed as a result of the events.
Table stone dazzled his time in butterfly swimming at the World Cup, Laukkanen also swam to the final
Jenna Laukkanen and Riku Pöytäkivi have advanced to the finals on the closing day of the 3/7 World Cup in the Netherlands.
The races will be swum in Eindhoven on a short course.
HSS's Pöytäkivi dazzled her Finnish record in the 50-metre butterfly, where she was second in the heats with a time of 22.82.
Earlier in September, Pöytäkivi swam a distance SE time of 22.77 in Helsinki.
Ari-Pekka Liukkonen, representing Cetus from Espoo, was 24th in the butterfly with a time of 24.68.
Swimming Club Vuokatti's Laukkanen was sixth in the heats of the 50 m breaststroke with a time of 30.48 and advanced to the final.
In the preliminary heats of the two-hundred-metre medley, Laukkanen was 15th with a time of 2:14.25.
Students act out a rare delicacy: an ancient tragedy - the simplistic Oresteia impresses with its visuals
Ancient tragedies are a rare delicacy on Finnish stages.
For example, the National Theatre last saw an ancient tragedy, Sophocles' Philoctetes, in 1988.
Now the Theatre Academy brought the only trilogy of ancient plays that has survived in its entirety, Aeschylus' Oresteia, to the tour starting at the National Theatre.
Stages open, which started in 2015! projects, Theatre Academy acting students work together with a professional director internationally.
This fourth project, like the first, is directed by Berlin-based Mikko Roiha.
Oresteia had its international premiere in Berlin in April.
Roiha's adaptation of Oresteia sums up the story of the end of the vendetta of the doomed Atreus family and the birth of the rule of law to its credit in one hour and twenty minutes, especially by condensing the choral parts.
The work manages to be very faithful to the spirit of Kirsti Simonsuur's fine Finnish translation (2003).
The dramatic lights and revealing presentation on the sides of the theatre space emphasise the simplistic and bright stage thinking.
At its core is the dynamic between the performers who alternately leave the choir and play the title roles, and the choir.
The performance uses both double and triple interpretations of the title roles.
The actors do not leave the stage at all, so for example, the murders of Agamemnon, returning from the Trojan War, and his spoils of war, Cassandra, are also shown on stage, contrary to the tradition of performing in antiquity.
Of course, the performance does not emphasize that it is faithful to the ancient performance tradition.
Rather, a modern, faithful interpretation of the text is created before the viewer's eyes, constantly aware of its ritualistic roots.
Roiha has succeeded in bringing out a rhythmic group of master's stage acting students who perform as a tight-knit group, even as a single organism.
Especially in the choral parts, the actors who flexibly bend to very expressive, sculptural group formations come into their own on a bare stage, decorated only with a white curtain.
Impressive.
Oresteia's performance tour continues to the Kouvola and Oulu Theatres.
Korean manufacturer manufactures its first hydrogen froster
The novelty is starting to show in Europe, especially thanks to the cooperation agreement between Hyindai and the Swiss company H2 Energy.
According to the cooperation agreement announced at the IAA commercial vehicle show in Hanover, Hyundai will supply a batch of one thousand cars to the Swiss company and its partners.
With the launch of the fuel cell truck, Hyundai continues on the path set by the Nexo and ix35/Tucson Fuel Cell models as a hydrogen car manufacturer.
With this world-first project of its kind, we are taking fuel cell technology even further.
We are also constantly looking for opportunities to expand the market for these vehicles, for example by monitoring the development of the refuelling network," Hyundai Motor Executive Vice President In Cheol Lee said at the announcement of the agreement.
Fists flung several times in Kajaani
A man in his early thirties assaulted three men in and in front of a restaurant in the centre of Kajaani in the early hours of Saturday.
The man first punched one man inside the restaurant, as a result of which he was removed from the scene.
Outside, he pushed another man to the ground, and when the third man intervened, the abuser hit him again.
The police apprehended the abuser.
At the police station, the man continued to behave aggressively and kicked another police officer in the leg.
The man also threatened police with assault and killing.
The man was taken to the jail to calm down.
The case is being investigated as three counts of assault and violent resistance to a public official.
There was also another assault incident on Välikatu in the centre of Kajaani in the early hours of Saturday.
The victim was assaulted by two men.
First, a 20-year-old man from Kajaani punched the victim.
A short time later, another man knocked him to the ground and the man who had punched him earlier kicked the victim.
Outsiders pulled the abusers away from the victim and the police were called.
However, the perpetrators had already left before the police arrived.
The police ask anyone who witnessed the incident to contact the Kajaani police by phone 0295 416 520 or by email at tutkinta.kainuu@poliisi.fi.
Long-time radio host Erkki Pälli has died
Erkki Pälli, known as a long-time journalist for Yle, died of cancer at the age of 83.
Radio host Erkki Pälli, 83, has died.
He died of incurable liver cancer, which he announced on his Facebook page in March 2018.
Yes, this is the way to go.
Even the doctor has said it, I live one day at a time," he told Iltalehti a month ago.
The safety of shop aunts and uncles must be guaranteed
I was first paid for a newspaper article in 1984.
When a story topic surprises you with these annual rings, it is usually big news.
When I wrote (Karjalainen, 27.9.) about the insecurity of retail workers, I was amazed and at times even a little angry.
I also spoke to Erika Kähärä, working environment specialist at the Service Union Union (PAM).
He says crime statistics do not reflect the real situation.
The problem is growing, although, of course, employers claim otherwise.
Only cases that are clearly considered serious are reported to the police, and many real violent situations remain unreported.
"Of course, companies are obliged to compile statistics on their near misses on the basis of the Occupational Safety and Health Act, but these statistics remain for internal use and their data is not collected anywhere," he said.
Mental disabilities do not end up in statistics.
The problem with violent situations has always been that they do not always result in physical injury.
Despite this, psychological trauma can be much more serious than bruises and wounds.
It is difficult to draw the distinction between a situation of violence and a threatening situation of violence when a certain level of aggressive threats must also be counted as violence - even if there is no assault.
Too many people are afraid at work, even though the actual act does not happen.
Some neighborhoods are restless.
The store has acquired guards.
When shop opening hours were deregulated, there was quite a lot of buzz in the media about its effects on the safety of sellers.
"Back then, quite a few employers arranged security guard services at least for night-time hours and to prevent people from working alone," Kähärä comments.
When nothing happens, the wrong conclusion is made.
This now seems to have had an effective effect, but this produces a new negative trend.
When disturbances were well controlled due to guarding, the impression was created that guarding would be unnecessary.
Many places are now trying to find solutions that could eliminate expensive security guard services.
Petty assault is a civil party offence, and it is quite understandable that a salesperson who has been assaulted does not want to make a request for investigation of a criminal who usually lives near the store.
But according to the same subsection of the law enacted in 2011, petty assault becomes subordinate to the prosecutor if it occurs in the workplace.
I believe that precedents are needed now.
The next time an aunt or uncle in a shop is assaulted, the police should investigate and the prosecutor prosecute.
When the court put a few abusers in jail, and the sentence from there at the high end of the punishment scale, the habits would be tidied up.
A society in which grocery stores have to be open almost day and night, even in small towns, must guarantee the safety of store employees.
Heidi Sohlberg acknowledged the miss before the start of the live broadcast - "Sara, Iiro is married then"
This year, Miss's coronation will not be seen on TV in the traditional way, but will be broadcast on the Viafree website.
The broadcast will be hosted by former Miss Finland Heidi Sohlberg and Iiro Harjula, host of Viasat and Viaplay's NHL and KHL studios.
The backstage and red carpet host is Janni Hussi.
Before the live broadcast, the trio of presenters informed the invited guests and media representatives about the broadcast.
At first, Sohlberg asked the audience to give Harjula a resounding round of applause.
Now all the women scream!
Now look at this male presenter of ours," Sohlberg enthused as his colleague cheered the crowd.
From the front row, many of the Miss Finland contests from previous years will follow.
Sara Chafak and Sara Sieppi, among others, sat next to each other, and Sohlberg threw a little joke in one direction or the other.
Sara, Iiro is married then!
Sohlberg snapped, looking towards Saros.
Most likely, Sohlberg was referring to the recently divorced Sieppi, who laughed at the comment, although he seemed confused at first.
Sieppi spoke about her resignation for the first time in the weekend newspaper of Ilta-Sanomat.
Miss Beauty said that she does not want to open up the reasons for the divorce in more detail in public, as it is a matter between her and Roope Salminen.
She said she's in no hurry for a new relationship, she's going to focus on herself.
I focus on my own stuff and especially start living my own life alone, Sara Sieppi said.
Harjula's marriage status came up even later, when Sohlberg accidentally mistakenly called Janni Huss and Iiro Harjula a couple.
The trio of presenters laughed at the screw-up.
Iiro, after all, was married, or how did it go?
Janni Hussi acknowledged the mistake.
An Ostrobothnian man tortured his bound partner by slashing, burning and feeding strong sauce
The Ostrobothnian District Court has sentenced a 34-year-old man living in Kokkola to three years in prison for numerous offences against his common-law partner.
The instruments of the crime included a belt, cable and cable ties.
The court ordered the items in question to be confiscated to the state.
Rank's charge was for a suspect of aggravated rape.
However, this charge was dismissed by the district court.
The Kokkola resident was charged with four assaults, aggravated assault, coercion, unlawful threats, deprivation of liberty, aggravated deprivation of liberty and two damages to property.
The crimes took place between 26 March last year and 24 May.
At the end of the last acts, the man was apprehended and imprisoned a couple of days later.
On Thursday last week, the Ostrobothnian District Court handed down its verdict and ordered the 34-year-old to continue to be held in Vaasa prison.
No evidence of rape
The 34-year-old was also charged with two counts of aggravated deprivation of liberty and aggravated rape on May 22.
However, these charges were dismissed by the court as unproven.
The case was heard in court behind closed doors.
However, the district judge issued a public record of the judgment.
According to the district judge, the accused had subjected his spouse to violence, threats and coercion in situations where she had been tied up.
The defendant slashed his victim with a knife, smoked tobacco, fed strong sauce and poured water and coffee over her.
In its judgment, the court ordered the confiscation of the instrumentalities of crime to the state: belt and cable, cable ties, bathrobe, belt, knife and knife.
Four witnesses
According to the district court, the parties continued to live together between the acts.
It can be read in the operative part of the sentence that a large number of the most aggravated acts took place at the end of the criminal period.
The court heard four witnesses, two women and two men.
The 34-year-old must pay compensation for pain, suffering, suffering and temporary inconvenience totalling EUR 5800 to the victim.
He hardly has this money, as the convicted person already has debts in collection.
The prison sentence is not the man's first.
Iltalehti does not disclose the name of the convicted person in order to protect the victim's privacy.
The recent district judgment is not final at the time of writing.
Europe with four-point lead to Ryder Cup decider
European golf pros solidified their lead on Saturday in a traditional hole-play match against the United States.
Europe leads the Ryder Cup on the outskirts of Paris by a score of 10-6, with twelve singles matches still to be played on Sunday.
Europe won three of the four four-ball matches that started Saturday, and in the afternoon doubles the victories were tied 2-2.
Europe's leading stars were Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who won all four paired matches on Friday and Saturday.
Previously, no European couple had achieved this.
On Sunday, the duo will be aiming for more history.
No European player has won five points in a single Ryder Cup, and only three American players have achieved one: Arnold Palmer and Gardiner Dickinson (1969) and Larry Nelson (1979).
HJK condemns the violent harassment of its supporters at the Honka match: "Violence has no place in football"
The Finnish football Veikkausliiga team HJK published a statement on Sunday in which it condemns the disruptive behaviour of its supporters during Saturday's FC Honka match in Tapiola.
"We apologize for the events after the Honka-HJK match on behalf of our supporters," the statement said.
After the match ended, about 50 HJK supporters rushed onto the pitch and some seemed to be trying to get into a dispute with Honka's supporters.
A fight also broke out between supporters.
The security guards could not calm the situation down, and police officers and also mounted police were needed.
HJK says in a statement that the team's players and officials are shocked by what happened.
What happens after the match is not in line with the values of our traditional 111-year-old club.
"We strongly dissociate ourselves from any activity that jeopardises the safety of match events," the statement said.
HJK promises to help the authorities and event organisers in investigating factors threatening safety and eliminating side effects.
Supporter culture is part of football and important to HJK.
We support positive, joyful and encouraging activities in the football stands in every way.
"Violence is not part of it," the statement said.
Filipino inventor flies drone car - this is how traffic jams are avoided
Mendiola is a Filipino inventor, hip-hop dancer, and something of a Clown the Fearless.
He is now part of a growing group around the world who swears they invented the flying car - or at least his own version of it.
As competitors, he has, for example, such factors as Audi and Airbus.
However, Mendiola does not believe in mass production of his device.
According to reports from around the world, the man has used a large part of his fortune to build his dream.
Six years ago, he began developing his flying car.
Now he calls the development version a drone car.
Recently, he says he made the first successful test flight - he glided with his device at an altitude of more than seven meters.
One of his goals was to avoid traffic jams.
I hope that the device will provoke positive reactions.
This was just a dream five years ago," Mendiola said, according to the British Daily Mail.
JHL anticipates: Industrial action starting tomorrow will affect children's day care and social and health care services
In the public and welfare sectors, the prohibitions on overtime and shift changes starting tomorrow will be particularly visible in health and social services and child day care, says Päivi Niemi-Laine, President of JHL.
The effects will be extensive and will certainly be felt in such a way that there will not be enough staff on site.
Everyone has to think about how to pick up their children.
It is now up to the employer to ensure that the services work and that no one's life is threatened," Niemi-Laine tells STT.
According to Niemi-Laine, the shortage of employees was also visible at the beginning of the year, when JHL members were banned from working overtime and changing shifts due to contract negotiations.
Through flexibility, employers have made it possible not to hire staff but to work overtime or change shifts.
This is not yet industrial action.
From the point of view of occupational safety and health, it is a normal thing to ensure regular working hours for each employee and only to do them.
JHL is taking measures to oppose the Government's intention to ease the protection against dismissal of small companies.
Markku Jalonen, Labour Market Director of Municipal Employers, will not begin to assess the effects of the prohibitions on overtime and shift changes in advance.
However, he does not believe that they will be very revolutionary, although services may deteriorate.
Employers all over Finland are aware of this and have made the preparations that can be made.
The area is so impossibly large, the social and health care sector and the technical sector that it is difficult to say.
The impacts can vary greatly by industry, region and employer," Jalonen told STT.
Jalonen says that last week we already gained experiences of similar three-day actions by the Association of Practical and Basic Nurses Super and Tehy, the professional organisation for social and health care.
Their effects were quite minor.
JHL's ban on overtime and shift changes applies to, among others, employees in municipalities, the church, the state and the private social and health care sector.
For example, family daycare providers are excluded.
At this stage, the industrial action affects nearly 100,000 JHL members.
According to Niemi-Laine, JHL's actions may take a long time.
The union is also prepared for other industrial action if the preparation of the Act on Dismissal continues.
The government should now admit that this is running into a wall and going hard.
In Jalonen's opinion, both the trade union movement and the government must respond.
What is special about this is that the hard ones are already in the barrel, even though the proposal has not yet been given, Jalonen says.
The Great Coral Reef is created by children and adults - the fitness circles of the show study the gestures of a stingray and a seahorse
The Great Coral Reef of the Other Spaces collective premiered last spring in Hamburg and last Saturday it was performed for the second time in Finland, this time in Kanneltalo.
Like the group's previous works, The Great Coral Reef is a work that is built from start to finish together with the audience.
This time, however, a more clearly defined presentation will also be built, which refreshes and crystallizes the observations made in the initial exercises.
Theatre play also has fairy-tale magic for child participants.
The child's perspective has already been included in the preparation phase of the work.
However, The Great Coral Reef is not a children's show, but a performance that adults and children do together.
It provides adults with information and observations about children's way of receiving information and making art.
Children's ability to throw themselves into exercises and shared games also dissolves the distance between adults and children.
The Great Coral Reef is somewhat reminiscent of fairytale ballet, fitness circles and nature-themed information sessions, but it finally tunes into other, non-human conditions around visits.
The Great Coral Reef begins with learning about the trajectories of corals and the organisms and fish living on the coral reef.
In six different fitness circles, you will learn, for example, the gestures of a stingray and a seahorse.
Finally, there is a performance lasting less than an hour, where music, lights, shiny paints and costumes help you get to know life on the coral reef.
The Great Coral Reef is both diving people observing coral reef life and the corals being viewed.
In addition, we are organisms that look at corals.
Glances and observations in many directions make the performance dense and teeming with life.
Whether you are the landscape of one organism, the organism looking at the landscape, and another organism or landscape looking at the organism - and all of this at the same time.
For children, it doesn't seem difficult at all.
With its exercises, the In Other Spaces group strives to reach the boundary between thinking and acting, which is challenging to reach when the group consists of both children and adults.
On the other hand, the presence of children makes it more significant.
After the workshop, there will be a silent demonstration on behalf of endangered corals at Sitratori.
Disasters beyond human understanding should not be allowed to harden, even though it might be difficult to comprehend the significance of practicing one's own compassion in the face of visions of destruction.
In other spaces, she has constructed her work in such a way that it respects the diversity of life, even through a political gesture.
There are other generations, there are other kinds of consciousnesses, other species and their future generations, for whom it clears space for wonder and play.
Children grow up too quickly - I am happy that there were no smartphones in my childhood
Today's children and young people are increasingly irresponsible.
Young people start smoking and drinking all the time at a younger and younger age.
In my opinion, children should be children throughout their childhood and not mess up their lives because of drugs and sex because others say they do.
I was overwhelmed when my friend told me that she had had to pick up her fifth-grade sister over the weekend from a "boyfriend."
When he came to pick up his drunken sister, she told us about her sexual experiences that night.
I couldn't possibly imagine my own sister in the same situation, because we've been told and warned throughout our childhood that you can't touch drugs and sex is an adult thing.
I wish today's children could live a proper childhood and not have to grow up too early because of peer pressure from friends.
I keep seeing younger and younger girls on Instagram who are wearing makeup and revealing their clothes in their photos.
Snapchat is used in the evenings to take and send revealing photos.
It is increasingly difficult for girls to guess what age they are.
Today's 13-year-olds can easily look like 18-year-olds and older.
My childhood consisted of playing in the woods and playing board games.
I am happy that there were no smartphones in my childhood.
I got to be a child for many, many years, and I didn't have to worry about what others thought of me.
Yle: Authorities have told the state leadership that the Airiston Helmi case is not related to national security
According to Ilkka Kanerva interviewed by Yle, Supo and the Finnish Defence Forces visited the Defence and Foreign Affairs Committees earlier this week to inform them.
The Finnish government has been told that the investigation of Airiston Helmi is not currently related to national security, but to organised crime, reports Yle.
The information from anonymous sources was confirmed to Yle by the chairman of the Defence Committee, Ilkka Kanerva (Conservative Party).
According to Kanerva, the Finnish Defence Forces and Supo visited the Defence and Foreign Affairs Committees this week to report on the ongoing investigation.
This is primarily considered financial crime.
They were quite strict about not speculating that there was anything else here, Kanerva commented in an interview with Yle.
According to YLE's information, no evidence of a connection to national security has been found in the seized material so far, but the investigation is still in its early stages.
There is no way we can yet know what may be revealed there, says one of Yle's interviewees.
The extensive house searches that began a week ago in the Turku archipelago and on the mainland have raised the question of whether the investigation is purely about economic crime or a threat to Finland's internal security.
Earlier this week, Iltalehti compiled an article reviewing arguments both for and against.
Video: dream goal saved Liverpool's unbeaten run
Liverpool's one hundred percent Premier League start came to an end, but they were still the happier team with a 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge.
Sunday marks exactly one year since Manchester City arrived at Stamford Bridge and ran away with a 1-0 away win.
It was then that Pep Guardiola's combination sent a signal to the entire Premier League that City were now serious.
Everyone remembers how last season ended.
And certainly Liverpool manager Jûrgen Klopp arrived in west London with the same idea.
The Reds had started the Premier League with six wins in a row.
Liverpool started stronger and Virgil van Dijk in particular seemed to be in control of his own end of the pitch alone.
Chelsea, on the other hand, had a fine League Cup away win at Anfield Road on Wednesday.
That's when Eden Hazard came off the bench to settle the match with a stunning individual performance.
Now, of course, Hazard was involved from the very first minutes.
In the 25th minute, he first ballooned in a small space for a triangle game with Mateo Kovacic and Jorginho.
In the end, the Croatian saw Hazard rush forward and sent him a perfectly weighted through-pass.
Hazard drifted a bit to the edge of the penalty area but bombed a perfect left-foot shot into the bottom corner.
Pool brass keeper Alisson was a bit slow in his save and could only get his fingertips on the ball.
Klopp must have felt that the defeat position was lightly unfair, as almost immediately afterwards Antonio Rüdiger cleared Mo Salah's header from the goal line.
In the second period, Chelsea veteran Kepa also got into action.
The Basque keeper reacted quickly to Sadio Mané's pull and pushed the ball from the base of the post into a corner kick.
At the other end, Alisson nullified Hazard's drive-through with his throw.
The visitors' best chance came in the 72nd minute when James Milner found Bobby Firmino with his centering.
However, the brass star's push was directed towards national team-mate David Luiz, who saved the hosts' lead.
That didn't last until the 89th minute when substitute Daniel Sturridge was free to shoot from 25 metres.
Sturridge was playing in his old home stadium and the striker bombed an irresistible shot into the top corner to his credit.
Liverpool's one hundred percent league start came to an end with a 1-1 draw, but they are still at the top of the league - along with Manchester City.
Chelsea are also firmly in the title race, two points behind the leaders.
In the clock change debate, the potholes run deep
I remember a few decades ago when a newspaper asked various Finnish influencers what divides the Finnish people.
Juice Leskinen's answer was the only one that stuck in my mind: the Nen suffix.
Some have a nen suffix in their surname and some do not.
After all, divisions can arise anywhere, and that is one offer.
In the EU, Finland has succeeded in abolishing the annual clock changes.
A great many people agree that changing the clocks twice a year has been a fool's errand and has caused all sorts of problems.
In the end, this achievement seems to be the easiest stage of the solution, at least in Finland, even though it has not been easy.
The most difficult thing now is to decide what time of day we will end up with: the current summer time or winter time, or some other time zone.
People can also have their say on this page at otakantaa.fi.
The survey was opened by the Ministry of Transport and Communications and is open until Friday 12 October.
The debate is heated at coffee tables and on social media, and everyone has their say.
Those who defend winter time justify their position by the effect of morning light on people's well-being, and those who defend summer time by the effect of evening light on people's desire to spend time outdoors and thus on well-being.
Both positions have strong supporters and good arguments.
According to studies, morning light rhythms people's day and gives them vitality.
On the other hand, if you don't particularly suffer from waking up in the dark, the light increases people's outdoor activity and provides better opportunities for yard work in the autumn, for example.
The amount of additional light after a normal working day has already been calculated to its hour.
I would prefer both, but unfortunately we can't do anything about our location in the northern part of the world.
Winters are too dark and summers too bright for many anyway.
It is typical of discussion on the subject that one's own view is promoted and another's view is strongly opposed.
The arguments of the other party are hardly listened to, because the most important thing is how you feel about it.
Since almost everyone has an opinion on the matter, it is somewhat pointless to try to turn the other person's head.
It burns gunpowder to waste.
The topic is terribly easy to argue about, because the matter does not require much dedication and a gut feeling is enough as justification.
Similar matters are usually the most fiercely debated and equally fruitless in any case.
It's unfortunate if the wrong option is chosen, but I wonder if you can adapt to it as well.
And it always offers a suitable scapegoat if life feels bleak.
Josba fought back for a narrow away win
Josba's first away game in floorball Divar produced a full three league points against Nurmon Jymy.
Josba left Seinäjoki on his way home with a joyous 6-5 (3-1, 0-3, 3-1) victory.
Nurmo still led by a goal early in the third period, but Josba looked for compositions and recycled men in chains.
In 50:47, brothers Eetu and Juuso Lehtiniemi scored the winning goal to make it 6-5.
As both teams cooled off, decisive minutes were played on an equal footing.
Josba's most effective was Juuso Lehtiniemi (2+1).
The second line was firepower anyway, as Teemu Tuhkanen (1+1), Jere Kaartinen (1+0) and Jere Kettunen (1+0) also scored.
Miika Kosone (1+0) was also playing in the second line at the time of his goal.
Josba has six points after three rounds in the league.
Next up is O2-Jyväskylä away from home in two weeks.
Uncle's Church celebrates its 200th anniversary on Sunday
The 200th anniversary of Eno's Church will be celebrated tomorrow, Sunday, partly in a very sad atmosphere.
The arson of the Church of Bigotry a week ago was a shock.
Eno's church was also guarded during the two nights after the fire.
Despite the pain, today is still a place to celebrate.
Although no one would want to, Eno Church is now the oldest church in Joensuu Parish Union.
The church on a hill in the middle of the village has always been Eno's heart, despite all the municipal and other mergers in the world.
Family Mass begins today at 10 a.m. in Eno Church.
After that, we move on to the parish hall at the Karelian banquet table.
The programme includes all kinds of activities throughout the day, both indoors and outdoors.
For example, the church building can be visited under the guidance of retired Parish Master Ari Räsänen, who has worked as a parish master for 37 years.
The feast of the birth of the Church also marks the end of an era.
The disused parish hall, built in 1982, is keeping its doors open today for the last time.
Now we are in temporary facilities at the former town hall," says Chaplain Markku Koistinen.
The parish hall was destroyed by indoor air problems, but the church has stood healthy for that 200 years.
Elon Musk steps down as Tesla chairman - Fraud charges settled for $40 million
Electric car maker Tesla and CEO Elon Musk have settled their lawsuit with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
The SEC suspected Musk of committing securities fraud, and Musk risked being sidelined from the management of the company he founded.
However, Musk is allowed to continue as CEO of Tesla.
Instead, Musk will have to step down as chairman of Tesla's board for three years.
The company will have to hire an external chairman of the board.
Musk also faces tighter scrutiny.
Under the agreement, Tesla must hire two independent directors and monitor Musk's communications more closely going forward.
In addition, Tesla and Musk will each pay $20 million (about €17 million) to settle the case.
"The decision is intended to prevent further market disruption and harm to Tesla shareholders," SEC director Steven Peikin said.
The case began in August when Musk wrote on Twitter that he might pull the company off the stock exchange.
Musk also wrote that the company's funding is secured.
The tweet momentarily boosted Tesla's share price.
The SEC suspected Musk of committing securities fraud.
The agency said the tweet was false and misleading, and Musk had not discussed the arrangement with the company's other management or potential financiers.
In effect, the agency accused Musk of misleading investors.
The SEC announced Friday that it is suing the company and Musk.
The SEC said it is demanding that Musk be fined and banned from running publicly traded companies anymore.
The SEC's challenge spooked investors, and Tesla's stock took a sharp fall.
Indonesian quake and tsunami kill more than 800 people
The death toll from Indonesia's earthquake and subsequent tsunami has risen to at least 832, the country's disaster agency said.
The death toll is expected to rise further, as the investigation into the damage is ongoing.
According to Vice President Jusuf Kalla, the final figure could reach thousands.
Friday's earthquake sparked a tsunami that hit the city of Palu on the island of Sulawesi.
A tsunami warning was issued immediately after the quake, but it was quickly withdrawn.
According to officials, almost all known deaths are from Palu, at least for the time being.
Rescue authorities are concerned, for example, about the Donggala area near the epicentre of the quake, where the situation is still largely unclear.
Already, several people are known to have died.
Requests for help from the rubble
The Indonesian army has been called in to help rescue workers search for victims.
President Joko Widodon, who arrived in the affected area today, urged the soldiers to continue the rescue work tirelessly, day and night.
One of the focal points of the rescue work is a hotel in Palu, where 50 to 60 people are believed to still be in the ruins.
Muhammad Syaugi, head of the agency leading the rescue efforts, said that one person was exhumed alive from the rubble of the Roa-Roa Hotel, popular with business travelers, during the night.
We also heard people's requests for help," he said.
According to Syaug, heavy clearance equipment is urgently needed in the quake and tsunami area.
Many Indonesians have turned to Facebook and other social media to find missing loved ones.
Please help, you in Palu and nearby.
My friend's family members are still missing," one author pleaded in a Facebook group.
Phone numbers of politicians leaked into the hands of troublemakers in Britain
Many British politicians were harassed when their contact details were leaked due to shortcomings in the app's encryption.
The troublemakers gained access to ministers' phone numbers, among other things.
It was an app used at the governing British Conservative Party congress.
For example, Michael Gove, the pro-Brexit Secretary for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson were harassed.
Several MPs received harassment calls.
Due to the lack of encryption in the app, the public was able to access the profiles of politicians on the mobile app of the Conservative Party convention.
The public could access the profiles using the politician's email address. which was readily available online.
Anyone logging in to the profile was able to view and edit the material stored in the profile.
Someone briefly managed to change Boris Johnson's profile picture to a picture and a defamatory title.
Michael Goven's profile picture was changed to that of media mogul Rupert Murdoch.
The Guardian columnist Dawn Foster described the problem by writing that the meeting app allows you to log into other people's profiles using their email addresses.
Then the logger can view the profile person's contact information and, for example, send messages in their name.
The meeting app made the phone number of every journalist, politician and attendee public, Foster criticized.
A Conservative Party spokesman apologised for the leak.
He said that the technical issues have been resolved and the app now works safely.
Britain's data authority, the ICO, supports the data breach.
The app was created by the Australian company Crown Comms.
The opposition Labour Party criticises the Conservative Party for not being trusted on security issues.
Every week, the audience of The Wall Finland quiz includes a large number of applauding Poles
Sharp-eyed viewers paid attention to the reactions of the studio audience of The Wall Suomi quiz show.
The US format The Wall, which has spread rapidly around the world, landed on Nelonen last Saturday as a Finnish version.
The game show, hosted by Heikki Paasonen, was filmed in Poland in the same studio where other international productions of the format are made.
In the Polish studio, the shooting possibilities were exceptional, as the format's large 12-meter-high gaming wall required space from the space.
During the opening episode, the show's studio audience was highlighted on social media, which was predicted to be Polish.
There was discussion on Twitter about whether the Poles who might be sitting in the studio understand anything about the game being played in Finnish.
Nelonen's Head of Finnish Programmes Unne Sormunen sheds light on the matter for Iltalehti.
He says that the studio audience includes the players' loved ones, other Finns, expatriate Finns living in Poland and just Polish viewers.
The audience consists of international applause in the Finnish production, just like the audiences of The Wall episodes filmed in the same production space in other countries.
In Finland, too, there are such groups, so-called professional audiences, who go to the filming of various programmes, Sormunen explains.
He reminds us that watching the game itself is not that difficult to understand, even if you don't understand the language in which it is played.
Red and green balls falling from the wall are easy to distinguish.
However, for foreign-language speakers, there are interpreters present in the studio who take care of the translation work.
There are two interpreters who interpret simultaneously for the studio director all the time events.
And the studio director then instructs the audience and tells them what kind of flap is being thrown there, for example, and what the situation is going on, Sormunen says.
He compares the situation to how David Hasselhoff was dealt with in domestic production in the past.
A few years ago, David Hasselhoff was involved in the filming of Talent Finland in Finland.
She had simultaneous interpretation in her ear all the time, and she knew everything that was spoken in Finnish during the filming, Sormunen sums up.
Typhoon battering southern parts of Japan moves towards main islands - authorities warn of landslides and flooding
Authorities also warn of possible landslides and flooding.
At least 50 people have been injured in the Typhoon Tram, but officials say no major injuries have been sustained and there are no casualties so far.
On the southern island of Okinawa, the wind has been so strong that it has turned cars around.
According to NHK public broadcaster, people have been evacuated to shelters and power has been cut to more than 300,000 households.
More than a thousand flights have been cancelled and high-speed trains are at a standstill in some places due to the storm.
The storm is expected to hit near Osaka around noon Finnish time.
The capital Tokyo is not directly in the path of the storm, but strong winds and rain are expected there as well.
Train services have been cancelled today in Tokyo.
According to meteorologists, Trami will torment Japan until Monday.
The sky for aces darkened even further
The Aces have had a poor start to the season.
The sky turned almost pitch black when the team lost 3-6 (0-2, 0-3, 3-1) at home to Vaasan Sport on Saturday.
The Porians now have five defeats in a row, with a total of two points from six rounds.
No Aces defender or player in the bottom two chains has scored a goal yet.
The pressure is also increasing.
Against Sport, the crowd disappeared from the hall already with almost half of the game remaining.
Six games have only just been played, and of course there is no reason to give up on this.
Of course, you have to be worried, because that's how poorly we played.
Especially the performance in the second period was embarrassingly poor, said Jarno Kärki, who scored 1+2 for the Aces.
For Sport, the victory naturally tasted.
The team had a game from Friday underneath, so you would have thought it showed in what they were doing.
Maybe it showed, but the Aces didn't know how to take advantage of it.
The number of visitors to Bread Day continued to grow
Pirkko Hyvärinen, the mother of Bread Day, marvels at the number of spectators in the grandstand of the large hall.
Somehow I thought that maybe there wouldn't be as many people this year, Hyvärinen ponders this morning.
In autumn 2017, the Finnish Tractor Threshold Championships were held at the same time as Bread Day, so perhaps the expectation would be that the number of spectators could even decrease slightly from the previous year.
However, things turned out differently; The aisles were already blocked well before ten, the sellers reported that the products had run out, almost 500 portions of news porridge were sold more than before, and Hyvärinen heard that the number of cars had also increased.
The estimated number of visitors has been about 6,000, Hyvärinen says later in the afternoon.
The five hours in the morning and afternoon included a particularly large amount of activities for families with children, which I think attracted a record number of them.
In addition, Hyvärinen estimates that people will reach the event from even further away.
Sellers also visit Liperi every year from a larger area.
This year, almost a hundred presenters, sellers of handicrafts, pastries and harvest products had arrived at the bread parish.
PIrkko Hyvärinen, the mother of Bread Day, admired the number of spectators from the auditorium.
At the beginning of the bread day, the harvest was blessed.
In the children's category, Teija Kiviniemi's beautiful bread won the public vote.
The children's bread competition received 11 loaves of bread of different shapes.
The winner of the rye bread competition, Marjatta Vepsäläinen, spent the day at the Martha Pie Workshop.
7 x Most beautiful lamp - this is how you recognize a good lamp
Bring the space to life, create the right atmosphere in your décor and read a book without tiring your eyes.
Good lighting is worth investing in.
We put together three good reasons to invest in lighting.
The tips were given by Tarja Jokiniemi, Sales and Marketing Director at Innolux.
Do your eyes a favor
The importance of lighting increases the more years you have passed.
Adequate light can help with the problems that many people face with age, as visual acuity decreases and more and more people suffer from glare.
As you get older, the need for light also increases.
A person in their sixties needs light three times more than someone in their twenties.
It is therefore worth investing in the healing effects of light and the properties of the luminaire for health reasons alone.
A good luminaire gives enough light but does not dazzle, Jokiniemi hints.
Create beauty around you
Beautiful décor can only be seen with the right lighting solutions.
The decorator of the moment can afford to choose.
The Japanese di style, which combines Scandinavian and Japanese, is popular.
On the other hand, the modern and playful retro style inspired by the 70s, with its strong colours, different shades of metal or ice cream colours, has also become a boom.
Authenticity fascinates in the same way as in the rest of a home's interior.
The materials now include wood, concrete, ceramics, paper, leather and bamboo.
Manifest your personality
On the other hand, people are investing more in the home now than before, and interior design has become a way of expressing themselves.
Instead of mass production, people want a tailor-made, even bold luminaire for their own home that has a story to tell.
People are clearly looking for Finnish and Nordic products whose origin and designer are known.
So let's be very design-conscious, Jokiniemi says.
The home does not necessarily acquire the latest trend lamp, but a timeless classic for which many years have been saved.
Certain timeless, jewellery-like and elegant classics hold their own year after year, Jokiniemi says.
Thank you and goodbye!
KooKoo showed the door to the Canadian forward after three games
KooKoo and striker Brendan O'Donnell cross paths.
The Canadian striker played a total of three League games for the Orange and Blacks without scoring, KooKoo said in a statement.
O'Donnell joined KooKoo in August on a one-year contract that included a trial period until the end of September.
Last season, the 26-year-old forward played in the KHL for Kunlund Red Star and KHL farm VHL for KRS Heilongjiang.
There is no word yet on O'Donnell's new club.
Pelimies wants to set an example in recycling – goods go out into the world in recycling boxes, plastic replaced with paper
Pelimies, a specialist in games, now recycles not only games but also packaging materials.
Brick-and-mortar customers' products are no longer packaged in plastic bags, but in paper bags made of recycled material.
Products ordered from the online store are packaged, for example, in packages from importers.
All packages that come to us are reused.
We may use the boxes a dozen times, as long as the package is in such a condition that it can be used, says Ville Puurula from Oulun Pelimies.
As a cushioning material, the company mainly uses newspapers and other similar recycled material.
Bubble wrap is avoided as far as possible.
In the near future, we intend to switch to recycled material even in envelopes.
The movement wants to set an example for others.
According to Puurula, recycling is not a cause of extra trouble.
It's not a big problem to start recycling.
There will also be financial savings when, for example, cardboard packaging is reused.
Recycling is a natural fit for Pelimies' operations, as in addition to new products, the store's key product range includes, for example, used games and equipment.
Getting every fashion-conscious person: One shirt works for every outfit
Classic clothes work season after season in any outfit.
With their versatility, they create the basis for a good garderob, as it is easy to assemble different outfits around high-quality classics, even at an affordable price.
In autumn, the most used classics in the wardrobe are high-quality knitwear.
This category also includes black polo.
A black sweater made of natural material with polo collars cannot be a mistake.
The garment can be combined with straight trousers, tulle skirts and jeans, and you can create both a discreet outfit and a flashy style around it.
The polo knit is suitable for both the youthful modern dresser and the classically sophisticated stylist.
Here's how to create a style.
The autumn trend look comes from golden brown and wide-legged corduroy trousers, a black polo knit and grey ankle boots.
The classic polo sweater in combination with other classics, the blue-green scotch checkered skirt and burgundy loafers, form a feminine and sophisticated outfit.
Add an edge to your black polo knit by pairing it with casual trendy garments: a denim skirt, high boots and thick tights.
Youthful and stylish!
There is a long tradition of sabotage by Russian intelligence services
There is no reason to suppose that the Russian Federation's Foreign Intelligence SVR or Military Intelligence GRU have abandoned this course of action.
In Soviet times, so-called DRG groups specialized in sabotage activities.
The name comes from the Russian words diversionno-razvedyvatelnaya gruppa: sabotage and reconnaissance group.
Western agents of the KGB, the Soviet security service, prepared detailed plans for important sabotage targets, says Vasily Mitrohin (1922-2004), an archivist who defected to the West.
His information was published in Christopher Andrew's books in the late 1990s and early 2000s
The targets included ports, shipyards, large dams, oil refineries and gas pipeline connections.
In Germany, the KGB provided DRG groups with uniforms and apparel for the Bundeswehr, railways, game wardens and road workers for covert operations.
This trick was used by Russian paratroopers in Crimea in February 2014: they donned local Ukrainian police riot gear, set up checkpoints on roads leading from the peninsula to Ukraine, and isolated Crimea from its mother country.
During the Cold War, agents hid supply packages containing mines, explosives, detonators and communications equipment in the terrain for sabotage groups.
As late as 1998, a KGB cache was found in Switzerland whose trap mine exploded when authorities sprayed it with a water cannon.
Police caught four drunk drivers in the province during the night
The police caught four drunk drivers in different parts of North Karelia during the night between Friday and Saturday.
In Joensuu, an 18-year-old man from Kontiolahti blew 1.57 per mil.
He drove at half past four at night at the beginning of Kajaanintie with two passengers on board.
On Kuorevaarantie in Polvijärvi, a car swerved into a ditch at four o'clock at night, and a 19-year-old local man alone in the car blew 1.54 per mil, according to the police.
He did not suffer any serious injuries in the ejection.
A 20-year-old man from outside the city who was driving a passenger car in the centre of Outokumpu blew 1.33 per mil into the breathalyzer.

HPK will keep Riska in their ranks for the rest of the season, Lehtinen's trial period ended
Mika Toivola, Sports Director of HPK in Hämeenlinna, says that Filip Riska (centre) has been important for the team in starts, shorthanded play and the defensive role of the fourth.
Filip Riska, who played during the trial period in early autumn, will continue at HPK in Hämeenlinna for the rest of the season.
The success of the experienced Riska, 33, in the roles offered to him convinced the club management.
Filip has been an important piece for us in terms of starts, shorthanded play and defensive role in the fours.
Although there is still room for improvement, it is good for a young team to hold on to such an experienced player, HPK's sports director Mika Toivola comments in the club's press release.
According to Toivola, Riska's value increases when the Ice Hockey League decider games are played.
Centre forward Riska from Pietarsaari has previously played league hockey for JYP, Lukko and Sport.
Winger Oskari Lehtinen, on the other hand, was left without a contract after a trial period.
True story on TV today: Climber left to die twice
The American Beck Weathers wrote a book 18 years ago.
Left for Dead: My Journey Home From Everest is based on his own experiences.
Tonight's film is made based on them.
Everest is now premiering on Finnish TV.
In May 1996, a devastating snowstorm surprised climbers on Mount Everest.
Baltasar Kormákur's 2015 directorial film tells the story of a struggle for survival that has been dealt with extensively.
There have been films - and documentaries - about the tragedy before.
Real events are also discussed in this story.
The highest mountain in the world took the lives of eight climbers 22 years ago.
Two of them were experienced leaders of expeditions: Scott Fischer and Rob Hall.
It was Hall who served as Weathers' guide.
Weathers' life may have been saved by eye surgery performed before leaving for Nepal.
As a result of that, and atmospheric pressure, he lost his eyesight, which is why the conquest of the peak had to be skipped.
Rob Hall kept going and never returned.
However, Weathers' life-and-death struggle had only just begun.
As the storm rose, he got lost and could no longer find his way back to camp.
When the man was searched, he was found in such poor condition that there was no belief in survival.
Weathers was left to die.
Miraculously, however, he was able to get back on his feet and find the others.
The badly frostbitten Weathers was thought to still be dying, and once again he was left to his fate.
What is clear is that, contrary to expectations to the contrary, Beck Weathers survived.
At some point, even his fellow climbers began to believe in the possibility enough to be given help.
In the film, Beck Weathers is portrayed by Josh Brolin.
Rob Hall as Jason Clarke and Scott Fischer as Jake Gyllenhaal.
Other cast members include Robin Wright, Keira Knightley and Emily Watson.
Today the 200th anniversary of Eno's Church has been celebrated
Eno's 200-year-old church has been celebrated today on the church hill.
The church was inaugurated on October 4, 1818, and a family celebration was prepared for Sunday to celebrate the anniversary.
The celebrations began at 10 a.m. with a family mass on Eno Church Hill, after which Karelian banquets have been served at Eno's parish hall.
The church was full.
The Family Mass was attended by 517 people.
Armi Rautavuori, the vicar of Eno, was happy that so many people had come to the church.
It will be a great joy for a long time to come and will give strength to the work, says Rautavuori (pictured).
The fire at Kiihtelysvaara Church has touched many, and it was not ignored at the 200th anniversary celebration of Eno Parish.
Eno Church is now the oldest church in Joensuu Evangelical Lutheran parishes after Kiihtelysvaara Church was destroyed by fire.
The wooden church of Kiihtelysvaara was completed in 1770.
In the morning, a devotional was held in Kiihtelysvaara to silence and remember the church destroyed in the fire.
Photos and videos: Medican flashes its might in Greece - The sea disappeared and the street turned into a river
A strong hurricane-type autumn storm rolled into Greece from the southwest on Saturday.
The Mediterranean hurricane, or medicane, has been named Zorba.
The Greek Meteorological Agency has issued a red weather warning for the regions of Attica, the Peloponnese, the Ionian Islands, the Cyclades and Crete.
Pictures taken from the area show high levels of flooding across Greece.
A video posted on Twitter shows how a river has suddenly appeared between houses in the town of Kiato in the Korinthia region instead of a street due to flooding.
Another video shows the car being carried by floodwaters.
In the southern part of the Peloponnese peninsula, strong winds caused strong seafaring.
The Embassy of Finland in Athens advises people on its Facebook page to prepare for the storm in Greece.
The Embassy advises you to follow weather reports and instructions from local authorities.
A Mediterranean hurricane, or medicane, brings with it heavy rainfall and even the risk of flooding.
According to a 2011 study, medicans occur only once or twice a year worldwide, typically around September or October when sea temperatures are still high.
The storm now blowing left flooding in its wake in Tunisia and Libya before continuing its journey north and towards Europe.
There has also been concern in Greece about refugee camps on islands such as Lesvos.
For the thousands of Syrian and Iraqi refugees living in the camps, access to proper shelter is limited.
Areas around Athens destroyed by wildfires will also be affected by the storm in the summer.
A medicane also went on a rampage in Greece last November.
Don't go to sea now, flights still on schedule - thousands of Finns are currently vacationing on the Greek islands threatened by the autumn storm
Trips to the sea are cancelled and even when walking, you should be careful not to let branches or other bulk materials fly on you in the storm.
These are the guidelines that the guides have distributed to more than 3,500 Finns vacationing in Greece through Aurinkomatkat during the weekend.
The guidance comes in handy, as even Storm Zorbas is forecast to batter the Greek islands this weekend.
For example, near the island of Crete, wind speeds can reach up to 45 meters per second in gusts.
Heavy rains add to the misery of the weather.
According to the tour operators, all those who have travelled to Greece from Finland via Aurinkomatkat and Tui and have provided their phone number have been warned of strong winds by text message.
Still sun and warmth in the air
According to Inka Ikonen, communications specialist at Aurinkomatkat, by early evening on Saturday, the holiday destinations had avoided the worst.
For example, flights have landed and taken off according to the normal schedule.
Of course, we are monitoring the situation all the time.
Safety first goes.
Antonia Schroderus, media officer at Tui, says that their flights have also run on schedule.
We are in constant contact with our staff on site.
At least it was still calm in Crete, he said in the early evening on Saturday.
The most popular Greek islands, Rhodes and Crete, currently have a total of more than 1,500 Finnish passengers.
In addition, a few hundred passengers spend their holidays in smaller destinations.
For example, the worst storm on the island of Kos is likely to reach on Sunday morning.
On the other hand, on Saturday afternoon the sun had also glimpsed in Rhodes and the temperature climbed to 27 degrees, says Ikonen of Aurinkomatkat.
Zorbas is expected to become Turkey's next nuisance, albeit with a slight relaxation.
In case of this, we have already been in contact with Turkey and our staff there, and checked, for example, the number of Finns who flew to Antalya with Tui," Schroderus says.
Shirly Karvinen and Janni Huss wear identical evening dresses in the miss final - here's how they reacted to the situation
Media personality and fitness beauty Janni Hussi arrived at the Miss Finland final on Saturday in an open-backed evening dress.
Hussi says she got the dress from Meslew.
I went to the store and decided to trust the professionals, who found me an absolutely amazing suit for tonight, Hussi smiles.
The exact same silver evening dress was also chosen by presenter Shirly Karvinen.
The two also noticed their similar outfits themselves and reacted to the situation with laughter.
Karvinen told Ilta-Sanomat that he was in a hurry to prepare, and he had to put himself on the plane.
Hussi will be the backstage and red carpet host of the Miss final, and he will chat with the leading stars who will be there.
Hussi has recently moved, as he moved from Kamppi to Jätkäsaari on Friday
I'm going to stay there for now, let's see what happens.
It is essential that the new apartment has its own office, Hussi pondered.
Before moving, Hussi vacationed alone in Greece.
It was lovely, I was only in the hotel for a week without leaving anywhere.
When the stress was released, I caught the flu, but otherwise the holiday was really successful, Hussi says.
Shirly Karvinen's behaviour on the plane attracted a lot of attention - gathered the curious glances of pensioners
Presenter and Miss Finland 2016 Shirly Karvinen said on the red carpet of the Miss Finland final that she had plenty to do with radio hosts and filming Love Island Finland.
There has been so much hurry that Karvinen arrived at the final directly from a Finnair flight.
I put on my makeup and put my hair on the machine.
This is the glamour.
Changing evening dresses at home, Karvinen laughs.
Karvinen says she pulled out her makeup in the middle of pensioners.
His preparation also attracted the attention of fellow passengers.
I had a big mirror and I could see people's eyes in the mirror.
My makeup was amusing at least to others.
Karvinen flies to Spain once a week.
In Marbella, he spends about a few days at a time.
Karvinen says he has enjoyed his job as the host of Love Island Finland.
She describes her experience as having been arresting so far.
Karvinen says that he went to say hello to the singles on the show on Friday.
It's really raw in some ways.
They are people's genuine feelings, Karvinen describes the feelings of the singles in the programme.
How do I wear over-the-knee boots?
Three perfect example outfits
Classic clothes are garments that work season after season in any outfit.
Often the classics are decades old, but sometimes there is room for more modern specimens.
The over-knee boots that became the hit shoes of the autumn and winter seasons a few years ago have not gone away.
As the name suggests, boots that reach over the knee repeat themselves in style year after year and season after season.
Spectacular boots divide the opinions of users, but a bold model is worth trying, well - boldly.
After all, over-knee boots are suitable for almost any outfit.
Whether it's denim, lace, tulle or jersey, the simple leather or faux leather surface of the boots will work.
Long boots look great in both festive looks and casual outfits.
Black over-knee boots go well even with gentle outfits.
They balance the femininity of a pink, floral plier skirt and a gentle, plush sweater.
A fresh but autumnally stylish everyday outfit for romantic tastes.
A strong and slightly retro outfit is created by a long copper-brown velvet dress, over-knee boots, eye-catching earrings and a rivet bag.
Although over-knee boots have a certain sophistication, they are also perfect for casual casual attire in combination with a t-shirt, long shorts and a trendy cap.
Wonderfully easy and yet so stylish!
Two robotic cars start operating in Espoo
They will operate for the rest of the year and take passengers on board, the City of Espoo informs.
The robot cars in Otaniemi play the role of a bus simulator, as the intention is to start traffic in the area next spring with a robot bus.
The project develops and pilots year-round robotic vehicle traffic and tests the technical functionality of vehicles in Finnish conditions.
The experiment will show how robotic cars fare on the current street network.
At the same time, the city offers robot bus developers the opportunity to develop technology in a real environment," says Johanna Nyberg, Traffic Management Manager.
For the first time, robotic cars will travel fully automatically among other traffic without any special traffic arrangements.
The safety of the vehicles is always the responsibility of the co-passenger sitting on board.
Vehicles constantly sense their surroundings with several sensors and assess whether the roadway is free.
If it is not, they interpret whether the detected obstacle is a vehicle, bicycle or, for example, a snowflake," says Harri Santamala, CEO of Sensible 4, which is responsible for developing robotic traffic.
Robotic cars will run three days a week throughout the autumn: on Tuesdays from 1 pm to 3.30 pm, on Wednesdays from 10 am to 3 pm and on Thursdays from 10 am to 3 pm.
Robotic cars stop at six stops along the route and pick up passengers.
Robot car stops can be identified by stop markings.
The safest way to get on board is from stop number 1 in Otakaari.
The bass player of the band Mokoma fell off stage in the middle of the gig and was injured
The band Mokoma informs on their Facebook page about the surprising situation at the Pakkahuone gig in Tampere.
Mokoma's gig at Pakkahuone in Tampere took a dramatic turn on Saturday when the band's bassist Santtu Hämäläinen dropped off stage in the middle of the performance.
The incident happened when the band was pulling the last song of the evening.
Hämäläinen's wrist was broken.
The band will announce this on their Facebook page.
"Let's be alive!"
Santtu stumbled off stage yesterday at Pakkahuone in the last song and broke his wrist.
Let's wish you a speedy recovery to the metal brother!
The rest of the gigs on the tour will be handled by reserve staff, the website reads.
Mokoma's fans respond with concern to a photo update showing bassist Santtu lying on a bed with a plaster cast in his hand.
This news has been awaited, there was quite a lot of worry about how bad it turned out.
The relief is great, the bones fortunately heal over time.
Cheers and a speedy recovery to Santu and a happy continuation of the tour to the rest of the band plus the substitute!
And thank you for yesterday, it was a great gig, but do you promise to leave out such strong drama about the end of gigs in the future? writes one fan.
Police supervised hunting in North Karelia and Savo
The Eastern Finland Police Department carried out hunting control on Friday and Saturday together with Metsähallitus and the Finnish Wildlife Agency in North Karelia and Ylä-Savo, the police department's wilderness contact persons said on social media on Saturday.
The main focus of the monitoring was on the legality and legality of hunting.
Each hunter was checked for a hunting license and the hunting license required on state-owned land.
In addition, permits for the possession of hunting weapons and the permitted number of cartridges for self-loading weapons used in fowling were inspected.
According to the police, 112 hunters were inspected during the surveillance, and only one hunter was found who lacked the required hunting license.
The hunter was fined 12 days for unauthorised hunting.
In addition, police blew up 133 vehicle drivers, two of them suspected of drunk driving.
In addition, the patrols processed five traffic infractions in a fine procedure, the police said.
In conclusion, hunters comply very well with the legality of hunting.
Many hunters were surprised by the surveillance.
One hunter said, "I've been hunting in the area for 50 years and this was the first time someone has checked the permits."
The Eastern Finland Police Department will continue hunting supervision in the autumn together with other enforcement authorities.
Mykkänen goes to Turkey to follow the selection of Syrian quota refugees
Minister of the Interior Kai Mykkänen will travel to Turkey in the coming days to monitor the selection of quota refugees coming to Finland.
A decision has been made to admit 530 Syrian refugees from refugee camps in Turkey to Finland this year.
Selection trips are usually made a couple of times a year, with representatives from the Finnish Immigration Service, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment and the police.
A delegation is already in Turkey conducting interviews.
The UN refugee agency UNHCR first selects particularly vulnerable people as candidates.
In practice, this has meant people who are considered to be particularly vulnerable in refugee camps, such as single-parent families, disabled and sick people, women and children.
More people are selected for the group coming to Finland than is included in the quota, because in practice some do not arrive for various reasons.
During his visit, Mykkänen will also meet Turkish Minister of the Interior Süleyman Soylu and NGOs operating on the Syrian border.
Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of the Interior Ilkka Salmi will also be on the trip.
Quota increase discussed
Finland has accepted quota refugees since the 1970s.
In recent years, the quota has been 750 refugees per year.
For a couple of years, the quota was 1,050 per year, but since then the government has not reached an agreement on raising it.
The Conservative Party has supported an increase in the quota, but the project has most recently failed due to resistance from the Blues.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre Party) recently proposed gradually increasing the quota to 1,500–2,000 people per year.
Mykkänen's visit is the first during this government term that the Minister of the Interior will make on site to monitor the selection of quota refugees.
The previous Interior Ministers Petteri Orpo (Coalition Party) and Paula Risikko (Coalition Party) had time to move on to their new duties before the visits could be arranged.
Finland receives EUR 10,000 in support from the EU for each particularly vulnerable refugee.
Now let's go wrong - you no longer know whether to cry or laugh
Last Saturday, Karjalainen reported on a bill to amend the Animal Welfare Act.
The article gave the impression that the bill prohibits, in principle, the keeping of all animals that have not been specifically permitted by ministerial decrees as production animals, pets or otherwise related to business activities.
In other words, everything else is prohibited in principle, except for the animals specifically mentioned in the regulation.
If the bill ends up as law, it will probably mean that we are abandoning the general principle in Western democracies that the law specifically prohibits activities that endanger the security of society or good practice.
As a rule, legislation is now being enacted prohibiting all activities that are not specifically authorised by law or decree.
The change means that nothing new can be tried in business, for example, or anything else can be done until the law or decree approving it has been passed.
The Government's performance in legislative drafting in general has been weak.
If we now start on the path that, in principle, everything is forbidden in Finland, which is not specifically allowed, we no longer know whether to cry or laugh.
I have no doubt that the Animal Welfare Act needs updating.
But a legislative project along these lines has no place in democracy.
Unfortunately, I am not very familiar with the Constitution, but I wonder whether it will accept this 'everything is forbidden, which is not expressly permitted by law or regulation' procedure.
Hopefully, there will be some sensible minister who will halt the progress of such a legislative project.
Metti Forssell tips: The four trendiest skirts of autumn
This autumn's trendy garment comes in a snake pattern.
It looks especially good precisely on skirts.
Pair a snake-print skirt with more subdued tops, such as a polo or a plain t-shirt, to keep the outfit stylish.

Baby Alexia, 3 months, growls sweetly in Jere's arms
In the Karalahti family photo, the focus is on the adorable three-month-old baby Alexia.
Nanna Karalahti tells about the Aito daycare centre established in Kerava.

Turkey urges people to charge mobile phones in case of storm
Storm Zorba, which blew through Greece on Saturday, is expected to move into Turkey on Sunday.
Meteorologists on Saturday warned sailors, fishermen and farmers on the west coast of the country in particular about the storm in Greece, according to CNN Türk.
The tropical storm is reported to move along the coast from south to north during the day.
In the early evening on Saturday, disaster and emergency officials urged citizens to charge their mobile phones before the storm and ensure internet access is working so people can get up-to-date updates on the situation, according to local news agency Anadolu Ajansi.
People have been advised to stay at home and away from windows, and to move garden furniture, for example, out of the way of the wind.
Heavy rain is expected in Turkey and winds are expected to blow 28-33 meters per second.
Red weather warning for Greece
On Saturday, the Greek Meteorological Service issued a red weather warning for southern Greece for the regions of Attica, the Peloponnese, the Ionian Islands, the Cyclades and Crete.
The Ministry for Foreign Affairs and travel agencies organising trips to Greece warned Finns in Greece about storm Zorba.
The Embassy of Finland in Athens also issued a storm warning.
Travellers were advised to follow weather reports and instructions from local authorities.
Not long ago, when I made contact, there was a lot of wind and rain.
People were quite calm," Laura Aaltonen, Communications Manager at Tui Travel Agency, told STT on Saturday.
Aaltonen described the situation as similar on Saturday evening.
By evening, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs had also received no messages about Finns in distress.
In several ports in Greece, ships did not operate on Saturday, local news agency Amna reported.
Boat trips to the sea were cancelled on Saturday, travel agencies told STT.
According to the Finnish Embassy in Athens, temporary disruptions to air and ship traffic were expected.
Finnair announced on Saturday that the weather situation is being actively monitored.
Kimi Raikkonen summed up the reason for Mercedes' superiority over Ferrari
Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen had to admit that his biggest rival, Mercedes, was too tough a piece in qualifying for the Russian Grand Prix.
However, there is no reason to panic in the Ferrari camp, the experienced driver reckons.
They were just faster than us, but it's not a huge thing.
Our car was the best in qualifying all weekend so far, but they were just too fast," said Raikkonen, who finished fourth and clearly missed the pace of Mercedes with team-mate Sebastian Vettel.
Ferrari already had a hard time at the last race in Singapore.
Räikkönen was asked what caused the sudden fall from Mercedes.
They seem to be going faster than us – it's as simple as that.
If I knew the reason for that, we would probably go at the same pace as them.
However, I know no more than anyone else.
This is always guesswork, and they seem to be ahead of us now.
Who knows why?
Qualifying was a rare treat for Raikkonen's future team, Sauber.
Charles Leclerc, who will replace Raikkonen with Ferrari next season, was seventh, and Marcus Ericsson also qualified for the final qualifying session.
For the Swedish driver, tenth place is the best in more than three years.
And even though no fewer than five drivers did not drive at all in the second session, the end result was still tasty for Sauber.
And perhaps encouraging for Räikkönen for the future?
Yes, if you compare to where they were in the early part of the season, it's been a big step forward.
There's a different story next year, so we'll see, we'll see.
That was it - Robert Helenius knocked out Erkan Teper: "Robbe is back"
The match between Robert Helenius and Erkan Teper on the evening in Stuttgart progressed evenly.
The German was the more proactive side in the ring, but he didn't get any real hits.
Helenius, who is clearly more outreached, controlled the match with his tough sets, which found their way well.
The Finn was also clearly in better physical shape than Teper.
The decision finally came in the eighth round, when Helenius knocked out Teper on his left straight.
The hit was so hard that the veteran, who was fighting in front of a home crowd, didn't even try to get up from the mat.
After the victory was secured, Helenius vented quite moderately.
In the in-ring interview, he initially praised the good mood created by the audience and his opponent.
Then he briefly changed his language to Finnish.
Thank you to all the spectators and Finnish supporters.
We took the belt with us today.
Helenius rejoiced immediately after the match.
It was a really big win for Helenius' career.
There might even be a chance to make it to a World Cup match," Helenius told Iltalehti before the match.
The defeat, on the other hand, might have ended his entire boxing career.
Of course it has crossed my mind.
You don't get any younger here," the 34-year-old Helenius admitted before the Teper encounter.
The number of victims of the disaster in Indonesia could multiply
According to The Guardian, the country's vice-president is urging people to prepare for a clear increase in the number of victims.
According to the country's vice president, Jusuf Kalla, the total number of victims could reach thousands.
Difficult conditions
Rescuers are searching for the trapped as well as the dead in the hardest-hit areas of Sulawesi Island: the port city of Palu and the neighbouring municipality of Donggala.
So far, all the victims are from Palu, the situation in Donggala is not yet clear.
Hundreds of people are missing and about 540 have been badly injured.
There are still people in the collapsed buildings who rescuers have been unable to get out.
For example, a hotel called Roa Roa in Palu has collapsed.
Rescuers say they heard the screams of people trapped in the rubble, but a lack of clearance equipment has delayed the start of rescue work.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo has ordered the army to rescue and clear.
There is a need for the army and its equipment, as electricity and telecommunications connections are cut in many places in the disaster area.
Fuel reserves are also running out.
The hesitant response and long reflection of the Miss Finland finalist caused laughter
Billnäs Village is currently electing a new Miss Finland.
In the interview round, each Miss finalist was asked a question.
The finalists pulled the question from a glass bowl on stage.
Especially the hesitant response of finalist number six Emilia Anttikoski, 23, elicited sweet but good-natured laughter in the audience present.
The question put to Anttikoski had come via Facebook.
User Pirkko-Ella wanted to know what is the latest book the Miss finalist has read.
Anttikoski thought about his answer for a while before hesitating.
Thank you for the question, Pirkko-Ella.
The last book I've read is..., Anttikoski said thoughtfully.
The pause for reflection caused laughter in the audience, until Anttikoski continued his answer:
The last book I've read is...
I've read books at school!
Probably something related to economics.
So the last book I've read is economics someone," Anttikoski replied.
After his answer, Anttikoski received a resounding applause from the audience, accompanied by laughter.
Earlier on the miss tour, Anttikoski attracted attention because he did not want to pose in lingerie because of his principle.
Miss Finland 2018 will be crowned at 21.00 when last year's Miss Finland Michaela Söderholm relinquishes the crown.
Sike's apple and pear cake will take your tongue away
This recipe is for those of you who have good, sour apples on your own, as Finnish apples are shockingly priced in stores.
You may need to buy a pear, although I think quite a few people already have a pear tree.
This cake can also be made only from apples if you don't want to buy a pear.
Of course, the taste is more varied if you also invest in the pear in the cake.
Peel the apples and pear and remove the cores.
Sliced.
Melt the butter in a saucepan.
Beat eggs and sugar until frothy, then add cornmeal and melted butter to the foam.
Combine cornstarch (maizena) and baking powder and add them to the dough as well.
Add almond flour and wheat flour, mix well.
Line a bread pan with parchment paper, sprinkle 2 tablespoons of sugar on the bottom of the pan and spread pear slices over the sugar.
Spoon half of the dough over the pear slices and the apple slices over the dough.
Spoon the rest of the dough over the apple slices.
Cook in the oven at 180 degrees for about an hour until the surface is beautifully browned.
Let cool in the pan, then set aside on a serving dish.
Cut the cake only after it has cooled down properly.
The cake is fragile in texture and crumbles easily due to the presence of almond and corn flour without gluten in the dough.
Ruka hosts an international crime literature event in January
In January, Ruka in Kuusamo will host for the first time an international literature festival focusing on Nordic crime literature.
The programme of Nordic Noir consists of interviews, panel discussions and other literature-related programme numbers as well as jazz music.

In addition to Swedish names, the event will also feature guest writers from Iceland, Norway and Finland.
Finnish writers will be represented at the event by Max Seeck.
According to the festival organizers, the northern location, nature, the dark season and the unique environment of Kuusamo provide a setting for a unique literary experience.
Status symbols don't attract friends - Four facts about popularity
What makes a person popular, charismatic or admired?
Researchers at the University of Sydney who have analysed the matter have outlined two types of "coolness" consisting of slightly different traits: the generally attractive coolness and the partly opposite dissident coolness.
Attractively cool people, according to the researchers' description, had many traits considered socially desirable: they were outgoing, friendly, amiable, and competent.
Dissidents, on the other hand, were characterized by distance, independence, rebellion and edge.
They were hungry for experience and paid little attention to outside judgments.
Both types shared good self-esteem and a stable emotional life.
The role of Kovis is not cool in the long run: a high status in adolescence does not necessarily lead to success later in life.
This is according to a US study published in the journal Child Development in 2014.
Young people who socialized early, partyed, sought out good-looking groups, and sought favor with others had an increased risk of substance abuse and crime as young adults.
In their relationships, they fared worse than their once more inconspicuous peers.
Luxury cars, designer bags or watches that communicate high status do not make a person cool - or at least not genuinely attractive company.
In a study published in the journal Social Psychological and Personality Science in August, the majority of people were more willing to make friends with people wearing a regular supermarket shirt than a branded shirt – despite the fact that most chose to wear a branded shirt when they got acquainted.
If you are on the Greek holiday islands, watch out!
Hurricane is about to hit it - weather warning screams red
Over the weekend, the amount of rain in southern Greece may be as high as in Finland on average for six months.
Hurricane Zorbas will hit Greece over the weekend.
Be prepared if you are staying in the Peloponnese, Ionian Islands, Cyclades or Crete.
The storm is very strong, so the Embassy of Finland in Athens announces it on its Facebook page.
According to the Embassy, the Greek Meteorological Service has issued a red weather warning for the regions.
The approaching storm is also reported on the blog of the weather service Foreca.
According to the report, the strongest gusts of the storm are up to 45 meters per second.
For comparison, storm Kuisma, which battered Finland at the beginning of the week, blew at its highest at just over 31 metres per second.
However, according to the blog, the biggest concern for Storm Zorbas is not wind, but heavy rainfall.
Over the weekend, more than 300 millimetres of water may come in southern Greece.
This corresponds to about half of Finland's annual precipitation.
The weather service Severe Weather Europa has shared a video of the storm's development on its Facebook page.
Storm Zorbas caused flooding in Tunisia and Libya earlier this week.
Do you recognise the men-drooling Love Island Finland Anku?
Appear in confusing Youtube videos
Few people know that in Love Island Finland, beauty Anku, who has been drooling over several men, also appears in strange Youtube videos released in 2010 as a craft aunt.
In the videos, Anku advises craftsmen, among other things, to make an octopus from an old roll of kitchen towels.
Anku also shows in his sympathetic style how tights can be turned into a hedgehog with real spines.
Now let's make Easter grasses grow, but let's do it in a somewhat surprising way, Anku hints, showing off sawdust, tights and rye grass seeds, which he makes a hedgehog out of.
You can watch the videos below or on Anku's Youtube channel here.
Valtteri Bottas was shaking and bursting with adrenaline in Sochi - will he be Hamilton's helper on Sunday?
Valtteri Bottas was still shaking a little for tens of minutes after his pole position at the Russian Grand Prix when he was in front of the media.
The fine lap left Mercedes' number one star Lewis Hamilton behind him and was certainly mentally important for the Finnish driver, who has also received criticism this season.
Nice tour.
I don't know what happened to Lewis when he dropped out of the deciding round.
It feels good, I'm still shaking a little bit," Bottas explained.
I've only been on pole once this year, in Austria (mid-summer), so it's been quite a while.
This track has been good for me in the past and I got some good laps again.
It is not easy to overtake on the Sochi circuit, so the start plays a particularly big role.
And of course, Bottas was left to answer the question of whether he will ride for victory tomorrow or whether he will be chasing Hamilton, who is approaching the World Championship title.
My starting point for the race is definitely that I try to win.
There can be no other goal when starting from the pole, Bottas piled.
But as a team, we are fighting for both titles.
Lewis' lead over Sebastian Vettel is pretty big and the gap to me is very big, so you have to keep that in mind.
We'll see what happens," Bottas added.
Hamilton was genuinely happy with Bottas' success after the race, and Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff also tasted what he saw.
Lewis was going to beat Valtteri, but he failed in the sevens.
Valtteri knows he has to tear everything out of himself to beat Lewis.
And he was so charged that adrenaline gushed out of his ears.
When asked if the team will allow Bottas and Hamilton to drive fairly, Wolff replied evasively.
We'll have a conversation tomorrow morning and we'll see how the race goes.
Erno Kinnunen from Kiteläinen won the Finnish Rally Championship
The Finnish Rally Car Championship ended rarely.
Hardly ever before have the brothers become Finnish champions at the same time.
Now it was done in the final rally around Turku and Salo by Eerik and Henrik Pietarinen from Tuusula, as Eerik won the SM1 class and Henrik won the SM2 class.
Erno Kinnunen from Kiteläinen secured the best achievement of his career when third place in the final race sealed the Finnish championship in the SM4 class of two-wheel drive cars.
Kinnunen, who competes in a Honda Civic, and co-driver Ville Mäkelä started the Turku race with composure, because the starting points were clear: a place in the top group would guarantee the Finnish Championship title.
In the darkness of Friday night, the duo had to give an equaliser when some of the extra lights failed on the second stage.
I was able to sift through the third segment quite blindly.
In such a situation, it is not appropriate to be foolish.
On Saturday, we only followed the pace of Jussi Tepo, who was second in the series, Kinnunen said.
Syria demands withdrawal of US forces, France and Turkey
Syria's foreign minister calls on the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops from Syria.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly on Saturday, Foreign Minister Walid Muallem said foreign troops must leave Syria immediately and unconditionally.
Muallem said foreign troops are in Syria fighting terrorism, and the war against terrorists is "almost over," he said.
In his UN speech, Muallem also appealed to Syrian refugees to return to their homeland.
However, there is no end in sight to the seven-year war.
More than 360 000 people have died in the war.
Chancellor Angela Merkel said Friday in Germany that a meeting on Syria was planned for October, which would be attended by the presidents of France, Russia and Turkey.
Not exactly the Super Bowl, but tens of millions of Americans watched the Supreme Court justice drama on TV
Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who is running for the Supreme Court, and Professor Christine Blasey Ford, who accuses him of harassment, brought an extraordinary number of people to the screens.
In the United States, the drama of appointing a Supreme Court justice in full swing drew at least 20 million people to their televisions on Thursday.
At the time, Kavanaugh, who was appointed by Donald Trump, and Blasey Ford, a California professor accusing him of harassment, were before the Senate Judiciary Committee to tell their stories.
According to preliminary results, the hearings were watched by a total of 20.4 million viewers on the six main channels: ABC, CBS, CNN, FOX News, MSNBC and NBC.
In addition to them, several million more followed, the online consultation followed.
NBC reported that the livestream was watched by 6.8 million people, and CNN reported that it had set a record for the year with 8.2 million live broadcast launches.
CNN's figure rises to more than 10 million, including those who followed the broadcast via YouTube and Facebook.
Fox News Digital also reached 8.0 million startups.
Digital startups are channel-owned, TV viewership figures come from research and data analysis company Nielsen.
Nielsen will release the final figures on Monday, but they are nonetheless staggering.
Few reach 20 million
In the United States, viewership of more than 20 million is usually limited to sports matches and the major Oscars and Grammys in entertainment, as well as occasional political events such as presidential speeches and, in 2016, presidential debates.
Of course, the American Football League's NFL final game, the Super Bowl, is a long way off.
This year, the Super Bowl drew about 103 million people to NBC.
Last year, Trump's first address to Congress was watched by nearly 48 million people and the inauguration by more than 30 million people, according to Nielsen.
A very important point
The appointment of a Supreme Court judge is an extremely significant case in the United States, as the offices are for life.
Trump was already able to nominate one new judge when Antonin Scalia passed away in early 2016 and Republicans managed to prevent then-President Barack Obama from appointing a successor to him.
Another seat opened up when Justice Anthony Kennedy, 81, announced his retirement this year.
Kennedy was appointed by Republican President Ronald Reagan, but on several issues he was a so-called tongue-in-law, whose vote could decide the nine-member court's position.
She was a supporter of abortion rights and LGBT rights, and in 2015, for example, she voted to give same-sex couples the right to marry federally.
Kavanaugh is considerably more conservative in his positions.
His election to the Supreme Court could lock the court's conservative supremacy for decades.
Children have the right to have their parents informed
Only parents of children under the age of 10 can see their children's health information in the Kanta service.
It's a big problem, it's wrong and it's weird.
Initially, the situation in the Kanta service was, of course, even more worrying: parents were not even able to view the health information or prescriptions of their little ones.
The situation was corrected as temporary in autumn 2016 for children under the age of 10.
Since then, promises have been made to correct practices, but it has taken an astonishingly long time to fix them.
Now the repair is in store - in 2020.
Since the problem is clear, changing the legal basis should have been nothing more than a walk-through.
After that, in layman's understanding, it is a matter of pressing a button: now that the cable is closed, it is opened.
Of course, children can show their information to their parents - if they have bank codes or an official ID card.
But how many 10-year-olds have?
An ID card is subject to a fee, and a 10-year-old cannot even get online banking credentials.
In practice, no one can see the information of a fourth-grader in primary school except by asking for it to be printed.
It is not so much a question of parents' rights as of children's rights.
It is extremely important for the care of a child that parents can be involved.
The right of teenagers to privacy must, of course, be safeguarded.
Even minors may have family situations where not all matters can be freely discussed.
Often they are related to sexual health, for which free care is a deeply meaningful human right.
In the United States, the FBI began gutting harassment allegations against Kavanaugh
According to US media, the FBI is investigating harassment allegations made by at least two women.
One of the women appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this week.
Kavanaugh has denied allegations of alleged sexual harassment during his college days.
U.S. President Donald Trump ordered the FBI to investigate the allegations at the request of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
The investigation shall not take more than one week.
According to the Washington Post, this is a more limited investigation than a criminal investigation and may not be made public.
Man threatened to kill police officers at police station in Kajaani
The arrested brawler continued to bully even in the chamber.
Police say they put the man in a police jail to "calm down."
The police were threatened by a suspected abuser on the night before Saturday in Kajaani.
The authorities are announcing an incident that began when a 30-year-old man fiercely challenged an argument in a downtown restaurant.
The man first assaulted another customer inside the restaurant.
This resulted in removal from the restaurant.
Outside, a brawler attacked another man, knocking him to the ground.
When a third party tried to intervene, the man hit her again.
The triple assault led to a police call.
The patrol apprehended the man and took him to the Kajaani police station, police said.
The suspect continued to behave aggressively at the police station.
The man kicked another police officer in the leg.
He threatened to kill and beat up police officers.
Police say they sent the man to a police jail to "calm down."
The man is suspected of three counts of assault and violent resistance to a public official.
Aid agencies prepare to start work in Sulawesi, Indonesia - "Clean water is the most urgent"
The UN Children's Fund UNICEF and other international aid organisations are ready to help on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, says Kirsi Haru, UNICEF Finland's Communications Manager.
Local authorities are leading the rescue efforts, but the need for further assistance is already evident at this stage.
UNICEF operates in almost all countries, and we also have long-term programmes in Indonesia.
In addition to normal operations, UNICEF always has full emergency preparedness," Haru says.
The first task now is to find the people in the rubble, both survivors and dead.
In the town of Palu in Sulawesi, rescue operations are underway, but in the Donggala region, a little further north, the situation is less clear.
There are still places where connections do not work.
Relief efforts are difficult because roads are also cut off," Haru says.
Buildings in Sulawesi are often lightweight, so the damage caused by earthquakes and tsunamis is great.
Once the survivors have been found, they need shelter - tents at first, for example - and clean water.
In crisis situations, clean water is the most urgent.
The first thing people can usually offer is water purification tablets, which UNICEF also has in stock.
The aim is to repair the water systems as soon as possible, but in case of emergency, water is transported in the first emergency, for example by truck.
In crisis situations, many children are separated from their parents.
Finding family members and reuniting families is one part of UNICEF's mission.
Food aid, on the other hand, is organised, for example, by the World Food Programme (WFP), which operates as part of the UN.
At the initial stage, previously collected funds are used for emergency assistance.
However, UNICEF, among others, has already started fundraising to help the victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia.
Billionaire Elon Musk quits Tesla as chairman of the board – $20 million fined for tweets
Elon Musk, founder of space rocket and electric car companies, is avoiding fraud charges through a deal with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Billionaire Elon Musk quits his position as chairman of the board of electric car company Tesla and agrees to a $20 million fine.
Musk is stepping down as part of an agreement he made with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
By agreeing, Musk avoids fraud charges.
Musk was threatened with securities fraud by the SEC over tweets he sent in August.
In them, Musk wrote that he was preparing to pull electric car company Tesla off the stock exchange, which caused the company's stock price to skyrocket.
Under the agreement, Musk will not be allowed to serve as chairman of Tesla's board of directors for three years.
In addition, Tesla must appoint a new "independent member" to its board of directors and include two "independent directors" on its management team.
Tesla must also set up a committee to oversee Musk's communications.
Musk will continue as CEO of Tesla.
In addition to Musk's personal $20 million fine, the Tesla company will also have to pay the equivalent of $20 million in fines to the financial regulator.
Tweets misled investors
According to the SEC, Musk's tweets misled investors and Tesla shareholders.
Musk claimed that he had secured financing to buy Tesla off the exchange back into a private limited liability company.
According to the billionaire's tweets, the company would have been bought off the stock exchange for $420 per share.
Tesla's stock price rose more than ten percent in a day after the tweets, but later fell.
According to the SEC, Musk's claims had no basis whatsoever.
According to the supervisor, he had not actually negotiated the funding he claimed.
Nor had he discussed the withdrawal from the stock exchange with the rest of the management team or the company's board of directors.
On Friday of this week, the rate fell 14% after the SEC announced a fraud charge.
The news of the agreement is expected to confirm the company's share price again.
The Last Judgment is not a reason
Naturally, the bells of the cathedral do not ring when the hands are not moving.
This is a technical failure.
The bell in the tower of Helsinki Cathedral has stopped.
The hands point to twelve o'clock.
It's like a mediocre horror movie: when you hear exorcism from the crypt of the church and the organ plays by itself.
Of course, this is not the case, but the clock has stopped for a technical reason: it has broken.
A repairman has visited it to see it, but some part has broken and a new part is expected," says Suntio Eveliina Jämsen.
At the same time, Jämsen confirms a point already mentioned by the Church in Helsinki Twitter account.
The account mentions that the final judgment is not a reason for the clock to stop.
Jamsen says that the church bells do not ring because of the fault.
