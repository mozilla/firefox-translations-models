9-year-old boy on the run in Tampere found
Police have been tasked with a search mission for a 9-year-old boy on a runaway in Tampere on Tuesday evening.
A missing person reported on a boy who started with a friend from Western Tampere has spread on social media.
The Police Situation Centre said the boy has been contacted and there is no risk to life and health.
The boy's father told the Evening News around midnight that the boy had been found.
He's fine and now we're going to start a back-to-back.
The boy was found in the vicinity of the home, the father said.
Ronaldo again, tearing up goal difference to Messi
Cristiano Ronaldo hit five goals in the Spanish league at the weekend and continued to fabricate in the Champions League as well.
The battle between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo over the Champions League goal kingship turned, at least for a moment, to the latter's favor.
Real Madrid's Ronaldo went to the top of the all-time goalscoring standings when he shot a visitor to Shahtar Donetsk's net two hits from penalties and one from a game situation.
Ronaldo raised his goal balance to 80, with Barcelona Messi, who was leveling with him on Tuesday, with 77 hits.
Real won the match 4-0.
Juventus have stumbled early in the season in the Italian Football League in Serie A, but in Group D of the Champions League it started with a 2-1 away win over Manchester City.
The winning goal was scored just over ten minutes before the end by Juventus' Alvaro Morata.
City's attack was dulled by the absence of a knee-troubled Sergei Aguero.
Aguero, who was injured in a major league game at the weekend, didn't come on the pitch until the last ten minutes.
Manchester's other club United also suffered a tough time in Holland against PSV Endhoven after suffering a 1-2 defeat.
ManU's 20-year-old winger, Luke Shaw,' away game lasted only a quarter of an hour.
PSV's Hector Moreno's dangerous-looking sliding tackle hit the ManU pack, who attacked the goal, so badly that Shaw was likely to have a tibia fracture.
Shaw lay on the grass at Eindhoven's home stadium for a dozen minutes before medical personnel went to transport him to hospital.
Memphis Depay took the visitors to a 1-0 lead in the 41st minute, but ManU's joy lasted only a few minutes.
Moreno levelled before the break in extra time.
PSV's winning goal was scored by Luciano Narsingh in the second half.
The goal-sapping season in the Champions League was started by Group A Paris Saint-Germain.
It was joined by Angel Di Maria of Argentina, who swapped a Manchester United shirt for PSG.
Di Maria broke through from the right and lifted the ball into the back corner past Malmo goalkeeper Johan Wiland.
Edinson Cavani scored 2-0 to PSG in the second half.
PSG has been betting on a season of success.
The assumption is not wrong, but Malmö, one of the league's small clubs, is not the best possible benchmark.
PSG star striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic faced his professional career-chase start club Malmö FF for the first time.
Ibrahimovic started his career at Malmö in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played 90 minutes as his team, Moscow's TsSKA, lost 0-1 to Wolfsburg in Group B in a game in Germany.
Opposition Party immediately called for resignation - president gave a false speech
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe gave the same speech he had given a month ago.
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe has given the same speech to the country's parliament at the end of last month.
In his 25-minute speech, Mugabe apparently didn't realize the speech was the same.
The speech raised doubts as to whether the 91-year-old Mugabe is in full spirit strength.
The main opposition MDC called on Mugabe to resign because he is too old to rule.
Mugabe's aides rushed to say that the mix-up had occurred solely at the Mugabe staff and that the president had done nothing wrong.
Mugabe's speech dealt with China's impact on the country's economy in the past.
Germany, Austria want an extraordinary summit on refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have presented an extraordinary summit of EU leaders for next week over the refugee crisis.
Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, who heads summits, assessed the request.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said state leaders should discuss cooperation with countries of origin as well as how to better register those coming to Europe.
Negotiations on quotas for asylum seekers, Merkel, are at the table of interior ministers.
Teacher admits shooting girlfriend during 911 call
Shannon Lamb, a university teacher with just a slightly quivering, tells police during an emergency call that he shot his girlfriend and that police officers need to come to their house.
Lamb stressed that his "golden dog" is alive and probably upset, as well as saying that the contact details of a dead woman's immediate family can be found on her phone.
Inside the house, officers found Amy Prentiss' body and I'm a handwritten message to the side of the tap: "I'm so sorry I wish I could cancel her love Amy and she's the only woman ever loved me," said in a letter that, according to experts, was signed by Lamb.
There was nothing to suggest that Lamb, who taught two online courses at Delta State University of Cleveland, Minnesota, had already traveled nearly 500 kilometers to a school campus where police believe he shot and killed a history teacher, Ethan Schmidt, to the door of his study.
Lynn Buford, the police chief at Delta State University, said university officials heard about the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He said Lamb made a fatal 911 call for a time after that.
By the end of the day, the number of deaths rose by one more: Lamb committed suicide while police siege.
Authorities were still trying to determine Lamb's motive for the day after students and staff had to hide behind locked doors because of a school shooting.
Researchers on both sides of the state have released reports of students and staff describing Lamb as a talented teacher who, however, possibly had problems.
Students said they expected her feelings.
Police at the site of Prentiss' death, Gautier, say Lamb had no violent past or criminal record.
Schmidt himself had included Lamb in a book he wrote in thanking "awesome people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught in a Department of Social Sciences and History, with a total of 17 staff members, and many students attended courses for both men.
On the other hand, there were some signs of problems.
A student named Brandon Beavers praised Lamb, but said he also seemed nervous and restless, "as if something was wrong."
Mikel Sykes, another student, said Lamb reported that he had a lot of stress at the end of the 2014-15 school year.
Lamb had previously asked for sick leave from Delta State University, saying he had some kind of health problem.
This year, he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the university's pay policies meant that while Lamb had worked hard for his doctorate value, it did not guarantee him automatic career development and the post of assistant professor.
William LaForge, the university's president, said there was no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, to his knowledge, any kind of conflict, but that "conquently there was something in Lamb's mind."
These are the questions Lamb can no longer answer.
After Lamb escaped from campus, police were able to track down him when he moved back to Mississippi from the state of Arkansas.
Before he was arrested, Lamb shot himself with a .38-caliber pistol in the backyard of a house about a mile and a half south of his parents' house in the suburb of Mississipin Greenville, said Methel Johnson, a Washington County Coroner of Death.
Lamb's car was still running in a driveway.
It wasn't immediately clear why Lamb went to this particular house, even though Johnson said he believed Lamb knew the people who live there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb started working at a university in 2009 and taught geography and education. The university has 3,500 students and is located in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants.
Lamb completed a doctoral degree in education in the spring.
One of Lamb's old friends described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 years old and Lamb 20 when they met through mutual friends.
Hairsto and his friends were in high school, and Lamb was a funny, older guy who for many years tried to teach Hairsto to play guitar.
He was quite a charmer in those days.
All the girls were molten wax when she was there, said now 40-year-old Hairston, who lives in a Jackson suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss had apparently been dating for a while.
In an emergency call, Lamb said he killed his wife, but there is no evidence of their marriage whatsoever.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them at a riverbank brick house in Gautier.
Police said the dog was fine.
Former Prentiss husband Shawn O'Steen reported their separation 15 years ago but remained friends. They now have a 19-year-old daughter.
"He's really upset," O'Steen described his daughter.
He was his mother's best friend.
O'Steen told me he hadn't met Lamb, but had heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when Lamb and Abigail were both performing at a summer market three years ago.
Later, they played together at some gigs.
O'Steen told me his daughter makes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse working for several different online companies.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender at The Julep Room's shady bar near Gautier, and occasional entertainment organizer, says he last saw Lamb and Prentiss on the night of September 5 after Lamb quit his guitar and harmonica performances to a sparse audience.
Nothing seemed wrong.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We played and threw sluts to each other.
So they were both pretty clever.
Schmidt, a dead teacher, headed a first-year student seminar program and specialized in Indians and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English teacher at the school.
Schmidt was married and had three young children.
He studied Emporia at State University in Kansas, as well as a speech director of his fraternal and student board.
On Tuesday night, a candle devotion was held at the Delta State campus in Cleveland, attended by about 900 people, including teaching and other staff, students and community members.
Schmidt's wife, Liz, and brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the Mass, during which the university choir sang the songs Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
The teaching continues on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
Now it's time to recover.
Amy and Rogelio Solis report Mississippi from Cleveland.
Associated Press writer Emily Wagster Pettus of Mississipin Greenville and Rebecca Santana from New Orleans contributed to the report.
The case has been corrected by the fact that police officers now say that Lamb made a 911 call after Schmidt was shot, and that while Lamb referred to Prentiss as his wife during the call, there is no evidence that they were married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for holiday season
Toys R Us says it doesn't hire as many employees for the holiday season as it did last year, but a dealer of toy and baby products says that current regulars and seasonal workers are given the opportunity to do more hours.
The company said it plans to hire 40,000 people to work in shops and distribution centers across the country, compared to 45,000 hired during the 2014 holiday season.
Most of the work is part-time.
The company said interviews with applicants will begin this month, and staff numbers will rise from October to December.
Although it's months off to vacation, the Christmas shopping season is approaching, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to help pick up stores, as well as the sale, dispatch and delivery of products.
Michael J. Fox jokes about 'dating' with Princess Diana
The premiere of Back to the Future was Michael J. A hugely important moment for Fox.
It was also noteworthy for personal reasons.
"We sat at the theater waiting for the royals to arrive, and I realized that the seat next to me was empty, and then I realized that Princess Diana's place was next to me," she said in a trailer for the upcoming documentary Back in Time.
The movie begins and it comes to me that I'm just a fake hunt and a hand stretch away from a date with a Princess of Wales.
Back in Time is a documentary about Back to the Future interviewed Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and production director Steven Spielberg.
Back to the Future premiered 30 years ago.
Spielberg told me, "To me, it's a no doubt the greatest time travel movie ever."
Back in Time is available on video-on-demand, DVD and some cinemas in October.
UN chief says Syria's situation won't be resolved armed
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's response to Russia increasing military support to Syria is that this nearly five-year conflict "does not be solved armedly," and additional weapons only exacerbate violence and the suffering of millions of people.
The U.N. leader again urged all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support non-discriminatory negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban told Wednesday's press conference that he plans to meet with the foreign ministers of five permanent member states - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France, on the side of a general assembly ministerial week later this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted that the division of the Council, the Syrian people as well as regional power factors "must have made the situation impossible to resolve."
Mr Ban called on five permanent Member States to show solidarity and consensus in the context of the Syrian crisis in aligning Iran's nuclear programme.
8 polls showing Donald Trump is serious
Some have tried to label him a wind van.
Others just think of him as a joke.
Some are waiting to collapse.
While some Republicans have tried to drag Donald Trump out of the top of support polls, it hasn't (yet) been successful.
Of the last 11 national polls, Donald Trump has been in charge of a double-digit number, and some have begun to seriously consider what this means for real estate king name opportunities.
Of course, the election season is only in its early stages.
These results do not yet mean that Trump will likely become a Republican candidate.
Commentators point out that at this point in 2011, Rick Perry was losing control of Herman Cain, who did not get any states behind in the nomination process.
There are many reasons why he would have a problem with general elections.
But outside groups such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the conservative financial organization Club for Growth have noted Trump's persistence and began to use their funds to take over him.
The following recent poll results suggest that the real estate king is not just a transitory phase:
Trump's popular numbers have turned around.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, Monmouth University support polls showed that only two of the ten Republicans welcomed the real estate king.
By mid-July, the figure was 40 percent.
In early August, the figure was 52 percent.
Six of ten Republicans are positive about Donald Trump.
About three in 10 say they are negative.
These figures are also true in the first primary states.
In a poll conducted by the University of Quinnipiac in Iowa last week, 60 percent of Republicans said they were positive about Trump.
Two-thirds of Republican voters would be happy if Trump were to become a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would either be "intentized" or "satisfied" if Trump were a candidate.
Only two in 10 said they would be "shocked" if he were to become a candidate.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent "intentally" vs. Trump's 40 percent).
Next up to be the most enthusiastic?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters would be "unsatisfied" or "shocked up" if Jeb Bush, a favorite of those in power, became a candidate.
Trump's fiery nature is not a problem for most of Republicans.
While Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his flamboyant speeches and insults, according to Monday's ABC News/Washington Post poll, 52 percent of voters gravitating to the Republican side at the national level think real estate king has a character appropriate to the president.
According to Quinnipiac's last week's survey, the figure in Iowa, which hosts a first convention, is the same: 52 percent of Republicans think Trump has a character that suits the leader.
However, according to an ABC/Posto survey, 44 percent think his character is not suitable for being president, and nearly six in ten people think his character is not part of the White House.
Republican voters get used to the idea.
When Republican voters think like commentators, they think Trump is a real option.
According to a CNN/ORC survey, four out of ten considered Trump to be the most likely option when asked to ask who is most likely to be nominated for Republicans.
At the end of July, four out of ten were still in favour of Jeb Bush.
Release: Republican Party voters have not always had access to the brightest possible crystal ball.
At the last election period, four out of ten Republicans thought that Rick Perry would be nominated, and only 28 percent supported the final candidate, Mittt Romney.
Either way, this shows that most of Republican Party voters think the Trump campaign is credible.
Even if Republicans stand up to support another candidate, Trump would still win almost everyone.
Some commentators have pointed out that a fragmented field likely has promoted Trump's leadership, as support against Trump is divided between numerous other candidates.
But a poll conducted by Monmouth University in early September showed that in a hypothetical bilateral race between Trump and nearly all other Republican candidates, Trump receives majority support in almost all cases.
He leads Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marco Rubio by 14 points, Walker with 15 points, Jeb Bush with 19 points, Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie for every 33 points.
He's level on points with Ted Cruz.
The only winning candidate for Trump?
If they were pitted against each other, Ben Carson would beat businessman Trump by a large 18-point gap.
A majority of Donald Trump supporters have just said they made a decision.
A new CBS/NYT poll from Tuesday shows that just over half of Trump-entrue voters have decided who their vote goes to.
Of course, things can change, and no one can say it is entirely certain that they would never change their minds.
46 percent said they could possibly switch candidates.
In any case, Trump's biggest competitor at the moment is another unlikely winner, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but those voters who said they had made a decision are twice as likely to be on Trump's side.
Six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump about immigration.
Since Donald Trump, two months ago, calling Mexican immigrants "cattlers" in his campaign pick-up address, immigration has been centrepieced in the 2016 debate.
Some are worried that Trump's flamboyancy is pushing Latino voters further away from the Republican Party and injuring rebranding attempts.
According to a new ABC/Post survey released Monday, six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So it seems that as long as immigration is at the center of things, so is Donald Trump.
Frustration with government has reached a new peak.
Support for Donald Trump and Ben Carson now covers about half of Republican voters, largely due to their position outside politics.
Six of the 10 Republicans said in Monday's ABC/Post poll that they would rather choose an out-of-politics person than one with government experience.
They are also angry with the federal government.
Two weeks ago, a Des Moines Register/Bloomberg survey of Iowa showed that three out of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated with Republicans in Congress: 54 percent are "unbundling" and 21 percent "a real angry."
Jeremy Corbyn's first appearance during Prime Minister's Question Time
Corbyn's first appearance at Question Time has been eagerly awaited since his election
Jeremy Corbyn, the new leader of the Labour Labour Party, will face David Cameron during question time for the Prime Minister.
Corbyn rises to ask about his first six questions shortly after noon, and probably both media and Labour MPs watch closely for his performance.
Corbyn has called for this weekly screening of "less theater and more facts."
He has also said he could leave some of the opportunities to be dealt with by his colleagues.
This encounter is the first parliamentary test for Corbyn's leadership since he was appointed to a shadow board and spoke at an annual meeting of the Confederation of Trade Unions on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader's decision to stand quietly during the national anthem during Tuesday's memorial service, held on the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain aerial war, has sparked criticism among Conservative Party MPs and appeared in several front-page stories.
Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention
A representative of Mr Corbyn said he "here-faced with respect to silent" and that he recognizes "The bravery of the Royal Air Force in the British Air Force in the British Air Force."
A member of Corbyn's shadow board, Owen Smith, told BBC Two's Newsnight that he would have urged Labour leader to sing a national anthem despite the fact that he thinks the royal house should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers have refused to be involved in Corbyn's inner circle, citing disagreements on economic, defence and foreign affairs. Originally less than a sixth of the parliamentary party supported him to be leader.
BBC policy correspondent Robin Brant says policy rotations regarding party status in the European Union as well as government aid cap have also "sponsive" within the Labour Party since Corbyn was appointed.
Corbyn said at a meeting of the trade union central organisation that Labour would propose an amendment that would remove the entire roof.
Hours later, Smith, secretary of labor and pensions for the shadow government, noted that the party was "quite clear" about opposing the government's plans to lower the ceiling of sqile of FAFF quizzes 4-0200,000.
Corbyn becomes the fifth Labour leader who has been faced by David Cameron over the past decade, when he has been the leader of the Conservative Party.
The Labour leader has promised a new approach to politics and now tells me that he has "masked" ideas into questions to the prime minister, and received more than 30,000 proposals.
Corbyn, an ISping North MP, has said the nature of the prime minister's Question Time is too pitting against each other and that he intends to refrain from both clever verbiage and spiking, promising to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges of young people instead.
Corbyn has said Angela Eagle, the shadow government's finance secretary, serves as her deputy in question classes when Corbyn doesn't attend - for example, when Cameron is abroad.
Mr Corbyn has also suggested that other colleagues should also be allowed to speak at one time, and he has said that he approached the speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, on the matter.
When Cameron took over the lead in 2005, he said he wanted to move further away from the kind of political theater, often associated with the Prime Minister's Question Time, but he later had to admit failing.
Since they began televising in 1990, the Prime Minister's Question Time has been an important measure of assessing the leader's discretion, his House of Commons, and his position among other MPs, even though critics have criticised questioning lessons for becoming nothing more than a travesty that require far-reaching reforms.
Photographed in Joburg: Homeless young people are trained as photographers
Downtown Johannesburg is a difficult place to be homeless.
But a group of former street children has found a way to learn skills and make a living.
'I was shot in Joburg's not-for-profit studio in which homeless young people are taught how to take photographs of their neighborhoods and make a profit from it.
BBC News met one of the first young people to complete the first project.

Pound value rises as UK pay growth accelerates
The value of a pound jumped upwards after the numbers showed rise in UK pay growth, while at the same time the FTSE 100 index rose with bid destination SABMiller.
Between May and July, UK wages, excluding bonuses, rose by 2.9 percent compared to the same time last year.
The growth rate was fastest since 2009, and was considered to bring with it estimates of higher rates.
The pound rose more than a percent against bucks to VP 1.5505, and 0.84 percent against €1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed down 1.49 percent to 6229.21.
SABMiller was the most distinctive stock on the market and rose 20 percent after rival AB InBev approached it with an offer.
The deal would bring together two of the world's largest brewers and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry stock rose 0.9 percent after encouraging news of Richmont, a rival luxury product group.
Richemont's latest sales figures were better than expected, plus they showed that sales in China - which are Burberry's key markets - had started to grow again.
Glencore shares rose 5 percent after the mining giant said it had raised  USD 2.5 billion by issuing shares as part of its debt-cutting strategy.
Shares in the packaging and paper group Mondi were among the highest calculators in the index at 4.3 percent after Goldman Sachs changed its recommendation from the company to "sell."
JD Sports rose 3.1 percent after a sportswear company releases information about its six-month return before taxes: an 83 percent rise to 46.6 million.
JD Sports director says higher wages could harm expansion
Peter Cowgill, president of JD Sports, says that if the minimum wage for employees is raised in the UK, it could mean that "potential consumers' purchasing power will increase."
However, this purchasing power is unlikely to exceed the higher labour costs incurred by the company, Cowgill notes.
The cost might be targeted at the company's expansion plans, he added, which would mean fewer additional jobs.
Metcash launches grassroots campaign against invasion of Aldi's industry
Metcash is trying to protect his IGA trades from Aldi's invasion of southern and Western Australia.
Metcash, a food wholesaler, has launched a grassroots campaign to defend IGA retailers' market share in southern and western Australia ahead of an attack of ninder 700 million.
Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centers as well as the first store early next year in southern and Western Australia, where up to 120 shops are due. Meanwhile, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening their relationships with local food processors and building an IGA brand through mainstream and social media marketing, as well as through events such as the Adelaide show.
IGA merchants and suppliers have jumped in, and brands such as Simmo's ice cream maker from Dunsborough offer tasts in IGA's stores, and shop owners sell discounted tickets to Australian football matches to regular customers.
Metcash is expected to reveal more details about his defense strategy on September 29, when this wholesaler of food, alcohol and hardware provides an annual investor strategy day.
There is much to play, with South and Western Australia accounting for a total of nearly 30 percent of the Metcash IGA trades, with yield margins higher than the IGA network of eastern states of Metcash.
South and Western Australia shopping visitors are known to be parochial, with IGA dealers with a much higher market share of New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland: more than 30 percent in the south and 24 percent in the West compared to 14 percent in eastern states.
But analysts like Morgan Stanley believe Aldi grabs about 5 percent of the food market in the two states within 12 months of opening the first moves. Turnover comes from all operators, but mainly independent dealers.
In his report this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimates that IGA dealers could lose tune tune tune  USD 360 million annually for sale and Metcash could lose  USD 250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in the south next year and 30 in the west, generating tune of tune of quid in these areas.
Loss of food and food sales and volume at a base of high fixed expenses in Metcash can pay Metcash about bucktos of operating profit losses before interest and taxes, Kierath said.
Meanwhile, Metcash is losing market share in eastern states, mainly for Aldi and Coles, although a recent Roy Morgan study found that IGA customers were the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley believes Metcash's food and food sales will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016; 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, so its market share will fall from 14% in 2015 to 10.3% in 2020.
Last week, Hamish Douglass, manager of a leading investment fund and founder of Magellan Financial Group, said at a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash could "well possibly lose in a decade."
Metcash has declined to publicly respond to Douglass' comments.
However, it has been understood that a member of the Metcash board would have contacted Douglass last week.
IGA's market share has fallen from 18% to 14 percent since 2010, and returns from Metcash's food and food business, which transmits products to about 1,200 IGA dealers, has fallen by 43% since 2012. This indicates a reduction in debt financing for operations when sales and margins are under pressure.
However, the wholesaler stands by, and has invested more than bucks150 million annually to lower prices of hundreds of products on the same level as Coles and Woolworths, helping IGA dealers to renovate stores by adding more rapidly growing fresh food, as well as introducing a better range of products from private brands to market.
Ian Morrice, president of Metcash, says lower prices and improving stores have increased attraction, and hopes the wholesaler will return to the road to revenue growth in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Australian Tennis Federation President Steve Healy backs Thanasi Checkfish
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves credit rather than criticism for his behaviour
Thanasi Kokkinakis has suffered a bystander in a recent storm that has been raging around his friend Nick Kyrgios. He deserves honor rather than criticism of his own behaviour, notes Steve Healy, president of the Australian Tennis Federation.
Kokkinakis, a young member of the talented duo called "Special Ks" unwittingly, was unwittingly publicized by Kyrgios of irking Stan Wawrinka in the Montreal Masters competition.
Soon after, in a fiery qualifier in Cincinnati, the head judge twice had to separate Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison when Harrison declared: "Wawrinka should have beaten Kyrgios, and I should beat that brat."
Although the Chefing was last seen breaking up his bat after the crramip ruined his potential victory over Richard Gasquet at the US Open, Healy has been a staunch defender of the Cook Nakis.
Right now, a young man is in Glasgow competing with Sam Groth for a second spot in doubles with Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against Britain.
"I quite strongly believe Thanasi has only been drawn to the brawl," Healy said.
He broke his bat when he lost to the US Open, but he's not the first player to break his bat as he frustrated, and I know Thanas well enough to know he's not proud of it.
But he has behaved superbly well, even in quite provocative situations at the US Open with Harrison, and so on, and I think he deserves praise.
He has a great team around him, he has a great family around him, and I think he's been treated a little hard.
He's very mature to 19, he works hard, fits into the team and so on, and has never had any problems with other players. He is appreciated in the locker room, he trains hard, is in good shape and is quite a calm and mature young man, and I think he should be judged to his merits.
Healy has also supported the decision not to take Kyrgio into important games starting on Friday, describing this "common decision" as a good solution for everyone, but still supporting the return of the Canberraan to the team's regular equipment.
"We want the team to be fully focused on games and not on all the polemic around [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
And Nick has risen really fast, as Federer and Murray, for example, pointed out, and he grows up in public, and has made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he receives. But we are trying to support him, we are trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I believe it's best for both the team and him if he spends some time out of public view to reflect on those consequences.
European immigration crisis: Hungary declares state of emergency, closes borders, arrests immigrants
Hungary declared a state of emergency and closed its southern border with Serbia, arresting those who tried to enter the country illegally. The goal is to dam the flow of migrants entering the country.
At the border, chaos ensued as hundreds of migrants flocked to a neutral area, and Serbian authorities reacted with dismay.
People who fled violence from their home countries have now set up their tents and set themselves up for an unspecified stretch of road between inspection posts in two countries.
But frustrates grew.
As the police helicopter remained above them, immigrants kept saying "Open the border!" and shouted insults to Hungarian riot police.
Some refused food and water to protest.
Serbia's foreign minister declared it "impossible to accept" the return of migrants from Hungary as more and more of them arrive from Macedonia and Greece.
"(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not to cause harm to civilians.
We need to discuss in the coming days with other countries and Brussels," Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
A consecution at the Hungarian-Serbian border was created after a group of 28 nationalities failed to create a common immigration policy at a contentious meeting in Brussels.
Ministers agreed with the division of responsibilities for 40,000 asylum seekers who have now invaded Italy and Greece. Ministers spoke hopefully about reaching the final deal - next month or by the end of next year - on which EU countries will take 120,000 additional refugees, including some of Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday called for an extraordinary EU summit to discuss the continent's migration crisis.
Hungary, however, does not express hope that its neighbours or Brussels will operate shortly.
Tuesday's emergency in two southern regions gave authorities greater powers to act in the crisis and allowed roads to be closed and asylum lawsuits to speed up.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that now that the fence at the Serbian border is complete, the country also plans to erect a barbed-wire fence on some of its border with Romania to stop the influx of immigrants through the country.
Charlie D'Agata, a CBS News correspondent, reported that even prisoners had been recruited to finish a barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
Over the past few months, Hungary has become the biggest bottleneck and entry into the European Union for refugees, many of whom are at war on the run from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
But Prime Minister Viktor Orban has claimed that most of those arriving are economic refugees looking for a better life, and not those fleeing from the war who are entitled to protection - this view is strongly at odds with other EU countries, including Germany.
New laws that came into force at midnight in Hungary now define an attempt to cross or damage a 4-metre (13-foot) barbed wire fence built by the government on the southern border with Serbia, as well as include longer prison sentences for convicted traffickers.
"Due to the situation caused by immigration, the Hungarian government is declaring a state of emergency," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told journalists in Szeged south.
We are very clear: Crossing the illegal border is a crime.
Parliament still has to formally approve the expected military positioning for next week, but the suppliers of the Associated Press at the border have seen heavy armed military personnel with vehicles and dogs for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, Orban's home country security adviser, said authorities had apprehended 45 people in an attempt to cross the border, as well as 15 those who had reached a longer country.
They got over the fence, are now imprisoned by police, charged with violations defined by new laws.
Authorities are fixing the fence quickly.
On Tuesday morning, Hungarian officials also closed two of seven crossing points to the border with Serbia after sending a barbed-covered train carriage to close one of those locations.
The main border crossing point near Hungary's Roszke was covered in chaos when Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container to handle people and crowds tried to stuff inside.
About 20 got in, but thousands were left out.
A group of immigrants blocked the main motorway between Serbia and Hungary, saying they refuse to eat and drink until they are allowed to enter Hungary.
2016 election: National Survey shows Hillary Clinton's lead on Bernie Sanders narrowed on the side
Former Foreign Secretary Hillary Clinton continues to lead a two-figure Democratic nomination race, but Senator Bernie Sanders clinches him up.
Clinton is now supported by 47 percent of Democratic voters (downloading from 58 percent), and another Sanders is supported by 27 percent (remitised from 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden has yet to announce whether he will go into the presidential race, but he is supported by 15 percent of Democratic voters.
More than five months before the primaries begin, most Democratic voters say it's still too early to say they would have decided who to vote for.
But Clinton's backers stand behind their own choice more tightly than supporters of other candidates.
Clinton's popularity has fallen to several demographic groups since last month's CBS News Poll survey, and at the same time Sanders has risen somewhat.
Clinton is heavily in charge of women and moderates, but her lead has narrowed.
His popularity among men has fallen considerably, and Sanders is only 5 percentage points behind.
Clinton's lead over Democratic voters under 50 has lost, and he is now level with Sanders.
Clinton, however, is clearly leading with older voters.
Last month, Clinton led Sanders with a double-figure number of liberals, but now Sanders leads this group by five percentage points.
About half of the country's Democratic voters say they will support Clinton enthusiastically if she becomes a candidate of the party.
A quarter say they support him with certain reservations, and 15 percent would support him just because he's a candidate.
Six percent would not support him at all.
It's not very surprising that Clinton's current backers are very likely keen on supporting her.
Opinions are more confusing for those who currently don't support Clinton - only a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48 percent of Democratic voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, the same number of Republicansman Donald Trump says the same number one Republican voter (35 percent).
When Clinton supporters were asked in an open question why they wanted her to run, the most popular response was that she had a suitable experience (16 percent). After that, the most popular responses were that now is the right time for a female president (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton backers also mentioned her connection to Bill Clinton (9 percent).
The same opinions and the possibility of being elected were also mentioned.
Because the vice president is instrumental in a possible presidential nomination, 57 percent of Democratic voters would like to see him already in the race - even though a third disagree.
When asked to be asked of Democratic voters who they choose to be second to the party appointment, Biden is the most popular choice.
More than half of Clinton supporters say they would choose Biden, who is much more popular than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to seek a Democratic nomination, Hilary Clinton's leadership of Sanders will grow. If Biden goes along, the lead will be 20 percentage points, but if he opts out, the figure is 30.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters think Clinton has the best chance of winning a presidential election, yet this figure has fallen from 78% last month.
With this standards, Biden falls far short, but the proportion of those who think he is most voted has increased.
However, when asked what the most important thing about a candidate was, democratic voters, they put opinions ahead of voting.
Last month, no Democratic candidate or potential bachelor candidate was also considered an impossible candidate for those voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates do well in certain key issues among their party voters.
Most consider Clinton, Sanders, and Biden to be honest, reliable and strong leaders.
Biden does best out of the trio in honesty, while Clinton's strength is leadership.
Thirty-two percent of Democratic voters say they don't think Clinton is honest and reliable, twice as many as Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent say they don't have an opinion of Sanders.
Democratic voters also generally consider that Clinton, Sanders and Biden agree ideologically.
When you look at all of these things, about a quarter of Democratic voters say they don't have an opinion about Sanders.
While Hillary Clinton's use of a personal email address and server while she was secretary of state still raises questions, most Democratic voters are pleased with her explanation of the issue and says the issue didn't affect their general opinion of her.
But it's different when you look at America as a whole.
Half of Americans are now unhappy with his explanation, and only about a third are satisfied.
People's opinions were split in March shortly after the issue came to light.
The majority of Americans say the email generation didn't affect their overall opinion of Clinton, even though 36 percent say their opinions about him have worsened.
More than six in 10 Republicans say their opinions about Clinton have gotten worse.
While voters in Clinton's own party consider her to be honest and trustworthy, this is still a problem for her among all registered voters. Only 32 percent think he's honest and reliable, and this figure has fallen by 8 percentage points since last month, as well as 15 percentage points since May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters say they don't think Clinton is honest and trustworthy.
Meanwhile, 55 percent of registered voters in the nation don't think Trump is honest and reliable either.
But both Clinton and Trump are considered to be good leaders.
The six candidates of Biden, Carson and Bush, who are involved in the study, are considered the most honest.
Sanders is generally considered honest, but many people have no opinion of him, just like Carson.
The margin of error in a study involving 351 Democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson approaches Donald Trump in a national poll
Ben Carson comes close to Donald Trump in latest CBS News/New York Times poll
In a new poll, two candidates garnered half of all votes, leaving others to fight for a foothold.
Republican voters across the country still strongly support Trump, whose support has risen from 23 percent to 27 percent of the previous CBS poll, pre-Supreme Fox News election debate, filed Tuesday.
But Carson soared from 6 percent to 23% at the same time.
The poll also found that Carson is doing well among various demographic groups and is displacing Trump's college-educated Republican voters.
The rest of the airport have fallen behind, except for Carly Fiorina and Ohio Gov. John Kasich. Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker has fallen the most: from 10 percent last month to 2 percent today.
Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, and Floridaxi Senator Marco Rubio are leveling in third place at 6 percent.
The margin of error in the sample of 376 Republican voters in this latest survey conducted in September is +/- 6 percent.
Last week's latest CNN/ORC poll showed Carson was up in polls: he has 19 percent support among Republicans, and Trump is ahead of him with 32 percent.
According to the latest ABC News/Washington Post poll, Trump was well ahead of Carson.
As Carson's popularity picked up last week, Trump criticized retired neurosurgery in vain, even though Carso apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday during a campaign visit to Iowa.
Five Brotherhood members accusing death of first year of Baruch College student
Nearly two years after a student died during a brotherhood clamming ceremony in Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains, a murder charge has been filed against five people.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood of Baruch College, New York City, brutally attacked Chu's "Michael" Deng during a ridicule in September 2013, and then delayed taking to the hospital, contributing to his death, police noted.
Officials say Dengi's eyes were tied and a back of more than 13 pounds full of sand was loaded onto his back, after which he was repeatedly tackled to the ground as he tried to walk through an icy field towards the finish line.
Eventually, Deng complained that his head hurt, after which he lost consciousness.
Brotherhood members did not call 911 after Deng fainted, but, according to the accusations, waited an hour before bringing him to a hospital, police say.
However, they had time to change Deng's clothes, look online to find information about his symptoms, as well as contacting Brotherhood national chairman Andy Meng, asking for advice from him," police chief Chris Wagner told a press conference.
"At this point, members began to hide their ritual gear and thus effectively put the welfare of the Brotherhood ahead of Michael Deng," police chief Wagner said.
Deng could not be rehearsed, and he died the next morning.
According to an autopsy record, Deng suffered repeated blunt objects to the head, body and thighs.
"Too many families have suffered a tribal investment, whereas every year at least one student has died as a result since 1970," Doug Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, said in a statement.
The Brotherhoods and their members must be held accountable, and this step by the authorities is important.
Monroe County's grand jury pleaded with first five members facing charges of third-degree murder
Thirty-two other members of the fraternity, including Meng, are also charged with violent simplistics as well as criminal intrigue.
"We don't want to be held to account individuals. If an organization is behind what happened that approved the situation either officially or informally, they should also be held accountable," Wagner said at Tuesday's press conference.
Baruch College banned the Brotherhood and the National Order dismantled its links to the local branch.
This happens when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates
Interest rate hikes will come, and rising rates markets will fail, bond yields rising and the economy will fall into recession.
We know this.
What we don't know is how long this will take or how long it will take.
The past does little to give you no help with timing, precisely what comes to the economy.
The recession has taken just 11 months to come after the first withdrawal, sometimes it has been as long as 86 months.
The US Federal Reserve's aggressiveness in raising interest rates has often been, though not always, a defining factor in how economics and financial assets react.
That's why US Federal Reserve officials have stressed that investors should not focus on it because interest rates are starting to be raised, but mainly to the trajectory of times that is going to normalise the situation.
There are several variables in the equation.
Eventually, however, market participants can see that all the fuss related to the rate hike has been overdone.
"The Central Bank's first increase following the global economic crisis will inevitably be interpreted in some circles to end the 'mypair money' era," Julian Jessop, chief global affairs expert at Capital Economics, said in a message to clients.
Instead, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to normal levels, albeit still low, to levels of a cataclysmic shock that many seem to fear.
But that doesn't mean it doesn't have any implications.
Below is an overview of how some economic sectors will react based on past developments:
As the market has seen in the past month or so, waiting for a rate hike can make the situation unstable.
When the increase becomes a reality, the impact is not quite so dramatic.
"It looks like a return on capital tends to stop for 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which again potentially reflects a delay in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of what happens after a central bank increase.
More specifically, over the past 35 years, the market tends to rise at a strong, about 14 percent increase, when approaching an increase of 250 days after that, the situation is fairly steady (average rise of 2.6 percent), and normal status has been achieved after 500 days with an average return of 14.4 percent in the last six cycles, according to a recent analysis by Bob Doll, the leading capital strategist of Nuvee Asset Management, which was published in Barron's journal.
According to Deutche Bank, the impact on equities tends to be clearer at a later stage of the increase cycle when returns start to decline.
Recessions are part of the economy, but interest-rate withdrawals often contribute to their income.
In the current situation, the central bank faces certain challenges that have not existed before, which can boost recession.
Such is particularly true of GDP, which will be the closest to its lowest ever level before the central bank's rate hikes.
According to Deutsche Bank, in 118 withdrawals since 1950, nominal annual GDP has only twice been less than 4.5 per cent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent, few believe it will stay, compared to a third quarter of a 1.5 percent, according to the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank.
A raising of interest rates in such a fragile economic setting may be risky and raise the question of "is this one time different," Deutsche Bank noted.
Market participants are braced for a central bank increase throughout the year, and everyone is awaiting a meeting of this week's Federal Open Market Committee, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economic experts believe the committee can accept an increase at this meeting, futures trading anticipates only a 25% probability.
"Our research shows that since 1950, all the upward cycles have so far occurred in the super cycles of increasing leverage, where GDP has overtaken its pre-recession peaks very quickly after stimulus has begun," the report said.
In contrast, an exceptionally slow recovery from a recession has been under way, which has been the worst of the observation period.
In today's cycle, the central bank has expected by far the longest to end the final recession: a record of 35 months, and now it's already 74.
Fixed returns have also been volatile as markets awaiting interest rate hiring, and the model somewhat reminiscent of capital observations.
The main difference is that when the central bank moves to its line, its effects are more visible in bonds than shares.
The direction of revenues in the Notes appears to change immediately at the first increase/cution of the cycle.
At the end of the rate hike, the proceeds of the notes will fall immediately," Deutche Bank said.
Charles Schwab strategists believe that raising interest rates is causing a convergence of returns on longer-term and shorter-term bonds, thus leveling the yield curve.
High-yielding bonds often produce better in such a situation, even though "even are cautious about looking for a return," noted Schwabi's fixed return analyst Kathy Jones in an analysis.
Surprisingly, Jones believes markets have already adapted to central bank policy expectations.
"As well as the decline in the strength of the dollar and inflation expectations, there are several signs that markets have adapted to the prospects of tighter monetary policy," he wrote.
Short-term interest rates are high, the yield curve is more even, credit margins have increased and instability has increased - all of these are characteristic of the market when the central bank has tightened its policy.
In general, companies whose business is mainly located in the United States will win when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinational companies with high debt perform worse when rising dollar value makes their products more expensive on the global market and their debt becomes more expensive than they have finance.
"History shows that 'quality' stocks tend to be more lucrative in the three months after the first rate hike," Goldman Sachs analysts noted in a report aimed at customers.
Enterprises with strong turnover overscorrupted companies after increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004, by an average of five percentage points.
Companies with high return on capital and low volatility stocks performed better than lower-quality enterprises. The average of the former was 4 (percentage points) and the latter 3 (percentages).
Debt is going to be a big problem.
Those companies with a lot of variable rate debt are losing the most, Goldman said.
Outside of stock market speculation, consumers also have the opportunity to benefit from a dollar increase in value.
Savings can also make a profit with higher returns, even as experts disagree on how quickly the impact feels.
BBC Radio is a copy of Classic FM, MP Andrew Bingham says
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham blames channel for 'international awareness'
He claims to be firing it from a commercial competitor becomes increasingly tricky
In addition, he targeted the BBC Music Awards, saying they only mimicking Brit Awards
To MP colleague Damien Collins criticized The Voice, saying it's not original either
BBC Radio 3 is becoming a "change" Classic FM, claims a leading MP boosting the production company's pressure to prove it is doing something that commercial production companies don't do.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC executives that the public service radio channel contributed to "internationalizing" its content, and that it is increasingly difficult to distinguish between a commercial rival.
"It seems Radio 3 - I wouldn't want to use the term "passent sense" - is turning into Classic FM," he said.
He also took aim at the BBC Music Awards, which was launched last December.
"The BBC Music Awards, launched last year, only appears to be a Brit Awards under a different name.
So if you try to do something different, here are two examples of me directly remembering about when you actually just copy something that you already find on the market," Bingham said.
The BBC executive denied the charges, claiming that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rival in terms of live music and sharing information to citizens.
Radio 3 teaches you things about classical music that I can't learn from anywhere else.
Its commitment to living music and music is actually first-class.
"I think it's really important, I think it's really important that Radio 3 is committed to finding new music and ordering new works," he said.
Earlier this year, director of BBC Radio 3, Alan Davey, claimed that the channel needed to do more work than previously to reach the audience because Britons know less about classical music.
Radio 3, however, was not the only part of the BBC's offering, which was criticized for stepping ontoes by commercial rivals during a hearing by the Committee on Culture, Media and Sporting Speciality.
Damien Collins, a Conservative Tory Party MP, criticised The Voice, a music competition bought by the BBC from Dutch production company Talpa Media for guise of pharmacies of FAMI pharmacies, according to estimates.
Do you understand why this program is discussed often because it is not original and it is by no means self-click?
Lord Hall claimed that this BBC1 program, in which Paloma Faith and Boy George, star judges, have been produced "especially in the BBC style."
He added that he wants the production company to "find success within his own house" the next time it starts a series of entertainment.
But he refused to stop the production of future The Voice seasons, or to order the money of the pledge payers to be used for other entertainment formats.
Online sales so far rose least in August, Black Friday may be the reason
Online sales rose by 7 per cent in the first three months of 2015
Last month was the highest figure after the start of statistics in 2000
Three years ago, online sales were confirmed by the use of mobile devices to make purchases
Experts believe November's Black Friday may curb consumption
The act of virtual shopping has been growing for more than a decade and transformed many of Britain's shopping streets into haunting cities.
But experts say there are now signs of leveling out online sales in the air, with the latest figures showing a rise of just 7 percent to the first quarter of 2015.
Overall consumption in August grew the least since the start of statistics in 2000: just five per cent of last year.
Experts say there are signs of levelling up online sales in the air, with the latest figures showing a rise of just 7 percent to the first quarter of 2015.
"If we look at the growth levels of previous years and go back to 2000, it was clear that the situation would make sense over time," Andy Mulcahy, editor of the JMRG Sales Index, told the Guardian.
He explained that three years ago, online sales were strengthened when buyers started using their mobile phones to shop.
It meant more people shop online, and that they could be done in different environments, such as on a sofa.
But now it's leveling off, and (growth) can go down.
The Black Friday phenomenon imported from America has been cited as one of the reasons behind slowing deals.
Experts believe consumers will curb shopping before the event of the last Friday of November.
Last year, five times as many buyers flocked to their computers to grab trades, pouring many traders' websites.
Experts believe Black Friday, prompting buyers to argue about discoveries, can curb shopping
A study published by the British Retail Consortium found that only about one pound of five was used online.
For certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of purchases are now made from online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of using shopping wardrobe fashion chains.
Muslims bury those killed in a lifting crane accident, Bin Laden family sanctioned by Bin Laden
Muslims carried bodies of 29 dead across streets during first funerals in Mecca
Saudi Arabia has partially blamed the collapse of construction giant Saudi Binladin Group
Health Department said a total of 394 people were also injured when a crane collapsed down
Twenty-nine dead were carried through the streets in the air as hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury them. The victims died when a crane collapsed at Mecca's Grand Mosque.
Traercals mainly dressed in white filled the route to honor the first dead to make their last trip to the Al-Moaissem Cemetery.
A sad procession passed a sacred place where just a few days ago a crane fell through the roof of a mosque and knocked down worshippers.
The bodies were released to be buried when the King of Saudi Arabia confirmed the Bin Laden family construction group to blame for the disaster, which also injured 394 people.
In the M.M. M.M. Grand Mosque of Dead Throttle Killing Throat of Threat, 9th Bodies of Threats Carried Carnated Through Streets
Among the dead was Qasim Akram Bolton, a father of four, from the Manchester area. He was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Akram had been at a Grand Mosque with his parents before the start of the annual hajj pilgrimage.
Saudi officials have already vowed to continue hajj Mecca as thousands keep arriving in town.
Today, King Salman stated that the Binladin Group should not have left the crane up when it was not in use.
An Arabic version of the decision published by the state-run Saudi Press Agency said that Binladin Group is partly to blame for the collapse.
The English-language service of the news agency did not mention this detail, but it said that company directors have been banned from travelling abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to find out what caused a crane to fall in the yard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were gathered ahead of a hajj-pillar hike later this month.
Binladin Group has not published communications on a squalid collapse, and its representatives have not been caught for comment.
The Royal Decision also accused the group of not using up-to-date safeguards, nor did it cooperate with meteorological authorities.
There are dozens of cranes around the M.M. Grand Mosque, which are part of a huge build robbery run by the Binladin Group.
The Binladin family has been close to Saudi Arabia's ruling family for decades, leading major construction projects.
The late leader of al-Qaida, Osama bin Laden, was a rebellious boy whose family banned in the 1990s.
The collapse occurred in windy and rainy weather just days before millions enter the kingdom for a pilgrimage that every capable Muslim must do at least once in their life.
Officials say 158 people are still in hospital.
Authorities ordered ounce of 1 million rials (€174,000) to pay families of the dead as well as permanent injured.
Other injured people will receive half of that amount.
B&Q boss says Eastern European cheap-working workers are behind popularity
Britons are increasingly using assistants' services, Veronique Laury says
Number of professionals from Eastern Europe is on the rise
As a result, 200 more Screwfix stores for professionals will be opened
Meanwhile, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q stores across the country
by Rupert Steiner, City principal correspondent for Daily Mail
Britons are said to give up hammers and paintbrushes and prefer to hire skilled Eastern European workers to do home rehabilitation work
It looks like if you're nifty with a hammer or a hack to paint walls, you're in a minority now.
You see, the British are hiring more and more helpers to handle do-it-yourself jobs in their homes, according to the boss of the company behind B&Q.
Veronique Laury, the new executive chief executive of Kingfisher, who owns the chain of home renovations, said the popularity is driven by skilled workers from Eastern Europe and offering their services at a derisory price.
This leads Kingfisher to plan to open 200 new Screwfix stores for workmen and close 60 B&Q stores.
Laury said he wants more women to work in B&Q stores because eight of 10 purchase decisions made at the store are made by a more beautiful sex.
Today, most of the staff are men.
He said changes in the population must be taken into account: there are more households of one woman today, where more home rehabilitation work is done than before.
Laury said, "Most of our stores' staff are still men.
We need to seek better balance.
But half of our customers are women, and 80% of product purchase decisions are made by women.
Women play a big role in the decision-making process.”
Laury is one of only five women who lead the main companies in the UK's FTSE100 index. He has rebuilt his management team to have as many male and female supervisors.
Kingfisher is almost the only company with an equal 50 percent of women in the group, including its president and finance director.
Laury said: "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.
It hasn't been hard to find good women in a management team.'
Kingfisher reported a decline in both six-month returns and sales after the group took the cut of the closing of stores.
As a result of the trend, Kingfisher, which owns Screwfix and B&Q stores, is opening 200 new stores
The three aces decided to resort to mandatory legislation to save the country's economy.
We got a visible impact pretty quickly.
The sharp head of SAK and other employee central organisations began to force the sharp head immediately, and as a result, the country will stand on Friday due to a large demonstration by employees.
Many people think that reason stands.
Ask if it's worth striketing when it's not going to go bad anyway.
A resistance movement has even been established.
More than 50,000 people have already visited the Internet to announce that they will not participate in a demonstration but go to work.
In an old good consensus, this would have been impossible.
Of course, there was no internet to protest, but openly declaring himself a criminal offence would have been a political suicide of a small person.
The protest of a few tens of thousands of people in multimillion-member trade unions does not get much heckled, but it gives me reason to think about.
The role of the trade union movement is no longer as self-evident as it was twenty years ago.
Not everyone knows the goals of the movement as their own, values have changed
From the point of view of the attractiveness of the Ay movement, the government’s drastic solutions can also be seen as a direct gift of heaven.
For years, when things have seemed to be rolling at their own weight, unions are finally getting to the point of defending, visibly and properly defending the rights of employees.
In doing so, the government may be willing to solidify the role of trade unions, when membership in a trade union is seen as perhaps more necessary than before.
Whatever the attitude of organisations, it is nonsense that Friday’s demonstration would somehow stop Finland.
Finland has stopped a long time ago.
Industrial production, for example, has fallen for 31 consecutive months.
Gross domestic product continues to decline, rising unemployment.
I think these things would force everyone to make ends.
Lappeenranta University has a tough savings treatment: Aiming to save 8.5 million euros, reduce personnel by 130
Lappeenranta University of Technology starts a savings course that aims to reduce costs by a total of EUR 8.5 million.
As part of the savings, the university will start co-operation negotiations concerning all personnel, with a savings target of 6.5 million annually.
In practice, that means cutting about 130 employees.
An additional 2,000 million are being saved from other activities.
The co-operation negotiations are based on the 2016 budget, which anticipates a deficit of 8.5 million actual operations.
It is also influenced by the government's allocation cuts.
In this financial year, the university will make a deficit of about 2.6 million.
Expenses will increase slightly for next year, but at the same time funding from the Ministry will decrease by 2 million euros and other funding by EUR 3.2 million.
The university’s total budget is approximately EUR 85 million, so the savings target is ten per cent of the total budget.
The combined impact of massive cuts in teaching and research and reduced corporate financing to our university is very significant,” says Rector Anneli Pauli.
Before the summer, the effects of the cuts seemed even more moderate, but now the reduction in supplementary funding is showing itself in new proportions.
Negotiations with shop stewards will be launched on Tuesday next week and will last six weeks as determined by law.
Onnibus wants to join Finnish railways
The owner of the low-cost bus company Onnibus, UK Sir Brian Souter tells Yle that the company is also aiming for rail transport in Finland.
I am very interested in joining Finland’s rail transport.
My Stagecoach company is one of the UK's largest rail transport companies," Souter said.
Rail traffic is to open to competition gradually.
The first is commuter traffic in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area between 2017 and 2018.
After commuter traffic, long-distance traffic will take place.
Souter says he's approaching the Department of Transportation.
According to Yle, Onnibus’s plans are welcomed by the Ministry of Transport.
Other international companies have expressed interest in rail transport at least Transdev (formerly Veolia), which also has bus services in Finland and rail traffic elsewhere in Europe.
The Federal Reserve must make decisions on interest rates
The rest of the world will follow from the sidelines as the US Federal Reserve meets for two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a critical decision on whether to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
With Reuters surveying 80 economists, just over half of those who still believed last week would raise rates of interest rates, believe the situation is not yet resolved and interest rates are kept at the current level of 0-0.25%.
It is a historic event, as it is seven years since the central bank cut interest rate levels to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a central central bank has a chance to get away from zero levels and start normalizing interest rates," said Angel Ubide, a senior fellow at the Institute of Economics for Peterson Institue for International Economics.
The U.S. economy has been doing relatively well, and the recovery has brought trillions of dollars to balance sheets, as well as creating little inflation.
But the central bank cannot ignore less rosy global views.
It has warned the market that they must be ready to withdraw, but signs also indicate that the odds are against the increase.
The decision will be announced on Thursday at 8pm (CET).
Delta State University shooter leaves apology message
After shooting his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - before shooting his colleague later that day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note saying he was "deprived" about the first murder and hoping to cancel it," officials said Tuesday.
Mississippi Gautier police said Delta State University gestation teacher Lamb called 911 at around 10 a.m.
Monday and told me he's shot and killed someone.
Lamb told the defendant that the police must send constables to his home.
He said he "tobb his wife last night" and also mentioned that there is a "sweet dog" in the house, which "doesn't bother anyone," but is probably shocked.
Police asked the caller for his name, but he didn't tell me that.
Lamb gave no explanation for the shooting.
When the police got to the scene, the body of 41-year-old Amy Prentiss was found, along with a hand-written message from 45-year-old Lamb that read: "I'm so sorry I could cancel it.
I loved Amy and she was the only person who ever loved me.'
After writing a message, Lamb drove nearly 500 miles to Delta State, where he killed history teacher Ethan Schmidt, before finally killing himself late Monday with police surrounded him.
William LaForge, the university's president, said there was no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, to his knowledge, any kind of conflict, but that "conquently there was something in Lamb's mind."
Officials said Tuesday that despite allegations published Monday that Lamb believed Prentiss had been in a relationship with Schmidt, there was "law information or evidence" of any kind of "triodoodram."
Shawn O'Steen said he had been married to Prentiss for about seven years and described him as a "good person."
The pair divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Steen reported that he and Prentiss had a 19-year-old daughter who is "shocked."
O'Steen told me that Prentiss and his daughter were "one best friends of all."
According to Linsday Knowles, Prentiss worked from home online. Sun Herald said Knowles was a close friend of Prentiss's close friend.
Knowles told me that Prentiss, who had a dog named Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
"He always wanted to help other people," Knowles said.
Police said Lamb called relatives at some point Monday to tell them "he's not going to jail."
When officers reached Lamb on Interstate 1 near Greenville that night, Lamb stopped his car to the side of the road, left it there and ran into the woods where he shot himself.
Lamb defended her doctoral dissertation on education at Delta States in spring 2015, according to a curriculum vitae on the university's website.
Stars who lost their charms
The actor (left), pictured with his son, Redmond (right), has been tough in recent years.
In 2001, he contracted leukemia, and in 2009 his longtime partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
Rumor has it that he also had drug problems, and in 2008 he was arrested for drug possession.
All of this does indeed take a toll.
Manchester United's Luke Shaw is out for months due to double break
Luke Shaw suffered a double break in his right foot as Manchester United lost to PSV Eindhoven in a Champions League match.
Even if the defender stayed in tears and is out for at least six months, Louis van Gaal hopes Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The injury was caused by a reckless tackle by H-ctor Moreno in the 15th minute after 20-year-old Shaw plunged into PSV territory.
He was treated for 9 minutes on the pitch and had to be given oxygen before taking to hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He has a double break on and is now in hospital."
He will be relocated tomorrow or maybe a day after, and then cut in Manchester.
This is horrible. The boy comes to Manchester United at 18, suffers trouble and then plays brilliantly, and now this happens.
When I was in the dressing room, he was wearing an oxygen mask.
He cried.
I'm not a doctor, but it's going to be at least six months a double break, and he's not playing in the group stage.
I hope he'll be playing this season.
Moreno seemed lucky to get a red card and a penalty shot.
Referee Nicola Rizzoli did not punish Mexican player.
Van Gaal suggested that an Italian trustee erred.
You can condemn the situation when I say it turned out to be a penalty shot and a red card.
It was a really bad tackle of two legs.
Shaw tweeted as follows: "Thank you to all your messages, words aren't enough to tell you how disappointed I am, my recovery is starting now, I'm back stronger."

The English defender has an additional incentive to recover next June's European Championships in France.
PSV coach Phillip Cocu said, "It's a really bad injury."
If a player is forced out of such an injury, everyone is very sad.
Our players are never meant to offend an opponent.
Moreno's leg was broken when he played for Mexico against Van Gaal's Holland at the 2014 World Cup.
"Moreno takes this heavily because the intention is not to hurt an opponent, and when you hear that an injury is really bad, it's a bad thing," Cocu said.
I didn't see it in that situation.
The only thing I saw was a ball going in a different direction, so it looked like he [Moreno] had touched it, but I didn't see Luke's tackle.
Moreno told SBS6, "I know what it feels like, I know how difficult this can be.
I feel terrible about this, I'm so sorry.'
PSV's Andr's Guardado was also taken to hospital after Chris Smalling sues him.
David Cameron knows Lorax better than this, right?
Every parent will soon learn something: if your child loves a book, it won’t be long before you learn it from almost outside.
Unless you're David Cameron.
When the holiday childcare service asked the Prime Minister for his favorite children's book, he chose Dr Seuss' The Lorax book, an environmental-promoting story published in 1971.
The choice was tricky, Cameron writes in a note posted on the SuperCamps website, continuing: "Funing, moving, creative and containing a strong message. I enjoy reading this book to my kids because it always seems to be a picture or a message we haven't seen before."
All of this is true, but the next paragraph, in which Cameron presumably describes the plot of the book, is a summary of the 2012 film version of 2012, in which new characters and details were added to the filling of a fairly short original text.
"In the town of Tarville within the lond, where all nature has disappeared and even air is a commodity, Ted-son hopes to win the girl of his dreams to his heart by filling Audrey's wish to see the right tree," the text says, describing a love story Dr Seuss, who died in 1991, not written by Dr Seuss, whose real name of Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991.
If this is not suspicious enough, Cameron's text sounds like it's taken from the Lorax movie congratulations on the Internet Movie Database, which begins as follows: "In a town inside the record, with all artificial and even air is a commodity, Ted boy hopes to win his dreams to the side of the Audrey girl."
Given that Cameron is a publicly active parent, it seems unlikely that he would be so unaware of a book plot. In it, a young, anonymous boy hears how local nature has been destroyed by greedy, tree-cutting and weaving needed, by noticing a short, moustache-like creature Lorax who has given the story, "talking for trees."
Such a relatively invisible PR assignment is probably outsourced to an assistant who apparently has never read a book 20 times in a row to a child.
A spokesman for the prime minister said the text must have come from Cameron's constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was received from Cameron's staff, but did not comment further at that moment.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of being stood aside from the English team, but it was still a tough place.
Playing against Pakistan in the UAE is a tough task, but when you see what kind of team England have chosen for a tour, I don't think there are likely to be a repeat of the 3-0 series loss last time.
I wouldn't shut an away win out of the count either.
The Alastair Cook side may be less experienced than the team of three years ago, but it involves good twisters and the team's mindset is strong: they don't have scars from 2012, just youthful positivity.
Moeen Ali develops in his twisting pitches and Adil Rashid is an attacker option, although he is an unknown factor at this level.
Related: Adam Lyth Dropped from England Cricket Team, replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to leave Adam Lyth from a team is understandably tricky to analyze for me because I'm his head coach in Yorkshire.
His seven games have been against good attackers in challenging circumstances, and the simple but stark truth is that cricketers are judged based on their results.
Joe Root's choice, for example, there was no uncertainty before a press release because, as I have said before, players are the best choice makers.
About 100 points more, and Lyth's season in the team could have continued, but he was responsible for his own fate.
Hopefully, if he gets more runs to Yorkshire, another chance comes up.
England head coach Trevor Bayliss praised Lyth's attitude even when he didn't perform quite as well as he could, and it doesn't surprise me. Lyth is first and foremost a team player.
It's a tricky to answer the question of how long a batter gets to leave a mark.
Lyth was selected seven times for the national team, as Sam Robson before him, while Nick Compton was selected nine times.
Only Compton got the opportunity to play both at home and away.
The only subject matter of the appeal is that England first chose Jonathan Trottt for the Caribbean when Lyth was in top form, but that missed chance is now a past.
Alex Hales comes along, and there's a batter I appreciate.
He has something we saw early in this season in the Yorkshire when he scored 236 points against us on the Trent Bridge field.
He must be given the same opportunity as anyone before him, but of course this depends on the composition of the team in the United Arab Emirates.
There's been a ballooning idea of Moeen in a batting opener alongside Cook, giving an extra pitcher onto the pitch but keeping four quick ones, and I'm not against this.
I don't understand why a hitter can't be hit there, and this left-handed guy has already shown himself to be quite a cricket player.
Moeen did not necessarily do his job in County Worcestershire, but he is three for them and there is little difference.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 games with the first hit drop, before moving to the opening in 2001.
He immediately scored three hundred points and didn't reminisce about the past.
Zafar Ansari becomes a backup pitcher for the team, and, the little bit I've ever dealt with him, he feels like a very impressive young man.
People can look at his unvarnished statistics - hitting an average 31, with a ball 35 - and think it's a gamble, but there aren't too many pitchers available and selectors picked young.
He learns a lot on this tour.
Outside the team, England seems to have a few tough additions to the coaching side.
The appointment of Sri Lankan batter Mahela Jayawarde as a consultant to the games could prove to be a stroke of genius.
He's one of the nicest guys in the game, and he's bringing a huge amount of experience because he's done everything in all situations and against all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes into white ball games, bringing with it both energy and a relentless hint of energy.
I've always thought he was born to be involved in international cricket, whether it's playing or coaching, and he's got the same trumpet as Mahela.
Sometimes new sounds in a locker room can refresh the team, even if their message is the same as before.
Colly's team-mate Durham, Ben Stokes, rests in one-day lives, Root was given a similar break against Australia, and at least I have no problem with this.
Although not everyone agrees, coaches and elects don't make schedules.
And you have to remember that just like players, their work depends on the results.
Such decisions are never made lightly.
The UK's departure from the EU (Brexit) could take a profit if the economy is in trouble in 2017
David Cameron's half-battle renegotiation strategies to keep Britain in the EU face increasing problems every day, even if you don't take into account even a heartfelt Jeremy "Is it yes or no?" Corbyn's election to head Labour's party or angering a trade union central organisation to Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their own Corbyns and Nigel Farage.
A European diplomatic fellow European diplomatic friend recently explained that, as the EU is so deep in various crises, not all of which are its own fault, some Member States are tired of Britain's self-centred agenda, which is full of dissenting concessions and disruptive treaty changes that these states do not want for the most part.
At its annual meeting in Brighton, the trade union federation decided that it would not want them if they eroded social protection.
We might even call it a selfieage of Dave and George.
The Prime Minister and Finance minister are delayed from summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a picture of themselves in front of a famous local monument, either with or without a local eye-witness, and then come home, saying they will win backers for reform.
Everything is about me.
My European friend who wants the outward-looking UK to the EU tent - 'Don't leave us alone with France," they say from Berlin - suggests that the shortst ministers and officials of certain capitals are now at such a point where they don't care about we're leaving.
German cautious and moderate Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave its actions before it gets ruined in the same way that it happened to the lingering Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France's Francheoz Hollande faces a re-election or replacement in 2017.
He's a fading power, too.
Poland could soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain could have a left-wing one.
It is difficult to see these countries sacrificing for selfie Britons, when it would be better to focus their energy on preventing Scotland from leaving the UK - they do not want it because of their own separatist trends.
So, my friend suggests, some such ministers can even deliberately plan to make useless remarks in the Scottish National Party style during the British referendum campaign in order to speed up the Brexit process.
"Renew negotiations had taken place a case" and "Reactions had no bearing on Britain."
Europeans have bitterly experienced how the Fleet Street press can be and how EU skeptical are, which were not at the time of the Tony Benn-inspired referendum of 1975, when our membership, which began in 1973, was confirmed by 2:1.
They can vaguely remember Boris Johnson, the biggest Europole scholar, who made a name for himself writing about "EU direct bananas" while being a Brussels correspondent in the early 90s.
Ed Miliband may be a fool, but at least he knew who his enemies were.
They included a diverse group of taxpayers, foreign phones hacking, residents of nominally domiciled elsewhere and who own most of our big newspapers.
Tony Blair actually thought the same about them, but realized that if you're in a cage with a lustful gorilla, bananas must be abandoned because of a bluff unless you want to be on that gorilla lunch menu and dinner later.
In fact, Miliband was more blairilian than Blair himself, as regards opposition to Cameron's renegotiation trick. After all, Bair had agreed to the principle behind the EU's rejected constitution, rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, thus giving Blair a way out of the situation.
The press never forgiven him for that either.
But a nice Jeremy Corbyn, who kindly tapped me in the back at Westminster Parliament House on Monday (I told him he didn't have time to waste on me) seems to be in danger of re-accounting Neil Kinnock's 80s boycott of the Murdochia strategy, which was a mistake both then and now.
However, even though it can take time, he is forced to develop a consistent strategy to communicate with the media. Not me, but no doubt Andrew Marriin, from whose BBC sofa, Corbyn left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position in Europe is, to put it nicely, evolving.
He says we would like us to stay in a renewed EU.
Well, most people outside the UK Independence Party Ukip's war paint engagement, as well as the frenzied of the Conservative Party, can certainly stand behind this opinion.
Hilary "Benn, but not a Benn fan," Benn said this on both radio and TV this week when his internal scout would have wanted to admit that Corbyn's choice of crass John McDonnell as shadow secretary of the government's finance minister was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70s when his father-in-law was struggling on TV, trying to be disloyal to his colleagues in the Labour Party, without going so far as to lose his seat of government.
Hilary's pinpointings were more appealing.
But for the fight to keep up with "any situation anywhere" - Benn's statement - was not what McDonnell said, and not everything, by judging, what Corbyn told the main fronts and MPs at a private meeting on Monday night.
Whatever the unhierarchical, emotional, personal image that Corbyn wants to convey (remember that he even touched me), the discipline of communication is important in the era of round-the-clock TV, and especially in the vortuffs of social media, which is a suitable breeding ground for paranoias and betrayals.
As McDonnell has said, it's only fair not to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe by allowing Labour's support in the referendum campaign taken for granted.
At least Simon Jenkins thinks so.
But the basic spiral of McDonnell and Corbyn regarding EU membership (and being aligned with their Benn-inspired regulated economy and anti-capitalist past) is no longer just a difficult conversation among left-wing concealers for whom the narcissism of small differences is a central dogmi in learning snails.
As for his duality of NATO (Tom Watson is convinced that Corby is not campaigning to give up), foreign diplomats must only try to explain it to their superiors.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital (thusiasts of suspicions, too) to be admitted to Britain when it can be completely futile?
The United States is already somewhat disappointed with the weak military performance of Britons in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost-cutting conservative government in power, as I was reminded of the start of Monday's British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticise Public Health England e-cigarette review
Researchers have said that the state-funded agency's claim that e-cigarettes were 95% less harmful than traditional ones originated from a meeting of 12 people, with links to the tobacco industry.
Experts writing to the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in a report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published this "sentment column" report last month, describing it as a "discounted review of evidence."
However, several researchers have questioned the sustainability of data and cited links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
A medical journal Lancet published an editorial last month attacking the "exceptionally shaky basis" of PHE's main ruling.
Two other researchers who wrote in the BMJ have wondered if the claims were "built on rock or sand."
Martin McKee, Professor of Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, say: "The main principle of national health is that policies must be based on proven effectiveness."
They say the public expects PHE's claim "according to current best estimate, e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than traditional cigarettes" is based on detailed assessment and modeling of evidence.
In fact, it comes from a meeting of 12 people, where a multi-critical decision analysis model (MCDA) was developed to synthesize their opinions about the disadvantages associated with various nicotine-containing products, and the results of this meeting were summarized by research.
McKee and Capewell say one of the sponsors of the meeting was the company named EuroSwiss Health, whose president is reported to have previously received funding for research independent of Bristish American Tobacco.
He also supported BAT's public health powers in the sustainability report, they say.
One of the 12 people in the meeting said they had received funding from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but not the funding he reportedly received earlier from tobacco company Philip Morris International, they add.
The criteria for selecting panel members are not disclosed, but the panel includes several well-known e-cigarette supporters, some of whom also report funding in the study.
Others present are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by a PHE tobacco manager.
The research produced by the group "muchfully admits" that there is a lack of "disputable evidence of harm to most products and most of the criteria," McKee and Capewell write.
However, none of these links or limitations are mentioned in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell say PHE's claims that "so far there is no evidence that e-cigarettes act as a route to burning children or non-smokers" to be premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, PHE's head of health and well-being, says the claims made in the BMJ have been answered in the past.
He says, "Electric tobacco are significantly less harmful than smoking."
Half of those who have burned their lifetime die of addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks posed by e-cigarettes are comparatively low, but we must continue to study long-term impacts.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what evidence is displayed and what it does not show, especially when there is so much public uncertainty compared to relative dangers to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die from smoking-related illness each year and smoking costs the NHS nil quip quip quid every year.
By explaining the current evidence - i.e. e-cigarettes are not risk-free, their harms are only a fraction of the disadvantages of traditional tobacco - we meet our national responsibility.
BBC would do well to give up EastEnders, says former Channel 4 chief
Former Channel 4 president Luke Johnson has said the BBC should stop broadcasting programs like EastEnders or The Voice, and that commercial competitors "sign anything" such hits as this soap series set on Albert Square, for example.
Mr Johnson said licence fees should only be used to make programs that other British broadcasters do not.
He criticised the BBC for putting public-service programs that are likely to have a smaller audience, tricky missions against competitors' most-watched shows and on such channels as the BBC4.
After BBC CEO Tony Hall said the company wanted to cooperate more with other organizations, Johnson said he tried to establish Channel 4 for six years to establish a relationship with the BBC, in vain.
"I don't understand the idea that the BBC is producing and broadcasting programs that would be clearly suited to unsubsidized competitors," Johnson told the DG Communications Committee as part of its research into the future of the BBC.
If you stick to the licence fee - and I'm not sure it would be a good idea for this message or, in the long term, it should at least limit its production to programmes that others don't do and produce.
The Voice is sent to the most important broadcast time because they want to gather as much support as possible for its future.
The idea that no one else would show the show is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's clearly nonsense.
Johnson said: "I don't see why a regressive tax should fund programs that could be funded even without government subsidies.
The Voice is one of those and EastEnders another, admittedly inside the house.
Frankly, other channels would give any of it.
I don't see how it's about public service transmission.
I don't think it would weaken the BBC at all.'
Johnson, a serial entrepreneur who led Channel 4 between 2004 and 2010, said the BBC was guilty of hunting viewerships "due to the goals of people working on it, and because they believe it's the best way to achieve long-term support."
He's comments on the BBC's most popular shows reminiscent of former Sky director Tony Ball. He used his 2003 MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh to suggest the BBC would sell such series as EastEnders.
Mr Johnson said that the BBC's smaller public public public programmes "go to BBC 4, where often it is not possible to measure the number of viewers, but the BBC thus fulfils its responsibilities and then, in defending 9% licence fees, hypocritically states that 'of course, we will do all these unknown programs that no one looks at'.'.
They put them in a place where no one ever comes to watch them.
Regarding the permit fee, Johnson told the committee: "I'll challenge you to find a more regressive system in which to get the most value for it.
Of course you all think, we all think about wing 150 years of getting a lot of value, but I don't know if it's true for people for whom wing 150 pounds is a big money, because they don't use the BBC much.
Former Skyn and Channel 5 executive David Elstein, who also testified to the committee on Tuesday, said the BBC should reassess its mission during the Rhine's "information, train and entertain."
He said only a small percentage of BBC production today classifies as education - he said figures were 1% of TV production and 0.1% of radio - and that it should take inspiration from Australian and Canadian public broadcasters and change the task to "data, educate and entertain."
As for partnership issues, Elstein said the BBC should focus more on events such as Proms concerts, which he says are only shown on television by some, and to ally them to watch online.
'Atound genetics' allows brain cells to control by sound waves
The video shows how nematode swap direction as soon as the sound impulse hits them.
Scientists have grown worms with genetically engineered nerve systems to control them with sound wave bursts.
Tiny nematodes change direction as soon as they are hit by a sound impulse that is too high to hear from a human ear.
The impulses work by turning on genetically engineered motion neurons with membrane ducts that respond to ultrasonic waves.
Related: Scientists Read and Write Brain Action With Light
Scientists said the worms show the functionality of a new method, called audio genetics. In it, ultrasound can be used to activate certain brain, heart and muscle cells from outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told The Guardian that the method could one day replace deep brain stimulation. It is an invasive procedure in which electrical impulses are passed into people's brains to treat Parkinson's disease.
The nematodes do not normally respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that when surrounded by liquid with microscopic bubbles, the situation changed.
He noticed that bubbles reinforced ultrasonic waves, which then pass through worms.
Reinforced ultrasonic waves affect the TRP-4 ion channels, structures found in cell membranes of some worms.
Sound waves cause these ion channels to open up and activate cells attached to them, according to a report published in Nature Communications.
To manufacture ultrasound-driven nematodes, Chalasan genetically modified worms so that some of their motion-nerve cells have TRP-4 ion channels.
When Chalasani used ultrasound to modified worms, microbubbles strengthened sound waves and transmitted them to worms where they switched on modified motion nerve cells.
The method features some of the same features as optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that allows scientists to turn nerve cells on and off using light impulses.
However, Chalasani says there may be some advantages over optogenetics.
Unlike light, which must be sent along the optical fiber to the desired spot inside the brain, low-frequency ultrasonic waves can pass through the tissue unimpeded, so they can be sent to the brain from the top of the skull.
"We believe that using gene therapy and a therapeutic virus, it may be possible to temporarily get targeted human nerve cells to respond to ultrasound signaling in certain neurological treatments in a clinical setting," Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.

Ads put Britain's arms trade to shame
Watch the video against Amnesty International's weapons fair.
Terrifying killers!
Foot cuffs crushing herrings!
Grape bombs!
Both electronic stun batons that cause painful pain but leave no traces!
The cheerful voice and imagery of the comics leave no doubt that this ad for the world's largest weapons trade fair is a sharp parody that Amnesty International produced to highlight the UK government's willingness to sell weapons to repressive regimes at the ExCeL Centre of Defence and Security Equipment at parties in London's shipyard area.

With a separate campaign, many posters also appeared on bus stops and subway trains that required more detailed access.
"Important information, Do you travel on the DLR route from September 15 to 18?" together, using the London Underground font and brand, as the DLR track turns into a picture of the tank.
In September, a herd of arms dealers arrive on the DLR route... Customers are asked to help stop the gun fair.
These 300 posters are made by artists whose work was exhibited at the Banks Dismaland Museum of Cruel Designs (Amrance of Cruel Designs).
A collective called Special Patrol Group helped spread posters around London using "Ad Space Hack Packs." We're talking about a sterling pound pack of six-footoxy keys, which the collective says "takes access to a third of the advertising space of the entire planet's bus stops."
Transport for London is not amused by this unauthorized "posteral vandalism."
One of the Parodyings produced by the Special Patrol Group collective.
According to Gavin Grindon, a Cruel Designs curator and University of Essex lecturer, artists increasingly question and want to take political work to audiences outside the galleries.
A lot of artists have started working with activists in resistance splining when they realize they must go to the outside world if they want their art to influence society.

Amnesty's video has been viewed more than 100,000 times via Facebook in the last 24 hours. It was created by free advertising agency VCCP, and also graphic designer and backing accountant worked for free.
VCCP's creative director Matt Leverin found that the gun fair was not advertised at all - and ExCeL's calendar was also a blank point at the time - and thought: "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They toyed with the idea of a more realistic traditional interest in shady corporation, but "was more halting to emphasize the issue with bright colors and animation."
"They have done a fantastic job of helping us raise questions about illegal torture equipment sold at the fair," Amnesty's Tom Davies says.
Now the UK Government must take action to ensure that torture equipment is not sold illegally near our own home.
Perhaps the most creative art related to a gun fair comes from inside ExCeL, as exhibitors pedd up fantastically embellished products.
In a press release, Saab revealed that it received an order from the U.S. military "the AT4CS RS" to launch.
This includes "unique plumbing combat tip, targeting excellent effects behind the armor inside the target."
Whatever it does, it is not pleasant.
Eight golden rules for living in a student dorm
It's been 11 years since Ignorant at 19-year-old I moved to a student dorm. That's when I still believed in the baretics and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the forced smiles of the people I provoked - and numerous, long complaints from others.
A large number of my scholars can be summed up in eight simple rules.
Moving to a dorm can be anything from a nerve to a completely scary one.
It's tempting to babble: tell me where you're from, did you take a gap year and where you thought about Corbyn, and why I don't really love or hate Marmice because it's really just yeast extract HAHA I find in my room'.
Take a breath.
And help others to take a breath - ask questions and show interest.
It guides the conversation and helps you find the people you like, and not those you wouldn't want to talk to even if your eyelashes were on fire and they would share fire extinguishers.
Give people space.
People's rooms often turn into cocktail parties, movie nights grips and high-rise places to spend time, but they are also places where people dress and fix their underwear.
Related: Don't even think about starting a university while in a relationship
University is a tough place for introverts.
Your room should be a resting place, but many dormitories form a culture of hiking from room to room, social and causes lifelong friendships.
It could mean hell to someone trying to rest.
Nothing in this culture gives you permission to say, 'I like you and I want to be friends with you, but you must now exit me to recover the energy I spent when I spent talking to you.
Try to sense when a student friend is tired of socialization - and maybe send a text message to the door instead of knocking.
It's a knocking speech: knocking.
One guy in my student dorm thought if the door wasn't locked, he had been invited in.
He saw some things.
Make friends through baking.
Since you start a university in the cutting season of baking, knocking people to the doors with a chocolate cupboard plate and introducing yourself to some extent seems less strange, less "welcome to the neighborhood, I baked something for you now, smiling when I ask you personal questions" -50s.
Providing self-made treats is a great way to make friends.
Your residential partners feel obliged to talk, and they may be to associate your face with a tasty surprise in the future.
Of course, this depends on whether you can bake.
Poorly mixed flour-sugar-fat blubbers are likely to only make people pretend to sleep while you're knocking.
Theft of food is a common crime in student dormants.
Understandably, taking some chicken is stealing, but what if you just take a drop of milk to your tea?
Ask and check with the milk owner.
It's quite possible they'll give you permission, even if they're boiling internally.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying and you're getting my sympathies - but try to deal with it more adult than my dormmate who mixed detergent into his milk to punish those who stole it.
He's in prison now.
You should not make noise so that people can’t sleep or study.
Not just to be a decent person, but because you're like that proverbal spat reproducing pot.
The girl in my hall asked her neighbour if they could play drum and bass music more quieter because it was three o'clock in the morning and had an exam in the morning.
The answer was to increase the volume.
When they finally fell silent at 5 a.m., the girl kindly let them sleep two hours before putting her own music to rag, locked their doors and went to a three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse happened to move to the same dorm with you?
Or, in reverse, would it not be incredibly awkward if you had a dorm partner as your future spouse, team up together, break up, and then see him every day and possibly lose all your friends together to him.
Of course the heart wants what it wants, but if a hot dorm partner isn't really your future spouse, you could at least try to talk some sense to your lower end.
In that exhilarating moment when you find that someone has left their keys in their unlocked room, the line between pranking and bullying is thinner than it seems.
A good treat is funny, but it's back to cancel in an instant.
You can give a useful and fun lesson on safety by hiding something - but never mess up someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock their doors and drop the keys to a glass of water, which you put in the freezer - but don't attach their property with a blue sticker to the ceiling like no more than twice.
A racist blow to the accommodation of foreign students in Kitee - House planned to be reception centre was smeared in Salo
A racist attack on the lodging of foreign students in Kitee, North Karelia, was hit in the early hours of Saturday.
Contrary to what the police said earlier, this is not accommodation for underage asylum seekers, but sleeping facilities for foreign students who have been in Finland for a long time, says Heidi Luukkainen, teacher at Kitee’s Evangelical Folk High School.
The windows and walls of the accommodation of the folk amplification were smeared with racist signs, such as swastika roads, and a metal object had been thrown through a window of one of the accommodation spaces, according to police in Eastern Finland.
According to Luukkainen, who is responsible for social guarantee education for young people at the Folk High School, there were an estimated ten people in the building under vandalism at the time of the attack.
"It was a weekend and grown people are free to move, some of them may have been elsewhere," Luukkainen says.
People from 12 different nationalities are housed at the People's College.
They are students who have been in Finland for some time and newly arrived minor asylum seekers.
Everyone in a soggy building has a-status.
Some students study at adult primary school, some are in vocational studies and some study Finnish," Luukkainen says.
A-status is a so-called continuous residence permit, which can be granted for a foreigner who has already been in Finland for a period of four years at a time.
Police in Eastern Finland are investigating the attack as an act of damage and a breach of domestic peace.
According to Luukkainen, a news conference was held for students on Monday, with the necessary interpreters also present.
There's no panic here, and no one's wanted to go away.
We have had foreign students for over a dozen years, and this is the first time something like this has happened," Luukkainen says.
According to Luukkainen, the mess has already been cleaned up.
The perpetrators are suspected to have been at least three men and had been travelling in a light passenger car.
I think this is a youth weekend night whim when this topic has been on the surface.
Nothing more serious than that," Luukkainen says.
A hospital has also been snuffed up in Salo, for which a reception centre is planned.
The incident happened last week.
This was reported by MTV on its website on Tuesday evening.
A swastika was drawn to the wall of the hospital and written in English, "You are not welcome."
A criminal complaint has been filed with the police.
Corrected incorrect information about the age and status of people living in the property building.
State to abolish Y-train for Karjaa - passengers in snarling, 'just idiotic'
From Helsinki to Karjaa, a Y-train from Helsinki to Karjaa, ceases to run in March.
News outraged passengers entering the early evening shift of the train at Helsinki Central Station.
The shutdown will particularly hit Siuntios, said Torbjörn Bengtström, who lives in the municipality.
It’s quite idiotic, because the number of inhabitants is growing all the time and working people need a fast and smooth connection to Helsinki.
This can't depend on anything other than political will - or lack of it.
Bengtström says in an interview video by HSTV that he can go to the capital by tractor.
There are also train changes elsewhere in Uusimaa.
The H and R trains on the main line are combined into a new R line.
Purola’s position in Järvenpää and Nuppulinna in Tuusula are excluded.
On Tuesday, the Ministry of Transport and Communications and VR announced information on what routes the Ministry will buy train traffic during the next contract period.
The contract period will change at the turn of the year and there are routes to be closed throughout the country.
The new four-year agreement, to be finalised in autumn, will be approved by the Monetary Affairs Committee.
Bengtström from Siuntio believes that a government train cutter is a short-sighted operation.
We make the same mistakes that have been made before and repeat them in a very systematic way.
Then there's the remorse.
The Y train is also used by non-raaseporians and Siuntio residents, because it is fast and bypasses several stations.
Annina Pöyry from Espoo was annoyed by train by train to travel further away.
"It's specifically miserable for those who have to replan their journey," he said, in pain to the Y train.
A little relief is in store.
A new train connection is likely to be on the shoreline, replacing the Y-train in the Helsinki Region Transport (HSL), i.e. all the way to Kirkkonummi.
This will increase costs for HSL, i.e. in practice to municipalities in the region and their taxpayers.
"We are now looking at different options and their impact on service level and ticket prices," said Suvi Rihtniemi, CEO of HSL.
The cost is still impossible to accurately estimate.
Rihtniemi says that based on the number of passengers, HSL has paid about a million dollars a year for the Y train, of course the Ministry much more than this.
The R line on the main track skips two stations.
In Ainola and Saunakallio, however, the number of train services will double.
A total of 28 small stations and numerous routes will cease in the whole country.
The Ministry will no longer buy train services from routes Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuruu and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Seinäjoki.
The Pieksämäki-Joensuu route is shortened to Pieksämäki-Varkaus.
Train services are reduced on the routes Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karjaa, Kouvola-Kotka harbour and Kajaani-Oulu.
More than half a million journeys are made on discontinued shifts per year, while in total, there are about nine million trips in traffic purchased by the ministry.
The new agreement is to bring annual savings of 12.3 million euros to the state.
The value of the contract is approximately EUR 27.5 million per year.
Sixten Korkman wrote a chapter in the book on the Timeliness of Capital: "Marx should be studied"
The crises in the world economy have brought Karl Marx (1818-1883) and his capital to capital published in 1867-1894, writes Yrjö Hakanen, known as the former chairman of the SVP, in the current topicality of Marx's Capital.
"He will be taken more seriously now than in a long time," Hakanen writes in his foreword.
Marx's estimates of the development of the capitalist economy, internationalisation and penetration more and more widely into all walks of life, the concentration of capital, and the growing role of monetary capital and fictitious capital have proved to be astonishing forward-thinking.
The author list of the book based on the Capital Seminars organised by Hakanen also includes Professor of Economics Sixten Korkman from Aalto University.
In the book, Korkman writes that Marx is timely "now and forever."
I wonder if the former Managing Director of the Research Institute of Economic Research Institute and Business Affairs is not a Marxist?
Oh, not.
On the phone, Korkman says that he does not consider Marx to be a timely economic thinker, but rather an interesting social theorist.
Today, social sciences are segregated and specialized, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitator, and literary connoisseur.
"The usual perception is that the history of ideas tells of the wrong opinions of dead men," Korkman begins.
Marx’s predictions went wrong.
Although Marx understood the nature and significance of the Industrial Revolution, he drew conclusions too far from the early days of capitalism, Korkman ponders.
But Korkman sees value in Marx's radical attitude.
"What's more honest about Marx is that he asked good questions," he says.
We are now discussing Marx’s interests, such as the distribution of wealth.
"Marx can perhaps give inspiration to anyone who wants to understand the big picture of a changing world as a result of technical upheaval," Korkman analyses.
But what the government should decide tomorrow is not helping Marx.
He thought capitalism was a hopeless case that should just be stopped.
Still, in the opinion of Marx, it is worth studying.
"In the 70s, you couldn't read Marx," Korkman says.
"Mascans and Trotskyists and other sects hated capitalism, but even more each other."
Today, the debate is more diverse, and Marx can also be approached without the ideological and political baggage of the past years.
"Any social scientist should get to know Marx's mindset - like other classics," Korkman says.
U.N. calls for war criminals to be sentenced in Sri Lanka
The U.N. is calling for the creation of a special tribunal to investigate war crimes committed in the Sri Lankan civil war, AFP news agency reports.
A U.N. report on the civil war between 1983 and 2009 came out on Wednesday after a long postponement.
The report blames war crimes on both Sri Lankan armed forces and rebels known as Tamil tigers.
At least 100,000 people are estimated to have died in Sri Lanka's civil war.
There is no specific information on the number of victims.
In particular, the major offensive of armed forces in the final months of a long war in 2009 should be properly investigated, a UN report calls for.
The Sri Lankan Armed Forces report accuses of torture, kidnappings and systematic sexual violence, with victims as likely as men as women.
The rebels have been guilty of coercion of bystanders and children to be fighters, according to the report.
Both sides have committed murders, according to the report.
Sri Lanka responded Wednesday that it planned to hold an investigation on its own, but would not allow the creation of a U.N. court because of foreign judges.
English yo exam allowed to weigh social media
The autumn matriculation examinations featured a long foreign language on Wednesday, most of which had English.
More than 16,000 aspirants were tested in English.
In the experiment, you could write a substance on social media.
Based on my own experiences, we had to consider whether social media would make us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, an essay of 150 to 250 words in English could be pointed to an online magazine's counselling column.
The title was Dear Agony Aunt.
Agony Aunt is equivalent to a Finnish Levil's reclining chair.
He asked him for advice on how to get parents to look at things for young people.
In total, there were four subjects to choose one of which was to be selected.
"That was the hardest of them," said Mia Lybeck, English lecturer at Porvoo Swedish-language high school.
The third topic was merely a quote from former European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso.
The fourth topic, Lybeck said, was fine.
There was to write an incendiary talk about why companies should hire young people to work.
"At least at our school we've been rehearsing to write speeches," Lybeck says, assessing the whole test as "pretty normal."
In English - or Swedish - the English test allowed questions to be answered about texts that discussed, for example, the adaptation of summer bricks to climate change and the processing of large masses of information.
On Wednesday, some tall Russian (168 students), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27) were also written.
Autumn articles will continue on Friday, when a second domestic, i.e. Swedish or Finnish, test will take place.
In high schools, the test is held normally, meaning that the protest of wage earners does not affect it.
The Matriculation Examination Board urges the aspirants to find suitable transport connections in time to get to the test event.
You can also get extra time if you can prove that the delay was not due to negligence.
Oulu to rob trade at gunpoint
A shop was robbed in Oulu on Wednesday morning in the Kello district.
Police said the robber was dressed in dark clothing and a face-covering commando beanie.
He is of normal body and about 30 years old.
Police said the man had threatened staff with a handgun and got a small amount of money on the ground.
It is being investigated as aggravated robbery.
Police prepare for the arrival of tens of thousands of protesters in Helsinki - support patrols from elsewhere in Finland
A demonstration against the government's cuts will block the centre of Helsinki on Friday, police predict.
Tens of thousands of people can arrive, according to preliminary information.
Members of the SAK, Akava and STTK unions will meet at Railway Square at 11 a.m.
Police officers are also expected to take part in the protest.
Police officers at work, on the other hand, are responsible for not only carrying out alert tasks and other policing activities, but also to ensure that a giant demonstration is conducted.
Roads leading to the railway market will be closed to motor vehicles between about 9:30 a.m. to 2pm.
Only emergency vehicles will be released into the area.
From the direction of Hakaniemi, traffic is cut at the Kaisaniemi roundabout, from the west direction of Mannerheimintie.
Is the Helsinki Police Department enough enough, Chief Inspector Seppo Kujala?
At least for now, it looks like enough.
I don't take a position on police industrial action.
According to Kujala, support patrols from other parts of Finland are coming to Helsinki due to a demonstration.
The police don't tell me exact patrol numbers.
"There is some coming, but we will be able to cope with our own," Kujala says.
Police are urging to avoid private cars in central Helsinki on Friday.
Kujala estimates that the worst traffic sum ends from Hakaniemi level to the core centre.
Standing traffic is expected from early this morning until early evening.
With the help of protesters from other parts of Finland, there are also many subscription buses to Helsinki.
They will not be allowed to go to Railway Square.
In principle, buses are left quite remote.
The rest of the journey will have to be at the protest site," Kujala says.
The demonstration also halts public transport in Helsinki.
From a police perspective, there is a positive side to this.
The issue of public transport, which is normally at hand at these large gatherings of people, is now partly due to itself.
The organisers of the protest have informed the police that tens of thousands of opponents of the government’s economic policy may come to Helsinki.
Police expect the demonstration to run smoothly.
After all, people are ordinary working or unemployed - ordinary citizens.
Finns are reasonable and peaceful,” Kujala says.
There will also be local demonstrations across Finland on Friday.
In many ways, Friday's demonstration is exceptional - remember these strikes and demonstrations?
The big demonstration organised by trade unions on Friday is interesting and exceptional in many ways.
For example, there is no very good benchmark point in Finnish political history, says Professor Emeritus Martti Siisiainen of Sociology at the University of Jyväskylä.
It is no wonder that the trade union movement protests.
If it didn't, it would put your hands up in front of the government," says Siisteninen.
A very right-wing government has hit the core aspects of the tradition of Finnish corporatism - and also to points that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The government's tough gripes are missing from contract law.
There are a lot of features here to try to get the trade union movement to its knees.
At the same time, the trade union movement has a place to look in the mirror.
A mirror is needed, for example, because the trade union movement has no support from all wage earners to Friday's demonstrations.
What is new now is the sharp division of which the demonstration brings to the crowd that the trade union movement would want to take part in the demonstration.
The unemployed gathered from all over Finland protest at Parliament House in November 1993.
If you are looking for a benchmark for Friday's demonstration, it could be a giant demonstration of the unemployed, a Mortgistan of the Bride in 1993, Siisteninen says.
In the middle of the deepest recession, the Murrostorstai gathered together 20,000 unemployed people.
Esko Aho’s (centre) government stumbles from one labour market crisis to another.
It was said that relations between the Finnish government and wage earner organisations had never been as bad as under the Aho bourgeois government.
Now, relations between the government and the trade union movement are perhaps even worse than in the days of Murrostorsta.
Besides, Finland’s toughest bourgeois government is now in power, Siisteninen says.
The current government coalition is still interesting in such a way that it is so tight-fitting despite what the True Finns say.
There were still certain elements of the old labour movement at the time of the pounding.
Several thousand protesters are expected to attend on Friday.
The demonstration will also stop public transport and potentially close kindergartens as well as schools.
Even if the demonstration does not receive unallocated support from employees, it could become the largest for years.
In recent years, about 300 demonstrations have been held in Helsinki every year.
There are sides of them.
Traditionally, Finnish union demonstrations have been quite peaceful in Finnish trade union movement protests - even though the policies have become tougher in recent years.
Traditionally, a Finnish demonstration avoids conflict, is law-abiding.
Protesters are trying to avoid damaging property or destroying property, Siisteninen says.
But the end of the 1990s brought new winds.
The culture of demonstration changed.
EU membership unnerved farmers to throw eggs and police were prepared to get a pig shit on them.
The firefighters' strike lasted three months in 1998.
There were also spectacular strikes by pilots and air traffic controllers, among others.
Remember these strikes and demonstrations?
Metal and electric strikes of 1970s
The most significant strikes of the 1970s were a metal strike in 1971 and a power plant and electricity strike in 1977.
70,000 metal men were involved in the metalmen's strike.
The strike was suspended by a settlement board proposal after the strike lasted seven weeks.
Metal men received a 16 percent pay rise.
The spring 1977 power strike lasted 49 days and caused power cuts around the country.
Mortgastic Thursday in 1993
On 4 November 1993, about 20 000 people, many people made unemployed by the recession met in front of Parliament House to demonstrate for work.
Firefighters strike for three months in 1998
Firefighters strike was one of the longest of the 1990s, if not the longest national strike.
In 1994 and 1999, farmers opposed to the EU
Police officers were caught in egg rain while farmers protesting against the EU in 1994.
"Siberia teaches, the EU to stop," was one of the slogans.
For Espa, farmers skipped tons of snow.
The EU summit in Helsinki in 1999 also prompted farmers to protest and burn hay bales in front of the meeting venue.
The nurses went on strike in 1983 and 1995
Nurses went on strike for about a month in 1995.
The last time they had been on strike was in 1983.
The 1995 strike was coloured by a few deaths during the strike.
Tehy threatened a strike and mass resignations of nurses in 2007.
The threat of mass resignation finally spurred negotiations to a result.
Doctors striked in 2001
"Doctors on strike - for compulsion," was the slogan of striking doctors in 2001.
The strike by municipal health centre and hospital doctors lasted for five months and prompted a lively debate about how strikes could endanger patient safety.
After the strike, the public sector raised doctors' salaries.
Students on the move in 2013
Approximately 5,000 students march for student financial aid in Helsinki from Senate Square to Parliament House in 2013.
Central Bureau of Investigation investigates backgrounds of Finnish truck full of refugees to Austrian police
Austrian police have asked the Central Bureau of Investigation for help in establishing the backgrounds of a refugee truck registered in Finland.
On Sunday, Austrian police in Aisterheim, near the German border, a truck with 42 refugees on board.
It is not known if the truck may be on its way to Finland.
Those on board the cold truck were in good shape.
We've had an exchange of information with Austrian police.
The investigation and primary responsibility are at the scene of Austria, says Chief Inspector Tero Haapala of the Central Bureau of Investigation.
At the end of August, other refugees travelling with a truck in Austria were more fatal.
At the time, all 71 passengers on board apparently died by suffocation.
According to YLE, which first reported cooperation with the Austrian police, the truck belongs to a Finnish limited liability company.
The company engages in restaurant operations, among other things, and its CEO is a man of foreign origin, aged about 40 years old.
In Austria, two Iraqi men have been arrested for smuggling.
Captain who beats refugees, former drug courier and a superbly businessman - the story of five smugglers
The submerged king of smugglers, a violent boat driver, a style-conscious missionary and a taxi driver who considers himself a good guy.
Such people, for example, engage in human smuggling into the European Union.
Andrea Di Nicola, a criminologist at the University of Trento, and journalist Giampaolo Musumeci have met and interviewed dozens of smugglers and their "customers," and the book Death Travel Agent they wrote will be published in Finnish this week.
In the book, they present tentacles of people smuggling, suggest solutions and introduce smugglers from different levels of business.
HS presents five of them.
I'll kick their minds out of them right away
The Kerkenna islands on the east coast of Tunisia do not attract foreign tourists, but many Tunisians head to summer celebrations.
In terms of location, the islands are also ideal for smuggling, with a trip to the island of Lampedusa, which is part of Italy, only 120 kilometres.
By comparison, the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 kilometres.
There, in the village of El Attaya, Emir lives in a chain of burning captain and father of six.
Kerkenna islands are famous for their shrubbers, but it is more productive for a fisherman to transport people.
Emir has done it with his blue, ten-metre wooden boat already hundreds of times.
If the boat is full of funnel, it can hold 40 people.
For one trip, after expenses, Emir earns about 8,000 euros.
Emir has five deputies looking for clients for him across Tunisia.
Customers arrive from many countries, but during the Arab Spring, a huge number of Tunisians wanted to escape unrest.
After that, things calmed down until it splashed again with the refugee crisis.
Customers arrive from the mainland to the Kerkenna Islands in small groups.
Emir accommodates them in empty houses for as long as he sees fit.
Food is given to just customers to survive.
Accommodation costs around 75 euros a night, and if a customer runs out of money, that's their problem.
We go to the water at midnight with extinguished lanterns.
On the first night, we drive away from the islands, then stop, wait for a day and drive to Lampedusa the following night.
Sometimes seafaring is tough, and in 20-meter-high waves, passengers cry and vomit.
At the destination, a shipment of people has been dismantled in half an hour and Emir goes on a return trip.
Emir wants him to be feared.
That's why he beats his clients and at least claims to beating the scampers to death.
He says in the book that when the police snapped him, he threw all his passengers over the edge of his passengers and told them to swim to the nearest island.
"I grabbed customers one by one by neck and threw them overboard," Emir says in the book.
The most peaceful passengers come from sub-Saharan.
I hear his candidors he's gonna have to abuse this.
I immediately kick their minds out of them.
They need to be shown immediately who is in charge.
Just an ordinary taxi driver
Goran is just an ordinary taxi driver in Bogovasha, Serbia.
His taxi is not very good - the starter engine is pulling its last and anyway it's seen its best days.
But the most important thing for Goran's customers is that taxi moves at all, and that it moves towards the Hungarian border.
Bogovasha is a small village of 500 people about 60 kilometers southwest of Belgrade.
Next to the village is a centre for asylum seekers, where families are mainly allowed.
In the forests around the city centre, men without their families stay in tents, lean-tos and abandoned cars, which now anyone has managed to find or build.
Families in the forest who, for one reason or another, have not filed an asylum application for asylum in Serbia.
Some also stay in private residences, but it's a public secret.
Among the foresters, Goran finds most of his customers.
These are often exhausted - through the Balkans, the route requires a large number of crossovers of borders and weeks of walking trips in difficult terrain, often in mountainous areas and in the dark.
When they eventually arrive in the Bogovasha region, a large hub of human smuggling, people are deathly tired.
Goran's riders are mainly Syrians, Afghans, Pakistanis, Iraqis and Kurds.
The best customers are Syrians, he tells me in the book.
"They say their business once and that's enough," says Goran.
He said Africans are trying to compromise.
That's not what Goran likes.
The battering all the way.
First, the price is agreed to be set at 300 euros, then they count it to 200 and eventually offer 150.
Goran stresses that he is a nice and kind-hearted man.
I don't care about money.
I'm just doing my job and helping people," he says in the book.
Goran says he works at a lower cost than others and charging only 50 euros a person to the Hungarian border.
There are three hundred miles away, most of the comfortably on a high motorway.
I'm told colleagues ask for a three-fold or four-time price.
Goran earns about 50,000 euros a year.
That's not a big deal for a smuggler, but a pretty nice annual income in Serbia.
Serbia has ordered that taxis not be allowed to carry migrants 12 kilometres closer to the Hungarian border.
Goran doesn't care: he knows the roads and the shortcuts and takes his ride-hailing people a mile from the boundary.
Then he shows his clients the right direction and froze away.
At work of mercy
A 35-year-old Congolese man is called Missionary, and it's not just a nickname.
He really has a Protestant church in the Ugandan capital Kampala, where many believers who have fled Congolese, as well as a small center to help Congolese child refugees.
In addition to preaching, the Missionary runs a smuggling business of people moving from Congo to Europe.
He thinks he's working for mercy.
It's important to a missionary to look good.
He polishes his shoes many times a day and makes sure the rubber band of white underwear picks elegantly under the low waist of jeans.
The missionary is proud of his new Mercedes, off-road vehicle and three motorcycles.
When the Missionary does not preach, he will organize people from Congo to Uganda and to Europe.
The customer will initially call one of the Missionary's five phone numbers.
He advises that you should arrive at the border in the morning, hide the money and slip into the peddlers crossing the border.
To get an asylum seeker or refugee status to Ugandan authorities, we must tell Uganda that they come from, for example, North Kivu war zones, and that they have had to flee violence from their home.
Often it is true, but if it is not, the Missionary organizes a new identity for the customer.
Old ID will be destroyed and another will be purchased.
That's what Missionary's contacts are helped by the Ugandan police.
The customer is then directed to the same place where even real asylum seekers go to: asylum-seeking procedure, to NGOs, eventually to the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR).
The missionary knows bureaucracy because he has come to Uganda as a refugee.
He charges for each step separately: it costs around 100 euros to submit an application to the Ugandan police, the handling of documents to a humanitarian organisation about 150 euros, and the migration process to a European country, for example, EUR 4 500-7,000.
Foil and ice cubes
Tom is a fledgling smuggler, a former drug courier.
An Irishman in his 40s is on duty on the French coast of Calais, where his job is to load people into trucks heading to Britain.
He has the help of an Afghan, a French taxi driver based in London, as well as dozens of truck drivers who may not even know they are in a people-enhanced business.
At night, Tom and a taxi driver pick up their customers, usually 2-3 people, somewhere near downtown Calais.
They drive the A26 on the highway and try to avoid a cop.
If a police officer stopped a car on a freeway, Tom and the driver would be sent to direct prison for organising illegal immigration.
Tom doesn't want that, he's been sitting for seven years now because of drugs.
A taxi stops, Tom, with his customers, runs across a motorway to a resting place where drivers sleep before continuing across the Channel to the British.
Tom picks a suitable truck - we have to make sure it's just headed to England and not Holland, say, and cut a protective guard.
You have to do it quietly so that drivers don't wake up.
Sometimes the driver is in the plot, but then it is more expensive.
When the route is clear, Tom wraps his customers in aluminium foil, a similar one wrapped in the kitchen around a roast or oven potato.
It should prevent a police heat scanner from spotting a hideout.
Some people use a sleeping bag filled with ice for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his clients in the truck and leaves the scene hoping the driver won't be stoked by stowashing passengers, at least not until the UK.
The King of Smugglers
Muammer K'k is one of the world's most famous human smugglers.
The embassy Turk has been called a master of marketing and the undisputed king of illegal Mediterranean landings, controlling sea routes from Turkey to EU countries, mainly to Greece and Italy.
K-k has been operating since the 1990s and has continuously developed new smuggling methods.
He also has a competitive advantage over other entrepreneurs: he only just needs the money.
One of the new methods is luxury ship scam: from Turkish ports, fervent spawns are rented to take U.S. or European families for a nice few days of tourist cruises.
In reality, the ships are loaded crowded by Syrians, Iraqis, Kurds and Afghans, who are transported for a fee of between €5,000 and €7,000, first from Istanbul to a port and then by sea to Europe.
Customers are stored in human warehouses, for example in old industrial halls, until it is time to leave.
People are funneled into minibuses and driven somewhere along the coast.
They are told to hide among vegetation and wait for a sign.
When it is given, you have to board quickly.
Passengers must stay hidden all the way under deck.
The Coast Guard can only observe how deep the ship swam, as no other signs of a crowd of people are visible.
Food and drink are given, but the less passengers defecate and vomit, the better.
KH receives about 53,000 euros after expenses for one luxury ship trip.
He doesn't run practical things himself, he hires captains, recruits, guards, hosts and other smaller factors to handle the work for him.
During the summer, there will be at least hundreds of shipments and K’k will make millions.
He is thought to have bought land through undercover companies, a pharmaceutical company and more than a hundred homes he leases.
Muammer K'k was arrested in 2011 at the same time as a Turkish Democratic Party MP and a pharmaceutical entrepreneur.
Since then, apparently he's gone missing.

American Olympic runner in book about his illness and becoming a prostitute
The new book of 1,500-meter runner Suzy Favor Hamilton, who competed three times at the Olympics, has attracted attention in the United States.
In his book Fast Girl, Favor Hamilton talks about ending his career and becoming a prostitute.
Sports Illustrated published fragments of the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton finished his career at the Sydney Olympics.
He came to the Games in top form and ran the second best time in qualifying.
But in the finale, he panicked.
He scrambled to the top at the start and defended his lead with a manic run.
But 150 meters before the finish line, his strength was depleted.
He collapsed to the surface of the track, and the other contestants passed him one after another.
I felt like an idiot and I thought I would never run again.
But I forced myself to cross the finish line," Favor Hamilton tells me in his book.
It was later revealed that Favor Hamilton suffered bipolar disorder.
His brother Dan had committed suicide a year before the Sydney Games, and he himself felt huge pressure of success.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when she became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
The couple had no financial problems, but were intrigued by the idea of making money from having sex with strangers.
She also convinced her husband to accept his actions.
Favor Hamilton's rate was 450 euros an hour.
He says he spent the money on luxury life.
One explanation for Favor Hamilton becoming a prostitute was also that he longed for the same kind of adrenaline spikes he had when competing in athletics.
Favor Hamilton later discovered he was suffering from bipolar disorder.
The former star runner's twin life came to light in late 2012 when a publication about him by the magazine Smoking Gun.
Favor-Hamilton participated in the Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney Olympics.
In 2000, he was world number one in the 1500 metres with 3:57.40, but was last in the Sydney Olympic final.
World champion rejoiced when union clutched Norway's ski rooster: 'straight backs'
Norwegian ski king Petter Northug has exceeded the limits of appropriateness in the opinion of at least one of his colleagues.
Northug and the Norwegian Ski Federation have skewed an athlete contract throughout the summer and autumn last year.
Although the federation has offered Northug a better deal than other athletes, even that has not been good enough for a multiple world champion and Olympic champion.
Following the deal dispute, the Norwegian Ski Federation decided to exclude Northug from the upcoming season's World Cup.
The decision was praised by two-time world champion Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was happy that the union was cracking down on a skiing rooster.
"Thank you for pointing the backbone," Jacobsen wrote on his Facebook profile.
"We cannot allow one active athlete to avoid working for a union sponsor," he continued.
The dispute between the Norwegian Ski Federation and Northug is about money.
Northug would apparently like to be part of the season of a national team to promote his own sponsorship.
Jacobsen said he was delighted to represent an alliance that also looks after future generations, and does not give one athlete solo.
At the same time, he reminded us that the union has given Northug economic as well as other privileges for several years.
I know that because I've been part of the system.
Jacobseb doesn't accept that one athlete has completely different rules than just because he's the best.
Northug released his own press release on Tuesday in which he asserted that he wanted to play sports in Norwegian colours next season at the World Cup as well as after at the World Cup and the Olympics.
Astrid Jacobsen won six World Championship medals in all, including two golds.
He was part of a team that won relay gold in Falun last winter.
Frying Translators Shield Day is also celebrated in Ostrobothnia
On Kilpi Day 25.9. there will be an antics in various restaurants and shops that have been granted a shield of frying translators.
The aim of the day is to highlight Finland’s high-quality food industry expertise and lower the threshold for leaving to a restaurant and to raise awareness of the importance of shield as part of high quality.
At the same time, we want to remind you that not all high-quality restaurants have focused on the Helsinki metropolitan area, but top restaurants that have been inspected and classified by an impartial operator can be found all over Finland.
The international attention received by the event is a testament to the significance of the event as part of increasing the awareness of shield restaurants and the organization.
In Ostrobothnia, the day will be held in Vaasa at Restaurant Fondisis and Kantarellis.
In Kokkola, a restaurant in Old Town participates in the shield day.
The event has also received significant international attention.
The decision has been made to make the event one of the organization’s most significant international events organised on the same day across the world.
Finland will remain host of the event.
Kauhajoki magazine: The Chancellor of Justice about the establishment of Kauhava reception centre
The Finnish Immigration Service and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are co-founding a refugee reception centre at the Kauhava Ex-garment premises currently owned by LSK Business Park Ltd.
According to the complaint, the area is still permanently located in crisis-time critical infrastructure, which is used by the Defence Forces and its partner, Suomen Isollisverkot Oy.
Kauhajoki magazine reports that, according to a private individual, placing a reception centre in the same building package would pose a significant safety risk, which has not been taken into account in the preparation of the matter.
According to the complainant, the Defence Forces may have interests related to the area of the former Air Training School and the airport, the impact of which has not also been investigated in the preparation of the reception centre.
The case states that for the past two years, negotiations have taken place for Kauhava Airport on the organisation of flight training and the arrival of a potential foreign operator to the airport.
The matter has been discussed with, for example, Minister of Defence Jussi Niinistö (ps.) and Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Defence Arto Räty.
An individual tells the attorney general that the complaint is not about opposition to the reception centre in principle, but to the wrong planned place in the former garrison area.
The city government of Kauhava discussed the reception centre issue last Monday.
Syria’s situation is reflected in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region
Management means that the immigrants and those here have the necessary conditions, Niinistö commented to journalists at the evening after meeting with the chairmen of all parliamentary parties at his official residence in Mäntyniemi.
The president said concerns about managing the refugee situation united all participants.
He considers it valuable that government and opposition parties in Finland are able to discuss fundamental issues confidentially.
Especially in times when we face great challenges
According to Niinistö, the situation in Syria and Russia and the United States in the region may also have an impact on the situation of Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region.
He is hopeful of the development of dialogue.
If this situation develops in a positive direction, i.e. the United States and Russia will be able to, it will have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and the further tension towards the situation in the Baltic Sea.
The NATO issue was also discussed.
The president did not take a position on the labour market situation.
Finnair cancels 16 domestic flights on Friday, Alkot closed for a couple of hours
One flight will be cancelled on Thursday and 15 on Friday.
The list of cancelled flights can be found on Finnair’s website.
Finavia says that the operations of airports are handled by supervisors during the work stoppage.
However, congestion and delays are expected at security checks and other service points.
Demonstration closes Helsinki city centre streets
A protest on Friday will close streets in central Helsinki.
Police say the streets leading to Railway Square will be closed to cars from around 9:30 a.m. to 2 p.m.
Cars will not be allowed from the direction of Mannerheimintie to Kaivokatu, Postikatu or Töölönlahdenkatu in the direction of the railway station.
From the direction of Hakaniemi from Unioninkatu, traffic is directed to Unioninkatu at the Kaisaniemi roundabout.
Police said the shutdown period depends on the crowd involved in the protest.
Only emergency vehicles are allowed into the area.
Metro and tram drivers throughout Friday's demonstration
Metro and tram drivers will take part in Friday's demonstration from the beginning of morning traffic to the end of night traffic.
The Association of Tram and Metro personnel told STT in the evening.
The vast majority of Beginnings close for two hours, including posts closed
Friday's demonstration will also cause disruption to Postal services.
Significant delays are expected, including the delivery of day mail.
Most of the postal service points are closed.
The Finnish Red Cross’s blood transports are handled despite a strike.
We also aim to treat meal deliveries, hospital shipments and laboratory samples.
Situational information about services is available on Posti’s website.
Most of Finland’s Alkos will close their doors for two hours on Friday.
Pam, a service sector trade union, has instructed its employees to suspend work between 11am and 3pm.
Pam has also urged grocery trade workers to participate in a professional protest.
Representatives of SOK and Kesko tell Helsingin Sanomat that the companies will be kept open by supervisors if necessary.
According to Kesko, there are no reports of possible closures of individual transactions.
Helsinki kindergartens partially closed
Helsinki day care centres will not operate in full terms on Friday, informs the Helsinki Agency for Early Childhood Education.
Due to the demonstration of trade unions, day care may be concentrated in certain kindergartens, and club activities in kindergartens and playgrounds are not organised.
24-hour day care centres and groups of mentally disabled and multi-disabled children remain open.
In addition, afternoon activities for mentally disabled and autistic schoolchildren will be held as normal.
The Early Childhood Education Agency promises to provide more information about changes to operations tomorrow.
Media researcher: Sipilä takes a big risk
According to Sipilä, communication requires diverse channels, and the Prime Minister’s television and radio speeches are one channel among others.
Such a direct speech channel will also be needed in the future.
This will not be the last time, Sipilä told reporters in Parliament.
Sipilä did not yet want to assess how often the often repeated way of television and radio talk by the Prime Minister will be.
According to Sipilä, speeches may not always be conveyed by Yle’s channels in the future.
If other channels sign up as a channel, we will see.
This evening, we are using this channel, Sipilä said.
According to Sipilä, the state of the Finnish economy is so serious that it requires that television and radio speech be given to citizens.
This whole of things, which is now being talked about, is quite complicated and requires a longer justification.
That's why we ended up in this channel, Sipilä explained.
The speech will be posted at 9:05 p.m. on both TV1 and Radio Finland.
You can also watch it at Yle Areena.
Sipila takes a big risk
A media researcher hopes Sipilä's television speech will not indicate a more general government inward turn.
Is it possible to take the right to define public debate more rigorously into our own hands and to refuse to set questions in public debate?
I recall Foreign Minister (Timo) Soini’s recent comment that he does not follow the media agenda and does not allow it to define itself.
In the interests of democratic debate and publicity, I hope these things are not related.
Koivunen understands that commercial media is indignant about Sipilä’s announcement.
It would be strange if the media field didn't react.
Policymakers' communication styles are not announcements in a democracy.
By definition, it is the responsibility of media representatives to try not to take issue of politicians' agendas.
According to Koivunen, television speech is a big risk to Sipilä.
In his speech, Sipilä should bring something new and special to the table in order to meet the exceptionally high expectations set for speech.
Is there more available today what we've already heard?
Or can he speak in a different tone, in a different way or in different words, or say something new?
Koivunen says that if there is only more old things to do, you have to wonder why such a big gesture was made and Yle gave it an extraordinary time.
Yle is taking a risk in this way, if it is not a special situation, but a routine speech among others.
There is a danger that Yle will be labelled a message of politicians or Parliament and the government, which is certainly not in line with Yle’s interests or general policies.
A clever bet from a sipper
What is also important in Sipilä’s upcoming speech is what the Prime Minister fails to say, the media researcher emphasises.
In the evening, we must look carefully at what Sipilä is missing and where it is not, says Heikki Kuutti, Research Coordinator at the University of Jyväskylä.
According to Kuuti, TV talk is a clever bet from Sipilä, because this will allow him to express its own views without gravel sounds.
This will give the message to a large audience without a journalistic filter, unlike a news conference where journalists can ask critical questions.
He bypasses the media and speaks directly to the people.
However, there is a danger that the media will misinterpret something from the speech because specific questions cannot be asked.
According to Kuuti, it is very important how Sipilä appears on TV - whether sweat is spilling, trembling with his hands.
He compares Sipilä to a father figure who now tells the people what to do.
If Sipilä can do his business well, it can work.
The situation is different from the case if the government would inform about something, because here, as it were, people speak directly to another person.
This is what (U.S. President Barack) Obama and partners do this regularly.
Really extraordinary
Political scientist Erkka Railo considers the Prime Minister’s speech to citizens to be truly exceptional.
He said there hasn't happened in decades that the Prime Minister speaks directly to the people.
An exceptional time requires extraordinary measures, Railo says.
The researcher thinks the Prime Minister wants to make Finns sympathetic to the blackmail ahead.
Employees' organisations on Friday are holding a demonstration and strikes against government action.
Paavo Arhinmäki, President of the Left Alliance, says on Twitter that Sipilä could give his speech on the state of the nation in Parliament as a Prime Minister’s announcement, which would also be able to discuss the speech.
SDP Chairman Antti Rinne (Sd.) says that he challenges Sipilä’s dialogue.
There is no time for monologues.
Six months after the election.
You can't hide to endless," Rinne wrote on Twitter.
9-year-old boy on a run has been found in Tampere
The boy was fine at the time of discovery.
THE POM HAVE TO THE ONES AND IN THE HUNBLE, the boy's father updated his Facebook page.
The Inner Finland Police Department also confirms this to Iltalehti.
The boy went out playing outside around 4 p.m.
Later in the evening, there was no further contact with him.
My father thanks all the people who helped in the search.
Thank you for the dozens of contacts and observations during these hours.
The update was shared closer to 15,000 times, which is an incredible balance in such a short time
Finnish UFC star disappointed by young people's violent craze: You're creating hate
Macwan Amirkhani, a MMA fighter of a Kurdita background, posted a video on Facebook, appealing especially to young people with an immigrant background.
Makwan Amirkhani gave a heavy speech against youth street brawls.
Amirkhani, who was born in Iran and arrived in Finland with his family at the age of five, has won both of his professional fights in mixed martial arts in the most prestigious UFC series.
Amirkhani says he received a message asking to watch an Instagram account.
Videos have been uploaded to the account of young people fighting with extremely violent gripes.
Amirkhani says he is disappointed by the craze of young people.
26-year-old Amirkhan has more than 62,000 followers on Facebook.
Guys kick those in the country, sit on someone else and bat me in a flashlessly without thinking about the consequences of this, when you make such videos, Amirkhani updates.
Hard to defend anymore
Some of the young people seen in the videos are from immigrant backgrounds.
According to Jarmo Heinonen, Inspector of the Helsinki Police, fight videos on social media have been uploaded by both immigrants and native Finns.
It's just that you're fighting in the street.
You make life more difficult for so many other immigrants here in Finland,” Amirkhani from Turku reminds us.
Amirkhani points out that there are sites in Finland that are looking for crimes committed by immigrants.
There have been a very few serious incidents of these individual cases.
A little difficult, boys, to excuse you again.
You should remember that you are still in a foreign country and will be a long time of strangers here.
That's a little different way to say thank you for being here," Amirkhani says.
Amirkhani urges young people to remember loved ones.
If they ever get to be subject to racism, you will be blamed on yourself.
Think a few times before you get involved in one of those guys.
Amirkhani says violent action is putting a stake in racism.
You create hate in me that I don’t like.
You have things pretty bad anyway and you don't cure them at all.
SAK pledges its position on a savings package - Lyly: decisions on Monday
Lauri Lyly, President of SAK, says on Twitter that the wage earner’s organisation will consider its position on an alternative savings list presented by STTK on Monday.
Lauri Lyly commented on STTK’s proposal on Twitter.
Earlier on Wednesday, STTK announced that it would present to the Government its own proposal to achieve the five per cent productivity leap required by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre).
Sture Fjäder, Chairman of Akava, believes that the Board of Directors will approve the proposal if SAK, STTK and Akava are all behind the proposal.
However, it would require the largest wage earner organisation SAK to soften its previous position.
Lauri Lyly, the chairman of SAK, said in a terse manner on Twitter.
Lyly writes that the SAK bureau will discuss the matter on Monday.
According to Lyly, SAK is looking for solutions to "opening a labour market lock," and that agreements made by active parties are needed instead of coercive laws.
Lyly points out that Prime Minister Sipilä’s government’s proposal for a social agreement was not acceptable to SAK.
In the past, Sipilä broke off negotiations on a social contract when SAK refused to commit to the goal of a 5% productivity leap.
Commentary: A grand demonstration threatens to slam - "It feels like a bit of a funny kissing a fist"
It feels a bit funny to shake your fist if you already have a settlement paper in your pocket, writes Pekka Tiinanen.
The mood varies from side to the wage earner camp.
Is it to call on the government to overturn it or to agree with it?
On Monday, SAK's federal leaders were bursting with holy hatred of the republic's government.
The whole of Finland was threatened to close.
The expoal spread to the Akava people.
OAJ, a trade association of teachers, threatened to close schools and kindergartens.
On Tuesday, OAJ canceled: no school or kindergarten will be completely closed.
On Wednesday, Antti Palola (sd), Chairman of STTK, performed conciliatoryly.
He said he had contacted the government and draft an alternative proposal demanded by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre) to be a 5% productivity leap.
Akava's chairman, Sture Fjäder (kok), immediately rushed to announce that his settlement paper is already ready.
There was no going to SAK's office at first.
Chairman Lauri Lylyn (sd) is difficult to reconcile when union leaders just told me to stand on Friday.
In the end, however, Lyly announced that the SAK bureau will meet next Monday to discuss the situation and that SAK would seek solutions to "opening the labour market lock."
In order for the joint proposal of wage earners to be created, SAK should yield to accept a five per cent productivity leap target.
No wonder Palola’s STTK has relations with Sipilä’s Board of Directors.
The right hand of Palola, STTK’s head of social influence Jukka Ihanus, previously served as special assistant to the centrist Prime Ministers Matti Vanhanen and Mari Kiviniemi.
Palola described the government’s core trade union expertise.
Coincidence or not, Palola’s exit took a bit of a boost from Finland’s stoppers, with AKT’s Marko Piirainen (sd) as a frontrunner.
It feels a bit funny to kiss a fist if you already have a settlement paper in your pocket.
Edited at 6 p.m.: Added information about Lyly's comments.
Russia calls Finland a bad host: 'This must not happen again'
Sergei Naryshkin, speaker of the Russian Duma, criticised the OSCE meeting in Helsinki.
Sergei Naryshkin, the speaker of the Russian Duma, believes that Mongolia is a better OSCE host than Finland.
In the Mongolian capital Ulan Bator, an autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly has begun, in which Naryshkin made extensive comments about a July celebration meeting in Helsinki.
At the time, Finland would not allow the arrival of Russian politicians on the European Union's sanctions list, such as Naryshkin, to a meeting - an issue for which the Speaker was able to remind journalists.
We estimate that it was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and the principles of open dialogue.
This must not happen again, Naryshkin stressed, according to Interfax news agency.
In addition to Finland and the EU, Naryshkin's criticism focused on the United States, where his access was also blocked.
Sanctions are a political suicide from the EU, Naryshkin declared.
In Mongolia, the Russian delegation got to uncomplicated, Naryshkin continued to spike Finland by praising and thanking Mongolia for "excellent organization."
I am sure that the Parliamentary Assembly will proceed constructively and with positive results - unlike a meeting held in Helsinki in July.
The Mongolian leadership understands that parliamentary dialogue is not supposed to have barriers.
Naryshkin has met Ilkka Kanerva (Kok), who is leading the meeting at Ulan Bator, who has already spoken to the Russian delegation, according to Russian media.
Lock meets real playoff troll: 'Goals tight'
Tappara and Lock will continue to spend bullish days in Hakametsä today, when both are on fire on a second consecutive day.
Janne Lahti anticipates that today in Hakametsä we will not see actual goal celebrations.
Tappara went to Kuopio yesterday to win a 3-2 overtime win over KalPa.
The rise was manly, with last season's silver group at its worst from a two-goal losing position.
The lock's Tuesday was more minor-winning.
The Blues, who started their catch in tangled, were a member of a round zero point, and the loss figures of 2-3.
A tough game, goals tight, if any play like last year, lock-attagger Janne Lahti foresights on the club's website.
Tappara has become quite a playoff nightmare for Raumans.
In the previous two seasons, Tappara has just dropped from the lock final series in the semifinals.
For both times, a crucial seventh match has been required to resolve.
Last season, Lock took the series to a break in the fourth game, but Tappara got up to the next three alongside and over.
There are no major changes in the group formations, except for goalkeepers.
The cashiers who rejected both yesterday will get a flurry shift today.
With Tappara's goal, Mika Noronen makes room for Tomi Karhunen, and between Lock poles, Rasmus Rinne replaces Ryan Zapolski.
Viewpoint: A terrible play going on in an ace
Sports Director Toivola wrote an inappropriate sequel to head coach Rautakallio, writes Santtu Silvennoinen from Tampere.
It's a classic.
In 1976, Sylvester Stallone wrote the film Rocky, in which he himself played the lead role.
The underdog sensationally put up a clash at heavyweight world champion Apollo Creed.
Rocky had great sympathy, despite eventually losing a title fight.
Thirty years after Rocky’s premiere, Mika Toivola wrote a troublesome Cinderella story in Pori.
To the surprise of everyone, the anonymous and wood-armed patata progressed to the SM-finals in 2006.
The team was full of anonymous but resilient underdogs like Rocky.
There was White Indian, Porin Matti and Pele Pelto.
In the playoffs, players dyed their heads red and cut the Iroquois.
Toivola became a blonde.
JP Jalo, a great TV commentator, called the coach Neumann.
Aces took the winning silver.
Toivola was one of the heroes.
Screenwriter Toivola believes that this season’s novelty works in the same way as it did ten years ago.
A man working as a sporting director at Aces has built a bang on the wrong boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have been smashing guys in a rink like Rocky pig carcasses at a slaughterhouse.
The merits of Masi Marjamäki, Mikko Viitanen, Juha Kiilholma and Matti Kuparinen are in something other than puckish play.
Toivola has forgotten that Pekka Rautakallio plays the lead in Rocky VI.
Karri Kivi has crossed Iron Rock Sean Connerone.
In the filming of Toivola, the Iron Rocky is a leading performer as Connery would have been in the original work of 1976.
There's no Rocky to Iron Rocko but a nickname.
The game philosophy of Iron Rock is not a stampede of rushing and small pieces of gum.
He appreciates a tough game, but there's a difference between playing hard than a pig.
Last season, Aces Garret Stafford tackled Tappara's Jere Karelian to the head.
He got two to eight to 10 minutes from the judges, but Rautakallio put the man in the shower.
He didn't deserve a minute!
We only play for those who deserve to.
I don't approve of a game like that and it's not part of ace puck," a hot-run Rautakallio snapped to the Satakunta People after the game.
The Aces' team this season is strangely built.
There are trains, veterans, policemen and impounders.
There are practically no key men in the best playing age.
No wonder the head coach has complained of a lack of skill.
How much have you been able to influence player acquisitions, Pekka Rautakallio?
Events last season affect procurement and unfortunately the situation in the market was quite limited, Rautakallio replied diplomatically.
Under the surface smoldering.
The 1953 Rautakallio is known to be interested in moving to Toivola’s place as a sports boss.
Men's contracts expire in the spring.
The Aces' balance in three league games of the season is as many losses with a goal difference of 1-6.
Toivola shouldn't have written a sequel to the sequel.
Olga Temonen plays Sipe Santapuki's mother
Olga Temonen reveals that if she had met her husband Tuuka when she was a teenager, they would have had nothing in common.
Olga Temonen acts under the guidance of her husband for the first time.
Yes, I play my husband’s mother in the movie.
In a way, it seems crazy," laughs actor and producer Olga Temonen.
He has been married to Apulanna’s ex-bassist and director Tuukka Temonen since 2008.
The couple have worked together a lot in the past, but now Olga is acting under Tuukka's guidance for the first time.
Olga's role in Apulanna's film You Made Beauty about the early years is drummer Sipe Santapukki's mother Cricket.
Cricket cheers and supports his son, even though his father, Risto (played by Lorenz Backmann), tries to be the voice of reason.
The more I've gotten to know my real role model, the easier it seems to be to play the role.
He's a great guy and I'm grateful to Tuukka for trusting me a role.
Olga had already met Cricket before the film project, but since then the two have grown much closer.
They met, spoken on the phone and messaging.
The cricket has helped a lot.
We've been through a lot of different angles to their history.
Luckily, Cricket also understands that drama is drama and truth to be coloured a little.
Olga emphasizes that Sirkka was almost the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that Apulanna would be Finland’s largest band.
In the 90s, there was a recession and a very dreary one.
There was a pretty low probability of someone actually succeeding, but Cricka had some intuition, and he was right.
Olga says she had heard a lot about Tuuka about his youth even before film plans.
But the stories of parents have been a bit different sometimes.
Yeah, if you're a 15-year-old teenager, how much parents really know, what you're up to.
Olga reveals that her own youth was completely different from Tuuka, known as Heinola’s notorious sketch story.
Olga was a daily life and a good girl who had nothing to do with the movie Tuuka.
At most, he could have secretly fallen for him.
According to Olga, he has collaborated with Tuukka so many years that a big joint project is not scary.
It's always been super-high.
Now the entire production team is going to filming in Heinola for a month.
A couple living in Iit often drive home for their young children because of their young children are not too long.
We'll take over Heinola for a month.
They have received us very warmly, just asking what streets and when to empty.
Iron Sky 2 becomes Finland's most expensive play film
Iron Sky: The Coming Race, directed by Timo Vuorensola, has a budget of 17 million euros.
Filming begins in Belgium in October.
Director Timo Vuorensola will shoot Iron Sky 2 in October in Belgium.
Iron Sky: The Coming Race, the sequel to the science fiction film Iron Sky, becomes Finland's most expensive play film ever with a budget of €17 million.
In the past, the title of Finland’s most expensive film has been Jalmari Helander’s Big Game.
The Angry Birds animation, which is currently under review, will also surpass Iron Sky 2, with a budget of more than 100 million euros.
Filming of the film, directed by Timo Vuorensola and produced by Tero Kaukomaa, will begin in October at AED Studios in Antwerp and last for eight weeks.
Director Timo Vuorensola will go to Belgium next week.
Giant budget is not scary.
I've been sickly relaxed!
I have such a relaxed feeling about the script because I know exactly what a movie should be like.
Everyone in the task force seems to realize something unprecedented is being done.
It's great to go to Belgium.
Even though time is tight, there is no fear of a bullshit.
I’m more excited, and I can’t wait to show this movie to the audience,” he told Iltalehti.
Originally, the film's budget was set to be between 8 million and 10 million, but as the script evolved, the budget also increased.
It's a big budget, but there's a big stoir.
But you could tuck 100 million into the film because every angle of view and effects is so expensive.
Now everything has been twisted so tight that there is no looseness.
Iron Sky Universe, the film's production company, launched a crowdfunding campaign and a bond today on Wednesday to pay an annual interest rate of 4 to 8 percent.
The final rate will be determined by supply and demand during the campaign.
After two years at least, the company will repay the loan.
The action film stars Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov, among others.
A hillbilly or a cool?
Big logos return to shirts
Trendsettes have recently been decorated with big logos.
Until recently, a fashion-conscious dresser avoided clear and big logos like Crocs.
Advertising the brand of a hoodie or a T-shirt was seen as a pretty hillbilly hillbilly.
But times change.
Sporting has become a real fashion megatrend, and so have old, familiar sport fashion brands such as Adidas and Nike have risen to a wave of coolness.
And as so often before, the line between a funny and trendy one is fickle: if something is already a very hillbilly hillbilly, it starts to turn ironic and cool.
First came the norm core trend, i.e. the tasting fashion, in which trendsetters surprised by favouring basic clothes as possible, as if as a way to differentiate themselves from the mass.
Now, instead of a grey basic college, we put on top of the pint that already buried the sweatshirt at the bottom of the cupboard, with the manufacturer's logo in front of it.
The bigger and more traditional, the better.
In addition to logos, Adidas' recognisable tracksuits, favourite team jerseys and New York Yankees caps have also made a return to street fashion.
In fact, the Calvin Klein logos of underpinnings starting to glimpse the edge of jeans are now a cool detail.
The trend seems to be moving from sportycracks to luxury brands, too.
Versace's gracious bushes, for example, makes it clear what branded clothing is all about.
Would you be willing to show off logos in your dress?
Russian politician releases evidence: I wasn't stuck in a tank hatch for hours!
According to claims, a peculiar incident would have taken place in Nizhni Tagil, where Russia Arms Expo, which presents products for Russian military industry, was held in 2015.
In recent days, colourful claims have spread in Russian media that Russia's emergency ministry was forced to dislodge large-sized Zotovia from a tank hatch for five hours.
Zotov has since done everything to deny the information.
He even posted a photo on his own public Facebook page showing him peeking from the armored vehicle hatch in a very good mood and, at least not based on those pictures, it's about getting stuck or angry.
Total nonsense.
Let's start with not getting inside a battle tank, it was an assault tank BMP-3.
I'm a former soldier, Lieutenant Colonel, I've served in the Urals.
I went in there, looked around and came out in peace," Zotov told Komosomolskaya Pravda.
I didn't get stuck and I certainly didn't spend five hours in that position," he said.
For the Russian army TV channel, Zotov explained that he admired Russia's new technology in the exhibition because he is a former professional soldier himself.
That's why I was interested in what's inside the carriages, I admired our technology.
And I came out through a trunk, he said.
I went to all tanks.
And in the next show, I will definitely visit all tanks and all assault tanks," Zotov promised.
Zotov also called a journalist writing about it a fool.
One fool wrote and everyone else repeated.
There was nothing like that.
I went inside and came out.
I'm tall and ratty, but anything like I was stuck in a tank somewhere, didn't happen," he told Russkaya sluzhba novostei radio.
Zotov's words are supported by the fact that no photograph of alleged drudgery has been published, even though a total of 50,000 people attended the weapons exhibition over a few days.
The claim of the drushing of Zotov originally started with a case of Bloknot.ru, in which Zotov was told to struggled to get out of a tank hatch while trying and ultimately threatened to shoot everyone around him, unless he got out of his back.
Later, the Bloknot website published a follow-up story in which the organisers of the exhibition shared their views on what had happened.
Everyone is just used to soldiers jumping out of armoured vehicles.
But MP Zotov, due to his big size, simply lingered when he came out.
But by no means he sat there for five hours," said the exhibition coordinator Aleksandr Pisarevsky to Bloknot.
Here's a favorite item for interior bloggers
The 1962 Lassen Candela fad looks like it was designed today by the architect Mogenes (1901-87) and Flemming (1902-84).

A leak has occurred at the Kittilän mine of Canadian-owned mining company Agnico Eagle Finland.
The Gold Mine's purified process water has leaked from the so-called tailings sink into a ditch.
The company said measures to remedy the leak have been initiated.
The pool has neutralized tailings and purified process water from the foaming process process.
Usually, water is either pumped to be used again as process water or discharged into the environment through a surface drainage field according to the permit.
The leak was estimated to be about 300 cubic metres per hour when detected.
The company said leakage water quality meets current permit conditions.
No other material spilled into the environment.
The leak was detected during a round of inspections Monday morning.
No structural damage to pool dam structures has been found to have been caused by the leakage.
The company says it is working closely with authorities to monitor and remedy the situation.
The mine employs about six hundred permanent workers.
Dansken Kuoppamäki: IMF warns against cutting too much
The Finnish country report published today by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) largely follows the views of the Government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organisation urged structural reforms covering Finland to cope with economic problems.
According to the IMF, reducing overtime payoffs would support Finland’s competitiveness.
Reforms would be needed for the entire treaty system and unemployment security.
According to Pasi Kuoppamäki, Chief Economist at Danske Bank, there is agreement on structural reforms, but there are also small differences.
There is a lot of message to the government's actions in the IMF's assessment, but on the other hand, there are also warning words about what shouldn't be cut too much.
These include infrastructure investments, for example, Kuoppamäki says to Taloussanomat.
In the IMF's view, growth projects should also be implemented as quickly as possible to support weak economic growth.
The IMF anticipates economic growth of 0.4 per cent for Finland this year, which will accelerate to 0.9% next year.
In his new cyclical forecast today, Danske anticipates that growth will remain at zero this year.
The IMF is a little more optimistic about this year.
They may have been based on the latest findings.
This morning, Statistics Finland reported that total output was growing slightly in the summer, Kuoppamäki says.
Less attention may be paid to weakened industry confidence or other so-called softer indicators.
But the differences are only a few percent decimals.
Nintendo, recovering from death, appoints new director
Tatsumi Kimishima, who died under Satoru Iwata, who died of cancer in July, will start working on Wednesday, Nintendo said Monday.
Iwata led Nintendo since 2002 and was a popular and charismatic face in the gaming industry.
Iwata, for example, was responsible for launching a successful Wii console.
The choice of 65-year-old Kimishima is no great surprise.
He was one of those names raised as potential followers of Iwata.
Kimishima is a safe choice to track Iwata's footprints, reckons Hideki Yasuda, an analyst at Ace Research, to Reuters.
Kimishima is seen as taking Nintendo heavily into mobile games, but so that it doesn't eat the company's bread on the traditional game consoles side.
More and more minor asylum seekers arrive in Finland alone
In February 2015, the Swedish Immigration Service acknowledged that hundreds of children who have entered the country were lost every year.
The issue has been reported by SVT.se and Dagens Nyheter on their website, according to the Swedish Immigration Service, hundreds of minor applicants disappear in the country every year.
Juha Kannelmaa, Senior Inspector of the Finnish Immigration Service, explains what the situation is in Finland and how it has changed.
Is it the same in Finland?
How many asylum applications of a total of 156 minors were made in Finland in 2013?-
They disappeared 9.
In 2014, 196 similar applications were made and 11 of them disappeared, Kannelmaa says.
The reason for the disappearance may be that the case is dealt with by the fact that the applicant has already been registered in another country applying the Dublin Regulation and may have been found to be of legal age there.
In this case, the applicant may be more attractive to disappear than continuing to process the case in Finland and to be returned to the country responsible for examining the application.
Similarly, some of the missing people will also be found later when they apply for asylum in another member state.
In 2014, there were a total of 3651 asylum seekers in Finland, of whom 134 were made to the applications, because the applicant had probably moved out of Finland, so 123 adult asylum seekers disappeared during the past year, he says.
Is the number increasing?
By 6 September this year, we have received a total of 586 asylum applications from a total of 586 minors who have arrived alone.
There are no overall statistics on missing underage asylum seekers this year, but the number of underage applicants is therefore known and has increased markedly, which is also likely to affect the number of missing persons, he stresses.
What about those who have received a conversion decision?
Are they also disappearing into a "dark labour market"?
This is difficult to assess from the Finnish Immigration Service, as the police are responsible for implementing decisions for desembies, Kannelmaa emphasises.
Interior Minister Petteri Orpo (Kok) has been concerned about the growing number of unregistered immigrants.
He has taken action on this.
Orpo, who was considering refugee issues at the EU Interior Minister’s meeting, told on Monday about practical measures to bring the flow of asylum seekers to northern Finland under control.
Nina Mikkonen sells Timo T.A.'s studio online - see pictures of equipment
Timo T.A., a pioneer in the media sector who lost his ability to work due to illness. Mikkonen’s equipment for TV and radio productions is now on sale.
Mikkonen’s spouse Nina Mikkonen sold devices on Huuto.net, which were once the most advanced professional tools in their field.
The online announcement was first reported by an online newspaper Iltamacaine.
Today, much of the equipment has been overtaken by technological development.
In the digital media world, television shows are no longer filming on Betacam tapes.
Nina Mikkonen is confident that there will be interested.
Of course, the equipment is no longer up-to-date, but these are also needed as long as there is an old generation of material that must be digitized.
On the other hand, there are also a lot of enthusiasts - collectors and building up your own studio, Nina Mikkonen ponders to IS.
The reason for the sale is that Mikkonens is trying to move out of their current Myrskylän home.
There's no way we can take all the amount of goods with us.
I have slowly begun to take inspiration and see what items are being disposed of.
I started from here, Nina Mikkonen says.
There is no longer any use for TV and radio equipment.
It is clear from recent strokes that a man with a long career will not return to working life.
Nina Mikkonen points out that only goods and equipment are sold.
Timo T.A. Mikkonen’s actual life’s work was archived already in the summer to the National Audiovisual Institute, whose representatives visited box stores of films and other material from Myrskylä.
Traffic threatens to be porridgeed worse than thought: Metro and trams could stop throughout Friday
Drivers of the metro and trams will decide today whether to extend force in relation to Friday's demonstration.
The original plan was to stop metro and tram traffic only for the duration of a protest on Friday.
In the afternoon, we will decide whether traffic stops throughout the day.
Pekka Hirvonen, chief steward, says the swagger is great on the pitch.
The cuts in night and shift supplements are badly stinging drivers, so government plans to cut more weights are stirring opposition.
Hirvonen thinks that halting traffic to a whole day is, however, a kind of dilemma.
If the metro and trams stop for Friday, public transport in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area will be almost completely halted.
According to VR reports, trains will not run between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. on Friday.
There will be no close or long-distance traffic on Friday.
Trains that have taken off before 6 a.m. are driven to destination stations.
According to HSL, most buses remain in the depot.
AKT members are out of work Friday from 3am to 3am on Saturday morning.
Probably a small number of buses can be run, they will be driven by supervisors, says HSL’s spokesperson Pirkko Repo.
Repo says HSL will not be able to say exactly which bus services will run on Friday.
Employees’ organisations will hold a major demonstration at Helsinki Railway Square from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. on Friday.
Aftonbladet: Hungarian police used tear gas against refugees
Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tear gas.
The incident occurred at the Hungarian-Serbian border, where many refugees are trying to get to Europe, according to the Associated Press news agency.
Sky News says refugees have tried to break through a border fence.
Refugees, many of whom were women and children, fled in a panic.
According to local media reports, Hungarian police would also have used water cannons against people.
Muslim boy arrested at school in Texas, teacher thought homemade bell to be bomb
In the United States, Ahmed Mohamed, 14-year-old Ahmed Mohamed has been arrested after a teacher kept his own-made clock at school as a bomb.
Mohamed told the Dallas Morning News he only wanted to show off his electronics hobby of produce.
But one of the teachers thought the clock looked like a bomb.
Police were called to the scene, and the situation eventually ended with the boy being taken to a youth arrest cell in handcuffs.
Mohamed has never been found to have claimed anything other than that he had made a clock.
Still, it's still possible the boy would be charged with committing a fake bomb.
Mohamed said officers had found the clock looked like a "movie bomb."
The clock is in a police warehouse, but it reportedly consisted of a circuit board and a digital display with wires between them.
The incident happened last Monday and Mohamedia was penalized for three days of forced leave from school.
His father is furious about the case and the country's American-Icelandic Council is considering whether the incident is yet another indication of Islamophobia in the United States.
UK buzzes - Labour leader refused to sing national anthem
In a song, God is asked to protect the Queen, but Corbyn is an opponent of the monarchy.
Criticism of the right-leaning press has also been joined by MPs from Corbyn's own Labour Party.
This has offended the people," said Labour MP Kate Green in a radio interview with broadcaster BBC.
Green thinks Corbyn should have joined the song.
At yesterday's memorial service, the British Air Force pilots' fight against the German Luftwaffe in 1940 was respected.
Labour in an official statement defends Corbyn and stresses that he has shown respect to pilots by attending the occasion.
We are all in huge debt of gratitude to the heroism of Royal Air Force pilots.
He (Corbyn) stood respectfully silently during the national anthem, the statement highlighted.
Corbyn's election as party leader has divided the ranks of Labour.
Among MPs in particular are those who fear he will deter moderate voters with their radical views.
Corbyn advocates unilateral disarmament, cessation of austerity and increased public spending.
Mr Corbyn is due to appear for the first time today in his capacity as party leader in parliament during question time by the prime minister.
Mr Corbyn has asked the public for suggestions on what to ask Prime Minister David Cameron.
Cameron took to Twitter to take to Twitter at the weekend to select Corbyn as party leader.
Labour is threatening our national security, economic security and the security of our families," the Prime Minister tweeted in his own account.
Minnesota family killing cause still unclear - family father expected to face lawsuit
South Lake Minnetonka police have been investigating a week of family killings in Greenwood, Minnesota.
A family of five was found dead in their home on September 10 and a couple of days later police confirmed that the shooter was the family's father, Brian Scott Short, 45.
After shooting a shotgun with his wife and three children, Brian Short killed himself into the garage of the house.
Dead for days
The family was found after concerns about the absence of children at the school.
Based on this report, officers went to the house for a check-up and found the Short family dead across a huge house.
StarTribune said it was possible the victims had been dead for days.
Million houses and a successful company
The investigation into the case of Michael Siitar, the South Lake Minnetonka Police Chief, is still under way.
The motive for the bloodshed is still unclear.
The shooter Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur and had created his belongings on a social media site for nurses at AllNurses.com.
In a 2014 interview with StarTribune, Short said the site had four million different visitors weekly.
I have made 50 bids for the company over the last ten years.
I have abandoned all of them.
I still have a lot of ideas I want to implement.
Maybe I'll sell the business at some point, but not yet.
The success was reflected in the fact that the Short family bought a staggering house in Greenwood in 2011 for quip quip for nil.
The house is advertised in real estate website Zillow as a car collector's dream: the house has not only 12 rooms, but a sufficient garage for eight cars.
Lawsuit pending
But StarTribune said a lawsuit awaited the family's father.
Achieve Test Prep, which offers various prepping courses, had sued him over comments on AllNurses.com.
According to Achieve Test Prep, short's site had not removed comments that scoff short-handed comments, and thus had lost customers to their competitors.
But StarTribunen said it was very unclear whether the trial would have had a very significant impact on Short's transactions.
Vesku Loiri offered cake coffee
In addition, the three owners were awarded the Finnish Hippos Horse Owner of the Month award at the race event.
This is great, Loiri commented on his honorary board.
The partying Fabrice Duo won the Derby on the first Saturday of September and earned 100,000 euros with a win.
Artist legend Loiri was still confused by the success of the Fabrice Duo in a major competition.
I still don't think it's happened.
According to Loir, successful shevovonen’s coach Korpi will have full peace of work when working with a horse.
Pekka decides where to decide where to compete.
And I'll shut up, Loiri scrambled.
NHL star's stunning gesture - 'The biggest donation of all time by an athlete'
Montreal Canadiens superstar P. K. Subban has donated ten million dollars (about 6.7 million euros) to a Montreal Children's Hospital.
A hospital statement said it was the biggest single donation ever made by an athlete to charity in Canada.
In addition, the 26-year-old Subban has committed to helping the hospital with other fundraising for the next seven years.
Subban signed an eight-year, cyclical contract with the Canadiens, worth cyclical and buckling bucks.
So Subban's donation amount is significantly higher than his nine hundredth of 9% million years.
As a reward for his donation, Subban receives a lobby space bearing his name from the hospital.
Canadiens players have helped significantly local hospitals before.
Longtime captain Jean Beliveau, who passed away a year ago, raised millions of dollars to the same children's hospital, among other things, and Saku Koivu raised a giant sum of money to get a PET scanner needed for cancer testing at another major city hospital.

Soon 150 million vehicles will be connected to the network: Car security attacks were geared up to be equipped
The Automotive Security Review Board (ASRB) also supports technological development and innovation in the industry, according to a statement published by Intel.
The board consists of top security experts from around the world.
ASRB researchers will conduct ongoing safety tests and inspections aimed at standardizing best practices and design recommendations for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products.
At the same time, Intel announced the first version of best cybersecurity practices.
The company will continue to update the report based on ASRB’s research results.
Gartner, an international ICT research and consulting firm, estimates that by 2020, around 150 million vehicles in traffic will be connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road.
According to the same estimate, 60 to 75 percent of these vehicles will be able to consume, create and share web-based data.
We can and need to improve the cyber security of cars," said Chris Young, president of Intel Security.
The ASRB allows Intel to establish security-related best practices and support the view that cybersecurity is a significant ingredient in the design of every connected car.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road, making the ASRB board the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world’s leading innovators in computing.
Ford Focus RS costs around €52,000 in Finland!
Ford's Focus RS has been expected to run for years like a moon rising.
Finally, the car is also on the horizon in Finland.
Ford announced RS data now that the car world's eyes are at the Frankfurt Motor Show.
Ford's new all-wheel-drive RS accelerates thanks to its 2.3-liter, 350-horsepower engine in 4.7 seconds from zero to 100 and peak speeds of 266 kilometers per hour.
What is also interesting in Finnish terms is the price, tentatively it is reported to be EUR 52,000.
The car is already available to order, although when the first cars arrive in Finland, Ford does not say in a statement.
Favourite brand Kia introduced two novelties at the Frankfurt Motor Show - such is the new Sportage and Optima
The new fourth generation Sportage, which Kia plans to grab a larger slice of the ever-growing SUV market, is certainly more important than in Finnish terms.
The new European Design Director, designed by Gregory Guillaume, Sportage is more round than before.
There has been a cent here and there and a car splits air even more efficiently.
The engine range is broadly unchanged, but a 1.6-litre turbo has added 177 horsepower.
More about Kia Sportage and its performance and consumption are reported closer to becoming available for sale.
We will have to wait a little longer for it, as the new Sportage will arrive in spring 2016.
Even before the turn of a year, the new Kia Optimats were able to reach our country.
Suddenly, the novelty doesn't seem to have changed, but it's a brand new car.
Kia plans to conquer the hearts of upper middle class buyers with better driving characteristics, lower noise levels and higher standard equipment.
Optimos with 1.7-liter turbodiesel and 2.0-litre petrol engine are available.
Next summer, the pace will pick up with the Optima GT with a 2.0-litre turbo engine.
Around the same time, the sale of an Optima station wagon begins with its arrival.
Chisu returned to stages - raucous in bold jumpsuit
Singer Chisu is part of the Life for a Child concert with other domestic stars.
The electric blue trouser suit has a spectacular, open neckline.
The outfit beautifully presents the singing star's graceful waist.
The ensemble is topped with a golden metal belt and red lipstick.
During a three-year break, the singer, who became a mother, has been able to shake off pregnancy pounds with light exercise and yoga.
Chisu's daughter will soon be a year old.
The singer released her first single from a new record in August.
Back to the stages and getting in front of a large audience after a long break doesn't really thrill me.
I hate everything about music, the singer says.
In a couple of weeks, Chisu will release their new album, Polaris.
A new life situation has inspired me to make new songs.
At this point, I wonder if people will find my new album, Chisu thinks.
Kim Kardashian's motherhood style stunnes me again - now you can see breast
Reality TV beauty Kim Kardashian gives talk to one after another.
She shows off her pregnancy belly and cleavage in sexy clothes, most recently at one American time last night when she left her sister Kourtney Kardashian from a gig by husband Kanye West.
The black maternity dress is transparent at the breast.
It reveals skin-coloured bras under the dress flashing flashing.
The last time Kardashian wore an Amazon-like maternity costume was when she visited a friend for a dinner party in New York just a couple of days ago.
The outfit was highlighted by black over-knee boots.
The third special maternity outfit is as recent as last week's Friday, when there was a pregnancy belly on presentation.
Model world tough laws: No home, you're lonely, competition is terrible
Top model Manon Leloup wanted to reap the notion that the modeling world would be pure glamour and champagne celebrations.
He made his own documentary film Speaking Dolls, in which Leloup and his colleagues talk about the model business.
Harpeer's Bazaar magazine put together Leloup's six hard truths behind the scenes.
Every season starts from scratch.
Even if you've been posing for top designers' outfits in the previous season, the new season begins with castings again.
And every season there are new, fresh faces in the industry competing for work with conkers.
Models rarely have a place to call home.
The work is continuous travel and it can take a year to have a hotel room or apartment where fashion houses accommodate their designs.
If you are very young, and your mother can't travel with you, loneliness can be unbearably difficult.
New York and Paris are sought-after jobs, but they are the most stressful of all.
There is not just one kind of leanness.
An agent in New York might ask you to lose pounds, but in Paris they tell you're too thin.
Getting a job is a risky game all the time.
At fashion weeks, models and designers are together all the time, while acting as a support network.
When the fashion weeks stop, the difference is wistful.
Models want to see this industry because of the opportunities it offers, but they are gnawed by the fact that everyone thinks work is just a presentation of clothes.
Models want to be their own personalities.
The work makes models feel like they are actors with some role.
But in the work of the model, you can also express yourself.
Models at Tory Burchi's show yesterday.
New York is celebrating fashion weeks, where designers reveal their collections for next year.
Scrooge Salminen plays the most unknown Apulanta musician in the film
Roope Salminen plays Antti Lautala, a founding member of the band, in a film based on the early years of the band Apulanta.
Lautala founded Apulanna in 1991 with Toni Wirtanen, but split from the band in 1994.
I’m a pretty big challenge, because I’m a rap artist who turns 26, and in this movie I’m playing a 16-year-old guitarist,” Salminen laughs.
I haven't wanted to see real Antti before the shoot, because I want to make him my own interpretation.
Antti is clearly the most unknown to people, so I think it’s good to me to learn his playing style only from video.
I don't want to do an impersonation of a person.
A man who pilots Roope Salminen and Dogs will not play a role.
Punk shooters come naturally to the man.
In the punk episode of Stars, Stars, I'm sure many saw a foretaste, as well as ever going to our gigs.
Our performance has never been a little bit of a snack, we always go full throttle.
The main actors in the film The main actors of the film Teit about us beautiful, which was directed by Tuukka Temonen, who played bass in Apulanna from 1993 to 2004, were announced today.
The core crowd of the band, which has become familiar to the audience, is played by young actors who are still quite unknown to the general public.
Drummer Sipe Santapukki is played by Teppo Manner, singer Toni Wirtasta Tatu Sinisalo bassist Tuukka Temosta Iiro Panula.
Scrooge Salminen gave a hint of his upcoming job last night, when he reported mysteriously preparing for the most important day of his career on Snapchat.
Roope has already posted a photo of his new look on Instagram yesterday, which he has had to carry out for the film.
Scrooge, previously seen in a moustache and chin-beard, has shaved his face to smooth-cheeked, and dyed his brown hair into black.
Psychologist advises: Here's how to tell children about refugees
Many parents have had to think about how to tell a child about the situation of refugees trying to reach Europe.
Or is it worth telling at all?
There is no need to forcibly raise the issue, says psychologist Ferdinand Garoff, a member of the SPR's crisis group.
Smaller children are worth protecting, for example, not allowing them to watch the news alone.
Young children can't always understand what they see, and it can stay in the mind and distressed, he says.
However, if a child has come across television news photographs of refugees or heard about it elsewhere, it is worth bringing it up.
It is good to have a conversation about the child’s starting points and listening carefully to what he or she asks.
The child's fears can be surprising.
They are not necessarily the ones the parents think they are afraid of.
You shouldn't scare a child for nothing, even if you're distressed and scared yourself.
A smaller child closely monitors his parents’ behaviour.
If the parents themselves remain calm during the conversation, the child feels safe.
Bigger children come across a conversation about refugees at school, with friends or online.
It is good for parents to bring it up to them if they think about it.
The fact is that not all people in the world have a good thing.
Parents, together with children, can think about how to deal with this in our family.
After all, is the world a safe or unsafe place?
Parents may also have different educational aspects - some may want to protect their children from anxiety where possible.
On the other hand: If a family also talks about difficult issues, a child gets a model of how to deal with the difficulties that come to life.
This could be of benefit to him in the future.
Social psychologist Janne Viljamaa: “Teach your children to help you worse”
At the end of their own strength?
You can still be a good parent for your child.
Vermo-hit Balling Lightning Hard to Curb
Perttu Pohjola was able to refine the Apila Pallosaima into a sluggish blow in midsummer.
It only trotted out wins and second positions, until a collapse came at the end of July at the Tampere races.
Because the stallion congealed thoroughly, the coach suspected something was wrong and ordered an appointment to his protru from a veterinarian.
An explanation for shutdown was cleared by endoscopy.
The horse had laryngitis.
The disease was not the mildest end; it took two courses of medicine to defeat it.
Since Apila’s Pallosaala had to be on light exercise, Pohjola says he is pleasantly surprised by the horse’s last run.
It was second in Turku after the second SE mare Taruntuule in Turku.
Apila's Ball Flash was under heavy pressure from the break, having been able to drive normally for only a few weeks.
Considering those things, a small deflection at the end was understandable, Pohjola says.
The coach assumes a proper race made a blade for the stallion.
I'm sure the horse's momentum went ahead of it, and hopefully it would have leveled off as well.
The Apila's Ball Lightning has been so-called humor horses.
When you haven't liked it, it could have thrown fat even without illness.
On a good day, instead, a lightning rush has come off the stallion that opponents have been amazed.
In short-term speed, fellow competitors can't match Ball Lightning, which even loosens warm-blooded rides.
There is a pittance run in Vermo.
What is different, however, is how the Apila's Ball Lightning agrees to it.
It's pretty difficult at the time of departure and might even pop under the starting car boom and that kind of thing.
I hope the stallion is calmer than he was leaving.
When it comes to the good, Apilan Pallona is also able to come from the bow, and we will drive it to win, the coach promises.
This is why you can't get rid of unnecessary iPhone programs
Apple CEO Tim Cook.
At least some of the apps that come with Apple iPhones may be removed sometime in the future - but not all of them.
Apple will potentially remove some of its own programs from iPhones in the future, according to Tim Cook, the company's CEO, in an interview with Buzzfeed magazine.
Apple's iPhone has a host of programs that relatively few people use: FaceTime calls, Leaf kiosk, Health, Stock Exchange, Podcasts and Tips, for example.
The latest addition to these programs is the Apple Watch, which became a must-have update to iPhones, although it is only necessary for Apple smartwatch owners.
Cook says removing Apple's programs is a more complicated issue than it looks like on the top.
Some apps are linked to another iPhone.
If they are removed, it could cause problems somewhere else on the phone, Cook notes to Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which Apple iPhone apps worked closely with other programs.
There are other programs that don't work this way.
So with time, I think we can develop a way to let the user remove them," Cook added.
So, according to Cook, Apple is investigating, as the company doesn't want to waste memory space on users' iPhones.
Eurozone inflation sludges to 0.1% in August
Consumer prices in the euro area rose only marginally, by 0.1% year-on-year in August, according to Eurostat, the EU's statistics regulator.
Prices were driven down by lower energy prices.
Eurostat revised its estimate of 0.2% below a couple of weeks ago.
In July, inflation rates were 0.2 percent.
So-called bottom inflation fell to 0.9 per cent in August from 1.0% in July.
Eurostat's estimate for bottom inflation was 1.0 per cent.
Energy in the euro area was 7.2 per cent cheaper last month than a year ago.
In the EU-wide total of 28 countries, average inflation was at zero in August.
In July, there was a 0.1 per cent rise.
Consumer prices rose most in Malta in August, i.e. by 1.4 per cent.
In Cyprus, inflation was lowest with prices falling by 1.9 per cent.
In Finland, inflation was 0.2 per cent minus-marked according to the EU's harmonised price index.
Eurozone inflation persists in a long way from the European Central Bank (ECB) target of a near 2% rise in prices over the medium term.
The ECB forecasts inflation of 0.1% for this year for the eurozone.
Next year, the rise will pick up to 1.1 per cent, the central bank anticipates in its new inflation forecasts, released in early September.
U.S. Fed to try to tighten monetary policy next
The next U.S. recession will begin at its fastest in less than a year, but more certain within three years after the country's central bank Fed takes a long time to raise interest rates again.
And financial markets, meanwhile, the decline begins before the next recession.
The Fed has hinted that it will start raising interest rates possibly as early as this week and by the end of the year at the latest.
So the next recession could weigh on top of its fastest by next fall and as a financial market rate rhythm before that.
Or at least that's what happens if the world's largest economy and financial markets act as they used to - and if they react to the Fed's money taps tightening as they used to do.
Such conclusions have been reached by Deutsche Bank, Deutsche Bank's London market research strategists Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker, in a broad study of long-term market and economic cycles.
The bank shared a more than 60-page Long-Term Asset Return Study report to its international clients last week.
The strategists who produced the study and report do not pretend to know when exactly the Fed will take to raise interest rates or what happens in the economy and the market thereafter.
Instead, through the cool facts and calculations of economic statistics, they present how economics and markets have behaved in the past at and after the Fed rate hikes.
In addition to historical findings, they look at which key variables of the economy and financial markets are now on the same or another model as at previous rate hikes - and what might result from.
It is clear that both the economy and financial markets are now in shaky shape to withstand interest rates than at any time since the 1950s.
A start to recession may not be a year
Leaders deciding on the Fed's monetary policy and its current tune-up have hinted along last summer and early autumn that time is starting to be ripe to raise interest rates.
The first rate hike in more than nine years could come as early as this week.
The matter will be resolved as Wednesday and Thursday, when the so-called Open Market Committee of the Fed's board meets to decide on the issue to its two-day meeting.
The last time the Fed raised its so-called Fed funds policy rate was in June 2006.
That was then ending exactly two years of relatively regular but at a time a series of small 0.25 percentage points of interest rate hikes at which the Fed raised its interest rate from 1.25 per cent to 5.25 percent.
The symptoms of financial markets began in 2007 with difficulties in U.S. riskier housing finance, and a year later the financial crisis torn into a global doomsday nightmare.
A major recession came in 2009.
Last time, serious adversity in financial markets and the real economy began to slower than have typically occurred since previous Fed rate hikes.
Similarly, the trials were tougher and more stark than once since the recession of the 1930s.
Deutsche strategists have screened the rises and downfalls of the world's largest economies, as well as the turnarounds of financial markets since 1950 and in some parts since the early 19th century.
The Fed's rate hikes and their economic and financial implications make senses since the 1950s.
At its fastest, less than a year has passed since the first rate increase to the start of the recession, most often less than three years and less than three-and-a-half years on average.
The increase in financial markets has ended within one year to two of the start of Fed rate hikes.
The Fed has alternately raised and cut its key interest rate by a dozen cycles of varying lengths since the early 1950s.
Each time has differed from others in some respects, and the narrator is under reviewing relatively sparingly, so it is unlikely to be possible to deduce anything certain about the effects of subsequent rate hikes.
Strategies remind us that this time a lot of things are different.
And not just better.
Highlights too low for too long
The crucial causes of the financial crisis, let alone the culprits, may not be unquestionably discovered even by decades of research.
But three factors of the causes of the crisis and increased its destructive power are probably somewhat unquestionably clear:
1) In the 21st century, the Fed, euro area ECB and other major central banks in the world considered their key interest rates too low.
They patched up traces of a tech bubble, while growing the next one.
2) Over the decades, the accumulated debt accumulation in different parts of the financial and real economy grew even greater than the impact of central banks’ loose monetary policies.
The largest debt bubble in economic history was created.
3) In particular, crazy low-income debt financing, which was about a disincreased focus on financial markets, inflated the largest price bubbles in real estate, bonds and commodities in most aspects of financial markets to that extent.
There is unlikely to be a very severe dispute that financial markets rising to heights on increasingly convoluted leverage were in an unusually dangerous and unstable segment of the past, when the Fed and other central banks last pushed up interest rates.
Financial structures, not longened to debt levers, let alone valuation bubbles, could not last until their time after interest rate hikes began and the cost of debt financing had taken off.
The risks were met as a financial crisis, followed by a major recession.
A bigger bubble and more debt
Deutschen strategists do not guess what will happen next, but give cause for commenting on issues such as:
1) Fed and other major central banks have now kept their monetary policy tune even lighter longer than before the financial crisis.
If interest rates were too low for too long before the crisis, they have now been even lower for even longer.
2) For a long time, debt has not been crazy as it was ten years ago, but now debt money is literally cheaper than free.
So the debt of the financial and real economy has not eased but now a heavy load of debt is heavily burdened in different parts of the economy than before or in the past financial crisis.
3) The liquidity that has been issued from central banks in higher prices and cheaper has mostly remained in financial markets and gridlocked key securities and asset classes to their most expensive ones, then a peak before the financial crisis or ever.
And not only the strategists are afraid of the mood with financial market warning signs, but also point out that even the U.S. economy has not yet recovered from the financial crisis and, in decades, from the heaviest recession to that model than it has been in the past.
The eurozone economy has barely recovered at all.
In other words, the real economy is in unusually weak shape, but similarly, the pressures and risks of financial markets are incomparably higher than before the financial crisis, when the Fed next sets in tighter than its money taps.
Perhaps the future of Albert Edwards, strategist at French bank Societe Generale, is not as strange as it can be a sudden impression.
For a long time, he has been coaching the Bank's international investor clients for the Fed's full turns:
First the Fed raises interest rates, then financial bubbles burst - and soon it's time for the Fed to rush to extinguish financial fires with even higher QE money sprayers.
Hewlett-Packard (HP), which makes computers and printers, plans to cut up to 33,000 jobs.
The vast majority of reductions will be on HP's corporate service side, the company said.
HP will be split into a company sales-focused Hewlett Packard Enterprise in November and consumer-oriented PCs and printers-focused HP Inc.
HP had a peak of staffing in 2011, with 350,000 employees.
In October last year, staff had been reduced to 302,000.
The company records non-recurring expenses of 2.7 billion dollars (approximately EUR 2.4 billion) of the arrangements.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be reduced to 25,000 to 30,000 employees.
The reductions in the consumer side will remain at 3300 within three years.
HP plans to shift operations to low cost countries with 60 percent of its employees in low-cost countries in 2018.
The company says it has already rebalanced its business so that none of its customers are responsible for more than 10 percent of its operating profit.
In the year before, its three most significant customers accounted for 65 percent of operating profit.
iOS 9: How to Get a New Operating System for iPhone After Apple Update Release
You can request a new operating system by going to the Settings app, by clicking "General" and then selecting "Software Update."
If the update is ready, the phone will give you the option to download and then install it.
Some have had problems after this installation after an "Software Update Failed" error message appears on the screen.
To bypass this, users are recommended to either wait for the worst of the traffic jam to pass or try to update through iTunes.
The phone guides the user in the final process.
This may include removing apps to get status, but Apple has reduced this option by reducing the update size and also making the process easier with a new tool that suggests deleted apps and then reinstalls them when the update is complete.
You should make sure your phone is charged or close to the charger during the update so that you don't run out of battery.
If the charging level is too low, Apple won't let the update proceed, because if you run out of battery, it could lead to a smashing of an update.

You should also make sure you’ve reviewed our list of all the things you have to do before charging to avoid things going wrong, and how to protect yourself from it, if they go anyway. iOS 9 brings new features like a much smarter personal assistant and huge new productivity features for iPad, as well as improvements that speed up and fix the operating system.
Yle: Minister Berner has served on the board of a tax haven company
According to Yle, Minister of Transport and Communications Anne Berner (centre) has served as a member of the Board of Directors of a tax haven company.
According to Yle, so-called tax planning has been related to the company’s operations.
We are talking about Saltri II LuxCo, a Luxembourg-based company of which Berner was appointed as a member of the board in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg Trade Register, Berner is still officially a board member.
Berner himself says he filed a resignation notice of membership in May of this year.
I checked it out and it's enough to file a resignation.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that the registration chains are implemented within the agreed schedule, Berner says in an interview with Yle.
Membership after merger
The Luxembourg company manages the holdings of Swedish company Kährs.
Kährs is a parquet manufacturer merged with Finnish parquet manufacturer Karelia-Upofloor in 2012.
Berner served on the board of Karelia-Upofloor in 2010-2013 and after the merger on Kährs’s board of directors and a Luxembourg company.
According to Yle, Kährs’ holdings go through a multi-tiered ownership structure in Luxembourg.
Berner tells Yle that he accepted board membership in a Luxembourg-based company at the request of Kährs’ second largest owner.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I have been on the board of Karelia-Upofloor, owned by Hartwall Capital.
The company was looking for a partner found in Sweden.
This company was owned by a private equity investor with a company in Luxembourg.
I felt that my own task was to ensure that the interests of a Finnish family company’s capital were realised.
It is important that we ensure that the income of our Finnish companies’ capital is taxed in Finland, and that’s starting point was secured in this context,” Berner says.
Berner tells Yle that Hartwall Capital’s holdings in the company are not related to tax planning.
According to Berner, the complex ownership structure erected in tax havens is due to the fact that the private equity fund of Kährs's largest owner, Triton, already had a Luxembourg holding company ready for holdings.
A company-run reception centre opens in Espoo
In Otaniemi, Espoo, the first reception centre maintained by the company opens to adult asylum seekers.
The reception centre is ready to take the first 100 inhabitants from 6 p.m. today.
The number of seats can increase to a maximum of 300-400 people within a week.
The Finnish Immigration Service will establish a reception centre in a former Rescue College property.
The operations are maintained by Luona Oy, which focuses on the provision of health care and medical services in particular.
The City of Espoo, the Finnish Immigration Service and Luona Oy jointly agree on security arrangements for the centre, among other things.
STTK prepares alternative labour blackmail package
STTK will prepare an alternative package for the tightening of the government’s working life.
The organization also hopes to include other employee central organisations.
According to Chairman Antti Palola, attention is currently being made in Friday’s demonstration.
Alternative ways to reduce the price of work will be returned after that.
Everyone understands that life will continue after Friday, Palola pointed out a meeting of the organization's administration to reporters during a break.
Palola estimates that the Confederation of Finnish Industries (EK) does not, on the other hand, be prepared for discussions.
STTK’s economists have calculated that the change security contained in the Government’s competitiveness package will cost the employer an estimated 30 million euros, compared to 2,700 million on the other side of the package.
I don't know if a party is terribly eager to have a conversation if there's a one-to-one ratio to 100 on the side.
Palola: Negotiation link was constructive
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre) has hoped for alternative proposals by Wednesday, because then the Government is to submit a communication on its own package to Parliament and to start preparing reforms.
Palola did not take a position on whether the timetable is realistic.
According to Palola, the dialogue with the government is there, and he has been constructive all along.
According to Palola, the cut in Sunday supplements is a painful place for the field of STTK.
The organization requires the government to back down from mandatory legislation to implement some of the blackmails.
According to Palola, STTK does not warm to preparing an alternative package with the SDP that has kept the issue on the table.
Employees will meet in Helsinki on Friday to oppose the blackmail package of working life presented by the Government last week.
As part of the package, the salary of the first days of illness will be cut, overtime pay will be halved, Sunday compensation will be reduced to 75 per cent and holidays reduced.
STTK stresses that the central organisations have invited wage earners to a demonstration, and the intention has not been to organise a strike.
Akava Fjäder commends
Sture Fjäder, Chairman of Akava, commends STTK’s announcement to prepare an alternative package.
According to Fjäder, STTK will now be on the same page as Akava, as Akava already has an alternative model for the Board of Directors’ proposals.
Fjäder hopes to include SAK in an alternative package, because without SAK the package is not comprehensive enough.
Sture Fjäder, the chairman of Akava, hopes that SAK, led by Lauri Lyly, will prepare a proposal as an alternative to cuts.
Antti Palola’s STTK said earlier on Wednesday that he was preparing new proposals.
We want change security and working time banks.
Akava announced on Wednesday that it has been preparing its own motion for a proposal to negotiate a five per cent competitiveness jump sought by the country's government as an alternative to cuts.
Akava has been ready to negotiate all along, and we have long written an alternative model for government proposals.
We are ready to look at the terms of employment as part of the agreement.
In return, we want change security and working time banks, says Chairman Sture Fjäder.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also come to Akava’s lines, as STTK has done earlier on Wednesday.
Without SAK, the package is not strong enough.
We are now working together to prepare a model that will go to the country's government and employers," says Fjäder.
Akava's bureau will meet on Thursday at 3pm to take a decision on the possible content of the agreement.
"Same boat, shared coal, talkoots" - playing bingo while Sipilä speaks in the evening
Tampere University Green Left
Vivan, the Green Left of the University of Tampere, a bingo ticket for an evening.
The Prime Ministers have previously made emergency speeches during the Mäntsälä rebellion and wars.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä speaks very exceptionally to the nation about the state of Finland’s economy on Yle’s channels on Wednesday evening at 9:05 p.m.
When applying for a previous speech by the Prime Minister, we must go to 1932, when Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was Prime Minister to give a famous radio address to mark the beginning of the end of the Mäntsälä rebellion.
The president and ministers then gave several radio addresses during the Winter War and Continuation.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho gave a New Year’s speech instead of President Mauno Koivisto, but it was more of a ceremony.
In the autumn of 1976, President Urho Kekkonen stopped a strike by train performers with a television address.
Single call, monarchical
Sipilä’s speech has attracted criticism and guesswork of what to come.
Paavo Arhinmäki, president of the Left Alliance, said on Twitter that "Sipilä could give his speech on the state of the nation in Parliament as an announcement from the Prime Minister, which would also allow discussion to be discussed."
According to the Greens, “allocation has already been seen.
Leadership includes dialogue, listening to people.
SDP’s Erkki Tuomioja condemned on Facebook that “monarchical: the Prime Minister tells the people what is best for them.”
Antti Rinne, the chairman of the SDP, challenged Sipilä to a dialogue: "Soon six months after the election.
Not a single appearance from the Prime Minister in the media with the opposition.
There's been an attempt.
What is ?juhasipila afraid of?
Public service
According to the Prime Minister’s Office, Sipilä’s speech has been recorded in advance and lasts about 15 minutes.
According to SAK, it was commented on live by SAK President Lauri Lyly and EK’s CEO Jyri Häkämies.
Yle has been criticised for presenting a speech.
We considered the matter and stated that it is part of the public service mission to promote publicity covering the whole of Finland,” says Ismo Silvo, Director of Yle’s publications.
Like us at Tammeloe time
The speech has also sparked taunts.
By evening, dinner will be enjoyed well in advance, children are combed and dressed to their best.
My mother wears a prettier kola and my father settles a tie around his neck.
At 9 a.m., we will be silenced to the television before at the time of Me Tammeloit,” writes blogger Saku Timonen.
"In his speech, Prime Minister Sipilä also discusses why the Finnish government sits on millionaires hiding their capital in tax havens, which draw up pardon laws for other tax-wringing mates and at the same time claiming to the people that they have to cut when the state is out of money?" asks Pia Lohikoski.
One guess is made by the Green Left of the Tampere University of Tampere.
It has posted an attached bingo on Facebook.
Will we hear about the same boat, coal, debts and team spirit tonight?
Coupons and pens ready, at 9:05 p.m. it starts and the channels are TV1, Radio Finland and Yle Areena.
Ahtisaari in Guardian: Western countries reject Russian proposal to oust al-Assad
More than three years ago, Western countries rejected Russia's offer to relinquish Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to relinquish power, President Martti Ahtisaari told the Guardian.
According to Ahtisaari, Russia’s UN Ambassador to the UN proposed a plan to give way to al-Assad in a class of style.
But Western nations did not take up the proposal because they believed al-Assad would fall in a matter of weeks anyway.
Ahtisaari discussed the Syrian crisis in 2012 with five permanent member states of the UN Security Council.
According to Ahtisaari, Russian Ambassador Vitali Thurkin listed a three-point plan for him in a bilateral debate: the opposition was not to be disarmed, the opposition and al-Assad immediately needed to be given a state of speech, and the relinquishing of al-Assad had to be implemented in a controlled manner.
I know of Tshurkin.
We may not agree with all things, but we can talk openly.
I told him what I was doing there and he said sit down, Martti, and I’ll tell him what to do,” Ahtisaari recalls in an interview with the Guardian.
Diplomats will not comment
Ahtisaari says he passed the Thurkin message to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
Tshurkin did not confirm the content of the discussion to the magazine, but according to Ahtisaari, there are no two words about it.
UN diplomats also declined to comment on Ahtisaari's claims, but said that al-Assad's forces had already committed several massacres at that time and key opposition groups refused any treaty with which he would remain in power.
Sir John Jenkins, former head of the Middle East division of the British Foreign Ministry, is hesitant to address Ahtisaari because, in his experience, Russia was never ready to discuss the fate of al-Assad.
Officially, Russia has supported al-Assad throughout the war.
The weakest point in Ahtisaari’s claim is that Tshurkin spoke with a Moscow authority.
If he had told me about what Tshurkin said, I would have replied that I wanted to hear the same from President Vladimir Putin so I could take it seriously.
In that case, Jenkins said, he would have suspected that it would have been Putin's gimmick to keep power to some al-Assad backer.
Refugees are our own actions
Some 7,500 people had died in the Syrian crisis during the negotiations on Ahtisaari.
The U.N. estimates the death toll exceeded 220,000 at the beginning of this year.
More than 11 million people have been forced to flee their homes because of the war.
We should have stopped this disaster.
The flow of refugees to Europe is our own thing.
I don't see any choice but to take good care of these poor people.
We are now paying a bill that we caused ourselves, Ahtisaari says to the magazine.
Asylum seekers' organising centre in Tornio
The Government’s planned organizing centre for asylum seekers in northern Finland is likely to be established in Tornio.
The centre would be set up in the empty Tornio joint Lyceum building in the city centre.
The Ministry of the Interior has been looking for a place to better manage the flow of refugees from the Swedish border.
On Tuesday, Helsingin Sanomat reported that the council had already decided to propose a school building as a spatial solution to the ministry.
According to Sauli Hyöppinen (left), vice-chairman of the Tornio City Council, this is not true.
When the entire council was not meeting and some of the group wanted a formal decision, we decided to invite a council meeting to decide on the matter, he explains to STT.
Thirty-six of 43 councillors were present at the discussion.
The organizing center was opposed by 13 councillors.
On that basis, you could expect the decision to be positive, says Hyöppinen.
According to Mayor Timo Nousiainen, the city was contacted on Monday, and there was a swift response to the matter.
The joint lynch could accommodate an estimated 500 asylum seekers at a time.
An expert has checked to see that it could be suitable for such use.
The location is a couple of hundred metres from the limit, so it would work in that sense, too, Nousiainen says.
Sipilä still hopes for a change of tension in the labour market
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre), halving public holiday payments would only take care of part of the government’s sought reduction in the price of work.
But the government, he said, will be happy to accept an alternative package if labour market organisations manage to agree on such a thing.
Sipilä told journalists in Parliament that he had not been in contact with labour market organisations.
He also did not know how seriously organisations were seeking replacements for the tightening of working life announced by the government.
If such an agreement is reached, we will certainly welcome it as part of the overall package.
In Sipilä’s opinion, halving holiday payments would be a means of working, because it would target almost all employees, unlike, for example, the government’s planned cut in Sunday supplements.
Labour market organisations could agree to cut furlough payments to each other because they are enshrined in collective agreements instead of the law.
The Government will present a Government to Parliament on Wednesday next week on the tightening of working life as a Government communication.
According to Sipilä, the proposals of organisations should be known before this.
The final deadline is not either.
Legislation work then starts, i.e. the train is on the move and it gets harder and harder.
It's a good time.
It won’t be long in such matters, if there is a will, Sipilä said.
The list published by the government last week includes, among other things, converting Epiphany and Ascension to unpaid days off without reducing annual working hours.
In addition, the pay of the first days of illness will be cut, overtime pay will be halved, Sunday compensations will be reduced to 75 per cent and holidays reduced.
Reforms will be implemented as a mandatory legislation past trade unions, prompting strong criticism.
The central payers' organisations will hold a major demonstration on Friday because of the actions, in addition to which several trade unions have declared political strikes.
Tohmajärvi council approves mahlahall warehouse expansion
The Tohmajärvi council unanimously approved but slightly award expansion of the hall of Nordic Koivu Oy, i.e. the mahla hall.
Criticism was caused by the fact that the project is bigger and more expensive than originally spoken.
A busy schedule also snubbed.
It was also a little surprised that the need to order the need was not known a year ago when the previous extension was decided.
At this point, the inventory extension by 400-450 square metres was approved for the investment programme, but money will be decided later in the interim report.
There was still talk of an investment of EUR 150,000 to EUR 200,000, but at the meeting, Technical Director Erkki Ikonen, said that the price would be estimated to be EUR 300,000.
The investment was supported on the grounds that it brings work and tax revenue to the locality.
There is no risk for the municipality, as the company pays the investment as a rent, Vesa Väistö (ps.) argued.
Karelian language also in Joensuu
The city government reduced its previous sharp stance to bring Karelian-language street name signs to the centre of Joensuu.
A new decision is important and right in keeping with the preservation of a Karelian tradition throughout the province.
Joensuu does not declare itself the capital of the Karelian language, because there are no historical grounds for it and the Karelian language is not an innate part of the region’s identity.
The language spoken in the Joensuu region has been more of Eastern Savongue dialects.
Even after the new decision, there will be no Karelian-language street name signs in the city centre.
However, the City of Joensuu is also ready to use the Karelian language in information boards and tourism marketing, for example.
The same attitude is recommended by the City to all other actors.
Even though Joensuu is officially a monolingual municipality, it is also worth taking a broad approach to the use of the Karelian language now that multiculturalism lives and changes strongly in North Karelia.
The Karelian language is still a special feature of the region, as is the image of Joensuu as the forest capital of the whole of Finland.
Both can be used to benefit from a wide range of marketing in the province.
Dismantling train loops cut provincial vitality
Cuts to train connections hit the province's vitality hard.
Transport connections have a direct impact on the region’s business life and competitiveness.
And that means whether we can live and work here at all, says Kari Karjalainen, Mayor of Joensuu.
He also raises air traffic, which has also been discussed several times.
It is important for the whole of the province that our chances of reducing the possibilities of state power, as is happening now.
We should look at the effects of these transport connections on employment, for example, Karjalainen emphasises.
The deterioration of access links poses an additional challenge for the University of Eastern Finland in terms of attractiveness.
Of course, the better services here, such as transport connections and housing situation, the easier it is to get students and employees,” says Jukka Mönkkönen, Rector of the University of Eastern Finland.
He points out that poor access to transport also affects a research staff that is very mobile and travels a lot due to research.
Marko Junkkarinen, Recruitment Manager, says that marketing the university towards Western Finland is difficult to market the university towards Western Finland, because the transport connections are weak in cross-field direction.
Currently, about half of students at the University of Eastern Finland come from outside Eastern Finland.
Some 10-20% of them are from Uusimaa, which is partly explained by direct train connections.
Joensuu became one gravel voice to Siun sote
The Joensuu City Board’s vision of the regional Siun Sote project is seemingly unanimous, but there is also one gravel voice.
Pentti Keskisalo, a member of the City Board, proposed aphath of the entire project at the Board’s meeting on Monday, but his proposal lapsed unprofitable.
The Board of Directors approved the proposal for a decision by Mayor Kari Karjalainen, which will be revised at the beginning of October before the City Council meeting, which will issue a final statement on the project at the same time as all other municipalities.
One train service from Kotka to Kouvola ends next year
Passenger train services from Kotka to Kouvola will remain in the future, although fewer than one train innings.
There will be changes to passenger train traffic between Kotka and Kouvola next March.
One train innings are left out, but still five times a day you can get to Kouvola from Kotka and vice versa.
The reductions are due to government austerity measures.
The purchase money of the Ministry of Transport and Communications for the next four-year period will decrease by EUR 12.3 million.
The quietest routes will be stopped altogether.
VR will prepare new schedules by the end of the year.
They will enter into force on 27 March 2016.
Boys climbed to roof, one couldn't get down, guys slipped away from the scene
Emergency services let a 12-year-old climbing into the roof from a dispute, who could not get down from the roof on his own.
The situation was created in Tornionmäki on Ketotie at 6:30 on Tuesday evening.
There is an old two-storey wooden house with no ladders on the roof.
That didn't stop a group of boys who decided to climb to the roof of the house along the radio amateur radio mast next to it.
Other boys got down the same route, but one didn't.
As a result, others slipped away from the scene and passersby alerted the emergency services to help the last one on the roof safely with tentholes back to the ground.
FedEx's operating profit dual, lowers tax year 2016 outlook
FedEx reported depressing results from its latest quarter, and the delivery giant cut its full-year profit forecast, due to reduced demand for freight services, and higher cost of its ground services.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for holidays.
Last year, FedEx announced that it was hiring 50,000 seasonal workers for holidays.
Its stock fell about 2.5 percent in an opening auction 45 minutes before Wednesday's opening cull.
FedEx Corp. says it expects next May to end the tax year of profit of DP 10.40 to 10.90, which is 20 cents lower than the previous forecast.
Analysts expected quid quid , according to a FactSet survey.
The smaller outlook came despite average price increases of 4.9%, which will come into effect on January 4, and despite higher surcharges in land shipments of heavy or large parcels in November.
The company said it expects operating profit to grow ever greater than before because of cutting expenses, revenue growth and growing e-commerce.
Fred Smith, chairman and chief executive, said the company "takes a solid performance in view of weaker-than-expected economic conditions, particularly in production and global trade."
Plans for pay for the holiday were announced a day after competitor UPS said it plans to hire 90-95,000 extra employees, about the same amount as it hired last year.
In the quarter ending August, FedEx's profit was DM 692 million, up from last year.
The profit per share came at DP, falling short of an average forecast of quid of quid. The 12 analyst survey was conducted by Zacks Investment Research.
Revenue rose 5 percent to nil to nil.
In a Zacks poll, six analysts expected quid at tune of quid.
FedEx has suffered in recent years from a decline in international priority transportation that has halted the development of turnover in its Express unit.
But the rise in e-commerce has improved the results of FedEx Ground.
In the latest quarter, the revenue of the inland unit rose by 29 per cent, but revenue from operations was basically the same due to the cost of higher parcels and own insurance.
The Express unit's revenue was better because of the higher basic payments, while operating profit in freight operations was lower than labour costs.
At the opening auction about an hour before the opening clock, FedEx shares fell naught n.3.5% to wing at DP 150.15.
FedEx on Tuesday shut down 11 percent on Tuesday for this year and 17 percent below June's record.
US Federal Reserve policymakers will sit around a huge mahogany table this week at a long-awaited meeting to decide whether a time to raise a key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
At the other end of the central bank's decorative, double-storey meeting room is mural from the United States.
The map is a reminder that Mr Janet L., President of the Central Bank, Yellen and his colleagues must put the nation's financial interests above everything else.
Congress has fallen to the central bank on a dual responsibility: they must maximise US employment and keep prices stable.
However, after a major recession, central bank leaders have accepted that there is also a third, unwritten mandate: financial stability.
It is this third demand that a decisive factor in a decision to be announced on Thursday, which is so strict that it cannot even be predicted. The decision on whether the US economy is ready to wean for a record incentive to bring in by a nearly trough short-term interest rate level that has remained at nearly zero until late 2008 .
While most of the data shows a steady increase in the economy, recent turmoil in global financial markets may have made even more frighty central bank officials in advance as to increase volatility. There are fears of how it would be to make a federal funds rate reference value raised by at least a percentage point in a quarter.
"Convincingly, the labour market and inflation are the first and most important aspects to be monitored," says Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economic expert at brokerage Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"However, I believe that if they seek justification for leaving interest rates unchanged, increased uncertainty on the global market is a valid enough reason to wait yet," he says.
There is no agreement on the central bank's decision, which already gives rise to nervousness to the economy.
According to a recent Bloomberg study, about half of financial experts predict that interest rates will rise this week.
Financial markets, on the other hand, expect the central bank to delay the raise, with a key indicator showing that the potential for growth is only about 30 percent.
This suggests a fall in securities markets if the central bank raises levels, unless policymakers managed to soften the blow by promising that the next withdrawal will not happen anytime soon.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average index rose by 228.89 points, or 1.4 percent, with a new figure of 16,599.65.
The recovery was brought by the expectation that the central bank would keep the level unchanged this week, according to John Lonski, a chief economic expert in the Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It will be surprising if the central bank raises interest rates right now," he says.
If policymakers raise interest rates, "they need to put a lot of effort into their policy to support financial markets so they don't panic."
Other experts argue that a heightened level would calm financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about when the central bank is working.
Just a month ago, it seemed to the central bank this month to raise interest rates by a quarter-percentage unit, thus taking the first small step towards slow tightening the monetary state of the economy, which would verify the stability of the U.S. recovery.
Yellen has stated in the spring and early summer that he expects the level to rise this year despite the fact that liberals demand more economic development in their complaints.
Although job creation slowed in August, labour market growth has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1 per cent last month, the lowest figure for seven years and close to the level that the central bank sees as a limit of full employment.
Wages growth has shown signs of picking up.
While inflation is still below the central bank's annual target of 2%, central bank policymakers say the main reason for this is a temporary effect of significantly reduced oil prices.
The economy "clearly from higher interest rates and also needs them given the tighter labor market situation," notes Ian Shepherdson, chief economic expert at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world were shaken last week when China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial Issue index fell as much as 16 percent of its toll from May, as investors feared China's slowing economy would slow global growth as well.
Markets have recovered somewhat this month, and the Dow index now stands at nearly 10 percent below the peak of May.
For central bank makers, market turmoil is an additional factor in a complex equation that indicates that interest rates should be raised.
"Without these financial market developments and recent weeks of news of China's economic weakness, policymakers would tighten the level at this meeting," says Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Investigator at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate, and former central bank official.
Now he predicts that policymakers will wait at least a month to get a better understanding of the effects.
"The potential impact on the U.S. economy is still quite unclear, and they have little information at their disposal regarding the consequences of what happened in China," Oliner notes.
The well-being of the international economy is not the main concerns of the central bank, so in principle it should not affect decision-making.
In practice, however, the Federal Reserve has become a monetary authority of the world.
In recent years, the central bank's influence has been immense.
In 2013, then Chairman, Ben S. Bernanken, an insinuation that a central bank can "cover" an increase in money amount caused upheavals in markets around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, central bank officials are expected not only to follow developments elsewhere, but also to consult other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
The central bank's decision-making process is "more art than science," notes Zachary Karabell, head of global strategy at asset management firm Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank in Richmond, Virginia, pointed out this month that "the central bank has previously overreacted to the movement of financial markets that has appeared to be separate from economic fundamentals."
The Federal Open Market Committee, which makes decisions, has called for a rate increase, and Lacker, a voting member of the Committee, invokes decisions of 1998-99 as an example.
The Asian financial crisis caused the central bank to cut its benchmark by 0.75 percentage points over three meetings "destroying its limited, identifiable impact on US economic growth," Lacker says.
A year later, the central bank reversed these cuts.
The central bank should only put economic stability first at a time of major crisis, as when the market collapsed in 2008, says Adam S. Former member of the Bank of England of the Bank of England.
The latest turmoil does not come anywhere near its level, Posen notes.
"No one wants to see a situation where an interest rate hike is feared because the market is annoyed," says Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains a dual demand, and does not mention financial stability. As long as this is the case, I don't think they should anticipate it.

Brazil's pediatric group Rio Grande promotes a healthy diet for breastfeedingers
The Brazilian National Statoe Association (SPRS) has come up with a shocking way to try to make women understand the importance of good nutrition during breastfeeding by posting pictures of babies sucking breasts with pictures of unhealthy food.
Breast milk consists of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients necessary to develop a strong immune system.
Pregnant women and new mothers need extra energy, so they are advised to increase their daily caloric amount by about 500 calories.
However, a new study suggests adding calories is not the only dietary change that mothers should make.
A recent study led by Robert Waterland, a professor at the Baylor of Medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine, revealed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genetic expression of their babies and protect babies from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet was found to have a negative impact on a child's immune system.
Seven Channel Sunrise is a favorite of viewership, despite Nine channel's efforts to report a director disclosure on the Today Show
The rush of Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberra to report the aftermath of the Liberal Party leader's revelation failed to increase Today's viewership numbers.
The Nine channel's morning program was broadcast from the country's capital after Malcolm Turnbull took over Tony Abbott.
The competing program Sunrise, hosted by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was stuck in London as part of its week-long series of international broadcasts, which also covers Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
The ballast of distance seemed to hamper Australian TV viewers, as Sunrise's average attendance in five state capitals was 399,000, compared to Today's figure of 339,000.
Today's average rose slightly compared to Monday's figures (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but was still lower than last Thursday (433,000).
Today has taken Suck up over the past few months.
In August, Today's average was 318,000 and Sunrise's 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the gap ranged between 40,000 and 50,000 viewers.
For now, during September, Sunrise's average is 349,000 viewers, compared to 314,000 at Today.
This is the most interesting event of the morning.
The winds of change are blowing elsewhere than in Parliament this morning!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for asking!

The big news on Seven was the 800-word series featuring former star of Packed to the Rafters, Erik Thomson, an amazing first performance.
A new drama series that garnered a very impressive average of 1.219 million viewers, reports a recently widowed father who decides to move to the coast of New Zealand with his two children.
Critics have wondered if Thomson's popular series is a driving force alone without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's results gave this a real certainty.
Seven's The X Factor program was a strong favourite with 1.136 million viewers, easily winning The Block series (8388,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven had a two-fold fate on the second night of The Chase Australia.
The first half-hour of Andrew O'Keefe's-hosting quiz show (17-17.30) attracted an average of 446,000 spectators.
The second half-hour (17:30-18) soared to 623,000 viewers - a small enough victory over Eddie McGuire's Hot Seat (63,000).
On Monday night, The Chase Australia's first half-hour attendance average was 520,000 spectators, with a whopping 720,000 at the second half-hour.
The hot Seat average was 620,000.
The decrease in the second night of Australia's ratings average brings confidence to Nine channel that Hot Seat will eventually become the most popular program at 5:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia replaced Million Dollar Minute, which failed to cut the number of viewers on McGuire's show.

The final three agree on fathers that Sam Wood is the perfect guy - but who to choose?
The secret has been revealed? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski could accidentally reveal who will win The Bachelor.
That woman's identity has been kept extremely secret with Sam Wood ending up together at The Bachelor.
The three remaining girls don't quip to whoever got the last rose.
However, when we discussed with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before there were two of the three, however, they could inadvertently give a hint of the identity of the winner.
Sam Wood's lips have sealed ahead of Thursday's final
All three women threw themselves poetic to tell how Wood is a perfect man mentioning his sense of humor, ambition, family value and positivity reasons why they would want to be his partner.
However, when asked "If Wood's last rose isn't for you, who should it go to?" their answers might have provided a revelation of what defeated the bachelor's heart.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly cited Mackay as the best option for Wood after them.
Relations between Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been uncomplicated from day one.
"From the moment I walked into the house, the energies of (Sarath's) energies and Sam's energies seemed quite compatible, and that thought was in my mind throughout the series," said Jeavons-Fellows.
"Sarah is really earthy, it's fun to be around him," Markoski added.
I've seen them together and there's chemistry between them.
They seem to be comfortable and relaxed together.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood would be a good match.
Mackay said last week's home visit meetings made him realize that Wood could be "the one."
"When I saw him with my friends and family I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I'm with all my heart now with me here," he said.
Asked who Wood should choose if he didn't, Mackay was mysterious.
"I don't know if I can say," he said.
I like the girls left as much, so it's a draw between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be broadcast at 7.30pm on Ten Channel.

Jarryd Hayne has many options to start his NFL career
Detroit and Seattle were both quite interested in his move to the United States, and many other teams have been asking him about him after his impressively open training day late last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers sledgehammer as well as coach Jim Tomsula, and this appears to have been a wise decision.
Some coaches would have left Hayne on the bench for the rest of the game after how this Australian rugby league convert dropped the ball in its first return of a flight kick as the team beat Minnesota 20-3 on Tuesday.
But Tomsula trusted his man and let Hayne return the next flight kick as well as take him into a running game after Reggie Bush's injury.
Tomsula's true nature was also evident in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of calling his new rookies a potter in front of the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne at a post-game press conference.
49ers Special Reporter Cam Inman reports that Haynea was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget about the dropped ball and worry about the next game.
Jarryd Hayne dropped a plane kick snapped by Minnesota Vikings on first game of play
This certainly wasn't the start that Hayne and his numerous Australian fans wished a man to an NFL debut.
Hayne was seen swearing on his way from the field after a fall, and later told the Australian radio pair Hamish & Andy to 2DayFM channel at 104.1 that he would not have imagined a worse start to his NFL career.
"That was just one of these stuff, you just have to think about the next game and that's it," Hayne said.
Hayne compared his fumbling to his 2007 Origin debut when an assist in his own end zone led to a Queensland goal.
Overall, it was still a great experience for this 27-year-old.
After the game, Hayne posed for a photo posted to her Instagram account with fans holding an Australian flag.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights

Khodorkovsky had openly questioned President Vladimir Putin, so he was convicted, his oil company Yukos was seized and his efforts to support democracy were restricted.
4 killed by police shooting rubber bullets against protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police shot rubber bullets into a crowd protesting against the country's new constitutional proposal, an official said Wednesday.
The violence occurred Tuesday night in the Rupandesh region about 175 miles west of the capital Katmandus.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the region's top official, said more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside the police station, and some threw rocks and fire bombs.
Dhakal said police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resorting to rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets known to kill but traditionally used as a less dangerous option appeared to have caused so many deaths.
The clash was the latest in weeks of violent protests across southern Nepalnised South Atlantic, with members of an ethnic group called Madhesi saying new provinces established under the proposed new constitution undermine their political influence.
There have also been protests in western Nepal as the Tharus group demands its own state.
Since August 10, at least 40 people have been killed in violent clashes, 11 of whom have been police officers.
At the time, four main parties signed an agreement to split the country into provinces - this is a big step toward a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal that has had central government for centuries.
A new constitution has been planned since 2008, but lawmakers accelerated the process after a devastating April earthquake killed thousands of people.
Lawmakers have this week voted on constitutional statements in Katmandu, and officials have said a new charter could be adopted by Sunday.
US National Hurricane Center NHC Says South Cape Verde has a 60 percent chance of a hurricane
On a wide low pressure front, located about 560km south of the southernmost point of the Cape Verde Islands group, there is a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, the US National Hurricane Center said Tuesday.
Another meekly narrowing front of low pressure, located midway between Cape Verde's island group and Small Antilles, also has a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical cyclone over the next two days, the weather forecasting center in Miami added.
Google launches donation campaign to raise tune quid to raise bucks to refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) launched a donation campaign to raise quid to raise novernment 10,000 to humanitarian organizations helping thousands of refugees who came to Europe when they fled war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google had an exceptionally personal perspective on its publication of a donation campaign blog.
In fact, instead of making the announcement, the director wrote about his own personal experience," Google employee Rita Masoud, who fled Kabul at the age of seven.
"We travel included numerous dark train and bus journeys, as well as hunger, thirst, coldness and darkness," he wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and immigration crisis in Europe has grown, people like my family desperately want to help.
The donations will receive four non-profit organisations to help refugees and immigrants: Doctors Without Borders, the International Rescue Committee, Save Children, and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said it will match every donation made worldwide on google.com/refugeerelief worldwide, up to wing 5,000 million, with a total target of ninth 10,000.
Europe is experiencing the worst refugee crisis since World War II, mainly due to Syria's four-year civil war, which has driven more than 4 million people from their homes this year.
Many also flee war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Weight loss surgery may help mildly obese diabetics
According to a new study, the benefits of mildly obese type 2 diabetics from dietary surgery can last for at least five years.
However, it is still too early to say whether these mildly obese diabetics live longer after weight loss surgery than those treated in other ways than surgery.
"It will take a long time to get death data," Dr. Robin Blackstone notes. He is a dieting surgery expert who wrote an editorial for a new study in JAMA Surgery.
In dieting, or bariatric surgery, different methods are used to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit food absorption.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been found to be effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but the majority of people surveyed have been morbidly obese, with their body mass index (BMI) levels of 35 or more.
BMI, i.e. the ratio of weight to length, is considered normal when it is between 18.5 and 24.9.
If BMI is above 25, it indicates that someone is overweight, and if a person’s BMI exceeds 30, they are considered to be obese.
You can calculate your own BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For this new study, researchers at Taiwanese Min-Sheng General Hospital used data collected from 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery, gastric bypass surgery, and gastric reduction, drug-derived treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were mildly obese.
The study showed that the average BMI of people cut from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year.
At the same time, BMI remained broadly the same for individuals treated by other means than surgery.
Thirty-six percent of people cut out diabetes completely and 28 percent partially improve diabetes.
By comparison, in a drug-treated group, diabetes was completely improved by only 1 percent and partly by about 2 percent.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides, as well as a "bad" LDL-chelator, "commonly speaking were better in the surgery group," the authors noted.
Researchers also monitored patients' blood hemoglobin A1c levels, reflecting long-term blood sugar levels.
Hemoglobin A1c should remain below 7%, researchers wrote.
Post-cut haemoglobin A1c levels dropped from about 9 percent to about 6 percent.
However, in the drug treatment group, it remained stable at around 8%.
However, this better "glycaemic control" described by improved haemoglobin levels A1c levels did not reduce mortality over five years, says lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu with his colleagues.
The team also compared average results between two different types of surgery.
At 5 years, when compared to the gastric reduction group, a gastric group with gastric bypass surgery had dropped more weight (18.7 and 14.2 kg), lowered their BMI more (7.4 and 5.1%) levels of haemoglobin A1c levels higher (3.1 percent and 2.1 percent), and were more likely to achieve complete diabetes remission (46.9 percent and 16.7 percent).
Blackstone of the University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix says that while research does not show survival or surgery after five years, there are research results from Sweden, where surgery led to a longer life in heavier people.
A Swedish study found that obese people who undergo weight loss surgery were 29 percent lower likely to die over a 15-year period when compared to a group that had tried more traditional treatments.
Although the new study does not show an improvement in the survival of surgical patients, Blackstone says the results are nevertheless encouraging for individuals with less than 35 BMIs who are interested in surgery.
"The results of research are crucial precisely in showing that surgery is safe for a lower body mass index group," and there is no increased risk of death or kidney disease, he says.
Blackstone adds that both patients and their physicians should take weight very seriously at the point when the patient's BMI is between 27 and 30.
"I think we'll wait too long to take this seriously," he says.
I believe that when a person has collected these genetic changes that permanently prepare their bodies for obesity and diabetes, it is very difficult to reverse the situation.
"No everyone can come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
The Dalai Lama has said that Europe cannot accept all refugees, adding that a real solution to the current refugee crisis is found in the Middle East.
The leader of Tibetan Buddhism has called for an end to violence at the countries of refugees.
The Dalai Lama addressed the ongoing refugee crisis in a speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford at the opening of a ten-day UK visit. The center is dedicated to ethics research.
The Dalai Lama argued that in the current situation, the needs of all mankind should be put before individual peoples or even continents.
He also stressed that while Western European countries' response to the refugee crisis is admirable, it is also inadequate.
"Not everyone can come to Europe," he said in a speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria's actions in crisis, he stressed that this was only a temporary solution.
"It is wonderful to take care of several thousand refugees, but in the meantime we have to think about long-term solutions: how to bring real peace and real development to these Muslim countries, mainly through education.
The ultimate thing is to consider how we can reduce killing in their lands.
We need to reduce the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
In addressing the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions following 9/11 terrorist attacks, claiming that the U.S. violent response caused the chain to be violent.
"After the September 11, I expressed my condolences to President Bush in a letter and told him that a solution to this problem could be found through non-violence.
I know his motives were good, but he used force and it created unexpected consequences," Dalai Lama said.
Over the past four years, swallowing of a child's hand disinfectant has increased fourfold
Poisoning data centers across the United States have reported a rise of nearly 400 percent in swallowing a heavily alcoholic hand disinfectant for children under 12 years of age after 2010, according to a Georgia Poison Data Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, head of the Georgian poisoning data center, disinfectant intoxicant swallowing cases reported to poisoning data centers for children under 12 years of age rose from the 2010 case to the 16117 case of 2014.
"Children are more interested in these products and, unfortunately, a certain percentage of them go to emergency services," Lopez told CNN.
He said some children drink disinfectant on purpose, while some want to impress their friends or meet a challenge on social media.
YouTube features videos of teenagers drinking disinfectant to get a cheap uproar.
Reports say teens have mixed disinfectant with alcoholic tea water to get a stronger drink.
The scents of disinfectant can attract younger children.
"The child doesn't think this is bad for him," Lopez said.
Many of the most interesting (hands) are ones with a scent added.
There are scented disinfectants of strawberries, grapes and oranges, which are very attractive to children.
Hand sanitizer can contain alcohol between 45 and 95 percent.
In young children, in particular, only a few injections are needed to poison poisoning.
"It's really condensed alcohol," Mr. Stephen Thornton, head of medical care at the University of Kansas Hospital's poisoning information center, told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
So you wouldn't leave a whiskey to sit on the table, but hand disinfectant is left visible, and if children are interested in it, it's a quick way to drink a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell is a six-year-old girl who for a while ago swallowed only four of the corrigid strawberry-scented hand disinfectant at school, and was taken to the emergency room to treat.
His blood alcohol level was .179, twice as high as the limit for adult drink-driving, according to first aid clinic doctor Chris Ritchey, who was treating a girl at the Gwinnet Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah savoured a chatter while speaking and couldn't walk when he arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors followed him overnight in a separate pediatric hospital for possible brain injury symptoms, as alcohol caused the girl to fall and hit her head, Ritchey said.
"It was really scary," Nhaith's mother Ortora Scott told CNN.
It could have been a deadly thing to my child.
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products or disinfectant wipes, as well as move disinfectant away from children's reach.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants have been linked to deaths.
In 2013, two Ontario women died after swallowing hand sanitizer containing a toxic, unreported ingredient.
Health officials assume the product contained methanol, a lethal substance, rather than ethyl alcohol, which was indicated as an active ingredient.
In January, in the north of New York State, three fourth-graders planned to poison their "slucky" teacher by spreading a bacterial toxin into a classroom, according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to hand sanitizer and denied it to class.
Police are considering the plan to be prevented as "tilling babbling" and leaving disciplinary action to the school district.

Scots Championship lacks Dutch - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Dutch national team player Ronald de Boer has said Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because it has no competition for the title with the Rangers.
Ajax's current ambassador, de Boer, said: "Netherlands show highlights of Celtic's games anymore, and why?"
Because Rangers aren't involved.
People here can't just talk about Rangers' return.
They're talking about Old Firm teams.
They talk about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
There are a lot of tensions in the games of these teams, and non-Scotlanders also want to follow those games.
Deila vowed to turn the situation around
Ronny Deila has admitted Celtic is in trouble, but the Norwegian boss has vowed to turn the situation around.
A loss to Malmö and the resulting drip from the Champions League was quickly followed by a loss to Aberdeen, who played with ten men, who are now at the top of the series with a five-point lead to the next.
But Deila said, "Celtic has had some bad episodes before, and we're going to rise again."
Now we just want to get out of this situation as quickly as possible.
I know this is frustrating and that many people are very, very angry or sad about what is happening.
We are, too, but we have to keep going.
We really need supporters because it improves players' performance.
Now it's important to stick together.
Warburton on guard over January player transfers
Although Rangers boss Mark Warburton just a few weeks ago commented on possible targets for January player transfers, he is on guard against recruiting the most asserting that he doesn't want to confuse the spirited consensus.
The former Brentford boss said, "The January transfer window is very different compared to a summer window."
For players coming in the summer, there is a period of adjustment before the whole season, which is reflected in our team this season.
The team is doing really well.
Sometimes adding unnecessary players can do more trouble.
Celtic's interest Michu hints of retirement
Swansea striker Michu, whose name has been linked to Celtic in connection with a transfer window, has hinted that he can retire after his contract with Swans runs out.
The 29-year-old player has had ankle problems for two years and failed to find a new club outside Wales during the summer.
Hearts stands ready to fight Scotland's soccer federation over Neilson's comments
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was removed from the field, and the team then lost 3-2. The defender's red card was later rebutted, and this was the third red card condemned by Collum in the past eight months, which was overturned.
Neilson remains behind what he said, claiming, "I didn't question honesty, I didn't comment on performance."
Griffiths swears to avoid Tynecastle
The loyal Hibernian player was reprimanded after admitting to singing an offensive song about former Hearts player Rudi Skacea.
The incident took place at a pub in Roseburn, Edinburg, ahead of Edinburg's derby at Tyncastles Stadium in March 2014.
"It was a derby and it was a spur of the moment," the attacker said, adding: "It's safe to say I'm not going back to Tynecastle, unless I move to Celtic to play for Celtic."
Tannadice's government believes in charge of Dundee United - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly claims that Dundee United's government still has faith in the management team's ability to turn the situation around, but admits that the weakening of players must stop.
"I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We're gonna get the boys right again," Donnelly says.
McInnes delighted to 'worn victory' in Hamilton game
Derek McInnes admits his team, Aberdeen, was desperately hanging in on a game against Hamilton Acism, but managed to reach his seventh consecutive league win at the top of the table five points above Celtic.
McInnes says, "There is no team that won anything, whether it's a trophy or a league that wouldn't have won games like this."
Scottish unemployment remains the same as UK total figure increases
In Scotland, 164,000 people remained in Scotland during the period from May to July, while unemployment in the United Kingdom rose by a total of 1.82 million.
Scotland's unemployment rate of 5.9% is higher than the UK's 5.5 percent, according to figures from the National Bureau of Statistics (ONS).
Meanwhile, unemployment in Scotland fell by 12,000 over a three-month period, with a working figure of 2,612 000 now.
Scotland's employment rate fell to 74 percent over the quarter, higher than the UK average of 73.5%.
Commenting on these latest figures, Scotland's secretary of state, David Mundell said: "The government's long-term plan is to build a foundation for a stronger economy."
Almost exactly a year has passed since Scotland made a historic decision to remain part of the UK.
Over these 12 months, Scotland's labour market has improved, employment has risen and unemployment has fallen.
Why I testify to execution in Oklahoma
If there is no legal intervention, I will see a man executed later today.
If that happens, and I hope no, I'll sit on viewers' gallery at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary prison to watch Richard Glossip executed with a lethal injection.
He has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
I received a request in January through his best friend, and even though I was upset, I agreed.
I've started to abhor this day as it approaches.
So why did I agree?
I agreed to, because I thought it would be a good way to tell the full story of the death penalty.
It would provide a unique perspective.
Of course, journalists have the opportunity to follow executions in America, and since there are often more than available places to apply, participants are selected through a horrendous draw.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of places reserved for the media from twelve to five.
Whoever is chosen will look at the event cool.
I can't do that.
I will sit next to Richard Glossip’s closest friends, and I have also created my own connection to him through calls over months and one two-and-a-half hour visit.
I like a man.
We laugh often when we talk.
Prison officials say I can't be both a witness and a journalist, so I'm not allowed to have a notebook and pen with me to record what I saw.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
On Twitter, a journalist from Okeroma accused me of compromising my neutrality.
Here's a lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story as he wants to, and you'll get involved.
I complained to a journalist.
He acknowledged that "had to put his words better," but still thinks what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip has disagreed with some of my messages and things I wrote.
He won't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do that even if he says.
I've told him he can remove me from his witness list anytime.
But he wants an international journalist to be there to write about it.
If Glossip dies, he believes publicity will help to oppose the death penalty.
Huffington Post reporter Kim Bellware is at my side.
If you want to know more about the story, you can listen to podcasts I made a series of podcasts.
I won't go through all the details again.
I can't tell you Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of aiding and acquittal anyway.
But I think there's a very strong chance of not committing murder.
I am sure I do not have enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think it's wrong to execute him.
And this is the perspective of which I consider him to die.
I cannot claim to be completely neutral.
There will be other journalists to see to it.
I'll give you a description of what it feels like to watch a man I like to die unnecessarily.
Man lured out of Canning River after a watery cop hunt
Canning Vale's officer remained dry as he lured a man out of the Canning River.
An attempt by a man from Perth to distract cops from his stumps went wrong when he found himself in a low, muddy water just metres from a police officer trying to "look him off right back to the beach."
Canning Vale police were called Tuesday to Beckenham for an unauthorized intrusion.
When they spotted the suspect, he tried to distract them by heading into the Canning River.
But he didn't get very far.
"He was standing in the water, saying, 'I'm not coming away, come get me,'" said Sgarter Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec didn't want his uniform to get wet, so he used a safer tactic: "pretty police negotiation."
"Sometimes people do funny things to try to escape," said Senior Constable Castledine.
Master football player Ben Cousins is a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins abandoned his car to avoid blowing and tried to swim across the Swan River.
He did not succeed in his attempt, but inspired locals to start planning a playful Ben Cousins bian.
Peter Moody claims editors tried to spy on him and threaten to stop competing
Peter Moody has claimed that Racing Victoria officials tried to infiltrate their spys at his stables last year, and threaten to stop competing immediately.
He blames the agents and Racing Victoria's integrity division, claiming they have a personal campaign going against him. Wednesday's late rejection of Lady Tatai for a treatment procedure on race day was the final straw.
Moody told Fairfax Media his goal has always been to do what is best for competition, and that he has found himself in a tricky situation after Lidar's unexplained positive cobalt sample.
He has kept his tongue in check with spy claims for a year and a half, and didn't want to be "its look like a jealousy."
"I wasn't going to say anything about this, and I've been quiet about it for a long time, but sometimes I get so frustrated that everything erupts at once," Moody said.
They knew the situation continued.
Sometimes I just have to react and live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I have said.
I'm going home today and sleep well.
I want to walk with my head held high and I want the owners to think I'm doing my best to face them.
When they start thinking differently, then I don't have to continue as a coach anymore.
I would have to consider what I'm doing to my license.
Earlier, Moody dropped a bomb in an interview with racing.com saying the integrity department had tried to spy on his stables.
"A month and a month ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - I name him when asked to ask him - and offered him a job in my stables if he passed on to information about what I'm doing there.
They obviously think I'm a fraud.
If that's the case, they should resign their lawyers, because they have failed to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former chairman of Racing Victoria, David Moodie, current president of Racing Victoria, as well as Bernard Saundry, current CEO of Racing Victoria, were all clear at the time and will be clear about it today.
Should I start thinking this is becoming personal?
Has Victoria Racing finally decided to manly and perhaps shift responsibility to non-trainers for what is happening in the industry?
Am I harmful to the industry?
Am I so harmful to the industry?
Maybe people think so.
Maybe they have to take my licenses and push me aside, and I have no doubt that the things I'm saying now may make them think about it.
But I'm at the point where I don't care anymore, and it saddens me.
It really saddens me.
I press them to make a decision that is their responsibility.
I have my family support, and I can turn my back on him.
The coach's frustration has increased with long-term Lidar cobalt research, and a late rejection led him to determine that he could "throw his license over the table."
Moody, best known for coaching undefeated champion Black Caviar, has called the race day care measures rule "ridiculous" after mute or sages is put at the feet of a horse, which is illegal.
"It's against competition rules.
I have to take full responsibility for that," he said.
One of my employees mistakenly put mud on it.
It could have had a shot last night.
It could have been yesterday, as it was.
It had it on race day.
Moody may face a three-month ban on race day of funnel, for which officials began an investigation.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules know nothing about a horse.
"We all understand that rules are needed, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
Driver who commits escape at Cobram arrested
Police have arrested a man who committed a traffic escape after colliding a cyclist with a cyclist in Cobram at the weekend.
A cyclist was transported by air to Royal Melbourne Hospital after suffering serious injuries when a car hit him on the Murray Valley highway Saturday morning.
Police said the driver drove away and didn't stop to help the injured cyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia claimed to police at Shepparton.
He will be charged with non-stop in an accident, neglect of assistance, and other traffic violations.
A cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, is still in hospital and his condition is stable.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy attacks rivals in wrestling claims
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has criticised the claims of two NRL RuGB band champion favorites for his team's tackles as part of a "line."
Trent Robinson, the Sydney Roosters coach, said referees allowed Storm to "wrestling" on their own side when they unexpectedly won final qualifiers in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett barely snapped up with his reference to Stormi after it beat the North Queensland Cowboys Saturday night in a final qualifier. Bennett called the game a rugby league "sample window" and said two Queensland teams were not "very enthusiastic" of wrestling.
Bellamy defended her team's tackles and said they just focus on "contact" while tacked.
Bellamy added that his confidence was boosted by criticism of two leading coachs for Stormi, meaning they fear they will lose to the team.
"This always comes up - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when we lost 24-2 to them," Bellamy said Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything in our defense systems or technologies throughout the year. Over the past six weeks, we've just put a weight of contact with tackles, and that's made us successful.
Trent has been on the team for three years, and he obviously has a great team to coach, so he probably isn't used to losing, and this was a bit of a shock to him.
It's funny how this always comes up at this time of year.
Bellamy challenged Bennett's idea of "an exciting rugby" by reminding her mentor that Bennett-t coached St George Illawarra Dragons won the championship in 2010 by playing "abandoned."
Wayne talks about exciting rugby.
He thought it was important to compare Saturday night's game to our Friday night game and tell them how exciting their game was," Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010 St George was often criticized for being a boring team, and Wayne said he couldn't care less.
But now he has a team capable of playing the kind of rugby that we find exciting, especially when he has fast young guys.
You want to play a game like that when you have players of that type.
He brought that up in 2010, now he wants everyone to play rugby of his style - not every team of guys like Anthony Milford or Ben Hunt to play that way.
I'm going to be more confident when they say things like this because they're a little worried about playing against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us as resistance to important games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game between Storm and Roosters was more point-rich than played between the Broncos and the Cowboys.
I'm sure the Broncos game was a good game, I haven't watched it yet, but how did it end? 16-12?
Our game was 20-18, so we had two goals more but is it exciting rugby?
Or is it going to be broken an exciting defensive line and not to score?
For me, this is about policies.
If they mention us, it means at some point we can play against them.
Storm has free time this weekend because they have already won the right to a home game against either North Queensland Cowboys or Cronulla Sharks for next Saturday night's pre-final at AAMI Park. Tickets will go on sale next Tuesday morning.
Serb Man Gets Towards Towards Towards Towards Cause of Drug Charge
A man facing a potential life sentence for attempting to possess 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled to Queensland has been released for a buck of 6-000,000.
29-year-old Marko Maksimovic is one of five men arrested last month after federal police tracked 100 pounds of drugs to Solay yacht who came to South America via Vanuatu and docked in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was seen seeing other defendants in a maryard all morning, and after that he met them at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe, where police found 40 pounds of drugs in a Toyota Echo car.
Although Maksimovic faces a potential life sentence for a attempt to possess a quantity of cocaine specific to business, his lawyer claimed there was no evidence that Maksimovic tried to hold the entire amount, and that he may have been in a coffee shop for completely innocent reasons.
Peter Flanagan, a Supreme Court justice, was concerned that Maksimovic is trying to escape.
"He has close links to Serbia.
He travels to Serbia often," he told the court Wednesday.
In a criminal case, Maksimovic lied to the police about the place where he lived.
Maksimovic's mother and stepfather had jointly offered a tune of tune of buckling to ensure her exemption.
"After reading the affidavits of both individuals, it is clear that setting a buck200 buck against a buck is a real financial burden for them," Judge Flanagan said.
But that alone was not enough to stop him from appearing at justice, he warned.
Maksimovic was given guarantees on the condition that he handed over his passports from both Australia and Serbia, reports to the police on a daily basis and to uphold his curfew between 6pm and 6 a.m.
Stevan Hogg used girl's phone to tempt pedophiles to send pictures
A paedophile used the 11-year-old girl's phone to ask for pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took her phone while sleeping and then logged in to an online communications service, where Hogg received numerous indecent images of the children another user sent her.
The girl later woke up, noticed that the phone was missing and found it sleeping Hogg's hand.
The girl examined her phone and found shocking messages, then she immediately told her mother.
In the scene, police saw five images, searched computers at the scene and found "worrying" web searches with search terms used to search for insightless images of children.
Hogg then claimed to officers that he had done this to "attract paedophiles" on the Internet, before he "prevent to be a police officer to scare them."
Eilidh Robertson, a Fiscal depute representative, told the Dundeen Sheriff Court court the following: "He said it was an addiction - that he depends on scaring people.
He admitted that he had carried out searches on a computer but said they were made only because he wanted to pretend to be a police officer to scare pampering pedophiles.
He was asked about discussions with an unknown person who sent him the photos, as well as when Hogg asked the person to send additional photos.
Hogg said he only did this for baiting purposes.
He said he's got a sick time to get drunk, and he wants to look at pictures of rapes and murders.
Robertson added: "When a girl found the photos on her phone, she screamed at her mother, shaking and crying.
My mother saw the photos on the phone and then confronted the defendant.
The girl was interviewed, and told me the defendant had used a computer and a Playstation to talk to girls who looked younger than her.
Hogg, 23, who lives at Ward Road in Dundee, pleaded guilty to charges of preparing or taking pictures of promiscuous children on June 14 last year. He broke his bail on January 25th of this year and failed to appear before a court on March 24 of this year.
Defense attorney Gregor Sim asked Hogg not to be entered in the sex offenders' register, as it can be argued that his crime did not include a "significant sexual element."
Sheriff Alistair Carmicheal sentenced to October to provide social services to prepare background reports.
Hogg was given bail in this case, but in other ongoing cases he is in custody before the hearing.
He was added to the sex offenders register before the sentencing date.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe makes a false speech to parliament
Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell on the steps leading to a podium earlier this year.
He was not injured, but a video of the fall spread like a virus on social media.
Parliament's opening was also tarnishing claims from opposition lawmakers that they had been sent anonymous death threats warning them not to booing Mugabe during his speech.
Last month, they booed and interrupted him with interludes as he gave a speech to Parliament on the state of the country - a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
Innocent Gonese, a group discipline over the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) party, said seven opposition politicians had received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to interfere with Mugabe's speech.
"The noise from which the message was sent is not answered, but the message is titled 'death'," Gonese told reporters after Mugabe's speech.
The message warned relevant members that immunity would end in Parliament, and when they step out, parliamentary immunity is not in effect.
The group discipline supervisor said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, is "concerning" of threats to its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard to cut up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is prepared to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of its restructuring and cost cutting efforts in the business services business.
Later this year, HP will be split into two listed companies, separating its computer and printer business from faster-growing corporate hardware and service operations.
Expected job cuts will bring around cyclically 0.7 billion expenses starting at a quarter of a quarter, an HP statement said.
"These restructuring efforts will allow for a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," noted Meg Whitman, HP president and chief executive, leading the unit after split.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than modern-day HP, and we will have a broad and deep range of services to help businesses transition to new business," Whitman said.
As a separate company, our ability to meet the evolving needs of our customers around the world is better than ever.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise's annual revenue will be more than buckberning, and "follows to produce unmatched integrated technology solutions" for businesses, according to a company statement.
The division dissolves a company founded by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, graduates of Stanford University, in the 1930s to manufacture electrical supplies. The company operated in a garage in Palo Alto called "City of the Silicon Valley Birth."
HP has been through a huge restructuring to cope with the transition from traditional computers to mobile devices.
HP is the world's second largest computer manufacturer and one of the largest technology companies in the U.S., and its distribution is the latest in an industry based on the belief that strictly limited firms perform better.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says teammates must support injured Jack Wilshere before Dinamo Zagreb draw
Wenger has also stressed to Wilshire that it is only September and assuming he is going to be rehabbing going according to plan, there is no reason why he would not be playing again by Christmas.
Even at this best, Wilshire misses at least four of England's games, and given his background, it is uncertain whether he will take part in next summer's European Championships.
The biggest pity in this last problem is that Wilsheren's end of last season was strong after a single ankle injury, and he recalled his old sharpness before the start of the season.
"A type of injury like this doesn't threaten a career," Wenger said.
It's a bone that didn't heal properly.
It's nothing strange.
It was just an accident.
It has nothing to do with his ankles or previous injuries he's had.
This may be true from a medical point of view, but, as Wenger also admitted, when a player tries to return in the middle of the season, there is always a risk of additional injuries.
There is also an uncomfortable model.
Studies by Premier Injuries Ltd show that Wilsherate has suffered 23 different injuries since debuting six years ago.
In addition, in the past five seasons, he has played Arsenal from 157 league games in just 65 games.
Looking at Arsenal's wider ensemble since the 2007-08 season, six of the eight seasons it has been another of the Premier League teams that have lost the most days due to injury.
Wenger admits to a vicious circle of pro-truths, but Arsenal believes their improvements to injury statistics last season continue.
"Sometimes when you recover from an injury, there may be a prone period when you have to strengthen your body and get competition," Wenger said.
Jack is young enough to get over it.
I hope his body will stabilize, I'm sure it will, and that he will have a career he deserves to.
Wenger is preparing to recycle his team as Arsenal begin their Champions League game on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb, then playing against Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday.
Hpctor Beller's and Aaron Ramsey haven't traveled to Croatia, meaning Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to be started.
Wenger can also replace Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud's Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I try to maintain balance and give a respite to players who need it," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal are clear forward-looking Group F, Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is among the most frightening in Europe.
Dinamo also hasn't lost in 41 games since they produced their own "Unwillible" campaign last season.
The stadium was rocked Tuesday night by an earthquake of magnitude 3.2 on the Richter scale.
That was the 10th in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes Arsenal have learned from last season's Champions League surrender to Monaco, and is still motivated by a distant dream of leading the team to its first European Cup victory.
"This motivation is huge," Wenger said.
Arsenal has never achieved it.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand I can be realistic.
We are ambitious, but not a dreamer.
FriendsFest: comedy series that taught us serious things about friendship between men
It is striking how similar descriptions are in series, especially given that the need for men to open up is more desperate than ever, and suicide rates among young men higher than for fifteen years.
In 2013, suicide was the highest cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in men in Britain, three times more common in men than women.
The company to tackle the problem of Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced the year of men. The goal was to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of meeting this challenge.
The recent study included more than 2,000 secondary school and high school pupils showing depressive symptoms. According to the study, a person's chance of recovery doubled if a percentage of his friends were "healthy."
So in those who were not depressed, the likelihood of potential mental health problems occurring halved if they had mentally sound friends.
But for friendship to work, it must be available first.
In this time of social media communication, the style passes the content and the immediacy of the answer is often more important than meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to seem strong, joyful and successful, when in reality isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by the values that psychologists call external: money, image, social status. All of this is at the expense of internal values - inner longing for personal growth and friendship - that more deeply affect our mental health.
And as the billionaire video game developer explained recently, money really doesn't get greater happiness.
The fine thing about friends was precisely that it turned this focus on its head.
None of the characters defined their work, but rather their personalities, which stood out clearly in interaction as friends.
Joey and Chandler's numerous hugs, moments in nice chairs watching football, Ross misses Rachel - their humor came from knowing that yes, men can relate to all of this, even though they often hesitate to fully examine their feelings.
As the Samaritans volunteer explained to me: ... "I listen to people who are depressed and self-destructed, I've really understood how the smallest interaction with a friend can improve."
Often men who contact us feel that they cannot talk to friends.
The old thought of "sucscapement" is strong, as is the feeling that if you open up about problems, you're seen as weak.
Friends is one of those series that comes to mind when I try to offer more long-term coping methods.
It highlighted the small moments of friendship between men.
While unbiased, outside my outside station at the other end of my phone helps people with moments of despair, long-time support comes from a closeer, personal family and friend network.
And if you attend Comedy Central’s FriendsFest this weekend, and all the locations have been redesigned to celebrate the celebration, why not take your friends to a coffee at Central Perki.
Or, better than that, if you see someone lonely in Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You never know how much your friendship can mean.
Friends sent to Comedy Central from start to finish, all 236 episodes, participate in FriendsFest
Di Maria scores to score and helps PSG slap Malmo to side
Angel Di Maria celebrates goals against Malmö with Blaise Matuid and Edinson Cavani.
Angel Di Maria scored in his Champions League debut, helping PSG to overtake Swedish team Malmö on Tuesday.
Below is a match report and reactions to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on the right track when Paris Saint Saint-Germain started their Champions League game with a comfortable 2-0 win against Malmö at Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored less than four minutes in her Champions League debut, pointing to the French league leaguers, but the team missed several opportunities before eventually adding to their lead as Cavan struck in the 61st minute of the goal.
Paris, who are in the same Group A with Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, needed a strong start against the Swedish league champion, as there was not only a runner-up spot in the game, but also an improvement in their quarter-final-leading games in the final three rounds of the final three rounds
But while PSG took the score, it wasn't a classic game, as Laurent Blanc's team Zlatan Ibrahimovic lost a place in front of goal and later was substituted from the field. Malmö is his old hometown team and the team in which he began his brilliant career in 1999.
"It's not easy to beat in the Champions League at home or away, so a 2-0 win creates problems for the opponent and looks good in the statistics, and there's a good start, even if there are things we're going to have to hone this season," Blanc said.
This is foreshadowing good.
We wanted to win and won, although I regretted we didn't manage to score one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned to the Parisian team after an injury with one of the three changes made after the team missed a 2-2 draw in Ligue 1's home game against Bordeaux at the weekend, but was overshadowed by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
When he moved from Manchester United last month, the Argentinian wing striker was named a man who takes PSG to a new level in Europe, and he proved why when he ran Marco Verratt's pass behind Malmö's defensive line and then struck a beautiful finish past Johan Wiland into the back corner of the net.
But if someone was expecting a quick and big win from PSG, they were disappointed.
Malmö was a stuffy opponent. It beat Celtic in a deciding match to reach this level, its opening field has nine international players and a five-man defense, as well as two players in a deep midfield.
But the team offered little on the offensive side other than a shot by Nikola Djurdjic in the 34th minute, which went nip past Kevin Trapp's goalpost.
Instead, PSG were sometimes stranded by missed passes and poor finishing, Ibrahimovic, who failed to fail in five attempts overall in the first half alone and after being disappointed when Cavani put the ball in for Ibrahimovic's touch at the start of the second half.
But he was much more effective in making pre-work to his colleagues, and it was from Ibrahimovic's pass that Di Maria sent a twist kick to the way, tipped around the Wiland goalpost at 52nd minute.
The second goal was finally scored by Cavani, a Uruguayan of Uruguayan who struck his sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic scuffled forward with Maxwell's cross-assward pass from the left.
That's where Malmo's hopes of getting back into the game, and only Wiland's brilliant save from David Luiz's direct kick kept the closing numbers down, before the changeover Ezequiel Lavezzi goal was disallowed right at the end of the game.
Malmö coach Age Hareide later admitted PSG were as high as his teams. The Norwegian said: "Our last Champions League game was in December last year."
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, which is not of the same standard.
Qualifying matches are not enough.
I'll take my hat to Paris.
This was a great game from them.
Glencore raises bucks 2.5 billion through share sale
Glencore, a Swiss mining industry giant, suffering from a price crash of basic commodities, raised  USD 2.5 billion on Wednesday by selling shares as part of its extensive debt cut plan.
Glencore, who is listed on the London Stock Exchange, told the announcement that it had sold new shares worth about 6% to reduce its debt.
A company that lost 57 percent of its market value this year is struggling with plummeting commodity prices as China's economic slowdown strains demand and wreaks havoc on all markets.
The re-entry put the value of Glencore's shares at the top of the London Stock Exchange in Wednesday's morning trades.
Shares rose 2.77 percent in the FTSE 100 index of 131.60 pence, which opened 0.69 percent higher.
Glencore had uncovered trading of DM5 billion in shares in the previous week as part of his broader plan to cut its buckling rate by about a third.
The company sold new share capital with 125 pence shares of the stock, which meant a 2.4 percent discount at Tuesday's closing price.
The company sold 1.3 billion shares worth 9.99 percent of the Group.
Concerns about the long-standing escalation of Chinese growth have cut iron ore prices by about half, while prices of coal, copper and other commodities have fallen by 20 to 40 percent.

Matt Damon downplays diversity in filmmaking
Matt Damon clashed with African-American filmmaker Effie Brown as they discussed a difference of contention, which Damon says is not needed behind the scenes.
In a Sunday episode of HBO's Project Greenlight, an experienced actor interrupted Brown as he highlighted the need for different perspectives on the dark-skinned protagonist of the selected script for the project.
"When we talk about diversity, it is taken into account when choosing actors for a film, not a series," Damon claimed.
The shocked Brown reacted with an incredulous disbelief of the injured, commenting "Oop! Wow. Okay," while The Martian's actor's comments were left hanging in the air.
Other producers Ben Affleck and Farrelly brothers joined Damon and Brown to discuss the show's finalists.
"I want to invite people to think, no matter how they treat Harmony's character," Brown said at the start.
The only dark character is a whore hit by her white pimp.
The Dear White People producer called for the rights to direct the film to the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio; Damon harshly replied that their guidance "can end to giving us something we don't want."
After the conversation was posted, social media exploded to frowned out of Damon's comments.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed his anger at the filming intention, writing: "Matt Damon talking to the only black person in the room and explaining to him diversity is SOE WHITE that it hurts."
The tweets gathered more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since its release.
Damon's comments coincide with a moment of accurate racial representation in the media at the forefront of social debate.
After a Caucasian police officer killed teenage Michael Brown in 2014, The Black Lives Matter movement spread nationwide and urged lawmakers and authorities to stop practices discriminating against colored people.
In February, singer Prince referred to the showup of the album of the Year nominees for a Grammy Award.
"Albums still matter," he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still matter.
Black Lives Matter executives recently released a statement to answer Fox News' television face Elisabeth Hasselbeck's question about whether the group should be considered a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter Network is a love group," the leaders said.
It was recently reported that Damon is involved in it among entertainers, producers and media moguls invited to the pope for a visit to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is unclear whether he has accepted an invitation or already met with the pope.
First American Ninja Warrior Master Crowned
Isaac Caldiero, a professional rock guitar player and dish collector, became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior competition on Monday and received a top prize of 10,000 euros as a reward.
It is in the competition program that decided its seventh season of seasons never had a rival who has survived all sections of the obstacle course of the program.
In the show's final episode, two men, Caldiero as well as cameraman Geoff Britten, made it to the final round.
In the last mission, a rope of about 23 metres was to be climbed in 30 seconds.
Britten climbed first and cleared the challenge on time, making him the first ever athlete to clear the exhausting 4th leg of American Ninja Warrior. But Caldiero cleared the challenge three seconds faster, making him a winner.
Caldiero gave an interview to E!News after a difficult win and was still in shock to win a top prize of 10,000 euros.
"It's great to think about this when I've never made or lived more than a maximum of 10,000 dollars a year," Isaac told E! after his big pay rise.
So I suddenly... I can't even imagine what this will become... the future is unknown.
Production director Kent Weed sat down to discuss a fiinalist with The Hollywood Reporter, as well as why the Briton doesn't get more reward money, even though he's the first ever contestant to successfully pass the track.
Under the rules, money goes to the fastest person.
"If more than one person passes, the money gets the one with the fastest time," Weed said.
Even though money is a great reward and changes life, he does have a great sense of satisfaction.
I don't think he feels a grudge over it.
He's just so happy he's gotten to do what he did.
His fans have praised him.
He's a great guy and a good family man.
He's a hero to his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If anyone had to beat me, I'm happy it was Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have thought the same way if this had gone the other way.
American Ninja Warrior returns to the eighth season, filming of which will begin in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers sneak past Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- The second half of the season hasn't been very funny to the Detroit Tigers.
The Tigers were one of the best baseball teams, but is now last in the American League Central division.
The Tigers played their scupper role perfectly Tuesday when they beat the Minnesota Twins 5-4 on Target Field.
Twins lost a chance to get up a half-game from the Houston Astros in a race for another American League wild card spot.
For Detroit, for at least one night, the game was a return to a six-letter H-word, which had been very hard to reach for most of the latter half of the season.
"All wins are fun, no matter how to get them," said Brad Ausmus, Tigers team director.
Tigers pitcher Alfredo Simon continued his early offensive support when Detroit made a run three times in the first two innings, followed once in the sixth and one more ninth.
Simon (13-9) pitched 6 1/3 innings and allowed three runs.
This was only his third of his quality start in the last nine games.
"I just want a strong ending for this year," Simon said.
It's tricky to pitch to the alternator every game, and that's why I want to go deep into the game.
Tigers substitute Victor Martinez hit three times and allowed for two runs, which were his first beaten runs after mid-August.
This was Martinez's first three-blind night since he hit four times against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He waved the bat well," Ausmus said.
He looked good (in batting practice), looked significantly better in batting practice and continued to do the same model in the game.
Twins were three runs behind the second half of the seventh inning, and that was their best chance of getting back into the game.
Center Byron Buxton started the inning by striking out twice to the left field line.
Right side Aaron Hicks homed with a snap of one nest, and Simon was able to burn out the other receiver Brian Dozier straight before Simon was replaced by left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy walked Mauer, the only player against the only one who took a startling surrogate Miguel Sano, who yanked two nests to the left of right-handed Drew VerHagen.
With two runners on the pitch and leveling up at second base, VerHagen got third base Trevor Plouffe to beat the ground shot leading to a double game.
It was a premiership record: the 27th time this season Plouffe hit a double game.
After Detroit had a stench-up race at the ninth start, Mauer yanked two slammed runs against Tigers shutter Bruce Rondon, and the score was 5-4.
But a right-handed player burned Sano in three pitches in his fifth save.
Detroit used the rusty Phil Hughes at the start.
The Tigers got three runs in the first two innings against a right-handed veteran player who got off the injured list before the game after being off for more than a month of lower back infection.
"It's obvious that I didn't want this kind of start," Hughes said, "but as the game progressed, I felt more comfortable, and I felt I was able to make some nice pitches on the third innings."
After Hughes snagged the starting miss to the first nest, he allowed another receiver player Ian Kinsler to advance in between.
Right side J.D. Martinez's walking in a two-fire situation brought Victor Martinez to a batting effort, taking himself to the first base by midfield punch and causing the game's first run.
Victor Martinez snapped his 0-21 streak with runners in good running positions.
Nick Castellanos, a third base player, continued to hit right and causing a second run, but a threatening situation ended when Victor Martinez was disqualified as he tried to advance to third base.
The Tigers continued with the second inning to get one fire, in a two-othelm situation with a run from catcher James McCann and two fires, one-heft centre Anthony Gosse, followed by a 3-0 situation.
"It was an important punch," Twins team leader Paul Molitor said.
He didn't hit very well, but it flew to the right spot.
Hughes began to serve and pitched a runningless third inning, followed by a right-handed extension A.J. Achter.
Hughes was counted three runs from six strokes as well as a walk with four fires.
NOTE: Tigers' right-hand pitcher Anibal Sanchez was forced away by a sprain on the shoulder of a throwing hand.
He is being investigated by Dr. James Andrews, who cut Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez has been on the injured list since mid-August due to a shoulder vet, but was supposed to return Wednesday.
With Sanchez out, left-handed pitcher Daniel Norris comes off the injured list to start against Twins.
Norris statistics at the Tigers are 1-1 in four starts after left-hander David Price was replaced with him on July 30.
Norris has been out since August 20 due to the right slanted abdominal muscle spriging.
The Tigers and Twins' three-game series ends Wednesday at the Target Field.
Norris (2-2-, 4.43 ERA) runs against Minnesota's right-hand pitcher Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi urges opening economy more widely to the world
The economy must open more to the outside world to promote growth," President Xi Jinping told a group to steer reform on Tuesday.
"China should commit to attracting foreign funding and expertise and developing transparency policy," he said, speaking at the 16th meeting of the group leading to deepening general reform.
Supporting transparency at the same time as reforms are pushing forward for more new movement and vitality, as well as creating a new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The management team adopted a series of guidelines including a negative market access list, denigration of border control principles, calls on state-owned enterprises to seize private capital, and revise the population registration system.
According to the statement, a negative list will be created to name sectors and companies in which they are not allowed to invest.
The system will be gradually tested and improved through pilot programmes.
The change is considerable as it will give a greater role to the market in allocating resources, ensuring a legal business environment and making markets more transparent, the statement said.
The government also loosens its control over the power it distributes to businesses, thus ensuring that companies decide for themselves how to manage their business operations.
The statement also said that China will allow border regions to explore new cross-border economic cooperation models as well as new mechanisms for regional growth development.
To open up government-dominated sectors to private financiers, more sectors open.
"The government will not change its policy regarding foreign investment, and it will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies as well as provide them with better services," the statement said.
In addition, the application process for permanent resident permits for foreign permanent resident permissions, "green Cards", is facilitated by optimizing requirements and reducing the application process.
The meeting also discussed guaranteeing lawyers' professional rights, as well as supporting professional judges and prosecutors.
Prime Minister Li Keqiang, as well as senior leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, were also attended by a statement released after the meeting.
