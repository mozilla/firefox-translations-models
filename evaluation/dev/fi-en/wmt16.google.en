A 9-year-old boy who was on the run in Tampere was found
The police have been on a search mission due to the runaway of a 9-year-old boy in Tampere on Tuesday evening.
A missing report about a boy who went out with his friend from West Tampere has spread on social media.
According to the police situation center, contact has been made with the boy, and there is no danger to his life or health.
The boy&#39;s father told Ilta-Sanom at midnight that the boy had been found.
He is fine and now we start the post-debriefing.
The boy was found in the vicinity of the home, the father said.
Ronaldo again fierce - tore the goal difference to Messi
Cristiano Ronaldo scored five goals in the Spanish league at the weekend and continued his success in the Champions League as well.
The battle between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo for the top scorer in the Champions League turned in favor of the latter, at least for a while.
Real Madrid&#39;s Ronaldo went solo on top of the all-time goalscoring record when he fired two goals from the penalty spot and one from play into the net for visitors Shakhtar Donetsk.
Ronaldo increased his goal balance to 80, while Barcelona&#39;s Messi, who was tied with him before Tuesday, has a total of 77 hits.
Real won the match 4-0.
Since the beginning of the season, Juventus has struggled in the Italian football league Serie A, but in the D group of the Champions League, it started strongly with a 2-1 away win over Manchester City.
Juventus&#39; Alvaro Morata scored the winning goal ten minutes before the end.
City&#39;s attack was dulled by the absence of Sergei Aguero, who had a knee problem.
Aguero, who was injured in the Premier League game at the weekend, only entered the field in the last ten minutes.
Manchester&#39;s other club United also had a hard time in Holland against PSV Endhoven after suffering a 1-2 defeat.
ManU&#39;s 20-year-old fullback Luke Shaw&#39;s away match only lasted a quarter of an hour.
PSV&#39;s Hector Moreno&#39;s dangerous-looking sliding tackle hit the ManU pack attacking the goal so badly that Shaw probably broke his tibia.
Shaw lay on the grass of Eindhoven&#39;s home stadium for ten minutes before the medical staff left to transport him to the hospital.
Memphis Depay gave the visitors a 1-0 lead in the 41st minute, but ManU&#39;s joy only lasted a few minutes.
Moreno equalized before the break in added time.
Luciano Narsingh scored PSV&#39;s winning goal in the second half.
Group A Paris Saint-Germain started the scoring season in the Champions League.
The case involved the Argentinian Angel Di Maria, who changed his Manchester United shirt to a PSG bunt.
Di Maria broke through from the right and lifted the ball into the back corner past Malmö goalkeeper Johan Wiland.
Edinson Cavani made it 2-0 for PSG in the second half.
PSG has been predicted to be among the season&#39;s winners.
The assumption is not wrong, but Malmö, which belongs to the league&#39;s smaller clubs, is not the best possible comparison target.
PSG&#39;s star striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic faced his starting club Malmö FF for the first time in his professional career.
Ibrahimovic started his career in Malmö in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played 90 minutes when his team CSKA Moscow lost 0-1 to Wolfsburg in the B group match in Germany.
The opposition party immediately called for resignation - the president gave a wrong speech
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe made the same speech he had made a month ago.
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe has repeated the same speech he gave at the end of last month in the country&#39;s parliament.
During his 25-minute speech, Mugabe apparently did not realize that the speech was the same.
The speech raised doubts about whether the 91-year-old Mugabe is still alive.
The main opposition MDC party called for Mugabe to step down because he is too old to rule.
Mugabe&#39;s aides were quick to say that the mix-up had only occurred in Mugabe&#39;s staff and that the president had done nothing wrong.
Mugabe&#39;s speech dealt with China&#39;s influence on the country&#39;s economy in the past and now.
Germany and Austria want an extra summit on the refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have proposed an extra summit of EU leaders for next week because of the refugee crisis.
President of the European Council Donald Tusk, who heads the summits, evaluates the request.
According to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the heads of state should discuss cooperation with countries of origin and how those coming to Europe could be registered more efficiently.
According to Merkel, negotiations on quotas for asylum seekers are on the table of the interior ministers.
A teacher admits to shooting his girlfriend during an emergency call
Shannon Lamb, a college teacher with only a slight voice, tells the police during an emergency call that he shot his girlfriend and that the police need to come to their house.
Lamb emphasized that his &quot;golden dog&quot; is alive and probably upset, and said that the contact information of the dead woman&#39;s next of kin can be found on her phone.
Inside the house, police found Amy Prentiss&#39; body and a handwritten note on the page: &quot;I&#39;m so sorry I wish I could take this back I loved Amy and she&#39;s the only woman who&#39;s ever loved me,&quot; said the letter, which experts say was signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who taught two online courses at Delta State University in Cleveland, Minnesota, had already traveled nearly 500 miles to the school&#39;s campus, where police believe he shot and killed a tenured history teacher, Ethan Schmidt, at his office door.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said university officials heard about the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He said Lamb made the fatal 911 call some time after that.
By the end of the day, the death toll rose by one more: Lamb committed suicide while surrounded by police.
Authorities were still trying to determine Lamb&#39;s motive a day after students and staff had to hide behind locked doors due to the school shooting.
Investigators on both sides of the state have released information that students and staff described Lamb as a talented teacher who may have had issues.
Students said they had been waiting for his classes.
Police in Gautier, the town where Prentiss died, say Lamb had no violent past or criminal record.
Schmidt himself had included Lamb in a book he wrote, in which he thanked the “great people” with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History, which has a total of 17 staff members, and many of the students attended both men&#39;s courses.
On the other hand, there were some signs of trouble.
A student named Brandon Beavers praised Lamb, but said he also seemed nervous and restless, &quot;like something was wrong.&quot;
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamb told him he had a lot of stress at the end of the 2014-15 school year.
Lamb had previously requested sick leave from Delta State University, saying he had some sort of health problem.
This year, he only taught two online courses.
Recent changes in the university&#39;s hiring policies meant that although Lamb had worked hard for his doctorate, it did not guarantee him automatic career advancement and an assistant professorship.
University President William LaForge said that as far as he knew, there was no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that &quot;something was clearly on Lamb&#39;s mind.&quot;
Lamb can no longer answer these questions.
After Lamb fled campus, police tracked him down when he moved back to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb shot himself with a .38-caliber handgun in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his parents&#39; house in suburban Greenville, Mississippi, Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson said.
Lamb&#39;s car was still running on the yard road.
It wasn&#39;t immediately clear why Lamb went to that particular house, though Johnson said he believed Lamb knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb started working at the university in 2009 and taught geography and education. The university has 3,500 students and is located in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants.
Lamb completed his doctorate in education in the spring.
One of Lamb&#39;s old friends described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb 20 when they met through mutual friends.
Hairston and his friends were in high school, and Lamb was a funny, older guy who tried for many years to teach Hairston how to play guitar.
He was quite a charmer in those days.
All the girls were melted wax when he was there, said Hairston, now 40, who lives in the Jackson suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss had apparently been dating for some time.
In the 911 call, Lamb said he killed his wife, but there is no evidence of their marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in Joenranta&#39;s brick house in Gautier.
The police said the dog was fine.
Prentiss&#39; ex-husband Shawn O&#39;Steen said they divorced 15 years ago but remained friends. They now have a 19-year-old daughter.
&quot;She&#39;s really upset,&quot; O&#39;Steen described her daughter.
He was his mother&#39;s best friend.
O&#39;Steen said he had never met Lamb, but had heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when Lamb and Abigail were both performing at a summer market three years ago.
Later they played together at some gigs.
O&#39;Steen said her daughter makes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for several different online companies.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and occasional entertainer at The Julep Room, a seedy bar near Gautier, says he last saw Lamb and Prentiss the night before Sept. 5, when Lamb had finished his guitar and harmonica performance to a small crowd.
Nothing seemed wrong.
“Just a happy couple,” he said.
We joked and threw socks at each other.
So they were both quite witty.
The deceased teacher, Schmidt, directed the seminar program for first-year students and specialized in Native American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, the school&#39;s English teacher.
Schmidt was married with three young children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his fraternity and student government.
A candlelight vigil was held Tuesday night on Delta State&#39;s campus in Cleveland, attended by about 900 people, including faculty and other staff, students and community members.
Schmidt&#39;s wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the Mass, during which the university choir sang Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
Teaching continues on Wednesday.
“We&#39;re trying to get our students to come back,” LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
Now is the time to recover.
Amy and Rogelio Solis report from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press writers Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
The story has been corrected to say that cops now say Lamb made the 911 call after Schmidt was shot, and that while Lamb referred to Prentiss as his wife during the call, there is no evidence they were married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for the holiday season
Toys R Us says it won&#39;t hire as many workers for the holiday season as it did last year, but the toy and baby products retailer says current regulars and seasonal workers will be given the option to work more hours.
The company says it plans to hire 40,000 people to work in stores and distribution centers across the country, up from 45,000 hired during the 2014 holiday season.
Most jobs are part-time.
The company said it will begin interviewing applicants this month, with the number of staff increasing from October to December.
Although the holiday season is months away, the holiday shopping season is approaching, and businesses are preparing to hire temporary workers to help staff stores and sell, ship, and deliver products.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his &quot;date&quot; with Princess Diana
The premiere of the film Back to the Future was a hugely important moment professionally for Michael J. Fox.
It was also noteworthy for personal reasons.
&quot;We were sitting in the theater waiting for the royals to arrive and I realized the seat next to me was empty and then I realized Princess Diana&#39;s seat was next to me,&quot; he said in the trailer for the upcoming documentary Back in Time.
The movie starts and it dawns on me that I&#39;m just a fake yawn and an arm&#39;s length away from a date with the Princess of Wales.
Back in Time is a documentary about the film Back to the Future, with interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
Back to the Future premiered 30 years ago.
Spielberg said: &quot;To me, it&#39;s arguably the greatest time travel movie of all time.&quot;
Back in Time will be available on VOD, DVD and in select theaters in October.
The head of the UN says that the situation in Syria will not be resolved by armed means
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon&#39;s response to Russia&#39;s increasing military support for Syria is that this nearly five-year conflict &quot;will not be solved by arms,&quot; and additional weapons will only worsen the violence and the suffering of millions of people.
The UN leader again called on all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support non-discriminatory negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said at a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the foreign ministers of the five permanent members - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France - during the General Assembly&#39;s ministerial week later this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted that the division of the Council, the Syrian people, and the regional powers &quot;has made the situation impossible to resolve.&quot;
Ban called on the five permanent member states to show the kind of solidarity and consensus in dealing with the Syrian crisis that they showed in dealing with Iran&#39;s nuclear program.
8 poll results that show Donald Trump is serious
Some have tried to label him a weathervane.
Others think he&#39;s just a joke.
Some are waiting for a collapse.
Although some Republicans have tried to knock Donald Trump off the top of the polls, it has not (yet) been successful.
In 10 of the last 11 national polls, Donald Trump has led by double digits, and some are beginning to seriously wonder what this means for the real estate kingpin&#39;s nomination chances.
Of course, the election season is only at the beginning.
These results do not yet mean that Trump is likely to become the Republican nominee.
Commentators point out that at this point in 2011, Rick Perry was losing his lead to the upstart Herman Cain, neither of whom carried a single state in the nominating process.
There are also many reasons why he would have trouble in the general election.
However, outside groups such as Jeb Bush&#39;s Super PAC and the conservative economic organization Club for Growth have taken notice of Trump&#39;s persistence and begun using their funds to bring him down.
The following recent poll results suggest that the real estate boom is not just a passing phase:
Trump&#39;s popularity figures have made a complete turn.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, Monmouth University polls showed that only two in 10 Republicans viewed the real estate mogul favorably.
By mid-July, the figure was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, the figure was 52 percent.
Currently, six out of ten Republicans view Donald Trump favorably.
About three out of ten say they have a negative attitude.
These numbers are also true in the first primary states.
In a Quinnipiac University poll in Iowa last week, 60 percent of Republicans said they had a favorable view of Trump.
Two-thirds of Republican voters would be satisfied if Trump became the nominee.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either &quot;enthusiastic&quot; or &quot;satisfied&quot; if Trump were the nominee.
Only two in ten said they would be &quot;shocked&quot; if he were to become the nominee.
Only Ben Carson generates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent &quot;enthusiastic&quot; vs. Trump&#39;s 40 percent).
Next most exciting?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters would be &quot;dissatisfied&quot; or &quot;shocked&quot; if Jeb Bush, the favorite of those in power, became the candidate.
Trump&#39;s fiery temper is not a problem for most Republicans.
While Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his bombastic speeches and insults, 52 percent of Republican-leaning voters nationally think the real estate mogul has the qualities to be president, according to a Monday ABC News/Washington Post poll.
According to a Quinnipiac poll last week in the state of Iowa, which holds the first party convention, the number is the same: 52 percent of Republicans think Trump has the qualities to be a leader.
However, according to the ABC/Post poll, 44 percent think that his character is not suitable for being president, and almost six in ten think that his character does not belong in the White House.
Republican voters are getting used to the idea.
When Republican voters think like the commentators, they think Trump is the real option.
According to a CNN/ORC poll, four in 10 thought Trump was the most likely option when asked who was most likely to be nominated as the Republican nominee.
At the end of July, four out of ten supported Jeb Bush.
Disclosure: Republican voters haven&#39;t always had the clearest possible crystal ball.
At this time last election season, four in 10 Republicans thought Rick Perry would be nominated, and only 28 percent supported the eventual nominee, Mitt Romney.
In any case, this shows that the majority of Republican Party voters find Trump&#39;s campaign credible.
Even if the Republicans lined up to support another candidate, Trump would still win almost every one.
Some commentators have pointed out that the fragmented field is likely to have contributed to Trump&#39;s lead, as anti-Trump support is split among numerous other candidates.
However, a poll conducted by Monmouth University in early September showed that in a hypothetical two-way race between Trump and almost all other Republican candidates, Trump would receive majority support in almost all cases.
She leads Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marco Rubio by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points, and Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie by 33 points each.
He is tied with Ted Cruz.
Trump&#39;s only winning candidate?
If they were pitted against each other, Ben Carson would beat businessman Trump by a whopping 18 points.
The majority of Donald Trump&#39;s supporters have said that they have made up their minds.
A new CBS/NYT poll from Tuesday shows that just over half of Trump voters have decided who their vote will go to.
The situation can naturally change, and no one can say with absolute certainty that they will never change their mind.
46 percent said that they could possibly change their bachelor&#39;s degree.
In any case, Trump&#39;s biggest challenger right now is another unlikely winner, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but those voters who said they&#39;ve made up their minds are twice as likely to side with Trump.
Six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Ever since Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants &quot;rapists&quot; in his inaugural speech two months ago, immigration has been at the center of the 2016 debate.
Some worry that Trump&#39;s pomposity will drive Latino voters away from the Republican Party and hurt rebranding efforts.
Six in 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration, according to a new ABC/Post poll released Monday.
So it seems that as long as immigration is at the center of things, so is Donald Trump.
Frustration with the government has reached a new peak.
The support of Donald Trump and Ben Carson now covers about half of the Republican electorate, due in large part to their status outside of politics.
Six in 10 Republicans said in an ABC/Post poll Monday that they would prefer someone from outside politics to someone with government experience.
They are also angry at the federal government.
A Des Moines Register/Bloomberg poll of Iowa two weeks ago found that three out of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated with Republicans in Congress: 54 percent are &quot;dissatisfied&quot; and 21 percent are &quot;very angry.&quot;
Jeremy Corbyn&#39;s first appearance at Prime Minister&#39;s Question Time
Corbyn&#39;s first appearance on Question Time has been eagerly awaited since his election
New Labor leader Jeremy Corbyn faces David Cameron for the first time at Prime Minister&#39;s Question Time.
Corbyn will rise to ask the first of his six questions shortly after midday, and his performance will likely be closely watched by both the media and Labor MPs.
Corbyn has called for &quot;less theater and more facts&quot; for this weekly show.
He has also said that he could leave some of the opportunities to his colleagues.
The meeting is the first parliamentary test of Corbyn&#39;s leadership since he was appointed to the shadow cabinet and addressed the annual meeting of the Confederation of Trade Unions on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labor leader&#39;s decision to stand silently during the national anthem at Tuesday&#39;s memorial service to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain air war has drawn criticism from Conservative MPs and featured in several front-page stories.
Corbyn&#39;s decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention
Corbyn&#39;s spokesman said he had &quot;stood respectfully silent&quot; and that he recognized &quot;the bravery of the Royal Air Force in Britain&#39;s air war.&quot;
A member of Corbyn&#39;s shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told BBC Two&#39;s Newsnight that he would have called on the Labor leader to sing the national anthem despite his belief that the House of Commons should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers have refused to be part of Corbyn&#39;s inner circle, citing differences over the economy, defense and foreign affairs. Originally, less than a sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says that line differences regarding the party&#39;s position in the European Union and the government&#39;s aid ceiling have also &quot;piled up&quot; within the Labor Party since Corbyn&#39;s appointment.
Corbyn told a meeting of the Confederation of Trade Unions that Labor is proposing an amendment that would remove the entire cap.
Hours later, shadow government work and pensions secretary Smith said the party had been &quot;quite clear&quot; that they were only opposing the government&#39;s plans to lower the cap from £26,000 to £23,000.
Corbyn will be the fifth Labor leader David Cameron has faced in the last decade he has been leader of the Conservative Party.
The leader of the Labor Party has promised a new approach to politics and now says that he has &quot;crowdsourced&quot; ideas for questions to the Prime Minister, and received more than 30,000 suggestions.
Corbyn, the MP for Islington North, has said that the nature of the Prime Minister&#39;s question hours is too confrontational and that he intends to refrain from both witty words and barbs, promising instead to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges of young people.
Corbyn has said that Angela Eagle, the shadow financial secretary, will stand in for him during Question Time when Corbyn is not attending - such as when Cameron is abroad.
Corbyn has also suggested that other peers could also sometimes be allowed to use the floor, and has said he has approached the Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, about the matter.
When Cameron took office in 2005, he said he wanted to move away from the kind of political theater often associated with prime ministerial question hours, but he later admitted he had failed.
Since they began to be televised in 1990, Prime Minister&#39;s Question Hour has been an important measure of a leader&#39;s judgement, his control of the House of Commons, and his standing with other MPs, although critics have criticized Question Hour for having become nothing more than a laughingstock that calls for far-reaching reforms.
Filmed in Joburg: Homeless youth are being trained as photographers

The value of the pound rises as UK wage growth accelerates
The pound jumped higher after numbers appeared to pick up on UK wage growth, while the FTSE 100 rose on bid target SABMiller.
Between May and July, British wages, excluding bonuses, rose by 2.9 percent compared to the same time last year.
The pace of growth was the fastest since 2009, and it was seen as bringing with it estimates of rising rates.
The pound rose more than 1 percent against the dollar to 1.5505 dollars, and 0.84 percent against the euro to 1.3730 euros.
The FTSE 100 closed up 1.49 percent at 6,229.21.
SABMiller was the market&#39;s standout stock, rising 20 percent after rival AB InBev approached it with a bid.
The deal would unite two of the world&#39;s largest breweries and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares rose 0.9 percent after encouraging news from rival luxury goods group Richmont.
Richemont&#39;s latest sales figures were better than expected and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Burberry - had started to grow again.
Shares in Glencore rose 5 percent after the mining giant said it had raised $2.5 billion through a share offering as part of its debt-cutting strategy.
The shares of the packaging and paper group Mondi were the biggest decliners in the index by 4.3 percent after Goldman Sachs changed its recommendation on the company to &quot;sell&quot;.
JD Sports rose 3.1 per cent after the sportswear firm reported its half-year pre-tax profit: an 83 per cent rise to £46.6m.
A JD Sports executive says higher wages could hurt expansion
Peter Cowgill, director of JD Sports, says that if the minimum wage for workers in Great Britain is increased, it could mean that &quot;the purchasing power of potential consumers will increase&quot;.
However, this purchasing power is unlikely to exceed the higher labor costs for the company, says Cowgill.
The costs could go toward the company&#39;s expansion plans, he added, which would mean fewer additional jobs.
Metcash is launching a grassroots campaign against Aldi&#39;s entry into the sector
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from Aldi&#39;s onslaught in South and Western Australia.
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a grassroots campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South and Western Australia ahead of a $700 million attack by Aldi.
Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centers and the first store early next year in South and Western Australia, which will include up to 120 stores. At the same time, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening their relationships with local grocers and building the IGA brand through mainstream and social media marketing and events such as the Adelaide show.
IGA retailers and stockists have jumped on board, with brands such as Dunsborough-based ice cream maker Simmo&#39;s offering tastings in IGA stores, and store owners selling discounted tickets to Australian rules football matches to regular customers.
Metcash is expected to reveal more details about its defense strategy on September 29 when the food, alcohol and hardware wholesaler holds its annual investor strategy day.
The stakes are high, as South and Western Australia together account for nearly 30 per cent of Metcash&#39;s IGA store territory, with higher profit margins than Metcash&#39;s Eastern States IGA network.
Shoppers in South and Western Australia are notoriously niche, and IGA retailers have a much larger market share there than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland: more than 30 per cent in the South and 24 per cent in the West, compared to 14 per cent in the eastern states.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will capture about 5 percent of the grocery market in the two states within 12 months of opening the first stores. Turnover comes from all operators, but mainly from independent retailers.
In a report this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimated that IGA retailers could lose $360 million in annual sales and Metcash could lose $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in the South and 30 in the West next year, generating sales of $500 and $600 million in these regions.
The loss of food and grocery sales and volumes in Metcash&#39;s high fixed cost base could cost Metcash about $13 million in lost operating profit before interest and tax, Kierath said.
Meanwhile, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states mainly to Aldi and Coles, despite a recent Roy Morgan study finding that IGA&#39;s customers were the most loyal of all.
Morgan Stanley believes Metcash&#39;s food and grocery sales will fall 3.8 percent in 2016; 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, so that its market share will decrease from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent in 2020.
Last week, Hamish Douglass, manager of a leading investment fund and founder of Magellan Financial Group, said at a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash could &quot;quite possibly be lost in a decade&quot;.
Metcash has declined to respond publicly to Douglass&#39; comments.
However, it is understood that a Metcash board member contacted Douglass last week.
IGA&#39;s market share has fallen from 18% to 14% since 2010, and revenue from Metcash&#39;s food and grocery business, which supplies products to around 1,200 IGA retailers, has fallen 43% since 2012. This indicates a reduction in the debt financing of operations when sales and margins are under pressure.
But the wholesaler stands firm, investing more than $150 million a year in bringing prices on hundreds of items a week in line with Coles and Woolworths, helping IGA retailers renovate stores by adding faster-growing fresh food, and introducing a better selection of private label products.
Metcash chief executive Ian Morrice says price cuts and store improvements have boosted appeal, and he hopes the wholesaler will return to profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Australian Tennis Federation President Steve Healy supports Thanasi Kokkinakis
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves credit rather than criticism for his behavior
Thanasi Kokkinakis has been forced to suffer as a bystander in the recent storm that has raged around his friend Nick Kyrgios. He deserves credit rather than criticism for his own behavior, says Australian Tennis Association President Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the younger member of the talented duo known as the &quot;Special Ks&quot;, was unwittingly drawn into the public eye for an incident in which Kyrgios annoyed Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
Soon after, in a heated qualifying match in Cincinnati, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison were twice separated by the head referee when Harrison declared: &quot;Wawrinka should have beaten Kyrgios and I should have beaten that brat.&quot;
Although Kokkinakis was last seen breaking up his racket after a cramp ruined his potential victory over Richard Gasquet at the US Open, Healy has been a staunch defender of Kokkinakis.
Right now, the youngster is in Glasgow competing with Sam Groth for second place in the singles match with Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against Great Britain.
&quot;I feel pretty strongly that Thanasi has just been dragged into the fray,&quot; Healy said.
He broke his racquet when he lost to cramp at the US Open, but he&#39;s not the first player to break his racquet out of frustration, and I know Thanas well enough to know he&#39;s not proud of it.
But he has behaved remarkably well, including in quite provocative situations at the US Open with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves praise.
He&#39;s got a great team around him, he&#39;s got a great family around him, and I think he&#39;s been treated a little bit harshly.
He is very mature for 19 years old, he works hard, he fits into the team and so on, and he has never had any problems with other players. He&#39;s well-respected in the dressing room, he trains hard, he&#39;s in good shape and he&#39;s quite a calm and mature young man and I think he should be judged on his merits.
Healy has also supported the decision not to include Kyrgios in the important games starting on Friday, describing this &quot;mutual decision&quot; as a good solution for everyone, but still supporting the Canberra&#39;s return to the team&#39;s regular squad.
&quot;We want the team to be fully focused on the games and not on all the controversy surrounding [Kyrgios],&quot; Healy said.
And Nick has risen really fast, as Federer and Murray, for example, have pointed out, and he&#39;s coming of age in the public eye, and he&#39;s made some terrible mistakes, and he deserves all the criticism he gets. But we&#39;re trying to support him, we&#39;re trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I think it&#39;s best for both the team and him if he spends some time away from the public eye to think about those consequences.
Europe&#39;s migration crisis: Hungary declares state of emergency, closes borders, detains migrants
Hungary declared a state of emergency and closed its southern border with Serbia, arresting those trying to enter the country illegally. The goal is to stem the flow of migrants coming to the country.
Chaos ensued at the border as hundreds of migrants flocked to the neutral zone, and Serbian authorities reacted with dismay.
People who fled the violence in their homelands have now pitched their tents and settled indefinitely on the roadside between the checkpoints of the two countries.
However, frustration grew.
As the police helicopter hovered above them, the immigrants shouted &quot;Open the border!&quot; and shouted insults at the Hungarian riot police.
Some refused food and water in protest.
Serbia&#39;s foreign minister declared that it is &quot;unacceptable&quot; to return migrants from Hungary, when more and more of them are arriving from Macedonia and Greece.
&quot;(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not cause harm to civilians.
Discussions must be held in the next few days with other countries and Brussels,&quot; Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The chaos at the Hungarian-Serbian border emerged after the 28-nation bloc failed to come up with a common immigration policy at a contentious meeting in Brussels.
The ministers agreed on the sharing of responsibility for the 40,000 asylum seekers who have now taken over Italy and Greece. Ministers spoke hopeful of reaching a final deal - next month or by the end of next year - on which EU countries will take in an additional 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday demanded an extra EU summit next week to discuss the continent&#39;s immigration crisis.
However, Hungary is not pinning its hopes on its neighbors or Brussels acting anytime soon.
Tuesday&#39;s state of emergency in the two southern regions gave authorities greater powers to act in a crisis, allowing roads to be closed and asylum cases to be expedited.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that now that the fence on the Serbian border is complete, the country also plans to erect a barbed wire fence on part of its border with Romania to stem the flow of migrants through the country.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D&#39;Agata reported that even prisoners had been recruited to help finish the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become the biggest bottleneck and point of entry into the European Union for refugees, many of whom are fleeing war in Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has argued that most of those arriving are economic refugees seeking a better life, rather than those fleeing war who are entitled to protection - a view strongly at odds with other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which took effect at midnight in Hungary, now make it a crime to attempt to cross or damage the 4-meter (13-foot) barbed-wire fence the government has built along the southern border with Serbia, and carry longer jail terms for convicted traffickers.
&quot;Due to the situation caused by mass immigration, the Hungarian government is declaring a state of emergency,&quot; government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We are very clear about this: Crossing the border illegally is a crime.
Parliament still has to formally approve the military deployment expected next week, but Associated Press reporters at the border have already seen heavily armed military personnel with vehicles and dogs for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, Orban&#39;s homeland security adviser, said authorities had detained 45 people trying to cross the border, as well as 15 who had already made it further into the country.
They got over by damaging the fence, are now in police custody and charged with offenses under the new laws.
The authorities will quickly repair the fence.
Hungarian officials also closed two of seven crossing points on the border with Serbia on Tuesday morning after sending a rail car covered in barbed wire to close one of those points.
The main border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, was engulfed in chaos when the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container to process people and crowds tried to force their way inside.
About 20 got in, but thousands were left out.
A group of migrants blocked the main highway between Serbia and Hungary, saying they would refuse food and drink until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
2016 election: Hillary Clinton&#39;s lead over Bernie Sanders narrows by half, according to national poll
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton maintains a double-digit lead in the Democratic nomination race, but Senator Bernie Sanders is closing in on her.
Clinton is now supported by 47 percent of Democratic voters (down from 58 percent), and Sanders, who is second, is supported by 27 percent (up from 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden has not yet announced whether he will enter the presidential race, but he is supported by 15 percent of Democratic voters.
More than five months before the start of the primary, most Democratic voters say it&#39;s still too early to say they&#39;ve decided who they&#39;ll vote for.
However, Clinton&#39;s supporters stand behind their choice more strongly than the supporters of the other candidates.
Clinton&#39;s approval rating among several demographics has fallen since last month&#39;s CBS News Poll, while Sanders has seen some gains.
Clinton has a strong lead among women and moderates, but her lead has narrowed.
Her popularity among men has dropped significantly, with Sanders only 5 percentage points behind.
Clinton&#39;s lead among Democratic voters under 50 has eroded, and she is now tied with Sanders.
However, Clinton clearly leads among older voters.
Last month, Clinton led Sanders by double digits among liberals, but now Sanders leads that group by five percentage points.
About half of the country&#39;s Democratic voters say they will enthusiastically support Clinton if she becomes the party&#39;s nominee.
A quarter say they support him with some reservations, and 15 percent would support him just because he is the candidate.
Six percent would not support him at all.
Not surprisingly, Clinton&#39;s current supporters are very likely to be eager to support her.
Opinions are more mixed among those who do not currently support Clinton - only a quarter would support her enthusiastically.
While 48 percent of Democratic voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, fewer Republican voters (35 percent) say the same about Republican front-runner Donald Trump.
When Clinton supporters were asked in an open-ended question why they wanted her to run, the most popular answer was that she has the right experience (16 percent). After that, the most popular answers were that now is the right time for a woman president (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton supporters also cited her connection to Bill Clinton (9 percent).
The same opinions and the possibility of being elected were also mentioned.
Since the vice president affects the possible presidential nomination, 57 percent of Democratic voters would like to see him already in the race - although a third disagrees.
When Democratic voters are asked who they would choose as the party&#39;s runner-up, Biden is the most popular choice.
Among Clinton supporters, more than half say they would choose Biden, who is far more popular than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to seek the Democratic nomination, Hilary Clinton&#39;s lead over Sanders will increase. If Biden goes along, the lead is 20 percentage points, but if he leaves, the number is 30.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters think Clinton has the best chance of winning the presidency, down from 78 percent last month.
By this standard, Biden is far behind, but the share of those who consider him the most popular has increased.
However, when Democratic voters were asked what is most important about a candidate, they put opinions ahead of voteability.
Also last month, no Democratic candidate or possible candidate was considered an impossible candidate for these voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates do well on certain key issues among their party&#39;s voters.
The majority consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be honest, reliable and strong leaders.
Of the three, Biden fares best in honesty, while Clinton&#39;s strength is leadership.
Thirty percent of Democratic voters say they don&#39;t think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many as Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent say they don&#39;t have an opinion about Sanders.
Democratic voters also generally believe that Clinton, Sanders, and Biden are ideologically aligned.
When you look at all of these factors, about a quarter of Democratic voters say they don&#39;t have an opinion about Sanders.
While questions remain about Hillary Clinton&#39;s use of a personal email address and server while she was secretary of state, a majority of Democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation and say it did not affect their overall opinion of her.
However, it is different when we look at America as a whole.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with his explanation, and only about a third are satisfied.
People&#39;s opinions were divided in March shortly after the matter came to light.
A majority of Americans say the email controversy has not affected their overall opinion of Clinton, although 36 percent say their opinion of her has worsened.
More than six in 10 Republicans say their opinion of Clinton has worsened.
Although voters in Clinton&#39;s own party view her as honest and trustworthy, this is still a problem for her among all registered voters. Only 32 percent consider him honest and trustworthy, down 8 percentage points from last month and down 15 percentage points since May.
62 percent of registered voters say they don&#39;t think Clinton is honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 percent of registered voters nationwide also do not consider Trump to be honest and trustworthy.
However, both Clinton and Trump are considered good leaders.
Of the six candidates included in the study, Biden, Carson and Bush are considered the most honest.
Sanders is generally considered to be honest, but many do not have an opinion of him, just as they do not have an opinion of Carson.
The margin of error in the survey of 351 Democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson is closing in on Donald Trump in a national poll
Ben Carson comes close to Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times poll
Two candidates collected half of all votes in the new poll, leaving the others to fight for a foothold.
Republican voters across the country still strongly support Trump, whose approval rating has risen from 23 percent in the previous CBS poll conducted before last month&#39;s Fox News debate to 27 percent in a poll released Tuesday.
At the same time, however, Carson skyrocketed from six percent to 23 percent.
The poll also found that Carson is doing well across demographics and is edging out Trump among college-educated Republican voters.
The rest of the field has fallen behind, except for Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich. Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker&#39;s approval rating has fallen the most: from 10 percent last month to 2 percent today.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are tied for third at 6 percent.
The margin of error for this latest poll, conducted in September, among 376 Republican voters, is +/- 6 percent.
The latest CNN/ORC poll released last week showed Carson rising in the polls, with 19 percent approval among Republicans, with Trump ahead at 32 percent.
Also, according to the latest ABC News/Washington Post poll, Trump was well ahead of Carson.
As Carson&#39;s popularity soared last week, Trump criticized the retired neurosurgeon for nothing, even as Carso apologized for questioning Trump&#39;s faith.
&quot;We need energy,&quot; Trump said last Saturday during his campaign visit to Iowa.
Five fraternity members are charged in the death of a Baruch College freshman
Nearly two years after a student died at a fraternity initiation ceremony in Pennsylvania&#39;s Pocono Mountains, five people have been charged with murder.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity at Baruch College in New York City brutally assaulted Chun &quot;Michael&quot; Deng during a membership rite in September 2013, then delayed taking him to a hospital, contributing to his death, police said.
Officials say Deng was blindfolded and a more than 13-pound backpack full of sand was loaded onto his back, then repeatedly tackled to the ground as he tried to walk across the icy field toward the finish line.
Finally, Deng complained that his head hurt, after which he lost consciousness.
Fraternity members did not call 911 after Deng passed out, but allegedly waited an hour before bringing him to the hospital, police say.
They did, however, have time to change Deng&#39;s clothes, search the Internet for information about his symptoms, and contact the brotherhood&#39;s national president, Andy Meng, for advice, Police Chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference.
&quot;At this point, the members began to hide their ritual equipment, effectively putting the well-being of the brotherhood ahead of Michael Deng,&quot; Police Chief Wagner said.
Deng was not allowed to take office, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng received repeated blunt force blows to the head, torso and thighs.
&quot;Too many families have been affected by fraternity hazing, with at least one student dying as a result every year since the 1970s,&quot; Doug Fierberg, an attorney representing Deng&#39;s family, said in a statement.
Fraternities and their members must be held accountable, and this step by the authorities is important.
A Monroe County grand jury ruled in favor of indicting the first five members for third-degree murder
32 other members of the brotherhood, including Meng, also face charges of violent extortion and criminal conspiracy.
&quot;We don&#39;t want to make only individuals responsible. If there is an organization behind what happened, which accepted the situation either officially or unofficially, they should also be held accountable,&quot; Wagner stated at Tuesday&#39;s press conference.
Baruch College banned the fraternity and the national fraternity disaffiliated with the local chapter.
This is what happens when the US Federal Reserve raises interest rates
There will be an interest rate hike, and the bull market will crash, bond yields will rise and the economy will go into recession.
This we know.
What we don&#39;t know is how long all this will take or how long it will last.
The past doesn&#39;t give much help in terms of timing, when it comes specifically to the economy.
The onset of the recession has sometimes lasted only 11 months after the first withdrawal, sometimes it has gone as long as 86 months.
The US Federal Reserve&#39;s aggressiveness in raising interest rates has often, though not always, been a determining factor in how the economy and financial assets react.
That is why the officials of the US central bank have emphasized so strongly that investors should not focus on when interest rates will start to be raised, but mainly on the development curve of the time leading to the normalization of the situation.
There are indeed several variables in the equation.
In the end, however, market participants may find that all the fuss related to the interest rate hike has been exaggerated.
&quot;The central bank&#39;s first rate hike since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted in some circles as the end of the &#39;cheap money&#39; era,&quot; said Julian Jessop, chief global economist at Capital Economics, in a message to clients.
Instead, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to normal, albeit still low, levels to be the kind of disruptive shock that many seem to fear.
However, this does not mean that there are no effects.
Below is a look at how some areas of the economy will react based on past developments:
As the market has seen in the past month or so, waiting for an interest rate hike can make the situation unstable.
When the increase becomes a reality, the effect is not quite so dramatic.
&quot;It appears that returns on capital tend to stagnate for 12-24 months after the first hike, again potentially reflecting a lag in monetary policy,&quot; Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study on what happens after a central bank hike.
Specifically, over the past 35 years or so, the market tends to be in a strong uptrend of around 14% approaching the hike, 250 days after that it&#39;s fairly flat (average up 2.6%), and normalcy has been reached after 500 days with average returns over the last six in the cycle 14.4 percent, according to a recent analysis by Nuveen Asset Management&#39;s chief capital strategist Bob Doll, published in Barron&#39;s magazine.
According to Deutsche Bank, the impact on stocks is usually clearer in the later phase of the hike cycle, when yields start to decline.
Recessions are part of economic life, but interest rate hikes often promote their arrival.
In the current situation, the central bank is facing certain challenges that did not exist before, and which may accelerate the recession.
This is especially the case with gross domestic product, which will be closest to its all-time low before the central bank raises interest rates.
According to Deutsche Bank, in the 118 withdrawals made since 1950, nominal annual GDP has only twice been below 4.5 percent.
While the number was 3.6 percent in the second quarter of 2015, few believe it will last after the third quarter has advanced 1.5 percent, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.
Raising interest rates in such a fragile economic environment can be risky and raises the question of &quot;is this time different&quot;, Deutsche Bank stated.
Market participants have been bracing for a Fed rate hike all year, with everyone looking ahead to this week&#39;s Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and financial experts believe the committee may approve the hike at this meeting, futures trading predicts only a 25 percent chance.
&quot;Our research shows that since 1950, all expansionary cycles so far have occurred in supercycles of increasing leverage, in which GDP has surpassed its pre-recession peak very quickly after the recovery has begun,&quot; the report says.
In contrast, there has been an exceptionally slow recovery from the recession that has been the worst of the observation period.
In the current cycle, the central bank has waited by far the longest for the end of the last recession: the record has been 35 months, and now it is already in its 74th month.
Fixed income has also been volatile as the market waits for an interest rate hike, and the pattern is somewhat similar to the observations made on capital.
The main difference is that when the central bank changes its policy, its effects are seen faster in bonds than in stocks.
The direction of bond yields seems to change immediately at the first hike/cut of the cycle.
At the end of the hike cycle, bond yields will immediately drop,” Deutsche Bank said.
Charles Schwab strategists believe that rising interest rates will cause longer- and shorter-dated bond yields to converge, thus flattening the yield curve.
High-yield bonds often outperform in such a situation, although &quot;we&#39;re still cautious about looking for yield,&quot; Schwab fixed income analyst Kathy Jones said in an analysis.
Surprisingly, Jones believes the market has already adjusted to the central bank&#39;s policy expectations.
&quot;In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are several signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy,&quot; he wrote.
Short-term interest rates are high, the yield curve is flatter, credit spreads have increased, and volatility has increased - all these are characteristic of the market when the central bank has tightened its policy.
In general, companies whose business operations are primarily located in the United States will benefit when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinational companies with a lot of debt perform worse when the rise in the value of the dollar makes their products more expensive on the world market and their debt becomes more expensive than what they have to finance.
&quot;History shows that &#39;quality&#39; stocks tend to be more profitable in the three months after the first rate hike,&quot; Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report to clients.
Companies with strong turnover outperformed companies with weak turnover by an average of five percentage points after the increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high return on capital and low volatility stocks outperformed lower quality companies. The average of the former was 4 (percentage points) and the latter 3 (percentage points).
Debt becomes a big problem.
Those companies with a lot of floating-rate debt stand to lose the most, Goldman said.
Outside of stock market speculation, consumers also have the opportunity to benefit from the increase in the value of the dollar.
Savers may also benefit from higher returns, although experts disagree on how quickly the impact will be felt.
BBC Radio is a copycat of Classic FM, MP Andrew Bingham says
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham accuses the channel of &quot;public awareness&quot;
He argues that distinguishing it from a commercial competitor is becoming increasingly difficult
He also took aim at the BBC Music Awards, saying they were just copying the Brit Awards
Fellow MP Damien Collins criticized The Voice saying that it is not original either
BBC Radio 3 is &quot;transforming&quot; into Classic FM, a leading MP claims, adding to the pressure on the production company to prove it does something commercial production companies don&#39;t.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC executives that the public service radio channel appeared to be &quot;popularizing&quot; its content and that it was becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish it from its commercial rival.
&quot;It seems that Radio 3 - I don&#39;t want to use the term &#39;folk sense&#39; - is turning into Classic FM,&quot; he said.
He also took aim at the BBC Music Awards, which were launched last December.
&quot;The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, seem just like the Brit Awards gala organized under a different name.
So if you&#39;re trying to do something different, here are two examples that I can directly remember where you&#39;re actually just copying something that&#39;s already in the market,” Bingham said.
The director-general of the BBC denied the charges, claiming that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rival when it comes to live music and sharing information with the public.
Radio 3 teaches me things about classical music that I can&#39;t learn anywhere else.
Its commitment to live music and musicianship is actually first class.
&quot;Furthermore, I think it&#39;s really important that Radio 3 is committed to finding new music and commissioning new works,&quot; he said.
Earlier this year, the head of BBC Radio 3, Alan Davey, claimed that the channel needs to do more than before to reach audiences because Britons know less about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only part of the BBC&#39;s offering to be criticized for stepping on the toes of commercial rivals during a hearing by the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee.
Conservative Tory MP Damien Collins criticized The Voice, the music competition which the BBC bought from Dutch production company Talpa Media for an estimated £22m.
Do you understand why this show is often discussed because it is not original and it is not unique in any way?
Lord Hall claimed that this BBC1 show, with star judges Paloma Faith and Boy George, was produced &quot;in a very BBC style&quot;.
He added that he wants the production company to &quot;find success in-house&quot; the next time it starts an entertainment series.
However, he did not agree to prevent the production of future seasons of The Voice, or to order that license payers&#39; money be used for other entertainment formats.
Online sales rose the least in August so far, Black Friday might be the reason
Online sales increased by 7 percent in the first three months of 2015
Last month&#39;s increase was the lowest since Matali&#39;s statistics began in 2000
Three years ago, online sales were strengthened by the use of mobile devices to make purchases
Experts believe that November&#39;s Black Friday may curb spending
Virtual shopping has grown exponentially for more than a decade and has turned many of Britain&#39;s shopping streets into ghost towns.
However, experts say there are now signs of a leveling off in online sales, with the latest figures showing just a 7 per cent rise for the first quarter of 2015.
Total consumption in August increased the least since statistics began in 2000: only a five percent increase from last year.
Experts say there are signs in the air that online sales are leveling off, with the latest figures showing just a 7 percent rise for the first quarter of 2015.
&quot;If you look at the growth levels of previous years and go back to 2000, it was clear that the situation would rationalize over time,&quot; Andy Mulcahy, editor of the JMRG sales index, told the Guardian.
He explained that three years ago, online sales became stronger when shoppers started using their mobile phones to make purchases.
It meant that more people were shopping online, and that they could be done in different environments, such as on the couch.
But now it&#39;s leveling off, and (growth) can go down.
The Black Friday phenomenon imported from America has been considered one of the reasons behind the slowing down of sales.
Experts believe that consumers will hold back on shopping ahead of the event on the last Friday of November.
Last year, five times more shoppers than the usual average flocked to their computers to grab deals, crashing many merchants&#39; websites.
Experts believe Black Friday, which left shoppers scrambling for bargains, could curb shopping
Research published by the British Retail Consortium found that only around one in five pounds was spent online.
For certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of purchases are now made online.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of using high street fashion chains.
Muslims bury those killed in the Mecca crane accident, sanctions for Bin Laden&#39;s family
Muslims carried the bodies of 29 dead through the streets during the first Funeral in Mecca
Saudi Arabia has partly blamed the collapse on the construction giant Saudi Binladin Group
The Ministry of Health said that a total of 394 people were also injured when the crane collapsed
The 29 dead were carried in the air through the streets as hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury them. The victims died when a crane collapsed in Mecca&#39;s Grand Mosque.
Mourners, dressed mainly in white, lined the route to honor the first of the dead to make their final journey to Al-Moaissem Cemetery.
The mournful procession passed the holy site where just a few days ago a crane fell through the roof of the mosque and felled worshippers.
The bodies were released for burial after the Saudi king blamed the Bin Laden family&#39;s construction group for the disaster, which also injured 394 people.
The bodies of 29 of the worshipers killed by the crane that fell in the Grand Mosque of Mecca were carried through the streets
Father-of-four Qasim Akram from Bolton, Manchester area, was among the dead. He was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Akram had been at the Grand Mosque with his parents before the start of the annual hajj pilgrimage.
Saudi officials have already vowed that the Hajj to Mecca will continue as thousands continue to arrive in the city.
Today, King Salman stated that the Binladin Group should not have left the crane arm up when it was not in use.
An Arabic version of the decision published by the state-run Saudi Press Agency said the Binladin Group was partly to blame for the collapse.
The news agency&#39;s English-language service did not mention this detail, but it said that the company&#39;s executives have been banned from traveling abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to find out what caused the crane to fall into the grounds of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims had gathered ahead of the hajj pilgrimage later this month.
The Binladin Group has not issued any statements about the collapse of the wretched, and its representatives have not been reached for comment.
The royal ruling also accused the group of not using up-to-date protective measures and failing to cooperate with meteorological authorities.
There are dozens of cranes around the Great Mosque of Mecca, which are part of a huge construction project led by the Binladin Group.
The Binladin family has been close to Saudi Arabia&#39;s ruling family for decades, leading major construction projects.
The late leader of al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was a rebellious son who was disowned by his family in the 1990s.
The collapse took place in windy and rainy weather just days before millions arrive in the kingdom for the pilgrimage, which every able-bodied Muslim must undertake at least once in their lifetime.
Officials say that 158 people are still in hospital.
Authorities ordered one million rials (£174,000) to be paid to the families of the dead and those permanently injured.
Other injured parties will receive half of this amount.
The B&amp;Q boss says cheap laborers from Eastern Europe are behind the popularity
The British use the services of helpers more and more, says Veronique Laury
The number of professionals coming from Eastern Europe is behind the increase
As a result, 200 more Screwfix stores aimed at professionals will be opened
At the same time, Kingfisher is closing 60 B&amp;Q stores around the country
By Rupert Steiner, Chief City Correspondent for the Daily Mail
Brits are said to be ditching their hammers and paintbrushes and preferring to hire skilled Eastern European handymen to do home renovations
It seems that if you&#39;re handy with a hammer or can paint walls, you&#39;re in the minority these days.
The British are hiring more and more helpers to do DIY jobs in their homes, says the boss of the company behind B&amp;Q.
Veronique Laury, the new CEO of Kingfisher, which owns the home improvement store chain, said that behind the popularity is the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe and the fact that they offer their services at ridiculous prices.
This results in Kingfisher planning to open 200 new working class Screwfix stores and close 60 B&amp;Q stores.
Laury said that she wants more women to work in B&amp;Q stores because eight out of ten purchasing decisions made in the store are specifically made by the fairer sex.
Today, most of the staff are men.
He said that changes in the population must be taken into account: today there are more one-woman households with more home improvement work than before.
Laury said: “Most of the staff in our stores are still men.
We need to seek a better balance.
However, half of our customers are women, and 80 percent of product purchase decisions are made by women.
Women play a big role in the decision-making process.&quot;
Laury is one of only five women to lead the most important companies in the UK&#39;s FTSE100 index. He has rebuilt his management team in such a way that it has an equal number of male and female supervisors.
Kingfisher is almost the only company that has exactly 50 percent women in its group, including its CEO and CFO.
Laury said: “This was a conscious decision - diversity is important here.
It hasn&#39;t been difficult to find good women for the management team.&quot;
Kingfisher reported a fall in both half-year profits and sales after the group shouldered the cost of closing stores.
As a result of the trend, Kingfisher, which owns Screwfix and B&amp;Q stores, is opening 200 new stores
The Three Aces government decided to resort to mandatory legislation to save the country&#39;s economy.
Visible effects were achieved quite quickly.
The sharp head of SAK and other wage earners&#39; central organizations began to be forced immediately, and as a result, the country will stand still on Friday due to a large demonstration of workers&#39; sentiment.
Quite a lot of people think that&#39;s when reason also stands.
We ask whether it is worth going on strike when things are going badly anyway.
A resistance movement has even been established.
More than 50,000 people have already gone online to announce that they are not going to participate in the protest but are going to work.
In the good old days of consensus, this would have been impossible.
Of course, there was no internet where to protest, but openly declaring yourself a criminal would have been the political suicide of a small person.
A protest of a few tens of thousands of people doesn&#39;t move the million-member trade unions much, but it gives food for thought.
The position of trade unions is no longer as self-evident as it was twenty years ago.
Not everyone knows the movement&#39;s goals as their own, the values have changed
From the point of view of the interest of the Ay movement&#39;s activities, the government&#39;s drastic solutions can also be seen as a direct gift from heaven.
When things have seemed to roll under their own weight for years, now the unions finally get to the point, i.e. to defend the employee&#39;s rights, visibly and properly.
In this way, the government can possibly consolidate the role of the ay movement, when membership in a trade union is perhaps seen as more necessary than before.
Whatever one&#39;s opinion is about the organizations&#39; actions, it is a fact that Friday&#39;s expression of opinion would somehow stop Finland.
Yes, Finland has stopped a long time ago.
For example, industrial production has already fallen for 31 months in a row.
The gross national product continues to decrease, and unemployment rises.
These things would seem to force everyone&#39;s head.
Hard savings for the University of Lappeenranta: Target savings of 8.5 million, personnel will be reduced by 130
Lappeenranta University of Technology is starting a savings program, the goal of which is to reduce costs by a total of 8.5 million euros.
As part of the savings, the university will start collective bargaining negotiations for the entire staff, with an annual saving target of 6.5 million.
In practice, it means reducing approximately 130 employees.
The aim is to save an additional two million from other activities.
The background of the Yt negotiations is the 2016 budget, which predicts a deficit of 8.5 million for the actual operation.
It is also affected by the budget cuts made by the government.
This fiscal year, the university makes a deficit of about 2.6 million.
The expenses will increase slightly for next year, but at the same time the funding received from the ministry will decrease by 2 million and other funding by 3.2 million euros.
The university&#39;s total budget is around 85 million euros, so the savings target is ten percent of the entire budget.
The combined effect of the massive cuts to teaching and research and the decrease in business funding on our university is very significant, says Rector Anneli Pauli in the university&#39;s press release.
Before the summer, the effects of the cuts seemed even more moderate, but now the decrease in supplementary funding is showing itself in new proportions.
The negotiations with the shop stewards will start on Tuesday of next week and will last the six weeks prescribed by law.
Yle: Onnibus wants Finland on the railways
British Sir Brian Souter, the owner of the cheap bus company Onnibus, tells Yle that the company is also targeting rail traffic in Finland.
I am very interested in joining Finland&#39;s rail transport.
My company Stagecoach is one of Britain&#39;s largest rail transport companies, says Souter.
Rail traffic is to be gradually opened up to competition.
First up is the capital region&#39;s local transport in 2017-2018.
After local traffic, long-distance traffic is next.
Souter says that he has already approached the Ministry of Transport.
According to Yle, the Ministry of Transport welcomes Onnibus&#39; plans.
Among other international companies, at least Transdev (formerly Veolia), which also has bus services in Finland and rail services in other parts of Europe, has announced its interest in rail transport.
The US Federal Reserve has to make decisions about interest rates
The rest of the world is watching from the sidelines as the US Federal Reserve meets for two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a critical decision on whether to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
When Reuters polled 80 economists, a little more than half of those who believed the central bank would raise interest rates last week now believe that the situation will not be resolved yet and interest rates will be kept at the current level of 0-0.25 percent.
It is a historic event, as it has been seven years since the central bank cut interest rates to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a central central bank has the opportunity to get out of zero and start normalizing interest rates,&quot; said Angel Ubide, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy has performed relatively well, and the recovery has brought trillions of dollars to balance sheets and created little inflation.
However, the central bank cannot ignore the less rosy global outlook.
It has warned the market that it should be ready for a hike, but the signs are that they also believe the odds are against a hike.
The decision will be announced on Thursday at 20:00 (CET).
The Delta State University shooter left a message of apology
After shooting his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning — before shooting a colleague later that day — Shannon Lamb wrote a message saying he was &quot;sorry&quot; for the first killing and wished he &quot;could take it back,&quot; authorities said Tuesday.
Police in Gautier, Mississippi, said Lamb, a geography and social studies teacher at Delta State University, called 911 around 10 a.m.
on Monday and said he had shot and killed someone.
Lamb told the defendant that the police needed to send officers to his home.
He said he &quot;killed his wife last night&quot; and also mentioned that there is a &quot;sweet dog&quot; in the house that &quot;doesn&#39;t bother anyone&quot; but is probably upset.
The police asked the caller for his name, but he did not give it.
Lamb did not provide an explanation for the shooting.
When police arrived, they found the body of 41-year-old Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note from 45-year-old Lamb that read: “I&#39;m so sorry I wish I could undo it.
I loved Amy and she was the only person who ever loved me.”
After writing the message, Lamb drove nearly 500 kilometers to Delta State, where he killed history teacher Ethan Schmidt, before finally killing himself late Monday as police surrounded him.
University President William LaForge said that as far as he knew, there was no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that &quot;something was clearly on Lamb&#39;s mind.&quot;
Officials said Tuesday that despite allegations published Monday that Lamb believed Prentiss had been in a relationship with Schmidt, there was &quot;no information or evidence whatsoever&quot; of any kind of &quot;triangle drama.&quot;
Shawn O&#39;Steen said he had been married to Prentiss for about seven years and described her as a “good person”.
The couple broke up 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O&#39;Steen said she and Prentiss had a 19-year-old daughter who is &quot;distraught.&quot;
O&#39;Steen said that Prentiss and her daughter were &quot;best friends forever.&quot;
According to Linsday Knowles, Prentiss worked online from her home. According to the Sun Herald, Knowles was a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said Prentiss, who had a dog named Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
“He always wanted to help other people,” Knowles said.
Police said Lamb called his relatives sometime Monday to tell them &quot;he&#39;s not going to jail.&quot;
When officers caught up with Lamb on Highway 1 near Greenville later that evening, Lamb pulled his car over to the side of the road, left it there and ran into the woods, where he shot himself.
Lamb received his doctorate in education from Delta State in the spring of 2015, according to the curriculum vitae found on the university&#39;s website.
Stars who lost their charm
The actor (left), pictured with his son Redmond (right), has had a tough time in recent years.
In 2001, he was diagnosed with leukemia, and in 2009, his longtime partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
According to rumors, he has also had drug problems, and in 2008 he was arrested for drug possession.
All this really takes its toll.
Manchester United&#39;s Luke Shaw is out for months with a double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture in his right leg during Manchester United&#39;s Champions League loss to PSV Eindhoven.
Although the defender was left in tears and will be out for at least six months, Louis van Gaal hopes that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The injury was caused by Héctor Moreno&#39;s reckless tackle in the 15th minute after the 20-year-old Shaw had lunged into PSV&#39;s territory.
He was treated for 9 minutes on the field and had to be given oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said: &quot;He has a double fracture in his leg and is now in hospital.&quot;
He will be transferred tomorrow or maybe the day after and then operated on in Manchester.
This is horrible. The boy comes to Manchester United at 18, struggles and then plays brilliantly, and now this is what happens.
When I was in the dressing room, he was wearing an oxygen mask.
He was crying.
I&#39;m not a doctor, but a double fracture will take at least half a year, and he won&#39;t play in the group stage.
I hope he can play this season.
Moreno seemed lucky to receive either a red card and a penalty kick.
Referee Nicola Rizzoli did not penalize the Mexican player.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian umpire made a mistake.
You can judge the situation yourself when I say that it became a penalty shot and a red card.
It was a really bad two-footed tackle.
Shaw tweeted: &quot;Thank you all for your messages, words cannot express how disappointed I am, my recovery begins now, I will come back stronger.&quot;
Related: Manchester United suffer Luke Shaw incident and lose to PSV
The English defender has next June&#39;s European Championships in France as an additional incentive for his recovery.
PSV coach Phillip Cocu said: &quot;It&#39;s a really bad injury.&quot;
If a player is out with an injury like this, everyone is very sad.
The intention of our players is never to offend the opponent.
Moreno suffered a broken leg while playing for Mexico against Van Gaal&#39;s Holland at the 2014 World Cup.
&quot;Moreno is taking this hard because the intention is not to hurt the opponent, and when you hear that the injury is really bad, it&#39;s bad,&quot; Cocu said.
I didn&#39;t see it in that situation.
The only thing I saw was the ball going the other way, so it looked like he [Moreno] touched it, but I didn&#39;t see Luke&#39;s tackle.
Moreno told SBS6: “I know how it feels, I know how difficult something like this can be.
I feel terrible about this, I&#39;m so sorry.”
PSV&#39;s Andrés Guardado was also taken to hospital after being challenged by Chris Smalling.
I guess David Cameron knows the Lorax better than this?
Every parent soon learns one thing: if your child loves a book, it doesn&#39;t take long until they learn it almost by heart.
Unless you&#39;re David Cameron.
When a holiday childcare service asked the Prime Minister about his favorite children&#39;s book, he chose Dr Seuss&#39;s The Lorax, a 1971 environmental story.
The choice was difficult, Cameron writes in a message published on the website of the SuperCamps company and continues: &quot;Fun, moving, creative and contains a strong message. I enjoy reading this book to my children because there always seems to be an image or message that we haven&#39;t seen before.”
All of this is true, but the next paragraph, where Cameron supposedly describes the plot of the book, is a summary of the 2012 film version, which added new characters and details to fill out the fairly short original text.
&quot;In the walled city of Tarville, where all nature has disappeared and even the air is a commodity, the boy Ted hopes to win the girl of his dreams to his heart by fulfilling Audrey&#39;s wish to see a real tree&quot;, the text says and describes the love story, which was written by Dr Seuss, who died in 1991, his real name Theodor Seuss Geisel, did not write.
If that&#39;s not suspicious enough, Cameron&#39;s text in parts sounds like it was taken from the Internet Movie Database&#39;s plot summary of The Lorax, which begins: “In the walled town of Tarville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, Ted- the boy hopes to win the heart of the Audrey girl of his dreams.&quot;
Given that Cameron is a publicly active parent, it seems unlikely that he would be so unfamiliar with the book&#39;s plot. In it, a young, nameless boy hears how the local nature has been destroyed by the greedy Kerskanen, who chops down trees and weaves supplies, ignoring the story&#39;s name, the short, mustachioed creature, the Lorax, who &quot;speaks for the trees&quot;.
Such a relatively invisible PR task is probably outsourced to an assistant who has apparently never read a book 20 times in a row to a child.
The Prime Minister&#39;s spokesman said the text must have come from Cameron&#39;s constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was received from Cameron&#39;s staff, but did not comment further at the time.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of being left out of the England squad, but it was still a tough spot
Playing Pakistan in the UAE is a tough task, but seeing the type of squad England have picked for the tour, I don&#39;t think a repeat of the last time&#39;s 3-0 series loss is likely.
I wouldn&#39;t even exclude away wins from the bills.
Alastair Cook&#39;s side may be less experienced than the team of three years ago, but there are good spinners and the mindset of the team is strong: they have no scars from 2012, just youthful positivity.
Moeen Ali is improving in his spin bowling and Adil Rashid is an attacking option, despite being an unknown factor at this level.
Related: Adam Lyth dropped from England cricket team, replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to leave Adam Lyth out of the team is understandably difficult for me to analyze as I am his head coach in Yorkshire.
His seven games have been against good batsmen in challenging conditions and the simple but stark truth is that cricketers are judged by their results.
For example, there was no uncertainty about the selection of Joe Root before the announcement because, as I have said before, the players are the best selectors.
About a hundred points more, and Lyth&#39;s season with the team could have continued, but he was responsible for his own destiny.
Hopefully if he gets more runs for Yorkshire another opportunity will come his way.
England manager Trevor Bayliss praised Lyth&#39;s attitude even when he didn&#39;t perform quite as well as he could have, and that doesn&#39;t surprise me. Lyth is above all a team player.
It is difficult to answer the question of how long a batsman gets to leave a mark.
Lyth was capped seven times, like Sam Robson before him, while Nick Compton was capped nine times.
Only Compton got the chance to play both home and away.
The only complaint is that England picked Jonathan Trott first for the Caribbean when Lyth was in top form, but that missed opportunity is now a thing of the past.
Alex Hales comes in and that&#39;s a batsman I appreciate.
There is something about him as a cricketer that we in Yorkshire saw early this season when he scored 236 against us at Trent Bridge.
He needs to be given at least the same opportunity as the others before him, but this of course depends on the composition of the team in the UAE.
The idea of Moeen opening the batting next to Cook has been tossed around, which would get an extra bowler on the field but keep four quicks, and I&#39;m not against that.
I don&#39;t see why a batsman can&#39;t bat there and this left-hander has already shown himself to be quite a cricketer.
Moeen didn&#39;t necessarily do his job for his county in Worcestershire, but he&#39;s third for them and that makes little difference.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 games in the first gridiron before moving to opener in 2001.
He immediately scored three hundred points and did not remember the past.
Zafar Ansari enters the team as a backup pitcher, and from what little I&#39;ve been around him, he seems like a very impressive young man.
People can look at his unadorned stats - 31 batting average, 35 with the ball - and think it&#39;s a gamble, but there aren&#39;t too many pitchers available and the selectors went young.
He is learning a lot on this tour.
Outside of the squad, England appear to have a few tough additions to the coaching side.
The appointment of Sri Lankan batsman Mahela Jayawardene as a consultant for the games may turn out to be a stroke of genius.
He&#39;s one of the nicest guys in the game and brings a huge amount of experience with him, having done everything in all situations and against all types of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes into the white-ball games, bringing both energy and relentless fade.
I have always thought that he was born to be involved in international cricket, be it playing or coaching, and he has the same kind of exploitable swagger that Mahela has.
Sometimes new voices in the locker room can refresh a team, even if their message is the same as before.
Colly&#39;s team-mate from Durham, Ben Stokes, is being rested in the one-dayers, Root was given a similar break against Australia, and at least I have no problem with that.
Although not everyone agrees, coaches and selectors do not make schedules.
And you have to remember that just like the players, their job depends on the results.
Such decisions are never made lightly.
Those in favor of Britain leaving the EU (Brexit) can take the profit if the economy is in trouble in 2017
David Cameron&#39;s half-hearted renegotiation strategies to keep Britain in the EU are getting into bigger trouble by the day, even if you don&#39;t even consider Jeremy&#39;s hearty &quot;Is it a yes or a no?&quot; Corbyn&#39;s election to the leadership of the Labor Party or the central organization of trade unions getting angry with Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their own Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomatic friend recently explained that because the EU is so deep in various crises, not all of its own making, some member states are fed up with Britain&#39;s self-centered agenda, full of divisive concessions and disruptive treaty changes that these states largely do not want.
At its annual meeting in Brighton, the trade union federation decided that it doesn&#39;t want them either, if they erode social protection.
We could even call it Dave and George&#39;s selfie agenda.
The prime minister and finance minister are late for summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a picture of themselves in front of a famous local monument with or without a local eyewitness, and then come home saying they are winning over supporters for reforms.
It&#39;s all about me.
My European friend, who wants to look inside Britain&#39;s EU tent on the outside - &quot;Don&#39;t leave us alone with France&quot;, Berlin says - suggests that the most short-sighted ministers and civil servants in certain capitals are now at the point where they don&#39;t care if we stay then we leave.
Germany&#39;s cautious and moderate chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but has been in power for 10 years and wants to get out of office before it spoils like the overstaying Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohli (16).
France&#39;s François Hollande faces re-election or replacement in 2017.
He too is a fading force.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain a left-wing one.
It is difficult to see these countries making sacrifices for the Selfie Brits, when their energies should rather be directed to preventing Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom - they don&#39;t want that either due to similar separatist tendencies of their own.
So, my friend suggests, some of these ministers may even be deliberately planning to make unhelpful remarks in the style of the Scottish National Party during the 2017 UK referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process.
&quot;The renegotiations were an arranged thing&quot; and &quot;The renegotiations had no meaning for Britain.&quot;
Europeans have experienced the hard way how greedy the Fleet Street press can be and how EU-sceptic the press monopolists are, which they were not at the time of the Tony Benn-inspired 1975 referendum, when our membership, which began in 1973, was confirmed by a ratio of 2:1.
They may vaguely remember Boris Johnson, the ultimate Euro-opportunist, who made a name for himself by writing about &#39;the EU&#39;s straight bananas&#39; when he was Brussels correspondent in the early 90s.
Ed Miliband may have been a fool, but at least he knew who his enemies were.
They included a motley crew of tax-evading crooks, phone-hacking foreigners and people nominally based elsewhere who own most of our major newspapers.
Tony Blair actually felt the same way about them, but he realized that if you&#39;re in a cage with a greedy gorilla, you have to give up bananas for the sake of it if you don&#39;t want to be on that gorilla&#39;s lunch list and later dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairite than Blair himself when it came to opposing Cameron&#39;s renegotiation ploy. After all, Bair had agreed to the principle behind the rejected EU constitution, which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, thus giving Blair a way out.
The press never forgave him for that either.
But nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly pat on the back at the Houses of Parliament in Westminster on Monday (I told him he had no more time to waste on me), seems to be in danger of re-embracing Neil Kinnock&#39;s 80s boycott Murdoch strategy, which was a mistake both then and now.
Although it may take time, he is forced to develop a coherent strategy to keep in touch with the media. Not to me, but undoubtedly to Andrew Marr, whose BBC couch Corbyn left on Sunday.
Corbyn&#39;s official position in Europe is, to put it nicely, evolving.
He says that he would like us to stay in the reformed EU.
Well, most people outside the war-mongering Ukip of the UK Independence Party and the most fervent nationalists of the Conservative Party can certainly get behind this opinion.
Hilary &quot;Benn, but not a Benn fan&quot; Benn said so on both radio and TV this week, when his inner Boy Scout would have liked to admit that Corbyn&#39;s choice to appoint a curmudgeonly John McDonnell as Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70s, when his father was on TV trying to be disloyal to his Labor government colleagues without going so far as to lose his government seat.
Hilary&#39;s pinnings were more attractive.
But fighting to stay involved &quot;no matter what&quot; - Benn&#39;s statement - was not what McDonnell said, nor, judging by what Corbyn told MPs and MPs in a private meeting on Monday night.
Whatever the non-hierarchical, emotional and personal image Corbyn wants to convey (remember, he even touched me), communication discipline is important in the age of 24/7 TV, and especially in the maelstrom of social media, which is a fertile breeding ground for paranoia and deception.
As McDonnell has said, it is only fair not to give Cameron a free pass to Europe by allowing him to take Labour&#39;s support in the referendum campaign for granted.
At least Simon Jenkins thinks so.
But McDonnell&#39;s and Corbyn&#39;s basic spin on EU membership (and in line with their Benn-esque regulated economy and anti-capitalist past) is no longer just a far-fetched debate among left-wing dissidents for whom the narcissism of minor differences is the central dogma of doctrinal wrangling.
As for his ambivalence about Nato (Tom Watson is convinced Corby is not campaigning to give up), foreign diplomats will just have to try to explain that to their superiors.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital (they too have suspicious voters) on concessions to Britain when it may be completely pointless?
The US is already somewhat disillusioned with Britain&#39;s poor military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost-cutting Conservative government in power, as I was reminded at Monday&#39;s launch of the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticize Public Health England&#39;s assessment of e-cigarettes
Researchers have said that the state-funded agency&#39;s claim that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than traditional ones was sparked by a meeting of 12 people, some with links to the tobacco industry.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined the Lancet in criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in its report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published this &#39;milestone&#39; report last month, describing it as a &#39;comprehensive review of the evidence&#39;.
However, several researchers have questioned the robustness of the data and pointed to links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
The medical journal Lancet published an editorial last month attacking the &quot;exceptionally flimsy basis&quot; of PHE&#39;s main conclusion.
Two other researchers writing in the BMJ have wondered whether the claims are &quot;built on rock or sand.&quot;
Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, say: &quot;The main principle of public health is that procedures must be based on proven effectiveness.&quot;
They say that the public&#39;s expectation that PHE&#39;s claim “the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are around 95% less harmful than traditional cigarettes” is based on a detailed assessment of the evidence and modelling.
In fact, it comes from a single meeting of 12 people where a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) model was developed to synthesize their opinions on the harms associated with various nicotine-containing products, and the results of this meeting were summarized in the study.
McKee and Capewell say one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO is said to have previously received funding from British American Tobacco for independent research.
He also supported BAT&#39;s public health mandate in the sustainability report, they say.
One of the 12 people at the meeting said he received funding from an e-cigarette maker, but not the funding he reportedly received previously from tobacco company Philip Morris International, they add.
The selection criteria for the panel members is not disclosed, but the panel includes several well-known supporters of e-cigarettes, some of whom also say in the study that they have received funding from the industry.
Others present are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by PHE&#39;s director of tobacco.
The research produced by the group &quot;eloquently acknowledges&quot; that there is a lack of &quot;unequivocal evidence for harm in most products and most criteria,&quot; McKee and Capewell write.
However, none of these connections or limitations are mentioned in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell say PHE&#39;s claims that &quot;there is no evidence to date that e-cigarettes act as a route to smoking in children or non-smokers&quot; are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and wellbeing at PHE, says the claims made in the BMJ have been answered before.
He says: “E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking.”
Half of those who have smoked in their lifetime die from their addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks from e-cigarettes are relatively small, but we need to continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what it does not show, especially when there is so much public uncertainty about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Almost 80,000 people die each year from a smoking-related illness and smoking costs the NHS £2 billion each year.
By explaining the current evidence - that is, even though e-cigarettes are not risk-free, their harms are only a fraction of the harms of traditional cigarettes - we fulfill our national responsibility.
The BBC should give up EastEnders, says a former Channel 4 executive
Former Channel 4 chairman Luke Johnson has said the BBC should stop broadcasting shows such as EastEnders or The Voice, and that commercial rivals would &quot;give anything&quot; for hits such as this Albert Square soap.
Johnson said license fees should only be used to make programs that other UK broadcasters do not.
He criticized the BBC for putting public service programmes, which are likely to have smaller audiences, in difficult timeslots against the most watched programs of rivals and channels such as BBC4.
After BBC chief executive Tony Hall said the company wanted to work more with other organisations, Johnson said he had tried for six years for Channel 4 to establish a relationship with the BBC, to no avail.
&quot;I don&#39;t understand the idea that the BBC is producing and broadcasting programs that would clearly suit unsubsidised competitors,&quot; Johnson told the House of Commons communications committee as part of its inquiry into the BBC&#39;s future.
If the license fee is kept - and I&#39;m not sure it would be a good idea for this medium or in the long term - it should at least limit its production to programs that others do not make and produce.
The Voice is broadcast in prime time because we want to gather as much support as possible for its future.
The idea that no one else would show the show is a joke, it&#39;s ridiculous, it&#39;s plain nonsense.
Johnson said: “I don&#39;t see why a regressive tax should fund programs that could be funded without government subsidies.
The Voice is one such and EastEnders is another, admittedly done in-house.
Frankly, other channels would give anything for that.
I don&#39;t understand how that is a public service broadcast.
I don&#39;t think it would weaken the BBC at all.&quot;
Serial entrepreneur Johnson, who ran Channel 4 between 2004 and 2010, said the BBC is guilty of audience hunting &quot;because of the ambitions of the people who work there, and because they believe that&#39;s the best way to achieve long-term support.&quot;
His comments about the BBC&#39;s most popular series are reminiscent of former Sky CEO Tony Ball&#39;s comments. He used his 2003 MacTaggart Lecture in Edinburgh to suggest that the BBC sell series such as EastEnders.
Johnson said that the BBC&#39;s smaller audience public service programs &quot;go to BBC4, where you often can&#39;t measure the audience, but that way the BBC fulfills its responsibilities and then, in defending its £4billion license fee income, can hypocritically say &#39;sure, we do all these unknown programs that no one watches&#39;”.
They put them in a broadcast location where no one will ever come to see them.
Regarding the license fee, Johnson told the committee, “I challenge you to find a more regressive system in terms of who gets the most bang for their buck.
Of course you all think, we all think, that £150 a year is a lot of value for money, but I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s true for the people for whom £150 is a lot of money because they don&#39;t use the BBC much.
Former Sky and Channel 5 chief David Elstein, who also gave evidence to the committee on Tuesday, said the BBC should reassess its mission under Reith to &quot;inform, educate and entertain&quot;.
He said that only a small proportion of the BBC&#39;s output now qualifies as education - he said the figures were 1% of TV output and 0.1% of radio output - and that it should follow the example of Australian and Canadian broadcasters and change its mission to &quot;inform, educate and entertain&quot; &quot;.
On the issue of partnerships, Elstein said the BBC should focus more on events such as the Proms, which he says are only televised, and team up with commercial companies to make them all available online.
&quot;Sound genetics&quot; makes it possible to control brain cells using sound waves
The video shows how nematodes change direction as soon as a sound impulse hits them.
Scientists have bred worms with genetically engineered nervous systems to be controlled by bursts of sound waves.
The tiny nematodes change direction as soon as they are hit by a sound impulse that is too high for the human ear to hear.
The impulses work by turning on genetically engineered motor neurons with membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves.
Related: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
The researchers said the worms show the new method, called sonic genetics, works. In it, ultrasound can be used to activate certain brain, heart and muscle cells from outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told The Guardian that the method could one day replace deep brain stimulation. It is an invasive procedure in which electrical impulses are delivered to people&#39;s brains to treat Parkinson&#39;s disease.
Nematodes don&#39;t normally respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that when they were surrounded by a liquid with microscopic bubbles, that changed.
He discovered that the bubbles amplified the ultrasound waves, which then travel inside the worms.
Amplified ultrasound waves affect TRP-4 ion channels, structures found in the cell membranes of some worms.
Sound waves cause these ion channels to open and activate the cells attached to them, according to a report published in the journal Nature Communications.
To make ultrasound-guided nematodes, Chalasani genetically engineered the worms so that some of their motor neurons have TRP-4 ion channels.
When Chalasani applied ultrasound to the engineered worms, the microbubbles amplified the sound waves and transmitted them to the worms, where they turned on the engineered motor neurons.
The method shares some of the same features as optogenetics, a pioneering tool that allows scientists to turn neurons on and off using light pulses.
However, Chalasani says that using sonogenetics may have some advantages over optogenetics.
Unlike light, which must be sent along an optical fiber to the desired location inside the brain, low-frequency ultrasound waves can pass through tissue unhindered, so they can be sent to the brain from the top of the skull.
&quot;We believe that using gene therapy and a therapeutic virus, it may be possible to make target human neurons momentarily respond to an ultrasound signal for certain neurological treatments in a clinical setting,&quot; Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.

The ads put the UK arms trade to shame
Watch Amnesty International&#39;s video against gun fairs.
Terrifying killing machines!
Ankle crushing leg irons!
Grape bombs!
As well as electric stun guns that cause excruciating pain but leave no marks!
The cheerful voice and cartoonish imagery leave no doubt that this ad for the world&#39;s biggest arms fair is a pointed parody produced by Amnesty International to highlight the British government&#39;s willingness to sell weapons to oppressive regimes at a party held at Defense and Security Equipment International&#39;s ExCeL Center in London&#39;s Docklands.

As a result of the separate campaign, many posters also appeared at bus stops and subway trains, which require a closer look.
&quot;Important information, Are you traveling on the DLR route between 15 and 18. September?” together we ask, using the font and branding of the London Underground, as the DLR track transforms into an image of a tank.
This September, a horde of gun dealers will arrive on the DLR route... Customers are being asked to help stop the gun fairs.
These 300 posters are made by artists whose work was exhibited at Banksy&#39;s Dismaland Museum of Cruel Designs.
A collective called the Special Patrol Group helped spread the posters around London using &quot;Ad Space Hack Packs&quot;. It&#39;s a six-pound pack of hex keys that, according to the collective, &quot;access a third of the bus stop advertising space on the planet&quot;.
Transport for London is not amused by this unauthorized &#39;poster vandalism&#39;.
One of the parody commercials produced by the Special Patrol Group collective.
According to Cruel Designs curator and University of Essex lecturer Gavin Grindon, artists are increasingly questioning and wanting to take political work to audiences outside galleries.
A lot of artists have started working with activists on the resistance fronts when they have realized that they have to go out into the outside world if they want their art to have an impact on society.
Another anti-arms trade poster greets commuters in the subway.
Amnesty&#39;s video has been viewed over 100,000 times in the last 24 hours via Facebook. It was created for free by the advertising agency VCCP, and the graphic designer and storyteller also worked for free.
Matt Leverin, creative director of VCCP, noticed that the gun fair was not advertised at all - and there was also an empty spot on ExCeL&#39;s calendar at the time - and thought: &quot;Let&#39;s give them the campaign they&#39;re trying to avoid.&quot;
They toyed with the idea of a more realistic ad for an obscure corporation, but &quot;it was more arresting to emphasize the issue with bright colors and animation&quot;.
&quot;They have done a fantastic job in helping us raise questions about illegal torture equipment being sold at fairs,&quot; says Amnesty&#39;s Tom Davies.
Now the UK government must step up and ensure that torture instruments are not sold illegally close to our own homes.
Perhaps the most creative art related to gun fairs comes from inside ExCeL, when exhibitors sell fantastically embellished products.
In its press release, Saab revealed that it had received an order from the US Army for a &quot;shoulder-launched AT4CS RS&quot;.
This includes a “unique tubular charge warhead that delivers superior effects behind armor into the target”.
Whatever it&#39;s doing, it&#39;s not pleasant.
Eight golden rules for living in a student dormitory
It&#39;s been 11 years since I moved into a student dormitory as an ignorant 19-year-old. Back then, I still believed in berets and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the loud smiles of the people I annoyed - and numerous, long complaints from others.
Much of what I learned can be summed up in eight simple rules.
Moving into a dorm can be anything from nerve-wracking to downright scary.
It&#39;s tempting to chat: tell where you&#39;re from, Did you take a gap year and where, what do you think of Corbyn, and why &quot;I seriously don&#39;t love or hate Marmite because really it&#39;s just yeast extract HAHAHA you can find me in my room&quot;.
Take a breath.
And also help others to catch their breath - ask questions and show interest.
It guides the conversation and helps you find the people you like and not the ones you wouldn&#39;t want to talk to even if your eyelashes were on fire and they were handing out fire extinguishers.
Give people space.
People&#39;s rooms often turn into cocktail parties, movie night venues and general hangouts, but they are also the places where people get dressed and mend their underwear.
Related: Don&#39;t Even Imagine Starting College While In A Relationship
University is a tough place for introverts.
Your room should be a place to rest, but many dorms develop a culture of wandering from room to room, which is friendly, social, and creates lifelong friendships.
It can mean hell for someone trying to rest.
Nothing in this culture gives you permission to say &quot;I like you and want to be friends with you, but you need to leave now so I can recapture the energy I spent talking to you&quot;.
Try to sense when a student friend is tired of socializing - and maybe send a text message instead of knocking on the door.
When it came to knocking: knock.
A guy in my student dorm was of the opinion that if the door wasn&#39;t locked, he was invited in.
He saw quite a few things.
Make friends through baking.
Since you&#39;re starting college at the height of the baking trend, knocking on people&#39;s doors with a plate of chocolate chip cookies and introducing yourself seems somewhat less weird, less &quot;welcome to the neighborhood, I baked you something, now smile while I ask you personal questions&quot; 50s.
Offering homemade treats is a great way to make friends.
Your roommates will feel obliged to talk, and it may be that in the future they will associate your face with a tasty surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you know how to bake.
Poorly mixed lumps of flour, sugar and fat will probably make people just pretend to be asleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student dormitories.
Understandably, taking someone&#39;s chicken is stealing, but what if you just take a drop of milk in your tea?
Ask and check with the owner of the milk.
It&#39;s quite possible that they will give you permission, even if they are seething inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it&#39;s annoying and you get my sympathy - but try to be more mature than my roommate who mixed detergent in his milk to punish those who stole it.
He&#39;s in jail now.
You shouldn&#39;t make a fuss so that people can&#39;t sleep or study.
Not just to be a decent person, but because you&#39;re like the proverbial pot banging the pot.
A girl down my hall asked her neighbor if they could turn down their drum and bass because it was three in the morning and she had an exam in the morning.
The answer was to turn up the volume.
When they finally quieted down at five in the morning, the girl kindly let them sleep for two hours before putting her own music on blast, locking her door, and leaving for her three-hour exam.
Wouldn&#39;t it be romantic if your future spouse happened to move into the same dorm as you?
Or conversely, wouldn&#39;t it be incredibly awkward if you thought of your roommate as your future spouse, hit it off, broke up, and then saw him every day and potentially lost all your mutual friends to him.
Sure, the heart wants what it wants, but if your hot roommate isn&#39;t really your future spouse, you might as well try to talk some sense into your bottom.
In that exhilarating moment when you realize that someone has left their key in their unlocked room, the line between prank and bullying is thinner than it seems.
A good prank is fun, but can be undone in an instant.
You can teach a useful and fun lesson about safety by hiding something - but never mess up someone&#39;s room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock their door and drop the keys in a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer - but don&#39;t blue-sticker their possessions to the ceiling more than twice.
Racist attack on accommodation for foreign students in Kitee - A house planned as a reception center was vandalized in Salo
On Saturday morning, a racist attack was made on the accommodation of foreign students in Kitee in North Karelia.
Contrary to what the police said earlier, it is not the accommodation facilities for underage asylum seekers, but the sleeping facilities of foreign students who have been in Finland for a longer time, says Heidi Luukkainen, a teacher at Evangelical Folk High School in Kitee.
The windows and walls of Kansanopisto&#39;s accommodation facilities were daubed with racist signs, such as swastikas, and a metal object was thrown through the window of one of the accommodation facilities, says Eastern Finland police.
According to Luukkainen, who works as a teacher in charge of social guarantee training for young people at Kansanopisto, there were approximately ten people in the vandalized building at the time of the attack.
&quot;It was a weekend and adults are free to move around, so some could have been elsewhere,&quot; says Luukkainen.
Kansanopisto accommodates people from 12 different nationalities.
They are students who have already been in Finland for some time and newly arrived minor asylum seekers.
Everyone who was in the messed up building has a-status.
Some are studying in an adult primary school, some are in vocational studies and some are studying Finnish,&quot; says Luukkainen.
A-status is a so-called continuous residence permit that can be granted for four years at a time to a foreigner who has already been in Finland for some time.
The Eastern Finland police are investigating the attack as an act of damage and a breach of domestic peace.
According to Luukkainen, an information conference was held for the students on Monday, where the necessary interpreters were also present.
There is no panic here, and no one has wanted to leave.
We&#39;ve had foreign students for twenty years, and this is the first time something like this has happened,&quot; says Luukkainen.
According to Luukkainen, the messes have already been cleaned from the walls.
The perpetrators are suspected to have been at least three men and they had been driving a light-colored passenger car.
I think this is a youth weekend night whim now that this topic has surfaced.
Nothing more serious than that,&quot; says Luukkainen.
A hospital has also been planned in Salo, with a reception center planned for it.
The incident happened last week.
MTV reported on this on its website on Tuesday evening.
A swastika was drawn on the wall of the hospital and &quot;You are not welcome&quot; was written in English.
A criminal complaint has been filed with the police.
Update 15.9. at 16:02 Corrected incorrect information provided by the police about the age and status of the people who lived in the target building.
The state cancels the Y-train to Karja - passengers are upset, &quot;absolutely idiotic&quot;
The Y-train from Helsinki to Raasepori Karjaa will stop running in March.
The news infuriated passengers boarding the train&#39;s early evening shift at Helsinki Central Station.
The downsizing especially hits the residents of Shuntio, said Torbjörn Bengtström, who lives in the municipality.
Absolutely idiotic, because the number of residents is growing all the time and those who work need a fast and smooth connection to Helsinki.
This cannot be down to anything other than political will - or the lack of it.
Bengtström says in the HSTV interview video that he comes to the capital with a tractor.
There are also train changes elsewhere in Uusimaa.
The H and R trains running on the main line will be combined into a new R line.
Purola station in Järvenpää and Nuppulinna in Tuusula will be out of use.
On Tuesday, the Ministry of Transport and Communications and VR announced the information on which routes the ministry will buy train traffic from in the next contract period.
The contract period changes at the turn of the year, and there are routes that will be terminated throughout the country.
The new four-year contract, which will be finalized in the fall, will be approved later by the finance committee.
Bengtström from Siunti believes that the state train cutter is a short-sighted activity.
Let&#39;s make the same mistakes that have been made before and repeat them in a very systematic way.
Then comes the regret.
The Y-train is also used by people other than people from Raasepori and Shuntio, because it is fast and passes several stations.
Annina Pöyrya from Espoo was saddened by the fate of those traveling further away from the city by train.
&quot;It&#39;s especially miserable for those who have to reschedule their trips,&quot; he said as he hurtled onto the Y train.
A little relief is on the way.
There will probably be a new train connection to Rantarada, which will replace the Y-train in the area of Helsinki Regional Transport (HSL), i.e. it will take you all the way to Kirkkonummi.
This brings more costs to HSL, i.e. in practice to the municipalities of the region and their taxpayers.
&quot;We are now starting to find out the different options and their impact on the service level and ticket prices,&quot; said HSL CEO Suvi Rihtniemi.
It is still impossible to accurately estimate the costs.
Rihtniemi says that based on the number of passengers, HSL has paid approximately one million per year for the Y-train, the ministry of course much more than this.
The R line on the main line misses two stations.
Instead, the number of train services in Ainola and Saunakallio will double.
A total of 28 small stations and numerous routes will stop throughout the country.
The ministry no longer buys train traffic on the routes Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuruu and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Seinäjoki.
The Pieksämäki-Joensuu route will be shortened to the Pieksämäki-Varkaus route.
Train times will decrease on the routes Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karjaa, Kouvola-Kotka port and Kajaani-Oulu.
More than half a million journeys per year are made on the services that will be abolished, while in total there are about nine million journeys in the transport purchased by the ministry.
The new agreement is supposed to bring annual savings of 12.3 million to the state.
The value of the contract is approximately EUR 27.5 million per year.
Sixten Korkman wrote a chapter in the book &quot;Pääomam aktokaliusuus&quot;: &quot;It&#39;s worth familiarizing yourself with Marx&quot;
The crises of the world economy have brought to the surface Karl Marx (1818-1883) and his main work Capital, published in 1867-1894, writes Yrjö Hakanen, known as the former chairman of SKP, in the book Marx&#39;s Capital to be published today.
&quot;He is taken more seriously now than in a long time,&quot; Hakanen writes in his foreword.
Marx&#39;s assessments of the development of the capitalist economy, its internationalization and penetration into all spheres of life, the concentration of capital and the growing role of money capital and imaginary capital have proven to be astonishingly far-sighted.
The author list of the book based on the Pääoma seminars organized by Hakanen also includes Aalto University professor and respected financial expert Sixten Korkman.
In the book, Korkman writes that Marx is relevant &quot;now and forever&quot;.
Isn&#39;t the former CEO of the Finnish Business Research Institute and the Finnish Business Delegation a Marxist?
Not anyway.
Korkman says on the phone that he does not consider Marx a current economic thinker, but rather an interesting social theorist.
Today, the social sciences are differentiated and specialized, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitator and connoisseur of literature.
&quot;The common perception is that the history of ideas is about the wrong opinions of dead men,&quot; Korkman begins.
It is true that Marx&#39;s predictions went horribly wrong.
Although Marx understood the nature and meaning of the industrial revolution, he drew too far-reaching conclusions from the beginnings of capitalism, Korkman reflects.
But Korkman still sees value in Marx&#39;s radical stance.
&quot;The most relevant thing about Marx is that he asked good questions,&quot; he says.
Now we are again discussing Marx&#39;s interests, such as the distribution of wealth.
&quot;Marx can perhaps give inspiration to those who want to understand the big picture, the world changing as a result of the technical revolution,&quot; Korkman analyzed.
But in what the government should decide tomorrow, Marx is of no help.
In his opinion, capitalism was a hopeless case that should just be stopped.
Still, in Korkman&#39;s opinion, it is worth getting familiar with Marx.
&quot;In the 70s, you couldn&#39;t read Marx,&quot; says Korkman.
&quot;Maoists and Trotskyists and other sects all hated capitalism, but even more each other&quot;.
Today, the discussion is more diverse, and Marx can also be approached without the ideological and political ballast of previous years.
&quot;Every social scientist should familiarize himself with Marx&#39;s world of thought - just like other classics,&quot; says Korkman.
UN calls for war criminals to be tried in Sri Lanka
The UN demands the establishment of a special court to investigate war crimes committed in Sri Lanka&#39;s civil war, the news agency AFP reports.
The UN report on the civil war fought in the years 1983-2009 appeared on Wednesday after a long delay.
The report accuses both the Sri Lankan armed forces and the rebels known as the Tamil Tigers of war crimes.
At least 100,000 people are estimated to have died in the Sri Lankan civil war.
There is no exact information on the number of victims either.
Especially the major attack by the armed forces in the last months of the long war in 2009 should be properly investigated, the UN report demands.
The report accuses Sri Lanka&#39;s armed forces of torture, abductions and systematic sexual violence, with men as likely to be victims as women.
According to the report, the rebels are guilty of forcing bystanders and children to become fighters.
According to the report, both sides are guilty of murders.
Sri Lanka responded on Wednesday that it plans to conduct the investigation itself, but will not allow the establishment of a UN court because foreign judges.
In the English yo-exam, social media could be considered
In the fall graduation essays on Wednesday, there was a long foreign language, most of which was English.
More than 16,000 examinees tested their English skills.
In the exam, you could write a subject about social media, for example.
Based on my own experiences, I had to think about whether social media makes us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, an English-language essay of 150-250 words could be sent to the owner of the advice section of the online magazine.
The title was Dear Agony Aunt.
Agony Aunt corresponds to the Finnish Leelia lounge chair.
He had to be asked for advice on how to get parents to look at things from the point of view of young people as well.
There were a total of four topics in the subject, from which one had to be chosen.
&quot;It was the most difficult of them,&quot; Mia Lybeck, the English lecturer at the Swedish-speaking high school in Porvoo, assessed the third topic.
The third topic only contained a quote from former European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso.
According to Lybeck, the fourth topic was really nice.
In it, you had to write a fire speech on why companies should hire young people to work.
&quot;At least our school has practiced writing speeches,&quot; says Lybeck and assesses the entire exam as &quot;fairly normal.&quot;
In Finnish - or Swedish - in the English exam, you could answer questions about texts that covered, for example, the adaptation of summer flounder to climate change and the processing of large data masses.
On Wednesday, some long Russian (168 students), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27) were also written.
The autumn essays continue on Friday, when it&#39;s time to take another domestic test, i.e. Swedish or Finnish.
In upper secondary schools, the exam is organized normally, which means that it is not affected by the opinion of the wage earners.
The Matriculation Examination Board urges examinees to find suitable transport connections in time so that they can make it to the examination.
You can get additional time if you can show that the delay was not due to your own negligence.
A store was robbed at gunpoint in Oulu
In Oulu, a shop was robbed in the Kello district on Wednesday morning.
According to the police, the robber was wearing dark clothes and a balaclava covering his face.
The man has a normal body and is about 30 years old.
According to the police, the man had threatened the staff with a handgun and got away with a small amount of money.
The matter is being investigated as aggravated robbery.
The police are preparing for the arrival of tens of thousands of demonstrators in Helsinki - support patrols from other parts of Finland
A protest against the government&#39;s cut decisions will block the center of Helsinki on Friday, the police predict.
According to preliminary information, even tens of thousands of people may arrive.
The members of SAK, Akava and STTK unions will meet at Rautatintor at 11 o&#39;clock.
The police are also believed to participate in the demonstration.
On the other hand, the duty of the police officers at work is not only to handle alarm tasks and other police activities, but also to secure the smoothness of the giant expression.
The roads leading to Rautatientori will be closed to motor vehicles from approximately 9:30 a.m. to 2 p.m.
Only emergency vehicles are allowed in the area.
From the direction of Hakaniemi, traffic is cut off at the Kaisaniemi roundabout, from the west direction from Mannerheimintie.
Are there enough people at the Helsinki Police Department, Chief Commissioner Seppo Kujala?
For now, at least, it seems to be enough.
I don&#39;t take a stand on police industrial action matters.
According to Kujala, support patrols from other parts of Finland are coming to Helsinki to express their opinion.
The police do not say the exact number of patrols.
&quot;Something is coming, but as a rule we can manage on our own,&quot; says Kujala.
The police urges you to avoid private cars in the center of Helsinki on Friday.
Kujala estimates that the worst traffic jam extends from the Hakaniemi level to the core center.
Stopped traffic can be expected from morning until early evening.
With the demonstrators arriving from other parts of Finland, there are also a lot of charter buses coming to Helsinki.
They are not allowed on Rautatientori.
Basically, the buses stay quite far away.
You then have to walk the rest of the way to the demonstration site,&quot; says Kujala.
The demonstration also stops public transport in Helsinki.
From the police&#39;s point of view, there is a positive side to this.
The issue of the smoothness of public transport, which is normally at hand in these large gatherings of people, will now partly take care of itself.
The organizers of the demonstration have informed the police that tens of thousands of opponents of the government&#39;s economic policy may come to Helsinki.
The police expect the demonstration to be peaceful.
After all, people are ordinary working or unemployed - ordinary citizens.
Finns are reasonable and calm people, Kujala says.
Local demonstrations will also be organized in different parts of Finland on Friday.
Friday&#39;s demonstration is extraordinary in many ways - Do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
The big demonstration organized by the trade unions on Friday is interesting and exceptional in many ways.
For example, there is no very good point of comparison in Finnish political history, says Martti Siisiäinen, professor emeritus of sociology at the University of Jyväskylä.
In itself, it is no wonder that the ay movement is protesting.
If it didn&#39;t do that, it would raise its hands in front of the government, says Siisiäinen.
The very right-wing government has struck at the core points of the tradition of Finnish corporatism - and also at points that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The government&#39;s tough grips interfere with contract law.
There are many signs that the ay movement is really trying to be brought to its knees.
At the same time, the ay store also has a place to look in the mirror.
A mirror is needed, for example, because the ay movement by no means has the support of all wage earners for Friday&#39;s demonstrations.
What is new now is the sharp division that the expression of opinion creates in the group that the ay movement would like to participate in the demonstration.
Unemployed people gathered from different parts of Finland demonstrated at the parliament building in November 1993.
If you look for a point of comparison for Friday&#39;s demonstration, it could be the giant demonstration of the unemployed, organized in 1993, Siisiäinen says.
Organized in the middle of the deepest recession, Breakthrough Thursday brought together 20,000 unemployed people.
The government of Esko Aho (Centre) lurches from one labor market crisis to another.
It was said that the relationship between the Finnish government and wage earners&#39; organizations had never been as bad as during Aho&#39;s bourgeois government.
Now the relationship between the government and the ay movement is perhaps even worse than at the time of Murrosthorstai.
Besides, Finland&#39;s most bourgeois government is now in power, says Siisiäinen.
The current government coalition is still interesting in the way that it is so strictly right-wing, despite the speeches of basic Finns.
There were still certain elements of the old labor movement at the time of jytky.
Several thousand protesters are expected to be there on Friday.
The demonstration also stops public transport and possibly closes daycare centers and schools.
Even if the expression of opinion does not receive the undivided support of the wage earners, it could become the biggest in years.
In recent years, around 300 demonstrations have been organized in Helsinki each year.
They are everywhere.
Traditionally, the Finnish ay movement&#39;s demonstrations have been quite peaceful - although the methods of operation have hardened in recent years.
Traditionally, in a Finnish demonstration, conflict is avoided, we are law-abiding.
The protesters try to avoid damaging or destroying property, says Siisiäinen.
However, the end of the 1990s brought new winds.
The protest culture changed.
EU membership made the farmers nervous to throw eggs and the police prepared to get pig shit on them.
In 1998, the firemen&#39;s strike lasted for three months.
There were also visible strikes by pilots and air traffic controllers, among others.
Do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
Metal and electrical strikes of the 1970s
The most significant strikes of the 1970s were the metal strike in 1971 and the power plant and electricity strike in 1977.
70,000 metalworkers participated in the metalworkers&#39; strike.
The strike was suspended at the request of the conciliation board after the strike had lasted seven weeks.
The metal workers received a 16 percent wage increase.
The spring 1977 electricity strike lasted 49 days and caused power outages across the country.
Maundy Thursday in 1993
On November 4, 1993, around 20,000 people, many unemployed during the recession, gathered in front of the Parliament building to demonstrate in favor of work.
Firefighters went on strike for three months in 1998
The firemen&#39;s strike was one of the longest, if not the longest nationwide strike of the 1990s.
Farmers opposed the EU in 1994 and 1999
The police were showered with eggs when farmers protested against the EU in 1994.
&quot;Siberia teaches, the EU stops,&quot; was one of the slogans.
The farmers dumped tons of snow on Espa.
The Helsinki EU summit in 1999 also caused farmers to protest and burn hay bales in front of the meeting place.
The nurses went on strike in 1983 and 1995
The nurses went on strike for about a month in 1995.
The last time they were on strike was in 1983.
The 1995 strike was colored by the few deaths that occurred during the strike.
Tehy threatened a strike and mass layoffs of nurses in 2007.
The threat of mass layoffs finally accelerated the negotiations to a result.
Doctors went on strike in 2001
&quot;Doctors on strike - out of necessity&quot;, was the slogan of the striking doctors in 2001.
The strike of municipal health center and hospital doctors lasted five months and sparked a lively discussion about how strikes can endanger patient safety.
After the strike, the public sector raised doctors&#39; salaries.
Students on the move in 2013
About 5,000 students marched for student support in Helsinki from Senatintori to the parliament building in 2013.
The Central Criminal Police investigates the background of the Finnish truck full of refugees for the Austrian police
The Austrian police have asked the Central Criminal Police for help in finding out the background of a refugee truck registered in Finland.
On Sunday, the Austrian police stopped a truck with 42 refugees in Aisterheim near the German border.
It is not known whether the truck was possibly on its way to Finland.
All those aboard the refrigerated truck were in good condition.
We have had an exchange of information with the Austrian police.
The investigation and the main responsibility is at the scene in Austria, says Chief Commissioner of the Central Criminal Police Tero Haapala.
At the end of August, other refugees traveling in a truck in Austria had a more fatal fate.
At that time, all 71 passengers on board apparently died of suffocation.
According to Yleisradio, which first reported on the cooperation with the Austrian police, the truck belongs to a Finnish limited company.
The company engages in, among other things, restaurant operations, and its CEO is a man of foreign background, around 40 years old.
Two Iraqi men have been arrested in Austria for human smuggling.
A captain who beats up refugees, a former drug courier and a hardworking businessman - the story of five smugglers
A rebellious king of smugglers, a violent boat driver, a style-conscious missionary and a taxi driver who thinks he&#39;s a good guy.
For example, such people engage in human smuggling to the European Union.
Criminologist Andrea Di Nicola and journalist Giampaolo Musumeci, who work at the University of Trento, have met and interviewed dozens of smugglers and their &quot;clients&quot;, and the book they wrote, Kuolema matkatoimisto, will be published in Finnish this week.
In the book, they present the tentacles of human smuggling, propose solutions and introduce smugglers from different levels of the business.
HS presents five of them.
I&#39;ll get rid of them immediately
The Kerkenna Islands on the east coast of Tunisia do not attract foreign tourists, but many Tunisians go there for the summer.
Due to their location, the islands are also excellent for smuggling, as the trip to the Italian island of Lampedusa is only 120 kilometers.
For comparison: the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 kilometers.
There, in the village of El Attaya, lives Emir, a chain-smoking captain and father of six children.
The Kerkenna Islands are famous for their shrimp, but it is more profitable for a fisherman to transport people.
Emir has already done that hundreds of times with his blue, ten-meter long wooden boat.
If the boat is full, it can hold 40 people.
From one trip, Emir Earns about 8,000 euros after expenses.
Emir has five assistants who look for clients for him all over Tunisia.
Customers come from many countries, but during the Arab Spring, a huge number of Tunisians wanted to escape the unrest.
After that, the situation calmed down until it flared up again with the refugee crisis.
Customers arrive from the mainland to the Kerkenna Islands in small groups.
Emir accommodates them in empty houses for as long as he sees fit.
Food is given in such a way that the customers just barely stay alive.
Accommodation costs around 75 euros per night, and if the customer runs out of money, that&#39;s their problem.
We go to the water at midnight with the lanterns turned off.
The first night we drive away from the islands, then we stop, wait a day and drive to Lampedusa the next night.
Sometimes the sea is rough, and passengers cry and vomit in 20-meter high waves.
At the destination, the human cargo is unloaded in half an hour and Emir starts the return trip.
Emir wants to be feared.
That&#39;s why he beats up his customers and at least claims that he beats the hangovers to death.
He says in the book that when the police once startled him, he threw all his passengers overboard and told them to swim to the nearest island.
&quot;I grabbed the customers one by one by the neck and threw them overboard,&quot; Emir says in the book.
The calmest travelers come from south of the Sahara.
He reportedly has to abuse his countrymen for this.
I&#39;ll get rid of them immediately.
They need to be shown immediately who is in charge here.
Just an ordinary taxi driver
Goran is an ordinary taxi driver in Bogovaða, Serbia.
His taxi is not very good - the starter motor is dying and it has seen its best days anyway.
However, the most important thing for Goran&#39;s customers is that the taxi moves at all, and that it moves towards the Hungarian border.
Bogovaða is a small village of 500 inhabitants about 60 kilometers southwest of Belgrade.
Next to the village is a center for asylum seekers, where mainly families are admitted.
In the forests surrounding the center, men traveling without their families stay in tents, sheds and abandoned cars, which everyone has managed to find or build.
Families who, for one reason or another, have not submitted an asylum application to Serbia also live in the forest.
Some also stay in private apartments, but that is an open secret.
Among the foresters, Goran finds most of his customers.
These are often exhausted - the route through the Balkans requires a large number of border crossings and weeks of walking in difficult terrain, often in mountainous areas and in the dark.
When they finally arrive in the Bogovaða area, a major human trafficking hub, the people are dead tired.
Goran&#39;s passengers are mainly Syrians, Afghans, Pakistanis, Iraqis and Kurds.
The best customers are the Syrians, he says in the book.
&quot;They say their case once and that&#39;s enough,&quot; Goran praises.
According to him, Africans are trying to bargain.
Goran doesn&#39;t like that.
Idiot Idiot Idiot all the way.
First we agree on a price of, for example, 300 euros, then they lower it to 200 and finally offer 150.
Goran emphasizes that he is a nice and kind-hearted man.
I&#39;m not interested in money.
I&#39;m just doing my job and helping people,&quot; he says in the book.
Goran says that he works cheaper than others and that he only charges 50 euros per person for the ride to the Hungarian border.
The journey is three hundred kilometers, most of it comfortably on the highway.
Colleagues are reportedly asking for three or four times the price.
Goran earns around 50,000 euros a year.
It&#39;s not a big sum for a smuggler, but in Serbia it&#39;s quite a nice annual income.
Serbia has ordered that taxis may not transport migrants 12 kilometers closer to the Hungarian border.
Goran doesn&#39;t care about that: he knows the roads and Shortcuts and takes his passenger a kilometer away from the border.
Then he points his customers in the right direction and storms off.
In the work of Laupeu
The 35-year-old Congolese man is called Missionary, and it&#39;s not just a nickname.
He actually has a Protestant church in Kampala, the capital of Uganda, where many believers who have fled the Congo attend, as well as a small center that helps Congolese child refugees.
In addition to preaching, the Missionary runs a smuggling business where people are moved from the Congo to Europe.
He considers himself to be doing a work of mercy.
Looking good is important to a missionary.
He shines his shoes several times a day and makes sure that the elastic band of his white ankle boots peeks elegantly from under the low waist of his jeans.
The missionary is proud of his new Mercedes, SUV and three motorcycles.
When the Missionary is not preaching, he is organizing people from the Congo to Uganda and on to Europe.
The customer initially calls one of the Missionary&#39;s five phone numbers.
He advises that you should arrive at the border in the morning, hide the money carefully and sneak among the traders crossing the border.
In order to get the status of asylum seeker or refugee, the Ugandan authorities must be told that they are from, for example, the war zones of North Kivu, and that they have had to flee their home from violence.
Often it is true, but if not, the Missionary arranges a new identity for the client.
The old identity card will be destroyed and another one will be obtained in its place.
The Missionary&#39;s contacts in the Ugandan police will help with that.
After that, the client is directed to the same place where real asylum seekers go: to the asylum application procedure, to non-governmental organizations, finally to the UN refugee agency UNHCR.
The missionary knows bureaucracy because he himself came to Uganda as a refugee.
He invoices for each step separately: submitting an application to the Ugandan police costs about one hundred euros, handling documents for a humanitarian organization costs about 150, and the process of moving to a European country, for example, costs 4,500-7,000 euros.
Foil and ice cubes
Tom is a budding smuggler, a former drug courier.
An Irishman in his forties is on duty on the French coast in Calais, where his job is to load people onto trucks bound for Britain.
He has the help of an Afghani living in London, a French taxi driver and dozens of truck drivers who may not even know that they are in the human smuggling business.
At night, Tom and the taxi driver pick up their customers, usually 2-3 people, somewhere near the center of Calais.
They drive the A26 motorway and try to avoid the police.
If the police stopped the car on the highway, Tom and the driver would go straight to jail for organizing illegal immigration.
That&#39;s not what Tom wants, he&#39;s been in jail for seven years for drugs.
The taxi stops, Tom and his customers run across the highway to a rest stop where the drivers sleep before continuing across the channel to the Brits.
Tom chooses a suitable truck - it is necessary to make sure that it is on its way to England and not, say, Holland - and cuts the safety wire of the protective cover.
It must be done quietly so the drivers don&#39;t wake up.
Sometimes the driver is involved in the plot, but then the hassle is more expensive.
When the route is clear, Tom wraps his client in aluminum foil, the same kind that is wrapped around a roast or baked potato in the kitchen.
That should prevent the police thermal scanner from spotting the hider.
Some use a sleeping bag filled with ice for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his client in the truck and leaves the place, hoping that the driver won&#39;t catch any hitchhikers at least before Britain.
King of Smugglers
Muammer Küçük is one of the world&#39;s most famous human smugglers.
The reclusive Turk has been called a master of marketing and the undisputed king of illegal landings in the Mediterranean, controlling sea routes from Turkey to EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
Küçük has been operating since the 1990s and has constantly developed new smuggling methods.
He also has a competitive advantage over other entrepreneurs: he demands the money when it arrives.
One of the new methods is the luxury ship scam: yachts are rented from Turkish ports to take American or European families on nice tourist cruises for a few days.
In reality, the ships are loaded full of Syrians, Iraqis, Kurds and Afghans, who are transported for a fee of 5,000-7,000 euros first from Istanbul by land to a port and from there by sea to Europe.
Customers are kept in human warehouses, for example in old industrial halls, until it is time for them to leave.
People are crammed into minibuses and driven somewhere along the coast.
They are told to hide among the vegetation and wait for a sign.
When it is given, you have to get on board quickly.
Passengers must remain hidden below deck the entire trip.
The Coast Guard can only observe how deep the ship is swimming, as there are no other signs of the crowd.
Food and drink are provided, but the less passengers defecate and vomit, the better.
After expenses, Küçük receives about 53,000 euros for one luxury cruise.
He does not take care of practical matters himself, but hires captains, recruiters, guards, lodgers and other smaller factors to do the work for him.
In the summer season, there are at least hundreds of transports and Küçük Tienaa millions.
He is believed to have bought land, a pharmaceutical company and more than a hundred apartments, which he rents out, through cover companies.
Muammer Küçük was arrested in 2011 at the same time as a member of parliament from the Democratic Party of Turkey and a pharmaceutical entrepreneur.
Since then he has apparently disappeared.
Correction September 16, 2015 at 3:10 p.m.: The Death travel agency book will be published this week, not next week.
The American Olympic runner talks about his illness and becoming a prostitute in his book
Three-time Olympic 1,500 meter runner Suzy Favor Hamilton&#39;s new book has attracted attention in the United States.
In her book called Fast Girl, Favor Hamilton talks about ending her career and becoming a prostitute.
Sports Illustrated published excerpts from the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton ended his career at the Sydney Olympics.
He came to the games in top condition and ran the second best time in the qualifiers.
In the final, however, he panicked.
He rushed to the top right at the start and defended his lead with a manic run.
150 meters before the finish, however, his strength ran out.
He collapsed onto the surface of the track and was passed one by one by the other competitors.
I felt like an idiot and thought I would never run again.
However, I forced myself over the finish line, says Favor Hamilton in his book.
It was later revealed that Favor Hamilton suffered from bipolar disorder.
His brother Dan had committed suicide a year before the Sydney Games, and he himself felt enormous pressure to succeed.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when she became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
The couple had no financial problems, but she was fascinated by the idea of getting money from having sex with strange men.
She also talked her husband into accepting her actions.
Favor Hamilton&#39;s fee was 450 euros per hour.
He says that he spent the money on a luxury life.
One of Favor Hamilton&#39;s explanations for becoming a prostitute was also that she wanted the same adrenaline rush she got from competing in track and field.
It was later revealed to Favor Hamilton that he suffered from bipolar disorder.
The former star runner&#39;s double life came to light at the end of 2012, when Smoking Gun magazine published an article about him.
Favor-Hamilton participated in the Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney Olympics.
In 2000, he was world number one in 1500 meters with a time of 3:57.40, but finished last in the Olympic final in Sydney.
The world champion was jubilant when the federation disciplined the Norwegian ski rooster: &quot;Straight-backed&quot;
Norway&#39;s skiing king Petter Northug has exceeded the limits of appropriateness, according to at least one of his colleagues.
Like last year, Northug and the Norwegian Skiing Federation have spent the entire summer and autumn twisting the athlete contract.
Although the federation has offered Northug a better contract than other athletes, it has not been enough for the multiple world champion and Olympic champion.
As a result of the contract dispute, the Norwegian Ski Association decided to exclude Northug from the World Cup next season.
The decision was praised by two-time world champion Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was glad the union put a stop to the ski cock.
&quot;Thank you for showing some backbone,&quot; Jacobsen wrote on his Facebook profile.
&quot;We cannot allow that one active athlete can avoid working for the federation&#39;s sponsor,&quot; he continued.
The dispute between the Norwegian Ski Association and Northug is about money.
Northug would apparently like to be part of the season with the national team so that he could promote his own sponsorship.
Jacobsen said he is happy to represent a federation that also takes care of future generations and does not let one athlete go solo.
At the same time, he reminded that the union has given Northug both financial and other privileges for many years.
I know that because I&#39;ve been part of the system.
Jacobseb does not accept that one athlete has completely different rules than just because he is the best.
On Tuesday, Northug published his own press release, in which he assured that he wants to play in the colors of Norway next season in the World Cup, as well as in the World Cup and the Olympics after that.
Astrid Jacobsen won a total of six World Cup medals in her career, two of which were gold.
He was part of the team that won the relay gold in Falun last winter.
Frying pan flippers&#39; shield day is also celebrated in Ostrobothnia
On Shield Day, 25.9. events are organized in various restaurants and stores that have been awarded the Paistinkäntäntäjie shield.
The goal of the day is to highlight Finland&#39;s high-level know-how in the food industry and lower the threshold for going to a restaurant, as well as raise awareness of the sign&#39;s importance as part of high quality.
At the same time, we would like to remind you that not all high-quality restaurants are concentrated in the capital region, but top restaurants inspected and classified by an impartial operator can be found all over Finland.
The international attention received by the event is an indication of the significance of the event as part of increasing the recognition of the shield restaurants and the organization.
In Ostrobothnia, the day is organized in Vaasa at the restaurant Fondis and Kantarellis.
In Kokkola, Vanhankaupunki&#39;s restaurant participates in the shield day.
The event has also received significant attention internationally.
It has been decided to make the event one of the organization&#39;s most significant international events, which will be organized on the same day in different parts of the world.
Finland will continue to be the host country of the event.
Kauhajoki-lehti: The establishment of the Kauhava reception center was appealed to the Chancellor of Justice
The Finnish Immigration Service and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are collaborating to establish a refugee reception center in the premises of the ex-garrison in Kauhava, currently owned by LSK Business Park Oy.
According to the complaint, the critical infrastructure of the crisis period is still located in the area on a permanent basis, which is used by the defense forces and its partner, Suomen Erillisverkot Oy.
Kauhajoki-lehti says that according to a private person, placing a reception center in the same building complex would constitute a significant safety risk, which was not taken into account in the preparation of the matter.
According to the complainant, the defense forces may have interests related to the area of the former Aviation School and the airport, the impact of which has also not been clarified when preparing the reception center, the paper writes.
The story states that for the past two years, negotiations have been held regarding the organization of flight training and the arrival of a possible foreign operator at the airport.
The matter has been discussed with, among others, the Minister of Defense Jussi Niinistö (ps.) and the Secretary General of the Ministry of Defense Arto Rädy.
The private person states to the Chancellor of Justice that the complaint is not about opposing the reception center in principle, but that the planned location in the former garrison area is wrong.
The Kauhava city government discussed the reception center issue last Monday.
Niinistö: The situation in Syria is reflected in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region
Governance means that immigrants and those who are here have the necessary conditions, Niinistö commented in the evening to reporters after meeting the chairmen of all parliamentary parties at his official residence in Mäntyniemi.
According to the president, concern for the management of the refugee situation united all participants.
He considers it valuable that in Finland the governing and opposition parties are able to discuss the ultimate issues confidentially.
Especially in these times when we have big challenges ahead of us
According to Niinistö, the situation in Syria as well as the actions of Russia and the United States in the region can also have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and thus on the Baltic Sea region.
Niinistö is hopeful about the development of the dialogue.
If that situation develops in a positive direction, i.e. the United States and Russia are able, it will have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and further on the tension in the situation in the Baltic Sea.
According to Niinistö, the NATO issue was also sidelined in the discussions.
The president did not comment on the labor market situation.
Finnair is canceling 16 domestic flights on Friday, Alkot closed for a couple of hours
One flight is already canceled on Thursday and 15 on Friday.
A list of canceled flights can be found on Finnair&#39;s website.
Finavia is told that the airport operations will be handled by supervisors during the work stoppage.
However, traffic jams and delays can be expected at security checks and other service points.
The demonstration closes the streets of central Helsinki
The demonstration organized on Friday will close the streets of central Helsinki.
The police say that the streets leading to Rautatientori will be closed to cars from around 9:30 a.m. to 2:00 p.m.
From the direction of Mannerheimintie, cars are not allowed on Kaivokatu, Postikatu or Töölönlahdenkatu in the direction of the train station.
From Unioninkatu in the direction of Hakaniemi, traffic is diverted to Unioninkatu at the Kaisaniemi roundabout.
According to the police, the closing time depends on the number of people participating in the demonstration.
Only emergency vehicles are allowed in the area.
Metro and streetcar drivers at the protest all Friday
Metro and tram drivers will participate in Friday&#39;s demonstration from the beginning of the morning commute to the end of the night commute.
The tram and metro staff association told STT about it in the evening.
Most of Alkoi closes for two hours, including post offices
Friday&#39;s protest also causes disruptions to Posti&#39;s services.
Significant delays can be expected, for example, in the delivery of daily mail.
Most of the postal service points are closed.
The blood transports of the Finnish Red Cross are handled despite the strike.
We also aim to handle meal deliveries and hospital deliveries and laboratory samples.
You can get situational information about the services on Posti&#39;s website.
Most of Suomen Alkoi closes its doors for two hours on Friday.
The service industry trade union Pam has instructed its employees to stop work between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m.
Pam has also called on grocery store employees to participate in the trade unions&#39; demonstration.
The representatives of SOK and Kesko tell Helsingin Sanomat that they will try to keep the stores open if necessary with the help of supervisors.
According to Kesko, there is no information yet on the possible closing of individual stores.
Helsinki kindergartens partially closed
Helsinki daycare centers will not operate to their full extent on Friday, the Helsinki Early Childhood Education Agency informs.
Due to the opinion of the professional associations, daycare will possibly be concentrated in certain daycare centers, and club activities in daycare centers and playgrounds will not be organized.
24-hour daycare centers and groups for children with developmental disabilities and multiple disabilities will remain open.
In addition, afternoon activities for school children with developmental disabilities and autism are organized as usual.
The Early Childhood Education Agency promises to inform more about the operational changes tomorrow.
Media researcher: Sipilä takes a big risk
According to Sipilä, versatile channels are needed in communication, and the Prime Minister&#39;s television and radio speeches are one channel among others.
This kind of direct speech channel will also be needed in the future.
This will not be the last time, Sipilä told reporters in the parliament.
Sipilä didn&#39;t want to estimate yet how often the Prime Minister&#39;s television and radio speeches become a recurring habit.
According to Sipilä, speeches may not always be broadcast on Yle&#39;s channels in the future.
If other channels are registered as channels, then we&#39;ll see.
This channel will be used tonight, Sipilä said.
According to Sipilä, the state of Finland&#39;s economy is so serious that it requires a televised and radio speech to the citizens.
This entity that we are talking about now is quite complicated and requires a longer explanation.
That&#39;s why we ended up with this channel, explained Sipilä.
The speech will be broadcast at 21:05-21:20 on both TV1 and Radio Finland.
You can also watch it at Yle Areena.
Sipilä takes a big risk
The media researcher hopes that Sipilä&#39;s televised speech does not indicate a more general inward turning of the government.
Is it an effort to take the right to define the public debate more firmly into one&#39;s own hands and refuse to pose questions in the public debate? thinks Stockholm University professor Anu Koivunen.
I am reminded of Foreign Minister (Timo) Soin&#39;s recent comment that he does not follow the media&#39;s agenda and does not let it define him.
In the name of democratic debate and publicity, I hope these issues are not related.
Koivunen understands that the commercial media is outraged by Sipilä&#39;s announcement.
It would be strange if the media field did not react.
The communication styles of political decision-makers are not a matter of notice in a democracy.
By definition, the task of media representatives is to strive to ensure that politicians&#39; agendas are not taken for granted.
According to Koivunen, the televised speech is a big risk for Sipilä.
Sipilä should bring something new and special to the table in his speech, so that the exceptionally high expectations set for the speech would be fulfilled.
Is there more to come today than we&#39;ve already heard?
Or is he able to speak in a different tone, in a different way or with different words or say something new?
Koivunen says that if the plan is just more of the same old, one has to wonder why such a big gesture was made and Yle gave it extraordinary time.
Ylekin is taking a risk here in the sense that it is not a special situation but a routine speech among others.
The danger is that Yle will be branded as a message for politicians or parliament and the government, which is certainly not in line with Yle&#39;s interests or general line.
Sly move from Sipila
In Sipilä&#39;s future speech, what the prime minister leaves unsaid is also important, the media researcher emphasizes.
In the evening, you have to look carefully at where Sipilä misses and where he doesn&#39;t, says Heikki Kuutti, research coordinator at the University of Jyväskylä.
According to Kuut, the TV speech is a shrewd bet on Sipila&#39;s part, because this way he gets to present his own point of view without making gravel sounds.
In this way, the message gets a large audience without a journalistic filter, in contrast to a press conference, where reporters can ask critical questions.
Sipilä bypasses the media and speaks directly to the people.
However, there is a risk that the media will misinterpret something about the speech, because clarifying questions cannot be asked.
According to Kuut, it is very important how Sipilä appears on TV - do you sweat, do your hands shake.
He compares Sipilä to a father figure who now tells the people what needs to be done.
If Sipilä can present his case well, it can work.
The situation is different than if the government were to inform about something, because here it is as if a person is talking directly to another person.
This is what (US President Barack) Obama and associates do regularly.
Truly exceptional
Political researcher Erkka Railo considers the prime minister&#39;s speech to the citizens to be truly exceptional.
According to him, it has not happened for decades that the prime minister speaks directly to the people.
Extraordinary times require extraordinary means, says Railo.
The researcher thinks that the prime minister wants to get the Finns to sympathize with the upcoming extortions.
On Friday, wage earners&#39; organizations will organize a demonstration and strikes against the government&#39;s actions.
Paavo Arhinmäki, the chairman of the Left Alliance, says on Twitter that Sipilä could deliver his speech on the state of the nation in parliament as an announcement by the prime minister, in which case the speech would also be discussed.
SDP chairman Antti Rinne (left) announces that he will challenge Sipilä to a dialogue.
This is no time for monologues.
Almost half a year since the election.
You can&#39;t hide forever, Rinne writes on Twitter.
A 9-year-old boy who ran away has been found in Tampere
The boy was fine when found.
THE BOY HAS BEEN FOUND AND IS OK, the boy&#39;s father updated on his Facebook page.
The Inner Finland Police Department also confirms the matter to Iltalehte.
The boy went out to play at four in the afternoon.
Later in the evening, he could no longer be contacted.
Father thanks all the people who helped in the search.
Thank you for the dozens of contacts and observations during these hours.
The update was shared close to 15,000 times, which is an incredible balance in such a short time
The Finnish UFC star was disappointed in the violent craze among young people: You are creating hatred
Makwan Amirkhani, a freestyle athlete with a Kurdish background, published a video on Facebook, in which he appeals especially to young people with an immigrant background.
Makwan Amirkhani gave a strong speech against youth street fights.
Amirkhani, who was born in Iran and came to Finland with his family at the age of five, has so far won both of his professional fights in the most prestigious UFC series in freestyle fighting.
Amirkhani says he received a message asking him to look at an Instagram account.
Videos have been uploaded to the account where young people fight in extremely violent ways.
Amirkhani says that he is disappointed by the youth craze.
26-year-old Amirkhan has more than 62,000 followers on Facebook.
Guys kick people on the ground, sit on top of each other and hit without thinking about the consequences of this, when you make videos like this, Amirkhani updates.
Hard to defend anymore
Some of the young people seen in the videos have an immigrant background.
According to Helsinki police inspector Jarmo Heinonen, both immigrants and native Finns have uploaded fight videos to social media.
Especially the fact that you fight in the street at all.
You make the lives of so many other immigrants more difficult here in Finland, reminds Amirkhani from Turku.
Amirkhani reminds that there are websites in Finland that look for crimes committed by immigrants.
There have been an outrageous number of these individual cases.
Kind of hard guys, no more defending you.
You should remember that you are still in a foreign country and will be strangers here for a long time.
That&#39;s a slightly different way of saying thank you for being here, says Amirkhani.
Amirkhani urges young people to remember their loved ones.
If they ever fall victim to some racism, you have yourselves to blame.
Now think twice before you go along with that, dudes.
Amirkhani says that violent action contributes to racism.
You create such hatred in me that I don&#39;t like myself.
Things are pretty bad for you anyway, and you&#39;re not going to improve them at all, Amirkhani concludes.
SAK pledges its position on the savings package - Lyly: decisions on Monday
The chairman of SAK, Lauri Lyly, says on Twitter that the Employers&#39; Association will consider its position on the alternative savings list presented by STTK on Monday.
Lauri Lyly commented on STTK&#39;s proposal on Twitter.
The white-collar union STTK said earlier on Wednesday that it would present its own proposal to the government, which would achieve the five percent productivity jump demanded by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre).
Akava&#39;s chairman Sture Fjäder believes that the board will approve the proposal if SAK, STTK and Akava are all behind the proposal.
However, it would require that the largest Salary Association SAK soften its previous position.
SAK chairman Lauri Lyly, on the other hand, commented on the matter sparingly on Twitter.
Lyly writes that the SAK working committee will discuss the matter on Monday.
According to Lyly, SAK is looking for solutions to &quot;open the labor market lock&quot;, and that instead of coercive laws, agreements made by active parties are needed.
Lyly reminds that the proposal of Prime Minister Sipilä&#39;s government for a social contract did not work for SAK.
Sipilä previously broke off the negotiations on the social contract when SAK did not agree to commit to the goal of a five percent productivity jump.
Comment: The large demonstration threatens to slow down - &quot;I guess it feels a bit funny to shake fists&quot;
It seems a bit funny to shake your fist if you already have a settlement paper in your pocket, writes Pekka Tiinanen.
Moods vary from one side to the other in the wage earner camp.
Is the intention to call for the government to be abolished or to agree with it anyway?
On Monday, SAK&#39;s union leaders spoke of holy hatred towards the republic&#39;s government.
The whole of Finland was threatened to be shut down.
The threat spread to Akavalas as well.
The teachers&#39; union OAJ threatened to close schools and kindergartens.
On Tuesday, OAJ canceled: no schools or daycare centers will be completely closed.
On Wednesday, Antti Palola (sd), the chairman of STTK, the Central Staff Association, appeared as a mediator.
He said that he had been in contact with the government and that he would prepare the alternative proposal demanded by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre) for a five percent productivity jump.
Akava&#39;s chairman Sture Fjäder (kok) immediately rushed to announce that his agreement paper is already ready.
At first, there was no noise from the SAK office.
Chairman Lauri Lyly (sd) finds it difficult to come to an agreement when the union leaders just ordered on Monday to put the country to a standstill on Friday.
In the end, however, Lyly announced that the SAK&#39;s work committee will meet next Monday to discuss the situation and that the SAK is looking for solutions to &quot;open the labor market lock&quot;.
In order for a joint proposal by the wage earners to emerge, SAK should be inclined to accept a five percent productivity jump as a goal.
It&#39;s no wonder that Palola STTK has good relations with Sipilä&#39;s board.
Palola&#39;s right-hand man, STTK&#39;s social influence director Jukka Ihanus previously served as a special assistant to centrist Prime Ministers Matti Vanhanen and Mari Kiviniemi.
Palola characterized that the government&#39;s ay competence has improved all the time.
Coincidence or not, but Palola&#39;s exit took some of the breath away from the Finnish supporters, whose front image is AKP&#39;s Marko Piirainen (sd).
It seems a bit funny to shake your fist if you already have a settlement paper in your pocket.
Edited at 18:00: Added information about Lyly&#39;s comments.
Russia scolded Finland for being a bad host: &quot;This must not happen again&quot;
The speaker of the Russian Duma, Sergei Naryshkin, criticized the OSCE meeting in Helsinki.
According to the speaker of the Russian Duma, Sergei Naryshkin, Mongolia is a better OSCE host than Finland.
The fall session of the OSCE Parliamentary General Assembly has started in Mongolia&#39;s capital, Ulan Bator, where Naryshkin made extensive comments about the July celebration meeting in Helsinki.
At that time, Finland did not allow Russian politicians who were on the European Union&#39;s sanctions list, such as Naryshkin, to come to the meeting - something the speaker kept reminding journalists about.
In our opinion, it was against the values of parliamentary democracy and the principles of open dialogue.
This must not happen again, Naryshkin stressed, according to the news agency Interfax.
In addition to Finland and the EU, Naryshkin&#39;s criticism was directed at the United States, where his entry was also blocked.
Sanctions are political suicide from the EU, Naryshkin declared.
The Russian delegation got to Mongolia without any problems, so Naryshkin continued to tease Finland by praising and complimenting Mongolia for its &quot;excellent organization&quot;.
I am sure that the parliamentary general assembly will proceed constructively and with positive results - unlike the meeting that was held in Helsinki in July.
The Mongolian leadership understands that there should be no obstacles to parliamentary dialogue.
Naryshkin has met Ilkka Kanerva (kok), who is leading the meeting in Ulan Bator, who, according to the Russian media, has already discussed with the Russian delegation.
Lukko meets a real playoff monster: &quot;Goals tight&quot;
Tappara and Lukko continue their bull days in Hakametsä today, when both are on fire for the second day in a row.
Janne Lahti predicts that today in Hakametsä we will not see any real goal celebrations.
Tappara went to Kuopio yesterday to score a 3-2 overtime win over KalPa.
The rise was manly, as last season&#39;s silver group was at its worst with a two-goal deficit.
Lock&#39;s Tuesday was more minor.
Rauma&#39;s catch as a guest of the Blues, who had a shaky start, was round zero points, and the defeat figures were also 2-3.
Tough game, goals tight, if at all they play the same game as last year, Lukko forward Janne Lahti predicts the setups on the club&#39;s website.
Tappara has become quite a playoff nightmare for the people of Rauma.
In the previous two seasons, Tappara has fallen in the semi-finals just from Luko&#39;s final series.
Both times, a decisive seventh match has been required for the solution.
Last season, Lukko took the series to a break in the fourth game, but Tappara rose to the occasion and passed in the next three.
Apart from the goalkeepers, there are no major changes in the composition of the groups.
The cashiers who rejected both of them yesterday will have their turn today.
With Tappara&#39;s goal, Mika Noronen makes room for Tomi Karhuse, and between the Lukko posts, Rasmus Rinne replaces Ryan Zapolski.
Point of view: A lousy play going on in Aces
Sports director Toivola wrote a sequel that was unsuitable for head coach Rautakallio, writes Santtu Silvennoinen from Tampere.
It&#39;s a classic.
In 1976, Sylvester Stallone wrote the script for the movie Rocky, in which he himself played the lead role.
The underdog sensationally put the heavyweight champion of the world, Apollo Creed, on the ropes.
Rocky got a lot of sympathy, even though he ended up losing the title match.
Thirty years after the premiere of Rocky, Mika Toivola wrote a restless Cinderella story for Pori.
To everyone&#39;s surprise, the nameless and wooden-handed team advanced to the WC finals in 2006.
The team was full of anonymous but tenacious underdogs like Rocky.
There was the White Indian, Matt from Pori and Pele from Pelto.
In the playoffs, players dyed their heads red and cut mohawks.
Toivola became a blonde.
The great TV commentator JP Jalo called the coach Neumann.
Aces took the won silver.
Toivola was one of the heroes.
Screenwriter Toivola believes that this season&#39;s new work will work in the same way as it did ten years ago.
The man who works as the sports director of the Aces has built a pot deck for the bad boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have been mauling dudes in the rink like Rocky pig carcasses at a slaughterhouse.
The merits of Masi Marjamäki, Mikko Viitanen, Juha Kiilholma and Matti Kuparinen lie in something other than playing hockey.
Toivola has forgotten that the lead role in Rocky VI is played by Pekka Rautakallio.
Karri Kivi has christened Rautakallio as Sean Connery.
In Rocky written by Toivola, Rautakallio is as clumsy as Connery in the original 1976 film.
There&#39;s nothing Rocky about the Iron Rock other than the nickname.
Rautakallio&#39;s game philosophy does not include rushing and scurrying.
He appreciates playing hard, but it&#39;s different to play hard than play hard.
Last season, Ässien&#39;s Garret Stafford tackled Tappara&#39;s Jere Karjalais in the head.
He got 2+10 minutes from the judges, but Rautakallio put the man in the shower.
He didn&#39;t deserve a minute!
Only those who deserve to play with us.
I don&#39;t accept that kind of game and it doesn&#39;t belong in ace hockey, a heated Rautakallio growled at Satakunta Kansa after the game.
Aces&#39; team this season is strangely constructed.
There are junkies, veterans, policemen, and vigilantes.
There are practically no key players who are at their best playing age.
No wonder the head coach has complained about the lack of skills.
How much have you been able to influence player acquisitions, Pekka Rautakallio?
The events of last season affect procurement and unfortunately the situation on the market was quite tight, Rautakallio answered diplomatically.
It smolders beneath the surface.
Rautakallio, model year 1953, is known to be interested in replacing Toivola as sports boss.
The men&#39;s contracts expire in the spring.
Aces&#39; balance in the season&#39;s three league matches is the same number of losses with a goal difference of 1-6.
Toivolan should not have scripted the sequel.
Olga Temonen plays Sipe Santapuk&#39;s mother
Olga Temonen reveals that if she had met her husband Tuuka as a teenager, they would have had nothing in common.
Olga Temonen is acting for the first time under the direction of her husband.
Yes, I play my husband&#39;s friend&#39;s mother in the movie.
In a way, it feels crazy, actress and producer Olga Temonen laughs.
She has been married to Apulanna&#39;s ex-bassist and director Tuukka Temonen since 2008.
The couple has worked together a lot in the past, but now Olga is acting under Tuukka&#39;s direction for the first time.
Olga&#39;s role in the film Teit mei mei kauniin, about Apulanna&#39;s early years, is Sirkka, the mother of drummer Sipe Santapuk.
Sirkka cheers and supports her son, even though his father Risto (played by Lorenz Backmann) tries to be the voice of reason.
The more I&#39;ve gotten to know my real role model Sirkka, the easier it seems to be to play the role.
He is a great guy and I am grateful to Tuuka that he trusted me with the role.
Olga had already met Sirka before the film project, but since then the two have become much closer.
They have met, talked on the phone and texted.
Sirkka has helped a lot.
We have gone through their history from many different angles.
Fortunately, Sirkka also understands that drama is drama and the truth may need to be colored a little.
Olga emphasizes that Sirkka was almost the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that Apulanna would become the biggest band in Finland.
In the 90s, there was a depression and it was really grim.
There was a pretty small chance that someone would actually succeed, but Sirka had an intuition, and he was right.
Olga says that she had heard a lot from Tuuka about his youth even before the film plans.
However, the parents&#39; stories have sometimes been a little different.
Yeah, if you&#39;re a 15-year-old teenager, how much do your parents really know what you&#39;ve been up to.
Olga reveals that her own youth was completely different from that of Tuuka, known as Heinola&#39;s notorious skater.
Olga was a normal and kind girl who would have had nothing to do with the movie Tuukka.
At most, he could have secretly fallen in love.
According to Olga, she has cooperated so much with Tuukka during the 10 years that a big joint project is not scary.
Everything has always gone super well.
Now the entire production team is going to shoot in Heinola for a month.
However, the couple living in Iiti often plans to drive home at night because of their small children, because the distance is not too far.
We will take over the whole of Heinola for a month.
They have welcomed us very warmly, only asking which streets and when to clear.
Iron Sky 2 became the most expensive feature film in Finland
The budget of Iron Sky: The Coming Race, directed by Timo Vuorensola, is 17 million euros.
Filming starts in October in Belgium.
Director Timo Vuorensola will start filming Iron Sky 2 in October in Belgium.
The sequel to the sci-fi film Iron Sky, Iron Sky: The Coming Race, becomes the most expensive feature film of all time in Finland with its budget of 17 million euros.
In the past, the title of the most expensive film in Finland has been held by Jalmari Helander&#39;s Big Game.
The ongoing Angry Birds animation will also surpass Iron Sky 2 after completion, as the film&#39;s budget is over 100 million euros.
The filming of the film, directed by Timo Vuorensola and produced by Tero Kaukomaa, will begin in October at AED Studios near Antwerp and will last eight weeks.
Director Timo Vuorensola is leaving for Belgium already next week.
A huge budget is not scary.
I&#39;ve been so relaxed!
I have such a relaxed feeling about the script because I know exactly what the movie should be like.
Everyone in the work group seems to realize that something unprecedented is being done.
It&#39;s great to go to Belgium.
Although time is tight, there is no fear in the ass.
I&#39;m more excited, and I can&#39;t wait to show this movie to the public, he tells Iltalehte.
Originally, the film&#39;s budget was planned to be 8-10 million, but as the script developed, the budget also increased.
The budget is big, but so is the store.
However, 100 million could be squeezed into the film, because every angle and effects are so expensive.
Now everything is screwed so tight that there is no looseness at all.
The film&#39;s production company, Iron Sky Universe, launched a crowdfunding campaign and a bond on Wednesday that pays 4-8 percent annual interest.
The final interest rate is determined by supply and demand during the campaign.
After two years at the latest, the company will repay the loan.
Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov star in the action film.
Crazy or cool?
Big logos return to shirts
Trendsetters&#39; fronts have recently been decorated with big logos.
Until a while ago, the fashion-conscious dresser avoided clear and big logos like Crocs.
Promoting a hoodie or t-shirt brand was seen as a bit of a prank.
But times change.
Sportiness has become a real fashion megatrend, and so have old, familiar sports fashion brands such as Adidas and Nike risen to the crest of the wave of coolness.
And as so often before, the line between funny and trendy is blurred: if something is already really funky, it starts to become ironic and cool.
First came the norm core trend, i.e. fashion, where the trendsetters surprised by preferring basic clothes as boring as possible, as if to stand out from the crowd.
Now, instead of the basic gray sweatshirt, put on the sweatshirt buried at the bottom of the closet, with the manufacturer&#39;s logo on the front.
The bigger and more traditional, the better.
In addition to logos, recognizable striped sweatpants from Adidas, favorite team jerseys and New York Yankees caps have also made a comeback in street fashion.
The Calvin Klein logos of the jeans peeking out from the edge of the jeans are now a cool detail.
The trend seems to be moving from sports brands to luxury brands as well.
For example, the front of Versace&#39;s fall sweaters makes it clear which brand of clothing it is.
Would you be willing to show off logos in your clothing?
The Russian politician published the proof: I didn&#39;t get stuck in the hatch of the tank for hours!
According to the claims, the peculiar incident took place in Nizhni Tagil, where the Russia Arms Expo 2015, which presents the products of the Russian military industry, was held.
In recent days, colorful claims have spread in the Russian media, according to which the Russian Ministry of Emergency Situations had to remove the large-sized Zotov from the tank hatch for five hours.
Zotov has since gone out of his way to deny the information.
He even published a picture on his own public Facebook pages, in which he seems to be peeking out of the hatch of an armored vehicle in a rather good mood and, at least based on those pictures, it&#39;s not about getting stuck or getting angry.
Complete nonsense.
Let&#39;s start with the fact that I didn&#39;t go inside a battle tank, it was a BMP-3 assault tank.
I am a former soldier myself, a lieutenant colonel, I have served in the Urals.
I went in there, looked around and came out calmly, Zotov told Komosomolskaya Pravda.
I didn&#39;t get stuck and I certainly didn&#39;t spend five hours in that position, he said.
Zotov explained to the Russian Army TV channel that he admired Russia&#39;s new technology at the exhibition because he himself is a former professional soldier.
That&#39;s why I was interested in what was inside the wagons, I admired our technology.
And I came out through the back door, he said.
I went to all the tanks.
And at the next exhibition I will definitely visit all the tanks and all the assault tanks, Zotov promised.
Zotov also called the reporter who wrote about it a fool.
One fool wrote and everyone else repeated.
There was nothing like that.
I went in, and I came out.
I&#39;m tall and rotund, but nothing like me getting stuck in a tank happened, he told Russkaja sluzhba novostei radio.
Zotov&#39;s words are supported by the fact that not a single photo of the alleged jam has been published, even though a total of 50,000 people visited the gun show over the course of a few days.
The allegation that Zotov got stuck started from a story on the Bloknot.ru website, where Zotov was said to have slipped out of the tank hatch while trying to get out, and finally threatened to shoot everyone around him if he didn&#39;t get out of his hold.
Later, the Bloknot website published a follow-up story, in which the organizers of the exhibition told their own view of what happened.
Everyone is just used to soldiers jumping out of armored vehicles quickly.
But MP Zotov, due to his large size, simply lingered when he came out.
But by no means did he sit there for five hours, said exhibition coordinator Aleksandr Pisarevski to Bloknot.

A leak has occurred at the Kittilän mine of the Canadian-owned mining company Agnico Eagle Finland.
Purified process water from the gold mine has leaked from the so-called tailings pool into the ditch.
According to the company, the measures to fix the leak have been started.
The tank contains the neutralized tailings from the foaming process and purified process water.
In general, the water is either pumped to be used again as process water or, according to the permit, it is led to the environment through a surface drainage field.
The leak was estimated to be around 300 cubic meters per hour when it was discovered.
According to the company, the quality of the leachate meets the current permit conditions.
No other substance leaked into the environment.
The leak was discovered during an inspection on Monday morning.
The leak has not been found to have caused structural damage to the basin&#39;s dam structures.
The company says that it is working closely with the authorities to monitor and correct the situation.
The mine employs approximately six hundred permanent employees.
Dansken Kuoppamäki: The IMF warns against cutting too much
The Finnish country report published today by the International Monetary Fund IMF largely follows the views of the government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organization advocated comprehensive structural reforms in Finland to overcome economic problems.
According to the IMF, reducing overtime compensation and paid holidays would support Finland&#39;s competitiveness.
Reforms would be needed for the entire contract system and unemployment insurance.
According to Danske Bank&#39;s Chief Economist Pasi Kuoppamäki, we agree on the structural reforms, but there are also small differences.
The IMF&#39;s assessment contains a lot of messages in support of the government&#39;s actions, but on the other hand, there are also words of warning about what should not be cut too much.
Such are, for example, infrastructure investments, Kuoppamäki tells Taloussanomi.
In the IMF&#39;s opinion, growth projects should also be implemented as quickly as possible in order to support weak economic growth.
The IMF predicts an economic growth of 0.4 percent for Finland this year, which will accelerate to 0.9 percent next year.
In its new economic forecast, Danske predicts today that growth will remain at zero this year.
The IMF is a bit more optimistic about this year.
They may have had the latest findings as a basis.
This morning, Statistics Finland said that total production was slightly increasing in the summer, Kuoppamäki states.
Less attention could have been paid to the weakened confidence of industry or other so-called softer indicators.
However, the differences are only a matter of a few percent decimals.
Nintendo, recovering from death, appointed a new leader
Tatsumi Kimishima, who worked under Satoru Iwata, who died of cancer in July, will start his job on Wednesday, Nintendo said on Monday.
Iwata led Nintendo since 2002 and was a popular and charismatic face in the gaming industry.
For example, Iwata was responsible for the launch of the successful Wii console.
The choice of the 65-year-old Kimishima is not a big surprise.
He was one of the names floated as a possible successor to Iwata.
Kimishima is a safe choice to follow in Iwata&#39;s footsteps, Ace Research analyst Hideki Yasuda told Reuters.
Kimishima&#39;s task is seen to involve Nintendo strongly in mobile games, but in such a way that it does not eat the company&#39;s bread on the side of traditional game consoles.
More and more minor asylum seekers are arriving alone in Finland
The Swedish Immigration Service already acknowledged in February 2015 that up to hundreds of children who have entered the country disappear every year.
SVT.se and Dagens Nyheter have reported on the matter on their websites, according to the Swedish Immigration Service, hundreds of underage applicants disappear in the country every year.
Juha Kannelmaa, Chief Inspector of the Finnish Immigration Service, explains what the situation is in Finland and how it has changed.
Is the situation the same in Finland?
How many applicants disappear &quot;underground&quot; in a year?- In 2013, a total of 156 asylum applications from unaccompanied minors were made in Finland.
9 of them disappeared.
In 2014, 196 similar applications were made and 11 of them disappeared, says Kannelmaa.
The reason behind the disappearance may be that the processing of the case reveals that the applicant is already registered in some other country applying the Dublin Regulation and has possibly been found to be of legal age there.
In this case, it may be more attractive for the applicant to disappear than to continue processing the case in Finland and be returned to the country responsible for processing the application.
Correspondingly, some of the disappeared are also found later, when they apply for asylum in another member country.
In 2014, there were a total of 3,651 asylum seekers in Finland, of which 134 applications were terminated because the applicant had probably moved out of Finland, so 123 adult asylum seekers disappeared in the past year, he says.
Is the number increasing?
This year, 6.9. to date, we have received a total of 586 asylum applications from minors who came alone.
There are no overall statistics on the number of underage asylum seekers who have disappeared this year yet, but the number of underage applicants is known and has clearly increased, which probably also affects the number of those who have disappeared, he emphasizes.
What about those who have received a conversion decision?
Are they also disappearing, for example, into the &quot;dark labor market&quot;?
This is difficult for the Finnish Immigration Service to assess, as the police are responsible for the implementation of conversion decisions, Kannelmaa emphasizes.
Interior Minister Petteri Orpo (Kok) has been concerned about the growing number of unregistered aspirants to the country.
He has taken action on the matter.
On Monday, Orpo, who discussed refugee issues at the EU interior minister&#39;s meeting, talked about practical measures to control the flow of asylum seekers through Sweden to northern Finland.
Nina Mikkonen is selling Timo TA&#39;s studio online - see pictures of the equipment
The equipment used by media industry pioneer Timo TA Mikkonen for TV and radio productions, who lost his ability to work due to illness, is now for sale.
Mikkonen&#39;s wife, Nina Mikkonen, sells equipment at Huuto.net, which were once the most advanced tools for professionals in their field.
The online newspaper Iltamakasiini was the first to report on the online announcement.
Nowadays, a large part of the devices has been left at the feet of technological development.
In the digital media world, television programs are no longer shot on Betacam tapes.
Nina Mikkonen is still confident that there will be people interested.
Of course, the equipment is no longer that up-to-date, but these are also needed as long as there is old generation material that needs to be digitized.
On the other hand, there are also many enthusiasts - collectors and builders of their own studio, Nina Mikkonen reflects to IS.
The reason for the sale is that the Mikkos are trying to move out of their current home in Myrskylän.
There is no way we can take all the goods with us.
I&#39;ve slowly started to take stock and see which items to give up.
This is where I started, says Nina Mikkonen.
You no longer have your own use for TV and radio devices.
After the recent brain infarctions, it is clear that the man who had a long career will no longer return to working life.
Nina Mikkonen points out that now only goods and equipment are sold.
Timo TA Mikkonen&#39;s actual life&#39;s work was already archived in the summer at the National Audiovisual Institute, whose representatives went to pick up films and other material from Myrskylä at a box store.
Traffic threatens to be worse than expected: Metro and trams may stop for the whole of Friday
Metro and tram drivers will decide today whether to expand the force regarding Friday&#39;s demonstration.
The original plan was to stop metro and tram traffic only for the duration of the demonstration on Friday.
During the afternoon, it will be decided whether the traffic will stop for the whole day.
Chief shop steward Pekka Hirvonen says that the threat is great on the field.
Cuts to night and shift allowances are hurting drivers badly, so the government&#39;s plans to cut allowances arouse opposition.
Hirvonen thinks that stopping traffic for the whole day is a kind of dilemma.
If the metro and trams stop for Friday, public transport in the capital region will be almost completely at a standstill.
According to VR, trains do not run between six in the morning and midnight on Friday.
On Friday, there is no local or long-distance traffic.
Trains that left before six in the morning are driven to their destination stations.
According to HSL&#39;s data, most of the buses will remain at the depot.
AKT members are off work on Friday from three in the morning until three in the morning on Saturday.
Probably a small number of the buses can be driven, they are driven by supervisors, HSL spokesperson Pirkko Repo thinks.
Repo says that HSL cannot say exactly which bus routes will run on Friday.
The wage earners&#39; organizations are organizing a large demonstration at the Helsinki Railway Square on Friday from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m.
Aftonbladet: Hungarian police used tear gas against refugees
Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tear gas.
The incident took place on the border between Hungary and Serbia, where many refugees are trying to get to Europe, reports the news agency AP.
According to Sky News, the refugees have tried to break through the border fence.
The refugees, many of them women and children, fled in panic.
According to local media, the Hungarian police would also have used water cannons against people.
A Muslim boy was arrested at school in Texas - the teacher mistook a homemade clock for a bomb
In Texas, USA, 14-year-old Ahmed Mohamed has been arrested after a teacher mistook the homemade clock he brought to school as a bomb.
Mohamed told the Dallas Morning News that he just wanted to show off the output of his electronics hobby.
However, one of the teachers thought the clock looked like a bomb.
The police were called to the scene, and the situation ended with the boy being handcuffed and taken to a juvenile detention cell.
At no point has Mohamed been found to have claimed anything other than that he had made the watch.
Still, it is still possible that the boy will be accused of making a fake bomb.
According to Mohamed, the police had stated that the watch looked like a &quot;movie bomb&quot;.
The watch is in the custody of the police, but it reportedly consisted of a circuit board and a digital display with wires between them.
The incident happened last Monday and Mohamed was punished with a three-day forced leave from school.
His father is outraged by the incident, and the country&#39;s American-Islamic Council is considering whether the incident is yet another indication of Islamophobia in the United States.
Britain roars - Labor leader refuses to sing national anthem
The song asks God to protect the Queen, but Corbyn is anti-monarchy.
Members of Parliament from Corbyn&#39;s own Labor Party have also joined the criticism presented by the right-leaning press.
This has offended the people, Labor MP Kate Green speculated in a BBC radio interview.
Green thinks Corbyn should have joined in the chant.
Yesterday&#39;s commemoration honored the battle of British Air Force pilots against the German Luftwaffe in 1940.
In its official statement, the Labor Party defends Corbyn and emphasizes that he showed his respect to the pilots by participating in the event.
We all owe a huge debt of gratitude to the heroism of the Royal Air Force pilots.
He (Corbyn) stood respectfully silent during the national anthem, the statement emphasized.
Corbyn&#39;s election as party leader has divided Labour&#39;s ranks.
Among MPs in particular, there are those who fear that he will drive away moderate voters with his radical views.
Corbyn supports unilateral disarmament, ending austerity and increasing public spending.
Today, Corbyn is scheduled to appear for the first time as party leader in Parliament during Prime Minister&#39;s Question Time.
Corbyn has asked the public for suggestions on what to ask Prime Minister David Cameron.
At the end of the week, Cameron criticized Corbyn&#39;s election as party leader on Twitter.
The Labor Party threatens our national security, our financial security and the security of our families, the Prime Minister tweeted on his own account.
The cause of the death of a family in Minnesota is still unclear - the father of the family was awaiting a lawsuit
South Lake Minnetonka police have been investigating a family homicide in Greenwood, Minnesota for almost a week.
The family of five was found dead in their home on September 10, and a couple of days later police confirmed that the shooter was the family&#39;s father, Brian Scott Short, 45.
After first shooting his wife and three children with a shotgun, Brian Short killed himself in the house&#39;s garage.
Dead for days
The family was found after the school became concerned about the children&#39;s absence.
Acting on this tip, the police went to check the house and found the Short family dead in different parts of the huge house.
According to StarTribune, it is possible that the victims had been dead for days.
A millionaire house and a successful company
South Lake Minnetonka Police Chief Michael Siitari&#39;s case is still under investigation.
The motive for the bloodshed is still unclear.
The shooter, Brian Short, was a successful entrepreneur who had made his fortune on AllNurses.com, a social media site for nurses.
In an interview with StarTribune in 2014, Short said that the site has four million different visitors every week.
I have had 50 offers to buy the company in the last ten years.
I have rejected them all.
However, I still have a lot of ideas that I want to implement.
Maybe at some point I will sell the company, but not yet.
Success was seen, for example, in the fact that the Short family bought a luxurious house in Greenwood in 2011 for two million dollars.
The house is advertised on the real estate website Zillow as a car collector&#39;s dream: the house has not only 12 rooms, but also a garage big enough for eight cars.
Lawsuit pending
However, according to StarTribune, the father of the family was facing a lawsuit.
Achieve Test Prep, which offers a variety of prep courses, had sued her over comments on AllNurses.com.
According to Achieve Test Prep, Short&#39;s site had not removed comments defaming the prep courses, and as a result they had lost customers to their competitors.
However, according to the StarTribune, it is very unclear whether the lawsuit would have had a very significant impact on Short&#39;s business.
Vesku Loiri offered cake coffees
In addition, the trio of owners were awarded the horse owner of the month award of Suomen Hippos at the trotting event.
It&#39;s great, Loiri commented cheerfully on his honor board.
The celebrated Fabrice Duo won the Derby on the first Saturday of September and earned 100,000 euros with their win.
Artist legend Loiri was still confused by Fabrice Duo&#39;s success in the big competition.
I still can&#39;t believe it happened.
Menestyshevosen&#39;s trainer Korpi gets Loir to have complete peace of mind while working with the horse.
Pekka orders and decides where the horse is taken to compete.
And I&#39;ll keep my hat on, Loiri joked.
A shockingly wonderful gesture from an NHL star - &quot;The biggest donation made by an athlete of all time&quot;
Montreal Canadiens superstar PK Subban has donated ten million dollars (about 6.7 million euros) to the Montreal Children&#39;s Hospital.
According to the hospital&#39;s press release, it is the largest single donation ever made by an athlete to charity in Canada.
In addition, the 26-year-old Subban has committed to helping the hospital with other fundraising efforts for the next seven years.
Subban signed an eight-year, $72 million contract with the Canadiens a year ago.
So Subban&#39;s donation amount is significantly higher than his nine million dollars annual income.
As a reward for his donation, Subban will receive a lobby in the hospital named after him.
Canadiens players have made significant contributions to local hospitals before.
The long-time captain Jean Beliveau, who passed away a year ago, raised millions of dollars for the same children&#39;s hospital, for example, and Saku Koivu raised a huge sum of money for another large hospital in the city, which was used to get the hospital a PET scanner needed for cancer examinations.
You can order from a Japanese cafe for your wife&#39;s evening - she serves the food wearing just a bikini and an essu
Theme cafes are a big thing in Japan.
The market already has a goat cafe, a rabbit cafe, a vampire cafe, a hali cafe and now a wife cafe.
It hits the lonely, the unsociable and the hungry.
The matter was reported by Metro.
You can order a wife or husband for the evening from the Ore no Yome (Finnish: my wife) cafe in Tokyo.
It&#39;s a waiter pretending to be a customer&#39;s spouse.
The &quot;husband&quot; is chosen from a list before entering the cafe and he prepares and serves the food.
The wife is opposite wearing only a bra and a bikini, the husband in tight cycling shorts.
The website offers all the information about the wife candidates, from height and weight to what kind of mattress they prefer to sleep on.
Soon, 150 million vehicles will be connected to the network: They began to equip themselves for attacks against car data security
The Automotive Security Review Board (ASRB) also supports technological development and innovation in the industry, says Intel&#39;s press release.
The board consists of top security experts from around the world.
ASRB researchers will conduct ongoing security tests and audits with the goal of standardizing best practices and design recommendations for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products.
At the same time, Intel announced the first version of cyber security best practices.
In the future, the company will update the report based on ASRB&#39;s research results.
Gartner, an international ICT research and consulting company, estimates that by 2020, approximately 150 million vehicles in traffic will be connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road.
According to the same estimate, 60-75 percent of these vehicles are able to consume, create and share web-based data.
We can and we must improve the cyber security of cars, says Intel Security Director Chris Young.
The ASRB enables Intel to establish security best practices and support the vision that cybersecurity is a critical ingredient in the design of every connected car.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road, making the ASRB the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world&#39;s leading innovators in computing.
Ford Focus RS costs around 52,000 euros in Finland!
Ford&#39;s Focus RS model has been awaited for years like a rising moon.
Finally, the car is starting to be seen in Finland as well.
Ford announced the details of the RS now that the eyes of the automotive world are on the Frankfurt Motor Show.
Thanks to its 2.3-liter, 350-horsepower engine, Ford&#39;s new four-wheel-drive RS accelerates from zero to 100 in 4.7 seconds and has a top speed of 266 kilometers per hour.
The price is also interesting for Finns, initially it is said to be 52,000 euros.
The car is now available to order, although Ford does not say when the first cars will arrive in Finland.
Favorite brand Kia presented two new products at the Frankfurt Motor Show - these are the new Sportage and Optima
For Finns, the more important of the two innovations is certainly the new fourth-generation Sportage, with which Kia intends to grab a larger slice of the ever-growing SUV market.
The new Sportage, created under the leadership of European design director Gregory Guillaume, is rounder than before.
The wheelbase and exterior dimensions have increased by a centimeter here and there, and the car cuts through the air even more efficiently.
The engine selection is largely unchanged, but a 1.6-liter turbo developing 177 horsepower has been added.
More about the Kia Sportage and its performance and consumption will be told closer to going on sale.
We will have to wait a little longer for that, because the new Sportage will arrive for us in the spring of 2016.
Even before the turn of the year, the new Kia Optimas arrive in our country.
At a glance, the novelty does not seem to have changed, but it is a brand new car.
Kia plans to win the hearts of upper-middle-class buyers with even better driving characteristics, lower noise levels and higher-level equipment.
To begin with, we get Optimas equipped with a 1.7-liter turbodiesel and a 2.0-liter gasoline engine.
Next summer, the pace will accelerate, when the Optima GT with a 2.0-liter turbo engine will arrive alongside them.
At the same time as its arrival, sales of the Optima station wagon begin.
Chisu returned to the stage - sizzling in a daring jumpsuit
Singer Chisu is participating in the Life for Children concert with other domestic stars.
The electric blue pantsuit has a spectacular, open neckline.
The outfit beautifully showcases the singer star Siro&#39;s waist.
The ensemble is crowned with a golden metal belt and red lipstick.
During the three-year break, the singer who became a mother has been able to shed the pregnancy pounds with light exercise and yoga.
Chisu&#39;s daughter will soon turn one.
The singer released her first single from the new album in August.
Getting back on stage and in front of a large audience after a long break doesn&#39;t really excite me.
I have missed everything related to music, the singer says.
In a couple of weeks, Chisu will release his new and at the same time his fourth album called Polaris.
The new life situation has inspired me to make new songs.
At this point, I wonder if people will find my new record, Chisu thinks.
Kim Kardashian&#39;s maternity style amazes again - now the breast is visible
Reality TV beauty Kim Kardashian gives talking points one after the other.
She&#39;s been flaunting her pregnancy belly and chest gear liberally in sexy outfits, most recently at 1am US time last night when she left husband Kanye West&#39;s gig with her sister Kourtney Kardashian.
The black maternity dress is transparent at the breast.
It reveals the skin-colored bra under the dress as the flash lights flash.
The last time Kardashian wore an Amazonian maternity outfit was when she visited a friend for dinner in New York just a couple of days ago.
The accessory was highlighted by black over-the-knee boots.
The third special maternity outfit is as fresh as last week&#39;s Friday, when the pregnant belly was on display.
The tough laws of the modeling world: No home, you&#39;re lonely, the competition is fierce
Top model Manon Leloup wanted to correct the perception that the modeling world is pure glamor and champagne parties.
He made his own documentary film Speaking Dolls, where Leloup and his colleagues talk about the modeling business.
Harper&#39;s Bazaar magazine gathered Leloup&#39;s six hard truths from behind the scenes.
Every season starts from scratch.
Even if in the previous season you posed in top designer outfits, the new season starts again with castings.
And every season, new, fresh faces enter the industry, competing for work with the conkers.
Models rarely have a place they can call home.
The job is constant travel and it can go up to a year so that the accommodation is a hotel room or an apartment where the fashion houses house their models.
If you are very young and your mother cannot travel with you, loneliness can be unbearably difficult.
New York and Paris are desirable jobs, but they are the most stressful of all.
There isn&#39;t just one kind of thinness.
An agent in New York might ask you to drop some pounds, but in Paris they&#39;ll say you&#39;re too skinny.
Getting a job is always a game of risk.
During fashion weeks, models and designers are together all the time, and at the same time act as a support network.
When the fashion weeks end, the separation is bittersweet.
Models want to get into this industry because of the opportunities it offers, but they resent the fact that everyone thinks the job is just about showing off clothes.
Models also want to be their own personalities.
The work makes the models feel like they are actors with a role.
But you can also express yourself in the work of a model.
Models at the Tory Burch show yesterday.
Fashion weeks are currently being celebrated in New York, where designers reveal their collections for next year.
Roope Salminen, who has changed his style, plays the most unknown Apulanta musician in the film
Roope Salminen plays the band&#39;s founding member Antti Lautala in the film based on the early years of the band Apulanta.
Lautala founded Apulanna in 1991 with Toni Wirtanen, but left the band in 1994.
This is quite a challenge for me, because I&#39;m about to turn 26 as a rap artist, and in this film I play a 16-year-old guitarist, Salminen laughs.
I didn&#39;t want to meet the real Antti before filming, because I want to make my own interpretation of him.
Antti is clearly the most unknown of that group, so I think it&#39;s good that I&#39;m only learning his playing style from the video.
I don&#39;t want to make an imitation of a person.
The man piloting the band Roope Salminen and Koirat out of nowhere does not take the role.
Punk manners come naturally to the man.
In the punk episode of the program Tähdet, tähdet, many surely saw a foretaste, as well as if you have ever been to our gigs.
Our performance has never been anything small, but we always go all out.
The main actors of the movie You made us beautiful, directed by Tuukka Temonen, who played bass in Apulanna between 1993-2004, were announced today.
The band&#39;s core group, which has become familiar to the public, is performed by young actors who are still relatively unknown to the general public.
Drummer Sipe Santapukki is played by Teppo Manner, singer Toni Wirta by Tatu Sinisalo, bass player Tuukka Temo by Iiro Panula.
Roope Salminen already gave a hint about his upcoming wedding last night, when he mysteriously said on Snapchat that he was preparing for the most important day of his career.
Roope has already published a picture of his new look on Instagram yesterday, which he has had to implement for the film.
Roope, previously seen with a mustache and beard, has shaved his face into chiseled cheeks and dyed his brown hair black.
A psychologist advises: This is how you tell children about refugees
In recent days, many parents have had to think about how to tell their children about the situation of refugees trying to get to Europe.
Or is it worth telling about it at all?
There is no need to forcefully bring up the matter, psychologist Ferdinand Garoff, a member of the SPR&#39;s crisis group, advises.
Younger children should be protected and, for example, not allowed to watch the news alone.
Young children are not always able to understand what they see, and it can linger in the mind and make them anxious, he says.
However, if the child has come across television news pictures of refugees or heard about it elsewhere, it is worth talking about it.
It is good to start the conversation from the child&#39;s starting point and listen carefully to what he asks.
A child&#39;s fears may be surprising.
They may not be what a parent imagines they fear.
It&#39;s not worth scaring a child for nothing, even if you are distressed and scared yourself.
A younger child closely monitors the behavior of their parents.
If the parents themselves remain calm during the conversation, the child also feels safe.
Older children probably come across a discussion about refugees at school, with friends or online.
It&#39;s a good idea for parents to discuss the matter with them if the matter worries the child.
The fact is that not all people in the world have it good.
Together with the children, the parents can think about how this is handled in our family.
In our opinion, is the world a safe or unsafe place after all?
Parents may also have different educational perspectives - some may want to protect their children from anxiety as much as possible.
On the other hand: If the family also talks about difficult things, the child gets a model of how to deal with the difficulties that come up in life.
This may be useful for him in the future.
Social psychologist Janne Viljamaa: &quot;Teach your child to help the weaker&quot;
At the end of your strength?
You can still be a good parent to your child
Ball lightning hitting Vermo is hard to contain
Perttu Pohjola was honed by Apila Pallosalaman&#39;s blunt attack in the middle of summer.
It only racked up wins and second places, until at the end of July there was a collapse in Tampere&#39;s raves.
Since the stallion was completely frozen, the trainer suspected something was wrong and made an appointment with a veterinarian for his protégé.
The explanation for the blackout became clear in the observation.
The horse had laryngitis.
The disease was not the mildest, but it required two courses of medicine to get rid of it.
Since Apilan Pallosalama had to do light exercise, Pohjola says that he was positively surprised by the horse&#39;s last run.
She was the second SE mare after Taruntuuli in her record time in Turku.
Apila Pallosalama was under a lot of pressure from the break, when it had only been able to drive normally for a few weeks.
Taking those things into account, the slight bending at the end was understandable, says Pohjola.
The trainer assumes that the good competition made the stallions sharp.
The horse&#39;s pace certainly went on from there, and hopefully it would have evened out as well.
Apila Pallosalama has been so-called humor horses.
When it has not been amused, it has been able to throw away without getting sick.
On a good day, however, the stallions have released such lightning bolts that the opponents have been amazed.
At breakneck speed, fellow competitors can&#39;t keep up with Pallosalama, from which even warm-blooded riders break away.
Pohjola hopes to have a peesijoon in Vermo.
However, how Apila&#39;s Pallosalama agrees to it is a different matter.
It&#39;s quite difficult at the start and might stick under the boom of the starting car and stuff like that.
I hope the stallion would be calmer than when he left Turku.
Apilan Pallosalama, when he is fit, can also come from the front, and we are going to ride it to victory, the coach promises.
That&#39;s why you can&#39;t get rid of useless iPhone programs
Apple CEO Tim Cook.
At least some of the programs that come with Apple&#39;s iPhones can perhaps be removed sometime in the future - but not quite all.
Apple plans to possibly remove some of its own programs from iPhones in the future, says the company&#39;s CEO Tim Cook in an interview with Buzzfeed magazine.
There are a number of programs on Apple&#39;s iPhone that relatively few people use: For example, FaceTime calls, Newsstand, Health, Stock Exchange, Podcasts and Tips come to mind.
The latest addition to these programs is the Apple Watch, which came as a forced update to iPhones, although it is only necessary for owners of Apple&#39;s smartwatch.
According to Cook, removing Apple programs is more complicated than it seems.
Some apps are linked to something else on your iPhone.
If they are removed, it can cause problems somewhere else on the phone, Cook tells Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which of Apple&#39;s iPhone apps work seamlessly with other programs.
There are other programs that don&#39;t work this way.
So over time, I think we can develop a way to let the user remove them,&quot; Cook added.
According to Cook, Apple is therefore investigating the matter, because the company does not want to waste memory space on users&#39; iPhones.
Inflation in the euro area fell to 0.1 percent in August
Eurozone consumer prices rose only slightly in August, i.e. 0.1 percent year-on-year, the EU&#39;s statistical authority Eurostat said today.
The increase in prices was dragged down by the cheaper energy.
Eurostat revised its preliminary estimate of 0.2 percent from a couple of weeks ago slightly downwards.
In July, the inflation rate was 0.2 percent.
So-called core inflation fell to 0.9 percent in August from 1.0 percent in July.
Eurostat&#39;s preliminary estimate for core inflation was 1.0 percent.
Energy was 7.2 percent cheaper in the euro area last month than a year ago.
In the entire 28-country EU region, average inflation was zero in August.
In July, the increase was 0.1 percent.
Among the euro countries, consumer prices rose the most in August, i.e. 1.4 percent, in Malta.
In Cyprus, inflation was the lowest, with prices falling by 1.9 percent.
In Finland, inflation was minus 0.2 percent according to the EU&#39;s harmonized price index.
Inflation in the euro area is still stubbornly far from the European Central Bank&#39;s (ECB) target, which is a price increase of around two percent in the medium term.
The ECB predicts an average inflation of 0.1 percent for the euro area this year.
Next year, the increase will pick up to 1.1 percent, the central bank predicts in its new inflation forecasts announced at the beginning of September.
The US Fed will next try to tighten monetary policy
The next recession in the United States will begin in less than a year at the earliest, but more likely within three years, after the country&#39;s central bank, the Fed, starts raising its interest rates again after a long time.
And in the financial market, the downturn starts before the next recession.
The Fed has hinted that it will start raising interest rates possibly as early as this week and by the end of the year at the latest.
Therefore, the next recession can hit the fastest by next autumn and the financial markets will be the price rhythm before then.
Or at least that&#39;s what will happen if the world&#39;s largest economy and financial markets operate as they have been doing - and if they react to the Fed&#39;s tightening of the money taps as they have in the past.
These are the conclusions reached by Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker, market research strategists of the German bank Deutsche Bank in London, in their extensive study of long-term market and economic cycles.
The bank distributed the more than 60-page Long-Term Asset Return Study research report to its major international customers last week.
The strategists who wrote the study and report do not believe they know when exactly the Fed will start raising interest rates or what will happen in the economy and markets after that.
Instead, they use the hard facts and calculations of economic statistics to show how the economy and markets have behaved in the past during and after Fed rate hikes.
In addition to historical observations, they examine which key variables of the economy and financial markets are now in the same or different pattern than at the time of previous interest rate increases - and what may result from that.
It becomes clear that both the economy and the financial markets are now in a worse condition to withstand a rise in interest rates than at any time since the 1950s.
Maybe not even a year until the beginning of the recession
The leaders who decide on the Fed&#39;s monetary policy and its current tone have been hinting throughout last summer and early autumn that the time is starting to be ripe for raising interest rates.
The first interest rate hike in more than nine years could come as early as this week.
The matter will be resolved between Wednesday and Thursday, when the so-called open market committee of the Fed&#39;s executive board gathers to decide on the matter in its two-day meeting.
The last time the Fed raised its so-called Fed funds policy rate was in June 2006.
That was the end of exactly two years of relatively regular but small rate hikes of 0.25 percentage points at a time, with which the Fed raised its interest rate from 1.25 percent to 5.25 percent.
The symptoms of the financial markets began in 2007 with the difficulties of the US&#39;s riskiest housing financing, and a year later the financial crisis erupted into a global doomsday nightmare.
The big recession hit in 2009.
Last time, the serious setbacks in the financial markets and the real economy started more slowly than it has typically happened after previous interest rate hikes by the Fed.
Correspondingly, the trials were harder and harsher than ever since the depression of the 1930s.
Deutsche&#39;s strategists have sifted through the ups and downs of the world&#39;s largest economies and the ups and downs of the financial markets since 1950 and in some places since the beginning of the 19th century.
They have been explaining the Fed&#39;s interest rate hikes and their economic and financial effects since the 1950s.
From the first rate hike to the start of the recession, the quickest time has been less than a year, most often less than three years, and on average less than three and a half years.
The price rise in the financial markets has ended within a year or two after the start of the Fed&#39;s interest rate hikes.
The Fed has alternately raised and alternately lowered its key interest rate since the early 1950s by a dozen cycles of varying sizes.
Each time has differed in some respects from the others, and there are relatively few multipliers in the review, so based on them, it is hardly possible to conclude anything definite about the effects of the next interest rate hikes.
The strategists remind us that this time many things are different.
And not just better.
Interest rates too low for too long
Even with decades of research, the decisive causes of the financial crisis, let alone the culprits, cannot be found out beyond doubt.
But three points about the reasons that led to the crisis and increased its destructive power should be clear to some extent beyond doubt:
1) In the 2000s, the Fed, the ECB of the euro area and other major central banks kept their key interest rates too low for too long.
They patched up the traces of the techno bubble, and at the same time grew the next one.
2) The already excessive amount of debt accumulated in various parts of the financial and real economy over the decades grew even larger under the influence of the central banks&#39; excessively loose monetary policy.
The largest debt bubble in economic history up to that point was born.
3) In particular, the crazy-cheap debt financing packed almost without restraint into the financial economy inflated the largest price bubbles in the economic history up to that point in most areas of the financial market, from shares to real estate, bonds and commodities.
It is also unlikely that there will be a very harsh dispute that the financial markets, which had soared to heights based on increasingly complicated debt levers, were in a rare dangerous and unstable mess when the Fed and other central banks last drove interest rates up.
Financial structures tuned to debt levers, let alone valuation bubbles, only lasted their time after the interest rate hikes had started and the costs of debt financing had started to rise.
The risks materialized as the financial crisis, and the Great Recession followed.
Bigger bubble and more debt
Deutsche&#39;s strategists don&#39;t guess what will happen next, but they give a reason to think by mentioning things like the following, for example:
1) The Fed and other major central banks have now kept their monetary policy even easier for even longer than before the financial crisis.
If interest rates were too low for too long before the crisis, now they have been even lower for even longer.
2) Getting into debt hasn&#39;t been crazy cheap for a long time like it was ten years ago, but now debt money is literally cheaper than free money at its lowest point.
Therefore, the debt burden of the financial and real economy has not eased, but now in different parts of the economy there is a much heavier debt load than before the financial crisis or at any time before.
3) The liquidity issued by the central banks, which is more flowing and cheaper than before, has for the most part remained in the financial market and has made key securities and asset classes more expensive, whether at the peak before the financial crisis or never.
And the strategists don&#39;t just lighten the mood with financial market warning signs, they also point out that even the US economy has not yet recovered from the financial crisis and the heaviest recession in decades to the pattern it has been in before.
The eurozone economy has hardly recovered at all.
In other words, the real economy is in an unusually weak condition, but correspondingly, the pressures and risks of the financial markets are incomparably greater than before the financial crisis, when the Fed next starts to tighten its money taps more tightly.
Perhaps the picture of the future of Albert Edwards, the strategist of the French bank Societe Generale, is not as strange as it might seem.
For quite some time now, he has been coaching the bank&#39;s international investor clients for the following complete translations of the Fed:
First the Fed raises interest rates, then the financial bubbles burst - and soon it will be time for the Fed to rush to put out the financial fires with even bigger QE money injections.
Computer and printer maker Hewlett-Packard (HP) plans to cut up to 33,000 jobs.
Most of the reductions are aimed at HP&#39;s business services side, the company says.
In November, HP splits into Hewlett Packard Enterprise, which focuses on business sales, and HP Inc., which focuses on consumer PCs and printers.
HP&#39;s workforce was at its highest in 2011, when it had 350,000 employees.
In October of last year, personnel had been reduced to 302,000.
The company records one-time costs of 2.7 billion dollars (about 2.4 billion euros) from the arrangements.
25,000-30,000 employees will be cut from Hewlett Packard Enterprise.
Deductions on the consumer side will remain at 3300 within three years.
HP plans to move its operations to low-cost countries so that 60 percent of its employees are in low-cost countries by 2018.
The company says that it has already balanced its business so that none of its customers is anymore responsible for more than ten percent of its operating profit.
Just another year, its three most significant customers brought in 65 percent of the operating result.
iOS 9: how to get the new operating system on your iPhone after Apple&#39;s update release
A new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings app, clicking on “General” and then selecting “Software Update”.
If the update is ready, the phone will give you the option to download and then install it.
Some people have had problems after installing this with a &quot;Software Update Failed&quot; error message appearing on the screen.
To bypass this, it is recommended that users either wait for the worst of the congestion to pass or try to update via iTunes.
The phone guides the user through the final process.
This may involve deleting apps to free up space, but Apple has reduced the possibility of this by reducing the size of the update and also made the process easier with a new tool that suggests apps to delete and then reinstalls them when the update is complete.
You should make sure that the phone is charged or near the charger during the update, so that the battery does not run out.
If the charge level is too low, Apple will not allow the update to proceed, because if the battery runs out in the middle, it can lead to the update being broken.

General: Minister Berner has served on the board of a tax haven company
According to Yle, Minister of Transport and Communications Anne Berner (center) has served as a member of the board of the tax haven company.
According to Yle, the company&#39;s operations involve so-called tax planning.
It is the Luxembourg company Saltri II LuxCo, whose board member Berner was appointed in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg trade register, Berner is still officially a member of the board.
Berner himself says that he resigned from the membership in May of this year.
I checked the matter and it is enough that I have filed a notice of resignation.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that the registration chains take place on the agreed schedule, says Berner in an interview with Yle.
Membership after the merger
The holdings of the Swedish Kährs company are managed through the Luxembourg company.
Kährs is a parquet manufacturer that merged with the Finnish parquet manufacturer Karelia-Upofloor in 2012.
Berner served on the board of Karelia-Upofloor in 2010-2013 and after the merger on the board of Kährs and the Luxembourg company.
According to Yle, Kährs&#39; holdings in Luxembourg go through a multi-level ownership structure.
Berner tells Yle that he accepted the board membership in the Luxembourg company at the request of Kährs&#39; second largest owner.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I have been on the board of Karelia-Upofloor, owned by Hartwall Capital.
A partner was sought for the company, which was found in Sweden.
This company was owned by a private equity investor with a company in Luxembourg.
I felt that my own task was to take care of the realization of the interests of the Finnish family company&#39;s capital.
It is important that we make sure that the capital gains of our Finnish companies are taxed in Finland, and that starting point was secured in this context, says Berner.
Berner tells Yle that Hartwall Capital&#39;s holdings in the company do not involve tax planning.
According to Berner, the complex ownership structure set up in the tax haven is due to the fact that Kährs&#39; largest owner, the private equity fund Triton, already had a Luxembourg holding company ready for ownership.
A company-run reception center opens in Espoo
The first company-run reception center for adult asylum seekers will open in Otaniemi, Espoo.
The reception center is ready to receive the first hundred residents starting this evening.
The number of places can increase within a week to a maximum of 300-400 people.
The Finnish Immigration Service will establish a reception center on the property of the former Rescue College.
The operation is maintained by Luona Oy, whose business is especially the production of healthcare and medical care services.
The city of Espoo, the Finnish Migration Agency and Luona Oy jointly agreed, among other things, on the center&#39;s security arrangements.
STTK is preparing an alternative work life extortion package
STTK starts to prepare an alternative package to the government&#39;s extortions in working life.
The organization also hopes to join other wage earner central organizations.
According to chairman Antti Palola, the focus is currently on Friday&#39;s sentiment.
We will come back to alternative ways to reduce the price of work after that.
Everyone understands that life goes on after Friday, Palola pointed out to reporters during a break in the organization&#39;s management meeting.
Palola estimates that the Confederation of Business (EK), on the other hand, is not ready for discussions.
STTK&#39;s economists have calculated that the change protection contained in the government&#39;s competitiveness package will cost the employer an estimated 30 million euros, while the other half of the package is 2,700 million.
I don&#39;t know if the party has an awful lot of enthusiasm to have a conversation, if there is a ratio of one to a hundred on the receiving side.
Palola: The negotiation relationship has been constructive
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre) has hoped for alternative proposals by Wednesday, because then the government is supposed to give a statement about its own package to the parliament and start preparing the reforms.
Palola did not take a position on whether the schedule is realistic.
According to Palola, the dialogue connection with the board exists, and it has been constructive for him all along.
According to Palola, the cut of the Sunday extras is a sore spot for STTK, the white-collar organization.
The organization requires that the government backs down on the mandatory legislation that would be used to implement some of the extortions.
According to Palola, STTK does not warm to the fact that an alternative package would be prepared with SDP, which has raised the issue.
On Friday, wage earners will gather in Helsinki to oppose the government&#39;s labor extortion package presented last week.
As part of the package, e.g. the pay for the first sick days will be cut, overtime compensation will be halved, Sunday compensation will be reduced to 75% and holidays will be shortened.
STTK emphasizes that the central organizations have invited wage earners to a demonstration, and the intention was not to organize a strike.
Akavan Fjäder thanks
Akava&#39;s chairman Sture Fjäder praises STTK&#39;s announcement about preparing an alternative package.
According to Fjäder, STTK will now align with Akava, because Akava has already outlined an alternative model for the government&#39;s presentations for a long time.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also be included in the alternative package, because without SAK the package is not comprehensive enough.
Akava&#39;s chairman, Sture Fjäder, hopes that SAK, led by Lauri Lyly, will come along to prepare a presentation as an alternative to surgery.
Antti Palola STTK said earlier on Wednesday that he is preparing new proposals.
We want change security and working time banks.
Akawa announced on Wednesday that it has been preparing its own proposal for a long time, with which it is ready to negotiate the five percent jump in competitiveness sought by the country&#39;s government as an alternative to cuts.
Akava has always been ready to negotiate, and we have been writing an alternative model for the government&#39;s proposals for a long time.
We are ready to consider the terms of employment as part of the contract.
In return, we want change security and working time banks, says chairman Sture Fjäder.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also follow Akava&#39;s lines, as STTK has done earlier on Wednesday.
Without SAK, the package is not strong enough.
We are now preparing a model together that will work for the country&#39;s government and employers, says Fjäder.
Akava&#39;s work committee will meet on Thursday at 3 p.m. to make a decision on the possible content of the contract.
&quot;Same boat, common coal, talkoot&quot; - play bingo while Sipilä talks in the evening
Tampere University Green Left
A bingo coupon for the evening from Viva, the green left wing of the University of Tampere.
Prime ministers have previously given exceptional speeches during the Mäntsälä rebellion and wars.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä will speak to the nation very exceptionally about the state of the Finnish economy on the Yle channels on Wednesday evening at 21:05.
When searching for a similar previous speech by the prime minister, you have to go back to 1932, when Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was prime minister when he gave his famous radio speech, which marked the beginning of the end of the Mäntsälä rebellion.
After that, the president and the ministers made several radio speeches during the winter and continuation war.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho gave the New Year&#39;s speech instead of President Mauno Koivisto, but it was more of a ceremony.
In the fall of 1976, President Urho Kekkonen ended the train drivers&#39; strike with a televised speech.
Soliloquy, monarchist mood
Sipilä&#39;s speech has sparked all day criticism and speculation about what should come next.
Paavo Arhinmäki, the chairman of the Left Alliance, stated on Twitter that &quot;Sipilä could deliver his speech on the state of the nation in parliament as an announcement by the prime minister, in which case the speech would also be discussed.&quot;
According to Ville Niinistö of the Greens, &quot;single talk has already been seen.
Leadership includes dialogue, listening to people.
SDP&#39;s Erkki Tuomioja condemned on Facebook that &quot;monarchist mood: the prime minister tells the people what is best for them&quot;.
SDP chairman Antti Rinne challenged Sipilä to a dialogue: &quot;It&#39;s almost half a year since the elections.
Not a single appearance by the Prime Minister in the media with the opposition.
It has been tried.
What is @juhasipila afraid of?
Public service
According to the Cabinet Office, Sipilä&#39;s speech has been pre-recorded and will last approximately 15 minutes.
According to SAK, SAK chairman Lauri Lyly and EK CEO Jyri Häkämies will comment on it live.
Yle has been criticized for presenting Sipilä&#39;s speech.
We considered the matter and concluded that it is part of the mission of the public service to promote publicity covering the whole of Finland, Yle&#39;s head of publications Ismo Silvo says in Yle&#39;s news.
Like at the time of Me Tammeloi
The speech has also aroused derision.
When evening comes, dinner is enjoyed in good time, the children are combed and dressed in their best.
Mom puts on the prettiest collar and dad adjusts the tie around his neck.
At nine o&#39;clock we quieten down in front of the TV like in the olden days at the time of Me Tammeloi&quot;, writes blogger Saku Timonen.
&quot;In his speech, will Prime Minister Sipilä also tell why there are millionaires hiding their capital in tax havens in the Finnish government, who are drafting amnesty laws for their fellow tax evaders and at the same time telling the people that it is necessary to cut money when the state has run out of money?&quot; asks Pia Lohikoski.
Regarding what Sipilä says, Viva, the green left wing of the University of Tampere, has one guess.
It has published the following bingo on Facebook.
In the evening, will we hear about the same boat, common coal, living in debt and team spirit?
Coupons and pens ready, it starts at 21:05 and the channels are TV1, Radio Suomi and Yle Areena.
Ahtisaari in the Guardian: Western countries rejected Russia&#39;s proposal to oust al-Assad
More than three years ago, Western countries rejected Russia&#39;s offer to get Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to give up power, President Martti Ahtisaari tells the Guardian.
According to Ahtisaari, Russia&#39;s UN ambassador proposed a plan by which al-Assad would have stepped down from power in style after some time.
However, the Western countries did not take up the proposal, because they believed that al-Assad would fall anyway in a few weeks.
Ahtisaari discussed the Syrian crisis in 2012 with the five permanent member states of the UN Security Council.
According to Ahtisaari, Russia&#39;s ambassador Vitali Tshurkin listed a three-point plan to him in a one-on-one conversation: the opposition could not be armed, there had to be immediate communication between the opposition and al-Assad, and al-Assad&#39;s relinquishment of power had to be carried out in a restrained manner.
I know Tshurkin.
We don&#39;t necessarily agree on everything, but we are able to discuss openly.
I told him what I did there and he said sit down, Martti, and I&#39;ll tell you what we have to do, Ahtisaari recalls in an interview with the Guardian.
Diplomats would not comment
Ahtisaari says that he forwarded Tshurkin&#39;s message to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
Tshurkin did not confirm the content of the conversation to the newspaper, but according to Ahtisaari, there is no doubt about it.
UN diplomats also refused to comment on Ahtisaari&#39;s claims, but said al-Assad&#39;s forces had already committed several massacres at that time and key opposition groups refused any deals that would have kept him in power.
Sir John Jenkins, the former head of the Middle East Department of the British Foreign Ministry, is skeptical about Ahtisaari&#39;s speeches, because according to his experience, Russia was never ready to discuss the fate of al-Assad.
Officially, Russia has supported al-Assad throughout the war.
The weakest point in Ahtisaari&#39;s argument is that Tshurkin spoke with Moscow&#39;s authorization.
If he had told me about Tshurkin&#39;s speech, I would have replied that I want to hear the same from President Vladimir Putin so that I can take it seriously.
According to Jenkins, even in that case, he would have suspected that it would have been a ploy by Putin to keep power with one of al-Assad&#39;s supporters.
Refugee flow of our own making
During the negotiations held by Ahtisaari, around 7,500 people had died in the Syrian crisis.
According to the UN&#39;s estimate, the number of deaths exceeded 220,000 at the beginning of the current year.
More than 11 million people have been forced to flee their homes because of the war.
We should have prevented this disaster.
The flow of refugees to Europe is our own doing.
I see no other option than to take good care of these poor people.
We are now paying the bill that we ourselves caused, Ahtisaari tells the newspaper.
The Asylum Seekers Organization Center is heading to Tornio
The organization center for asylum seekers planned by the government for Northern Finland will probably be established in Tornio.
The center would be established in the vacant Tornio joint high school building in the city center.
The Ministry of the Interior has been looking for a suitable location in order to better control the flow of refugees from the Swedish border.
Helsingin Sanomat reported on Tuesday that the council had already decided to present the school building as a space solution to the ministry.
According to Tornio city council vice-chairman Sauli Hyöppinen (left), that is not true.
When the whole council was not meeting and part of the group wanted an official decision, we decided to call a council meeting for next Monday to decide on the matter, he explains to STT.
There were 36 councilors out of 43 present at the discussion.
Thirteen councilors opposed the organizing center.
Based on that, one would expect the decision to be positive, Hyöppinen says.
According to City Manager Timo Nousiainen, the city was contacted about the matter on Monday, and the matter was reacted to quickly.
The joint high school could accommodate an estimated 500 asylum seekers at a time.
An expert has checked that it could be suitable for such use.
The location is a couple of hundred meters from the border, so it would be functional in that sense as well, says Nousiainen.
Sipilä is still hoping for an alternative to extortion from the labor market
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center), the publicized halving of vacation pay would only take care of part of the government&#39;s goal of lowering the price of work.
However, according to him, the government will be happy to accept an alternative package if the labor market organizations manage to agree on one.
Sipilä told reporters in parliament that he has not been in contact with labor market organizations.
He also didn&#39;t know how seriously the organizations were looking for substitutes for the government&#39;s announcement of labor restrictions.
If such an agreement does arise, we will of course gladly accept it as part of the overall package.
In Sipilä&#39;s opinion, halving vacation pay would be a viable solution, because it would target almost all wage earners, unlike, for example, the government&#39;s plan to cut Sunday allowances.
The labor market organizations could mutually agree on a cut in vacation pay, because it is written into collective agreements instead of the law.
The government will probably tell the parliament about the tightening of working life on Wednesday next week in the form of a statement from the Government.
According to Sipilä, the organizations&#39; proposals should be known before this.
This is not the final limit either.
The legislative work then starts, that is, the train is in motion and it gets harder all the time.
Now is a good time.
Things like this don&#39;t take long if you have the will, Sipilä formulated.
The list published by the government last week includes, among other things, turning Epiphany and Maundy Thursday into unpaid holidays without reducing the annual working time.
In addition, the pay for the first sick days will be cut, overtime compensation will be halved, Sunday compensation will be reduced to 75 percent and holidays will be shortened.
The reforms are implemented as mandatory legislation, bypassing the trade unions, which has aroused strong criticism.
The wage earners&#39; central organizations are organizing a large demonstration on Friday because of the actions, and several trade unions have also declared political strikes.
Tohmajärvi council approved the expansion of the juice hall&#39;s warehouse
The Tohmajärvi council unanimously approved, but with some grumbles, the expansion of Nordic Koivu Oy&#39;s warehouse, i.e. the juice hall.
Criticism was caused by the fact that the project is bigger and more expensive than originally discussed.
The busy schedule also bothered me.
We were also a little surprised that the need for space was not known a year ago, when the previous expansion was decided.
At this stage, the expansion of the warehouse by 400-450 square meters was approved for the investment program, but the money will be decided later in connection with the interim report.
The agenda still talked about an investment of 150,000-200,000 euros, but at the meeting technical director Erkki Ikonen said that the price will be approximately 300,000 euros.
The investment was supported on the basis that it brings work and tax revenue to the locality.
The municipality has no risk, because the company pays the investment as rent, argued Vesa Väistö (ps.).
The Karelian language also has a place in Joensuu
The city government softened its previous strong stance on bringing Karelian street name signs to the center of Joensuu.
The new decision is important and correct in terms of nurturing the Karelian tradition throughout the province.
Joensuu does not declare itself the capital of the Karelian language because there is no historical basis for it and the Karelian language is not an inherent part of the region&#39;s identity.
The language spoken in the Joensuu region has belonged more to the eastern Savoland dialects.
Even after the new decision, there will be no Karelian street name signs in the city center.
However, on a case-by-case basis, the city of Joensuu is ready to use the Karelian language, for example in information boards and tourism marketing.
The city recommends the same attitude to all other operators.
Although Joensuu is officially a monolingual municipality, the use of the Karelian language should also be approached with an open mind now that multiculturalism is alive and changing strongly in North Karelia as well.
The Karelian language is still a special feature of the province, as is the image of Joensuu as the forest capital of all of Finland.
Both of them can be used to advantage in a wide variety of marketing in the province.
The closure of train connections cuts the vitality of the province
The cuts to train connections hit the province&#39;s vitality hard.
Transport connections directly affect the business life and competitiveness of the province.
And that affects whether it is possible to live and work here at all, Joensuu&#39;s mayor Kari Karjalainen wonders.
He also highlights air traffic, the continuation of which has also been discussed several times.
It is important from the point of view of the entire province that our chances of success are not reduced by measures taken by the government, as is happening now.
We should look at the effects of the closure of these transport links on, for example, employment, Karjalainen emphasizes.
The deterioration of transportation connections causes an additional challenge for the University of Eastern Finland in terms of attractiveness.
Of course, the better the services here, such as transport connections and the housing situation, the easier it is to get students and employees, says Jukka Mönkkönen, Rector of the University of Eastern Finland.
He points out that the poor transport connections also affect the research staff, who are very mobile and travel a lot for research.
Recruitment manager Marko Junkkarinen says that even at the moment marketing the university towards Western Finland is difficult, because the transportation connections are weak in the transverse direction.
Currently, about half of the students at the University of Eastern Finland come from outside Eastern Finland.
About 10-20 percent of them are from Uusimaa, which is partly explained by the direct train connection.
Joensuu became one gravel sound for Siu sote
The view of the Joensuu City Council on the provincial Siun sote project is seemingly unanimous, but there is one gravel voice among them.
City council member Pentti Keskisalo (left, pictured) proposed abandoning the entire project at the board&#39;s meeting on Monday, but his proposal fell through as unprofitable.
The board approved the final proposal of the mayor Kari Karjalainen, which will be revised at the beginning of October before the meeting of the city council, which will issue a final statement on the project at the same time as all other municipalities.
One train service from Kotka to Kouvola will end next year
Passenger train service from Kotka to Kouvola will also be maintained in the future, although one train shift less frequently.
There will be changes to passenger train traffic between Kotka and Kouvola next March.
One train shift will be missed, but you can still get from Kotka to Kouvola five times a day and vice versa.
The reductions are due to government austerity measures.
The Ministry of Transport and Communications&#39; purchase money for train traffic for the next four-year period will decrease by 12.3 million euros.
The quietest routes will be stopped completely.
VR will prepare new schedules by the end of the year.
They enter into force on March 27, 2016.
The boys climbed onto the roof, one couldn&#39;t get down, the guys ran away
The rescue service released a 12-year-old who had climbed to the roof from the ladder, but who could not get down from the roof on his own.
The situation arose in Tornionmäki on Ketotie at half past six on Tuesday evening.
There is an old two-story wooden house with no ladder leading to the roof at all.
That didn&#39;t stop a group of boys, who decided to climb onto the roof of the house using the radio amateur mast next to it.
The rest of the boys made it down the same route, but one didn&#39;t.
As a result, others fled the scene and passers-by alerted the rescue service to help the last person on the roof safely back to the ground with a pull ladder.
FedEx&#39;s operating profit doubles, lowers outlook for fiscal year 2016
FedEx reported disappointing results for its most recent quarter, and the shipping giant cut its full-year profit forecast, citing weaker demand for cargo services and higher costs for its ground services.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
This time last year, FedEx announced it was hiring 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
Its stock fell about 2.5 percent in opening trading 45 minutes before the opening bell on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. says it expects earnings for the fiscal year ending next May to be between $10.40 and $10.90, down 20 cents from its previous forecast.
Analysts had expected $10.84, according to a survey by FactSet.
The lower outlook came despite price increases of 4.9 percent on average, which take effect Jan. 4, and despite higher surcharges for ground shipments of heavy or large packages that began in November.
The company said it expects operating profit to still grow from the previous year because they have cut expenses, revenue has increased and online shopping is growing.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company &quot;is performing solidly given the weaker-than-expected economic conditions, particularly in manufacturing and global trade.&quot;
The holiday hiring plans were announced a day after rival UPS said it plans to hire 90,000 to 95,000 extra workers, about the same number it hired last year.
For the quarter ended Aug. 31, FedEx&#39;s earnings were $692 million, up 6 percent from last year.
Earnings per share came in at $2.42, which is below the average forecast of $2.44. A survey of 12 analysts was conducted by Zacks Investment Research.
Turnover increased by 5 percent to 12.3 billion dollars.
Six analysts polled by Zacks were expecting $12.23 billion.
FedEx has suffered in recent years from a decline in international priority shipping, which has halted the development of revenue in its Express unit.
However, the rise of online shopping has improved FedEx Ground&#39;s results.
In the most recent quarter, the country unit&#39;s turnover rose by 29 percent, but the operations&#39; income was basically the same due to the expensive costs of the larger packages and own insurance.
Earnings in the Express unit were better due to higher basic charges, while operating profit in freight operations was reduced by higher labor costs.
In opening trading about an hour before the bell, FedEx shares fell $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
FedEx closed Tuesday down 11 percent for the year and 17 percent below the June 11 record.
For two days this week, the policymakers of the US Federal Reserve will sit around a huge mahogany table in a long-awaited meeting to decide whether the time has come to raise the key interest rate for the first time in almost a decade.
At one end of the central bank&#39;s ornate, two-story boardroom is a mural of the United States.
The map is a reminder that Fed Chair Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues must put the nation&#39;s economic interests above all else.
Congress has placed the Federal Reserve on the shoulders of a dual responsibility: they must maximize US employment and keep prices stable.
However, since the Great Depression, central bankers have accepted that there is also a third, unwritten mandate: financial stability.
It is this third requirement that may be the decisive factor in the decision to be announced on Thursday, which is so strict that it cannot even be predicted. The decision on whether the US economy is ready to be weaned off the record-breaking stimulus that the short-term interest rate, which remained at almost zero until the end of 2008, has brought.
While most data points to steady economic growth, the recent turmoil in global financial markets may have made already wary central bank officials more nervous about further volatility. We are afraid of what the effect would be if the federal funds rate reference value were raised even by a quarter of a percentage point.
&quot;Understandably, the labor market and inflation are the first and most important things that are monitored,&quot; states Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at Brokerage Stifel Nicolaus &amp; Co.
&quot;However, I believe that if they are looking for a justification for leaving the interest rate unchanged, the increased uncertainty in the world market is a valid enough reason to wait a little longer,&quot; he says.
No consensus has been reached on the central bank&#39;s decision, which is already creating nervousness in the economy.
According to a recent survey by Bloomberg, about half of economic experts predict that interest rates will rise this week.
The financial market, on the other hand, expects the central bank to delay the withdrawal, because according to the key indicator, the chance of growth is only about 30 percent.
This suggests a fall in the securities market if the central bank raises the rate, unless the decision-makers succeed in softening the blow by promising that the next increase will not take place in the near future.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average index rose 228.89 points, or 1.4 percent, with the new figure being 16,599.85.
The recovery was brought about by the expectation that the central bank will keep the level unchanged this week, says John Lonski, chief economic expert at Moody&#39;s Capital Markets Research Group.
&quot;It&#39;s surprising if the central bank raises interest rates right now,&quot; he says.
If policymakers raise interest rates, &quot;they have to put a lot of effort into their policy to support the financial markets so that they don&#39;t panic.&quot;
Other experts argue that the increased level would calm financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about when the central bank would act.
Just a month ago, it looked like the central bank was on its way to raising interest rates by a quarter percentage point this month, taking the first small step toward the slow tightening of monetary conditions that would ensure the stability of the US recovery.
Yellen has stated in the spring and early summer that she expects the level to rise this year, despite the Liberals calling for more economic development in their complaints.
Although the creation of new jobs slowed down in August, labor market growth has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1 percent last month, the lowest figure in seven years and close to the level that the central bank considers the limit of full employment.
Wage growth has shown signs of picking up.
Although inflation is still below the central bank&#39;s 2 percent annual target, according to the central bank&#39;s decision makers, the main reason for this is the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy &quot;can survive even higher interest rates and also needs them considering the tight situation in the labor market&quot;, says Ian Shepherdson, chief economic expert at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, financial markets around the world were shaken last week when China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average index fell by up to 16 percent from its May record, as investors feared that China&#39;s slowing economy would also slow down global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, and the Dow is now almost 10 percent below its peak in May.
For the central bank&#39;s decision-makers, the market turmoil is an additional factor in the complex equation that tells when the interest rate should be raised.
&quot;Without these financial market events and recent weeks of news about the weakness of the Chinese economy, policymakers would be tightening at this meeting,&quot; said Stephen D. Oliner, a senior fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former central bank official.
Now, he predicts that policymakers will wait at least a month to get a better idea of the impact.
&quot;The possible effects on the US economy are still quite unclear, and they don&#39;t have much information at their disposal regarding the consequences of the events in China,&quot; states Oliner.
The well-being of the international economy is not the main concern of the central bank, so in principle it should not affect decision-making.
In practice, however, the Federal Reserve Bank has become the world&#39;s monetary authority.
In recent years, the influence of the central bank has been immense.
In 2013, then-Chairman Ben S. Bernanke&#39;s suggestion that the central bank might &quot;tape&quot; the money supply caused upheaval in markets around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, central bank officials are expected not only to follow developments elsewhere, but also to consult other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
The central bank&#39;s decision-making process is &quot;more art than science,&quot; says Zachary Karabell, head of global strategy at asset management firm Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank in Richmond, Virginia, noted this month that &quot;the central bank has historically overreacted to financial market movements that have appeared to be disconnected from economic fundamentals.&quot;
The decision-making Federal Open Market Committee has called for a rate hike, and Lacker, a voting member of the committee, cites the 1998-99 decision as an example.
The Asian financial crisis caused the central bank to cut its benchmark by 0.75 percentage points over three meetings &quot;despite its limited, discernible impact on US economic growth,&quot; Lacker says.
A year later, the central bank reversed these cuts.
The central bank should prioritize financial stability only during a major crisis, such as when the market crashed in 2008, says Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England&#39;s interest rate-setting committee.
The latest turmoil doesn&#39;t even come close to that level, Posen states.
&quot;No one wants to be in a situation where interest rate hikes are feared because the market will get upset,&quot; says Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains a dual requirement and does not mention financial stability. As long as this is the case, I don&#39;t think they should anticipate it.

The Brazilian Pediatric Association in Rio Grande promotes a healthy diet for breastfeeding mothers
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS has come up with a shocking way to try to make women understand the importance of good nutrition during breastfeeding by publishing pictures of babies sucking on their breasts with pictures of unhealthy food painted on them.
Breast milk consists of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, which give babies all the necessary nutrients for the development of a strong immune system.
Pregnant women and new mothers need extra energy, so they are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories.
However, new research suggests that increasing calorie intake isn&#39;t the only dietary change mothers should make.
A recent study led by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, revealed that a healthy diet in pregnant women actually affects the genetic expression of their babies and protects the babies from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet was found to negatively affect a child&#39;s immune system.
Seven&#39;s Sunrise program is a ratings favourite, despite Nine&#39;s attempts to cover the leadership reveal on the Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson&#39;s rush to Canberra to cover the aftermath of the Liberal Party leader reveal failed to boost Today&#39;s viewership.
The Nine morning show was broadcast from the nation&#39;s capital after Tony Abbott was ousted by Malcolm Turnbull.
Rival show Sunrise, hosted by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was stuck in London as part of a week-long series of international broadcasts that also includes Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
The weight of the gap didn&#39;t seem to bother Australian TV viewers, with Sunrise averaging 397,000 across the five state capitals, compared to Today&#39;s 339,000.
Today&#39;s average was up slightly from Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday&#39;s (283,000), but was still down from last Thursday (343,000).
Today has caught up with Sunrise over the past few months.
In August, Today&#39;s average was 318,000 and Sunrise&#39;s 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference varied between 40,000 and 50,000 viewers.
So far in September, Sunrise is averaging 349,000 viewers, compared to 314,000 for Today.
This is the most interesting event of the whole morning.
The winds of change are blowing this morning in places other than the Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for asking!

The big news for Seven was the stunning premiere of 800 Words, featuring former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
The new drama series, which averaged a rather impressive 1.219 million viewers, is about a recently widowed father who decides to move to the coast of New Zealand with his two children.
Critics have wondered whether Thomson will be the driving force behind the popular series on her own without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
Last night&#39;s results gave this a real certainty.
Seven&#39;s The X Factor was a strong favorite with 1.136 million viewers, easily beating The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
There was a double fate on Channel Seven on the second night of The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (5-5:30 p.m.) of the new trivia program hosted by Andrew O&#39;Keefe gathered an average of 446,000 viewers.
The second half-hour (17:30-18) increased to 623,000 viewers - which was enough to narrowly beat Eddie McGuire&#39;s Hot Seat program (613,000).
On Monday night, The Chase Australia averaged 520,000 viewers for the first half-hour, with a whopping 720,000 for the second half-hour.
Hot Seat averaged 620,000.
The drop in the average viewership for The Chase Australia&#39;s second night gives Nine confidence that Hot Seat will eventually become the most popular program at 5.30pm.
The Chase Australia replaced Million Dollar Minute, which failed to reduce the viewership of McGuire&#39;s show.

The final three dads agree that Sam Wood is the perfect guy - but who will she choose?
The secret has been revealed? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have accidentally revealed who will win The Bachelor.
The identity of the woman Sam Wood ends up hooking up with on The Bachelor has been kept extremely secret.
The three remaining girls don&#39;t really slip who got the last rose.
However, speaking to Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before three became two, they may have inadvertently given a hint as to the identity of the winner.
Sam Wood&#39;s lips are sealed ahead of Thursday&#39;s final
All three women waxed poetic about how Wood is the perfect man, citing his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positivity as reasons why they would want to be his partner.
However, when they were asked &quot;If Wood&#39;s last rose isn&#39;t for you, who should it go to?&quot;, their answers may have offered a revelation as to who won the bachelor&#39;s heart.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski were quick to name Mackay as the best option for Wood after themselves.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood&#39;s relationship has been smooth sailing since day one.
&quot;From the moment I walked into the house, (Sarah&#39;s) energies and Sam&#39;s energies felt quite compatible, and that thought was in the back of my mind throughout the series,&quot; Jeavons-Fellows said.
&quot;Sarah is really down-to-earth, it&#39;s fun to be around her,&quot; Markoski added.
I have seen them together and there is chemistry between them.
They seem to be comfortable and relaxed together.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood would make a great match.
Mackay said last week&#39;s home visit meetings made him realize Wood could be &quot;the one&quot;.
&quot;When I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this is clearly not just a game - I&#39;m in this with all my heart now,&quot; he said.
Asked who Wood should pick if not him, Mackay was enigmatic.
&quot;I don&#39;t know if I can say,&quot; he said.
I like the remaining girls just as much, so it&#39;s a tie between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor airs on Wednesday at 7.30pm on Ten.

Jarryd Hayne has many options on where to start his NFL career
Detroit and Seattle were both quite interested in his move to the US, and several other teams have inquired about him since his impressive open day at practice late last year.
However, Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula, and it appears to have been a wise decision.
Some coaches would have benched Hayne for the rest of the game after the Australian rugby league convert dropped the ball on his first punt return in the team&#39;s 20-3 win over Minnesota on Tuesday.
But Tomsula trusted his man and allowed Hayne to return the ensuing kickoff and included him in the running game after Reggie Bush was injured.
Tomsula&#39;s true character was also visible in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of berating his newcomers in front of the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne in the post-game press conference.
49ers special reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by special teams coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget about the dropped ball and worry about the next play.
Jarryd Hayne dropped a fly kick that was picked up by the Minnesota Vikings in the first quarter
It certainly wasn&#39;t the start Hayne and his many Australian fans were hoping for in the man&#39;s NFL debut.
Hayne was seen cursing on his way off the field after the tackle and later told Australian radio duo Hamish &amp; Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he couldn&#39;t have imagined a worse start to his NFL career.
&quot;It was just one of those things, you just have to think about the next game and that&#39;s it,&quot; Hayne said.
Hayne compared his fumble to his 2007 Origin debut, when a pass in his own end zone led to a Queensland goal.
All in all, it was still a great experience for this 27-year-old.
After the game, Hayne posed with fans in a photo he posted on his Instagram account, holding an Australian flag.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Russia&#39;s richest man, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested at gunpoint on a Siberian runway.
Khodorkovsky had openly questioned President Vladimir Putin, so he was convicted, his oil company Yukos seized, and his efforts to support democracy curtailed.
4 killed when police fire rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets into a crowd demonstrating against the country&#39;s proposed new constitution, an official said Wednesday.
The violence happened on Tuesday night in the Rupandeh district, about 175 miles west of the capital, Kathmandu.
Senior district official Bishnu Prasad Dhakal said more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside the police station, with some throwing stones and firebombs.
Dhakal said police fired tear gas and then fired into the air before resorting to rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, known to kill but traditionally used as a less dangerous alternative, appeared to have caused so many deaths.
The clash was the latest in weeks of violent protests across Nepal&#39;s southern plains, where members of an ethnic group called the Madhesi say new provinces created under the proposed new constitution will erode their political influence.
There have also been protests in western Nepal when the Tharus group demands their own state.
Since August 10, at least 40 people have died in violent clashes, 11 of whom have been police officers.
At the time, the four main parties signed an agreement dividing the country into provinces - a big step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has had a central government for centuries.
A new constitution has been planned since 2008, but lawmakers accelerated the process after a devastating earthquake in April killed thousands of people.
Lawmakers have been voting on clauses in a draft constitution in Kathmandu this week, and officials have said the new charter could be approved by Sunday.
The US National Hurricane Center NHC says there is a 60 percent chance of a hurricane south of Cape Verde
A broad low-pressure front located about 560 km south of the southernmost point of the Cape Verde archipelago has a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, the US National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday.
Another well-bounded low-pressure front, located midway between the Cape Verde Islands and the Lesser Antilles, also has a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical cyclone over the next two days, the Miami-based weather forecast center added.
Google starts a donation campaign with the goal of raising 11 million dollars for refugees
Google Inc ( GOOGL.O ) launched a donation campaign that aims to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations helping thousands of refugees who have come to Europe as they flee war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google had an exceptionally personal angle when it posted the donation campaign on its blog.
Instead of the manager making the announcement, Google employee Rita Masoud, who fled Kabul with her family at the age of seven, wrote about her own personal experience.
&quot;Our journey included numerous dark train and bus journeys, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and darkness,&quot; he wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and immigration crisis in Europe has grown, people like my family are desperate to help.
Donations will go to four non-profit organizations that help refugees and immigrants: Doctors Without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said it will match every donation made worldwide at google.com/refugerelief up to $5.5 million, bringing the total goal to $11 million.
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since World War II, largely due to Syria&#39;s four-year civil war, which has driven more than 4 million people from their homes this year.
Many are also fleeing the ravages of war in Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Weight loss surgery can help mildly obese diabetics
The benefits of weight loss surgery for mildly obese type 2 diabetics can last for at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is still too early to say whether these mildly obese diabetics will live longer after bariatric surgery than those treated with methods other than surgery.
&quot;It takes a long time to get mortality data,&quot; says Dr. Robin Blackstone. He is a weight loss surgery specialist who wrote the editorial for a new study in the journal JAMA Surgery.
In weight loss or bariatric surgeries, different methods are used to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce the feeling of hunger and limit the absorption of food.
Over the years, bariatric surgeries have been found to be effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but most of the subjects in the study were morbidly obese, with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or more.
BMI, i.e. the ratio of weight to height, is considered normal when it is between 18.5 and 24.9.
If a BMI is over 25, it indicates that someone is overweight, and if a person&#39;s BMI is over 30, they are considered obese.
You can calculate your own BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For this new study, researchers at Taiwan&#39;s Min-Sheng General Hospital used data collected since 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery, gastric bypass surgery and gastric reduction, with drug treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were mildly obese.
The study showed that the average BMI of those who underwent surgery dropped from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year.
At the same time, the BMI of those who were treated by means other than surgery remained roughly the same at 29.
Of the people who underwent surgery, 36 percent of the diabetes was cured completely and 28 percent partially.
In comparison, in the drug-treated group, diabetes was completely cured by only 1 percent and partially by about 2 percent.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides, and &quot;bad&quot; LDL cholesterol &quot;were generally better in the surgery group,&quot; the authors noted.
The researchers also monitored the patients&#39; blood hemoglobin A1c levels, which reflect long-term blood sugar levels.
The hemoglobin A1c value should remain below 7 percent, the researchers write.
Postoperative hemoglobin A1c dropped from about 9 percent to about 6 percent.
In the medical treatment group, however, it remained stable at around 8 percent.
However, this better &quot;glycemic control,&quot; as reflected by improved hemoglobin A1c levels, did not reduce mortality over five years, say lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results between two different types of surgery.
At the fifth year, when compared to the gastric bypass group, the gastric bypass group had lost more weight (18.7 and 14.2 kg), reduced their body mass index more (7.4 and 5.1), reduced their hemoglobin A1c levels more (3.1 percent and 2.1 percent), and were more likely to achieve complete diabetes remission (46.9 percent and 16.7 percent).
Blackstone of the University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix says that while the study doesn&#39;t show survival or surgery after five years, there is research from Sweden where surgery led to longer lives in heavier people.
A Swedish study found that obese people who underwent weight-loss surgery were 29 percent less likely to die over a 15-year period when compared to a group that had tried more traditional treatments.
Although the new study doesn&#39;t show an improvement in survival for surgery patients, Blackstone says the results are encouraging for people with a BMI under 35 who are interested in surgery.
&quot;The research results are decisive precisely in that they show that the surgery is safe for a group with a lower body mass index,&quot; and does not involve an increased risk of death or kidney disease, he says.
Blackstone adds that both patients and their doctors should take weight very seriously when a patient&#39;s BMI is between 27 and 30.
&quot;I think we&#39;re waiting too long to take this seriously,&quot; he says.
I believe that once a person has accumulated these genetic changes that permanently prepare their body for obesity and diabetes, it is very difficult to reverse the situation.
&quot;Not everyone can come to Europe&quot; - Dalai Lama - RT News
The Dalai Lama has said that Europe cannot accept all the refugees, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis can be found in the Middle East.
The leader of Tibetan Buddhism has called for an end to violence in the refugees&#39; homelands.
The Dalai Lama addressed the ongoing refugee crisis in a speech he gave at the opening of the Dalai Lama Center for Compassion in Oxford at the start of his ten-day visit to Britain. The center is dedicated to the study of ethics.
The Dalai Lama argued that in the current situation, the needs of all humanity should be put before individual nations or even continents.
He also emphasized that although the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admirable, it is also insufficient.
&quot;Not everyone can come to Europe,&quot; he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised the actions of Germany and Austria in the crisis, he emphasized that it is only a temporary solution.
&quot;It is wonderful to take care of several thousand refugees, but in the meantime we have to think about long-term solutions: how to bring real peace and real development to these Muslim countries, mainly through education.
The bottom line is to think about how we can reduce killing in their countries.
We must reduce the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems,” he added.
Addressing the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush&#39;s actions after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, claiming that the violent response of the United States caused the chain of violent events.
&quot;After the 9/11 attack, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him that the solution to this problem can be found through non-violence.
I know his motives were good, but he used force and it created unexpected consequences,” the Dalai Lama said.
In the past four years, hand sanitizer ingestion by children has quadrupled
Poison control centers across the United States have reported a nearly 400 percent increase in highly alcoholic hand sanitizer ingestions among children under 12 since 2010, according to the Georgia Poison Control Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Control Center, disinfectant ingestions reported to poison control centers by children under the age of 12 rose from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
&quot;Kids are becoming more interested in these products and unfortunately a certain percentage of them end up in the emergency room,&quot; Lopez told CNN.
He said some kids drink the sanitizer on purpose, while some want to impress their friends or take a challenge on social media.
There are videos on YouTube of teenagers drinking disinfectant to get a cheap high.
According to reports, teenagers have been mixing disinfectant with alcoholic mouthwash to make a stronger drink.
The pleasant smells of the disinfectant may attract younger children.
&quot;The child doesn&#39;t think this is bad for him,&quot; Lopez said.
Many of the more interesting (handmade) ones are the ones with added fragrance.
There are strawberry, grape and orange scented disinfectants that are very attractive to children.
Hand sanitizer can contain anything between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in small children, only a few injections are needed for alcohol poisoning.
&quot;It&#39;s really concentrated alcohol,&quot; Mr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the Poison Information Center at the University of Kansas Hospital, told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
So you wouldn&#39;t leave a shot of whiskey sitting on the table, but leave the hand sanitizer in plain sight, and if the kids are interested, it&#39;s a quick way to drink a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell is a six-year-old girl who not long ago swallowed just four squirts of strawberry-scented hand sanitizer at school and was taken to the emergency room for treatment.
Her blood-alcohol level was .179, twice the adult drunken driving limit, said emergency room physician Chris Ritchey, who treated the girl at Gwinnet Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah was slurring her words and unable to walk when she arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight at a separate children&#39;s hospital for signs of a brain injury, as the alcohol caused the girl to fall and hit her head, Ritchey said.
&quot;It was really scary,&quot; Nhaijah&#39;s mother, Ortoria Scott, told CNN.
The situation could have been fatal for my child.
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers use alcohol-free products or disinfectant wipes and move the disinfectant out of children&#39;s reach.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants have been linked to deaths.
In 2013, two Ontario women died after ingesting hand sanitizer that contained a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Health officials believe the product contained methanol, a deadly substance, and not ethyl alcohol, which was reported as the active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-graders in upstate New York planned to poison their &quot;mean&quot; teacher by spreading a bacterial poison in the classroom, according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to hand sanitizer and banned it from her class.
The police consider the thwarted plan to be &quot;just a bunch of bullshit&quot; and leave disciplinary actions to the school district.
Rumor mill: Celtic have no contradictions
Griffiths plays down talk of Celtic infighting and Deila admits Hoops are in a tight spot but he can turn it around
Hearts are battling the Scottish Football Association over Neilson&#39;s allegations and Warburton is wary of January signings that could disrupt squad unity
The Dons extended their lead over Celtic to five points
Adam Rooney&#39;s first-half penalty lifted Aberdeen to a narrow victory over Hamilton at Pittodrie Stadium and allowed the team to extend the gap to Celtic to five points.
Griffiths downplays talk of contradictions
There have been rumors of internal conflicts at Celtic, but Griffiths brushed them off right away. He insists he and his teammates have no sense of working under closer scrutiny as the team prepares to face the Dutch league leaders.
I don&#39;t think we&#39;re under pressure, I think the players are looking forward to the match.
Scots&#39; lack of title race bores Dutch - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and ex-Holland international Ronald de Boer has said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because of their lack of title competition with Rangers.
Ajax&#39;s current ambassador de Boer said: &quot;In Holland they no longer show highlights of Celtic games and why?&quot;
Because the Rangers aren&#39;t involved.
People here just can&#39;t stop talking about Rangers coming back.
They talk about Old Firm teams.
They talk about both teams together, and that&#39;s what they&#39;re interested in.
There is a lot of excitement in the games of these teams, and non-Scottish people like to watch those games as well.
Deila vows to turn the situation around
Ronny Deila has admitted that Celtic are in trouble, but the Norwegian boss has vowed to turn things around.
The loss to Malmö and the consequent elimination from the Champions League was quickly followed by a loss to Aberdeen, who played with ten men, and are now at the top of the league with a five-point gap to the next team.
However, Deila said: &quot;Celtic have had bad spells in the past and we will rise again.&quot;
Now we just want to get out of this situation as quickly as possible.
I know this is frustrating and that many people are very, very angry or sad about what is happening.
So are we, but we must continue.
We really need supporters because it improves the performance of the players.
Now it&#39;s important to stay together.
Warburton is wary of January transfers
Although Rangers boss Mark Warburton just a few weeks ago commented on possible January transfer targets, he is wary of the recruitment frenzy, assuring that he does not want to confuse the team&#39;s consensus.
The former Brentford boss said: &quot;The January transfer window is very different to the summer window.&quot;
For players coming in the summer, the adjustment period is the entire pre-season period, which can be seen in our team this season.
The team is doing really well.
Sometimes adding unnecessary players can do more harm.
Celtic interest Michu hints at retirement
Swansea striker Michu, who has been linked with Celtic in the transfer window, has hinted that he could retire after his contract with the Swans expires.
The 29-year-old player has had ankle problems for two years, and he failed to find a new club outside of Wales during the summer.
Hearts are ready to fight the Scottish FA over Neilson&#39;s comments
Hearts were leading 2-1 when Paterson was sent off and the team went on to lose 3-2. The defender&#39;s red card was later overturned, and this was the third red card issued by Collum to be overturned in the past eight months.
Neilson stands by what he said, claiming: &quot;I didn&#39;t question the integrity, I didn&#39;t comment on the performance.&quot;
Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle
A loyal Hibernian player was reprimanded after admitting singing an offensive song about ex-Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place in a pub in Edinburgh&#39;s Roseburn, before the Edinburgh derby at Tynecastle Stadium in March 2014.
&quot;It was about Derby and it was a spur of the moment,&quot; the striker said, adding: &quot;It&#39;s safe to say I&#39;m not going back to Tynecastle unless I&#39;m going to play for Celtic.&quot;
Tannadice board have faith in Dundee United manager - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly insists the Dundee United board still have faith in the management team&#39;s ability to turn things around, but admits the player attrition must stop.
“I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We&#39;ll get the boys back in shape,&quot; says Donnelly.
McInnes happy with &#39;ugly win&#39; in Hamilton
Derek McInnes admits his side Aberdeen were desperately hanging on against Hamilton Accies, but thanks to Adam Rooney&#39;s first-half penalty, they secured their seventh straight league win to take them five points clear of Celtic at the top of the table.
McInnes says: &quot;There&#39;s not a single team that&#39;s won anything, whether it&#39;s the trophy or the league, that hasn&#39;t also won games like this.&quot;
Scottish unemployment remains the same as the UK total rises
UNEMPLOYMENT in Scotland remained at 164,000 between May and July, while unemployment across the UK rose by 10,000 to a total of 1.82 million.
Scotland&#39;s unemployment rate of 5.9 percent is higher than Great Britain&#39;s 5.5 percent, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
Meanwhile, unemployment in Scotland fell by 12,000 people in the three-month period, with the number of people in work now at 2,612,000.
Scotland&#39;s employment rate fell to 74% during the quarter, which is higher than the UK average of 73.5%.
Scottish Secretary of State David Mundell commented on these latest figures: &quot;The government&#39;s long-term plan is to build the foundations for a stronger economy.&quot;
Almost exactly a year has passed since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
During these 12 months, the Scottish labor market has improved, employment has risen and unemployment has fallen.
Why am I witnessing an execution in Oklahoma?
If there is no legal intervention, later today I will watch the man be executed.
If it does, and I hope not, I&#39;ll be sitting in the bleachers at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary watching Richard Glossip be executed by lethal injection.
He has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
I received a request in January through his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
I&#39;m starting to dread this day as it approaches.
So why did I agree?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story of the death penalty.
It would provide a unique perspective.
Of course, journalists have the opportunity to follow executions in America, and since there are often more applications than available places, participants are chosen through a creepy lottery.
Oklahoma has reduced the seats reserved for the media from twelve to five.
Whoever complains, looks at the event coolly.
I can&#39;t do that.
I&#39;ll be sitting next to Richard Glossip&#39;s closest friends, and I&#39;ve also established my own connection with him through months of phone calls and one two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I like the man.
We often laugh when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can&#39;t be both a witness and a reporter, so I can&#39;t have a notebook and pen with me to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
An Oklahoma reporter took to Twitter to accuse me of compromising my impartiality.
Here&#39;s the lesson.
Tell the prisoner&#39;s story the way he wants, and you can participate.
I complained to the editor.
He admitted that he &quot;could have put his words better&quot;, but still thinks that what I&#39;m doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip has disagreed with some of the things I have said and written.
He doesn&#39;t tell me what to write, and I wouldn&#39;t do it even if he did.
I have told him that he can remove me from his witness list at any time.
But he wants an international reporter to be there to write about it.
If Glossip dies, he believes the publicity will help the anti-death penalty movement.
Huffington Post reporter Kim Bellware is next to me.
If you want to know more about the story, you can listen to a series of podcasts I made.
I won&#39;t go through all the details again here.
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after Barry Van Treese&#39;s murder would make him guilty of aiding and abetting in any case.
But I think there is a very strong possibility that he is not guilty of murder.
I certainly believe that there was not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I believe his execution is wrong.
And so this is the perspective from which I see him die.
I can&#39;t claim to be completely impartial.
There will be other reporters there to take care of that.
I&#39;ll give you a description of what it feels like to watch a man I love die needlessly.
The man was lured out of the Canning River after a watery police chase
A Canning Vale constable stayed dry as he lured a man away from the Canning River.
A Perth man&#39;s attempt to outwit police went awry when he found himself in shallow, muddy water just meters from a policeman who tried to &quot;gently lure him back to shore&quot;.
Canning Vale police were called to Beckenham on Tuesday to reports of trespassing.
When they spotted the suspect, he tried to mislead them by heading into the Canning River.
However, he didn&#39;t get very far.
&quot;He was standing in the water saying &#39;I&#39;m not coming out, come get me,&#39;&quot; said Senior Constable Shandell Castledine.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec didn&#39;t want his uniform to get wet, so he used a safer tactic: &quot;proper police negotiation&quot;.
&quot;Sometimes people do funny things when they try to escape,&quot; said Senior Constable Castledine.
Champion football player Ben Cousins is a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins abandoned his car to avoid a blowout and attempted to swim across the Swan River.
He was unsuccessful in his attempt, but inspired the locals to start planning the playful Ben Cousins Biathlon.
Peter Moody claims officials tried to spy on him and threatens to quit competing
Peter Moody has claimed that Racing Victoria stewards tried to infiltrate his stables last year and is threatening to stop racing with immediate effect.
He blames the stewards and Racing Victoria&#39;s anti-corruption division, claiming they are running a personal campaign against him. On Wednesday, Lady Tatai&#39;s late withdrawal due to a race day treatment was the final straw.
Moody told Fairfax Media that his aim has always been to do what is best for the race and that he has been put in a difficult position following the Lidar&#39;s inexplicable positive cobalt sample.
He has held his tongue about the spy claims for a year and a half, and didn&#39;t want &quot;it to look like jealousy.&quot;
&quot;I wasn&#39;t going to say anything about this, and I&#39;ve been quiet about it for a long time, but sometimes it gets so frustrating that it all comes out at once,&quot; Moody said.
They knew the situation continued.
Sometimes you just have to react and live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I&#39;ve said.
I will go home today and sleep well.
I want to walk with my head held high and I want the owners to think that I am doing my best for them.
When they start to think differently, that&#39;s when I should no longer continue as a coach.
Then I would have to consider what to do with my license.
Earlier, Moody dropped the bomb in an interview with racing.com, where he said that the anti-corruption department had tried to spy on his team.
“A year and a half ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - I&#39;ll name him if asked - and offered him a job in my stables if he would pass on information about what I was doing there.
They clearly think I&#39;m a fraud.
If that&#39;s the case, surely they should fire their lawyers, because they&#39;ve failed to catch me.
Robert Roulston, the former chairman of Racing Victoria, David Moodie, the current chairman of Racing Victoria, and Bernard Saundry, the current chief executive of Racing Victoria, were all aware of this at the time and are aware of it today.
Should I start thinking this is getting personal?
Has Victoria Racing finally decided to man up and perhaps transfer responsibility for what is happening in the industry to others than the coaches?
Am I harmful to the industry?
Am I that bad for the industry?
Maybe people think so.
Maybe they need to take my license and push me aside, and I have no doubt that what I&#39;m saying now might make them think just that.
But I&#39;m at the point now where I don&#39;t care anymore, and it makes me sad.
It really saddens me.
I push them to make a decision that is their responsibility.
I have the support of my family and I can turn my back on this.
The trainer&#39;s frustration has grown with the long-running Lidar cobalt survey, and the late rejection led him to say he might &quot;throw his license over the table&quot;.
Moody, best known for training undefeated champion Black Caviar, has called the rule on race-day grooming &quot;ridiculous&quot; after putting a mud or clay bath on a horse&#39;s feet, which is illegal.
&quot;It is against the rules of the competition.
I have to take full responsibility for that,” he said.
One of my workers accidentally put mud on its foot.
It could have had a bath last night.
It could have had it yesterday, as it did.
It had it on race day.
Moody could face a three-month ban due to race-day hospital treatment, which the stewards opened an investigation into.
It&#39;s a joke.
The people who make these rules know nothing about horses.
&quot;We all understand that rules are needed, but this has gone too far,&quot; Moody said.
In Cobram, the driver who was guilty of fleeing traffic was arrested
Police have arrested a man who was guilty of fleeing traffic after colliding with a cyclist at the weekend in Cobram.
A cyclist was airlifted to the Royal Melbourne Hospital after suffering serious injuries after being hit by a car on the Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
Police said the driver drove away and did not stop to help the injured cyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia turned himself in to police in Shepparton.
He will be charged with failure to stop in an accident, failure to render assistance and other traffic violations.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains in hospital in a stable condition.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy hits out at rivals over wrestling claims
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has criticized claims by the two NRL rugby league title favorites that his team&#39;s Tackles are part of the &quot;alignment&quot;.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the umpires allowed the Storm to &quot;wrestle&quot; in their side as they unexpectedly won the finals qualifier in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett could barely hide his reference to the Storm after they defeated the North Queensland Cowboys in Saturday night&#39;s finals qualifier. Bennett called the game a &quot;showcase&quot; for rugby league and said the two Queensland teams weren&#39;t &quot;very enthusiastic&quot; about wrestling.
Bellamy defended his team&#39;s tackling, saying they just focus on &quot;contact&quot; when tackling.
Bellamy added that his confidence was boosted by the criticism of the Storm from the two leading coaches, as it means they fear losing to the team.
&quot;This always comes up - I didn&#39;t hear Trent Robinson talk about wrestling when we lost to them 24-2,&quot; Bellamy said Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven&#39;t changed anything in our defense systems or techniques all year. Over the last six weeks we&#39;ve just put more emphasis on contact in the tackles and that&#39;s what&#39;s made us successful.
Trent has been with the team for three years and obviously has a great team to coach, so he&#39;s probably not used to losing, so this was a bit of a shock for him.
Funny how this always comes up this time of year.
Bellamy challenged Bennett&#39;s idea of &quot;exciting rugby&quot; by reminding his mentor that Bennett&#39;s St George Illawarra Dragons won the title in 2010 by playing &quot;boring&quot;.
Wayne talks about exciting rugby.
He made it a point to compare his Saturday night game to our Friday night game and tell how exciting their game was,” Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010 how St George were often criticized for being a boring team and Wayne said he couldn&#39;t care less.
But now he has a team that can play the kind of rugby that we think is exciting, especially when he has fast young guys.
That&#39;s the kind of game you want to play when you have those types of players.
He brought that side out in 2010, now he wants everyone to play his style of rugby - not every team has guys like Anthony Milford or Ben Hunt to play that way.
I feel more confident when they say things like this because they are a little worried about playing against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn&#39;t think of us as opposition in important games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game between the Storm and the Roosters was higher scoring than the one between the Broncos and the Cowboys.
The Broncos game sure was a good game, I haven&#39;t watched it yet, but how did it end? 16-12?
Our game was 20-18 so we were two goals up but is that exciting rugby?
Or does it make it exciting to break the defensive line and not score?
For me, this is all about alignment.
If they mention us, it means that at some point we can play against them.
The Storm have this weekend off having already won the right to play at home against either the North Queensland Cowboys or Cronulla Sharks for next Saturday night&#39;s preliminary final at AAMI Park. Tickets go on sale next Tuesday morning.
$200,000 bond for Serbian man on drug charge
A man facing a possible life sentence for attempting to possess 40kg of cocaine smuggled into Queensland has been released on $200,000 bail.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, is one of five men arrested last month after federal police traced 100kg of the drug to the yacht Solay, which entered South America via Vanuatu and docked in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was seen meeting the other defendants at the marina throughout the morning and then met them at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe where police found 40kg of the drug in a Toyota Echo.
Although Maksimovic faces a possible life sentence for attempting to possess a quantity of cocaine intended for business, his lawyer argued that there is no evidence that Maksimovic was trying to possess the entire quantity, and that he may have been at the cafe for completely innocent reasons.
Supreme Court Justice Peter Flanagan was concerned that Maksimovic was trying to escape.
&quot;He has solid connections with Serbia.
He travels to Serbia often,&quot; he told the court on Wednesday.
In the criminal court case, Maksimovic lied to the police about where he lived.
Maksimovic&#39;s mother and stepfather had jointly offered a $200,000 bond to secure his release.
“Having read the affidavits of both individuals, it is clear that setting bail at $200,000 is a real financial burden on them,” Judge Flanagan said.
But that alone was not enough to stop him from appearing in court, he warned.
Maksimovic was granted bail on the condition that he surrender both his Australian and Serbian passports, report to the police daily and adhere to his 12:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. curfew.
Stevan Hogg used the girl&#39;s phone to lure pedophiles into sending pictures
A pedophile used an 11-year-old girl&#39;s phone to request pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl&#39;s phone while she was sleeping and then logged into the online messaging service, where Hogg received numerous indecent images of children sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up later, noticed that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of a sleeping Hogg.
The girl examined her phone and found the shocking messages, after which she immediately told her mother about it.
On arrival, police saw five images, examined the computers at the scene and found &quot;worrying&quot; web searches with search terms used to search for indecent images of children.
Hogg then claimed to police that he had done this to &quot;attract pedophiles&quot; on the internet, before &quot;pretending to be a police officer to scare them&quot;.
Fiscal Depute Eilidh Robertson told Dundee Sheriff Court: “He said it&#39;s an addiction - that he&#39;s addicted to scaring people.
He admitted that he had done the searches on the computer but said they were only done because he wanted to pretend to be a police officer to scare off pedophiles.
He was asked about conversations with the unknown person who sent him the photos and when Hogg asked the person to send additional photos.
Hogg said he only did this as bait.
He said that after drinking, his head is sick, and he wants to look at pictures of rapes and murders.
Robertson added: “When the girl found the pictures on her phone, she was screaming for her mum, shaking and crying.
The mother saw the obscene pictures on the phone and then confronted the accused.
The girl was interviewed and she said that the accused had used a computer and a Playstation to talk to girls who looked younger than her.
Hogg, 23, of Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to a charge of making or taking indecent images of children on June 14 last year. He breached his bail on January 25 this year and failed to appear in court on March 24 this year.
Defense attorney Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not be placed on the sex offenders&#39; register, as it can be argued that his crime did not include a &quot;significant sexual element&quot;.
Sheriff Alistair Carmicheal adjourned sentencing until October to allow social services time to prepare background reports.
Hogg was granted bail in this case, but in other ongoing cases he is being held pending trial.
He was added to the sex offender registry before the sentencing date.
Zimbabwe&#39;s Robert Mugabe gave a false speech to parliament
Africa&#39;s oldest leader, Mugabe, fell on the steps leading to the podium earlier this year.
He was not injured, but the video of the fall spread like a virus on social media.
The opening of parliament was also marred by claims by opposition lawmakers that they had been sent anonymous death threats warning them not to boo Mugabe during his speech.
Last month, they booed and interrupted him during his state of the country speech to parliament - a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) group discipline supervisor Innocent Gonese said seven opposition politicians received text messages on their cellphones warning them not to disrupt Mugabe&#39;s speech.
&quot;The number from which the message was sent is not answered, but the subject of the message is &#39;death&#39;,&quot; Gonese told reporters after Mugabe&#39;s speech.
The message warned the members involved that immunity ends in Parliament, and once they step outside, parliamentary immunity will no longer apply.
A party discipline watchdog said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, is &quot;concerned&quot; about threats against its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard cuts up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard has prepared to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of its restructuring and cost-cutting efforts in its business services business.
Later this year, HP will split into two publicly traded companies, separating its computer and printer business from the faster-growing enterprise hardware and services operations.
The expected job cuts will result in approximately $2.7 billion in expenses starting in the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
&quot;These restructuring actions will enable a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise,&quot; said Meg Whitman, HP&#39;s chairman and CEO, who will lead the unit after the split.
&quot;Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than today&#39;s HP, and we will have a broad and deep set of services to help companies transition to a new way of doing business,&quot; Whitman said.
As a separate company, our ability to meet the evolving needs of our customers around the world is better than ever.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise&#39;s annual turnover will be more than 50 billion dollars, and it will &quot;focus on producing unparalleled integrated technology solutions&quot; for companies, according to the company&#39;s press release.
The split breaks up the company, which was founded in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to make electrical supplies. The company operated out of a garage in Palo Alto, known as the &quot;Birthplace of Silicon Valley&quot;.
HP has gone through a massive restructuring to cope with the shift from traditional PCs to mobile devices.
HP is the world&#39;s second largest computer maker and one of the largest technology firms in the US, and its split is the latest in an industry based on the belief that tightly bounded companies perform better.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says team-mates must support injured Jack Wilshere ahead of Dinamo Zagreb tie
Wenger has also stressed to Wilshire that it is only September and assuming his rehabilitation goes to plan, there is no reason why he will not be back playing by Christmas.
Even in this best-case scenario, Wilshire will miss at least the next four England games and, given his background, it is uncertain whether he will feature at next summer&#39;s European Championships.
The biggest shame in this latest problem is that Wilshere had a strong end to last season after a single ankle injury, and he recalled his old sharpness before the start of the season.
&quot;This kind of injury is not career-threatening,&quot; Wenger said.
It&#39;s a bone that didn&#39;t heal properly.
It&#39;s nothing strange.
It was just an accident.
It&#39;s not related to his ankles or any previous injuries he&#39;s had.
This may be true from a medical point of view, but, as Wenger also acknowledged, there is always the risk of further injury when a player tries to return mid-season.
An uncomfortable pattern is also forming.
Investigations by Premier Injuries Ltd show that Wilshere has had 23 different injuries since he made his debut six years ago.
In addition, in the last five seasons, he has played in only 65 of Arsenal&#39;s 157 league games.
Looking at the wider picture of Arsenal since 2007-08, in six out of eight seasons they have been the second Premier League team to miss the most days due to injury.
Wenger admits the possibility of a vicious cycle, but Arsenal believe their improvement in injury statistics last season will continue.
&quot;Sometimes when you come back from an injury it can be a vulnerable season, when you have to strengthen your body and get competition,&quot; Wenger said.
Jack is young enough to get over it.
I hope that his body will stabilize, I&#39;m sure it will, and that he will have the career he deserves.
Wenger is preparing to rotate his squad as Arsenal open their Champions League campaign against Dinamo Zagreb on Wednesday night, before playing Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia, meaning Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to start.
Wenger can also field Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud in place of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
&quot;I try to maintain a balance and give a breather to the players who need it,&quot; Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is the clear favorite to continue in Group F, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the scariest in Europe.
Dinamo are also unbeaten in 41 matches since they produced their own &#39;Invincible&#39; campaign last season.
The stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday night, the magnitude of which was 3.2 on the Richter scale.
It was the tenth in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes Arsenal have learned from last season&#39;s Champions League defeat against Monaco and remains motivated by the distant dream of leading the team to their first European Cup triumph.
&quot;This motivation is huge,&quot; Wenger said.
Arsenal have never achieved that.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand, I can be realistic.
We are ambitious but not dreamers.
FriendsFest: the sitcom that taught us serious things about friendship between men
It&#39;s striking how similar depictions don&#39;t exist in the series, especially considering that men&#39;s need to open up is more desperate than ever, and the suicide rate among young men is higher than it&#39;s been in fifteen years.
In 2013, suicide was the leading cause of death for men aged 20-45 in the UK, and is three times more common in men than in women.
In an attempt to tackle the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) declared 2015 the Year of Men. The goal was to challenge the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of facing this challenge.
A recent study involved more than 2,000 middle school and high school age students who showed symptoms of depression. According to the study, a person&#39;s chance of recovery doubled if a high enough percentage of his friends were &quot;in good spirits&quot;.
Similarly, for those who were not depressed, the probability of possible mental health problems was halved if they had mentally healthy friends.
But for friendship to work, it must first be available.
In this age of communication through social media, style overrides content and the immediacy of a response is often more important than meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have redoubled the need to appear strong, happy and successful, when in reality isolation reigns supreme.
This superficial success is dominated by values that psychologists call extrinsic: money, image, social status. All of this comes at the expense of inner values—the inner longing for personal growth and friendship—that have a deeper impact on our mental health.
And as a billionaire video game developer recently explained, money really doesn&#39;t buy happiness.
The beauty of Friends was precisely that it turned this focus on its head.
Neither character was defined by their work, but rather by their personalities, which stood out clearly in their interactions as friends.
Joey and Chandler&#39;s numerous hugs, moments in comfortable chairs watching football, Ross missing Rachel - the humor of these came from the knowledge that yes, men can relate to all of this, even if they are often hesitant to fully explore their feelings.
As a Samaritans volunteer explained to me: ...&quot;listening to people who are depressed and suicidal, I&#39;ve really understood how even the smallest interaction with a friend can make you feel better.&quot;
Often men who contact us feel that they cannot talk to friends.
The old idea of &quot;getting over it&quot; is strong, as is the feeling that if you open up about problems, you will be seen as weak.
Frendit is one of those series that comes to mind when I&#39;m trying to provide more long-term means of survival.
It highlighted the small moments of friendship between men.
While my neutral, outsider position on the other end of the phone helps people in times of despair, long-term support comes from a close, personal network of family and friends.
So if you&#39;re attending Comedy Central&#39;s FriendsFest this weekend, and all the sets have been redesigned to celebrate, why not take your friends out for coffee at Central Perk.
Or, better yet, if you see someone lonely at Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You never know how much your friendship can mean.
Friends airs on Comedy Central from beginning to end, all 236 episodes, attend #FriendsFest
Di Maria scores to help PSG knock Malmö aside
Angel Di Maria celebrates goals against Malmö with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani.
Angel Di Maria scored on his Champions League debut to help PSG past Swedish side Malmö on Tuesday.
Below is the match report and reactions to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on the right track as Paris Saint-Germain finally got their Champions League campaign underway with a comfortable 2-0 win over Malmö at the Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored less than four minutes into his Champions League debut to put the French league champions in the way, but the team wasted several chances before eventually extending their lead when Cavani struck in the 61st minute.
Paris, who are in the same Group A as Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, needed a strong start against the Swedish league champions, with not only a promotion spot at stake, but also an improvement on their performances in the last three rounds leading up to the quarter-finals
But even though PSG took the points, it wasn&#39;t a classic game as Laurent Blanc&#39;s Zlatan Ibrahimovic lost his place in front of goal and was later substituted. Malmö is his old hometown team and the team where he started his brilliant career in 1999.
&quot;It&#39;s not easy to win at home or away in the Champions League, so a 2-0 win creates problems for the opposition and looks good in the statistics and is a good start, although there are things we need to work on this season,&quot; said Blanc.
This bodes well.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret that we didn&#39;t manage to score one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned from injury to the Paris team in one of three changes made after the team were held to a 2-2 draw at home to Ligue 1 Bordeaux at the weekend, but he was overshadowed by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
After his move from Manchester United last month, the Argentine winger was named as the man to take PSG to the next level in Europe, and he proved why when he ran onto Marco Verratti&#39;s pass behind Malmö&#39;s defense and then curled a beautiful finish past Johan Wiland into the back corner of the net.
However, if anyone expected an easy and big victory from PSG, they were disappointed.
Malmö was a tough opponent. They beat Celtic in the decider to reach this level, have nine internationals in their starting line-up and a five-man defense with two players in deep midfield.
But the team didn&#39;t offer much on the offensive side other than Nikola Djurdjic&#39;s shot in the 34th minute that went just wide of Kevin Trapp&#39;s goal post.
Instead, PSG were troubled at times by lost passes and poor finishing, especially from Ibrahimovic, who failed in five attempts in the first half alone and then let himself down when Cavani put the ball in from Ibrahimovic&#39;s touch early in the second half.
However, he was much more effective in laying the groundwork for his colleagues, and it was from Ibrahimovic&#39;s pass that Di Maria sent a curling shot that tipped around Wiland&#39;s goal post in the 52nd minute.
The second goal finally arrived after an hour thanks to Uruguayan Cavan, who scored his sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic had flicked on Maxwell&#39;s cross from the left.
That ended Malmö&#39;s hopes of getting back into the game, and only Wiland&#39;s brilliant save from David Luiz&#39;s free kick kept the final tallies down, before substitute Ezequiel Lavezzi&#39;s goal was disallowed right at the end of the game.
Malmö coach Age Hareide later admitted that PSG were one level above his team. The Norwegian said: &quot;Our last Champions League game was in December last year.&quot;
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, which is not at the same level.
Qualifying matches are not enough.
Hats off to Paris.
This was a great game from them.
Glencore raises $2.5 billion by selling shares
Switzerland-based miner Glencore, hit by a slump in commodity prices, raised $2.5 billion on Wednesday by selling shares as part of its sweeping debt-cutting plan.
Glencore, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange, said in a statement that it had sold new shares for about 1.6 billion pounds to reduce its debt.
The company, which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is struggling with plunging commodity prices as China&#39;s economic slowdown weighs on demand and wreaks havoc across markets.
The new listing lifted the value of Glencore&#39;s shares to the top of the London Stock Exchange in Wednesday&#39;s morning trading.
Shares rose 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence in the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69 percent higher.
Glencore had disclosed a $2.5 billion stock deal the previous week as part of its broader plan to cut its $30 billion debt burden by about a third.
The company sold new share capital for 125 pence a share, which meant a 2.4 percent discount to Tuesday&#39;s closing price.
The company sold 1.3 billion shares, the value of which was a total of 9.99 percent of the group.
Concerns about the long-standing stagnation of China&#39;s growth have cut the prices of iron ore by about half, and at the same time the prices of coal, copper and other commodities have fallen by 20-40 percent.
The White House confirms Xi Jinping&#39;s visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will pay a state visit to the United States at the end of the month, a White House statement on Tuesday confirmed.
Xi&#39;s first official visit to Washington will take place on September 25 and is in response to President Barack Obama&#39;s visit to Beijing last November, the statement said.
The President of the United States and First Lady Michelle Obama host a dinner for Xi and his spouse, Peng Liyuan, after the leaders hold bilateral talks.
&quot;President Xi&#39;s visit provides an opportunity to expand cooperation between the United States and China on a number of global, regional and bilateral issues of common interest, and at the same time, it provides an opportunity for President Obama and President Xi to constructively discuss issues where there are differences,&quot; the statement added.
In the visit, which was first announced in February, Xi is also expected to stop in Seattle on his way to Washington to meet with a number of US technology leaders before continuing on to New York City and the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to discuss a range of contentious topics, including Washington&#39;s concerns over China&#39;s alleged cyber espionage and the country&#39;s increased assertiveness in the disputed waters of the South China Sea.
Matt Damon downplays diversity in filmmaking
Matt Damon clashed with African-American filmmaker Effie Brown as they discussed diversity, which Damon says isn&#39;t needed behind the scenes.
On Sunday night&#39;s episode of HBO&#39;s Project Greenlight, the veteran actor interrupted Brown as he emphasized the need for different perspectives regarding the dark-skinned protagonist of the script selected for the project.
&quot;When we talk about diversity, it&#39;s taken into account when casting actors for the movie, not the series,&quot; Damon argued.
A shocked Brown reacted with injured disbelief, commenting “Whoa! Wow. Okay,” while the The Martian actor&#39;s comments were left hanging in the air.
Fellow producers Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers joined Damon and Brown to discuss the series&#39; finalists.
&quot;I want to encourage people to think, no matter who the director is, how they treat the character of Harmony,&quot; Brown said at the beginning.
The only dark character is a prostitute who is beaten by her white pimp.
The producer of The Dear White People claimed the rights to direct the film to finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio; Damon bluntly replied that their guidance &quot;could end up giving us something we don&#39;t want&quot;.
After the conversation was broadcast, social media exploded with disapproval of Damon&#39;s comments.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed his anger at the clip, writing: &quot;Matt Damon talking over the only black person in the room and explaining to him the difference is SO WHITE it hurts.&quot;
After its publication, the tweet collected more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes.
Damon&#39;s comments come at a time when accurate racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discourse.
After the white police killing of teenager Michael Brown in 2014, The Black Lives Matter movement spread nationwide, calling on lawmakers and government officials to end practices that discriminate against people of color.
In February, singer Prince referenced the movement when he presented the Album of the Year nominees for the Grammy Awards.
&quot;Albums still matter,&quot; he said.
Like books and black lives matter, albums still matter.
Leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement recently released a statement in response to a question from Fox News television personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck about whether the group should be considered a hate group.
“The Black Lives Matter Network is a group of love,” the leaders said.
It was recently reported that Damon is among the entertainers, producers and media moguls who have been invited to visit the Pope to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is unclear whether he has accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope.
First American Ninja Warrior champion crowned
Professional rock climber and crockery collector Isaac Caldiero on Monday became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior competition and was rewarded with the $1 million grand prize.
The competition program, which has just concluded its seventh season, has never had a competitor who has survived all sections of the program&#39;s obstacle course.
In the last episode of the series, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, made it to the final round.
In the last task, you had to climb a 23-meter rope in 30 seconds.
Britten climbed first and completed the challenge in time, making him the first athlete ever to complete the grueling Stage 4 of American Ninja Warrior. However, Caldiero cleared the challenge three seconds faster, making him the winner.
Caldiero gave an interview to E!News after the hard-fought victory, still reeling from winning the $1 million grand prize.
&quot;So that&#39;s amazing to think about when I&#39;ve never made or lived on more than $10,000 a year,&quot; Isaac told E! after his big raise.
So suddenly...I can&#39;t even imagine what this will be like...the future is unknown.
Executive producer Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to talk about the finale and why Britten isn&#39;t getting more prize money despite being the first contestant ever to successfully complete the course.
According to the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
&quot;If more than one person passes, whoever has the fastest time gets the money,&quot; Weed said.
Although money is a great reward and life-changing, he still gets a great sense of satisfaction.
I don&#39;t think he holds any grudges about it.
He is just so happy that he got to do what he did.
He has been praised by his fans.
He is a great guy and a good family man.
He is a hero to his children and his wife.
Geoff told me, “If anyone had to beat me, I&#39;m happy it was Isaac.”
And I think Isaac would have thought the same if this had gone the other way.
American Ninja Warrior will return for its eighth season, which will begin filming in spring 2016.
The Detroit Tigers snuck past the Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- The second half of the season hasn&#39;t been much fun for the Detroit Tigers.
The Tigers were once one of the best teams in baseball, but are now in last place in the American League Central division.
The Tigers played their spoiler role perfectly on Tuesday, beating the Minnesota Twins 5-4 at Target Field.
The Twins squandered a chance to pull within a half game of the Houston Astros in the race for the second American League wild card spot.
For Detroit, the game was, at least for one night, a return to the six-letter H-word, which had been very elusive for most of the second half of the season.
&quot;Any win is fun, no matter how you get it,&quot; said Tigers team manager Brad Ausmus.
Tigers pitcher Alfredo Simon continued his early offensive support as Detroit scored three runs in the first two innings, then once in the sixth and again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) pitched 6 1/3 innings and allowed three runs.
It was just his third quality start in the last nine games.
&quot;I just want to finish this year strong,&quot; Simon said.
It&#39;s difficult for a substitute to pass in every game, and that&#39;s why I want to go deep into the game.
Tigers reliever Victor Martinez had three hits and allowed two runs, his first since mid-August.
It was Martinez&#39;s first three-hit night since hitting four against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
“He swung the bat well,” Ausmus said.
He looked good (in batting practice), looked significantly better in batting practice and continued that pattern in the game.
Trailing by three runs in the bottom of the seventh inning, the Twins were their best chance to get back into the game.
Center fielder Byron Buxton started the inning with a two-out single down the left field line.
Right-hander Aaron Hicks homered with a single, and Simon got burned right off second baseman Brian Dozier before Simon was replaced by left-hander Blaine Hardy.
Hardy walked Mauer, the only other player facing off, ahead of rookie reliever Miguel Sano, who ripped a two-run home run to left off right-hander Drew VerHagen.
With two runners on and the tying runner on second base, VerHagen got triple baseman Trevor Plouffe to hit a groundout leading into a double play.
It was a major league record: the 27th time this season that Plouffe hit a double play.
After Detroit got the go-ahead run in the top of the ninth, Mauer plated two runs against Tigers closer Bruce Rondon to make it 5-4.
However, the right-hander burned Sano in three passes in his fifth save.
Detroit took advantage of a rusty Phil Hughes early on.
The Tigers scored three runs in the first two innings against the veteran right-hander, who came off the injured list before the game after being out for more than a month with lower back inflammation.
&quot;Obviously I didn&#39;t want to start like that,&quot; Hughes said, &quot;but as the game went on I got more comfortable and I felt like I made some nice pitches in the third inning.&quot;
After Hughes caught the leadoff hitter at first base, he allowed second baseman Ian Kinsler to advance with one out.
A walk to right fielder JD Martinez in a two-out situation brought in Victor Martinez, who singled to first base with a hit to center field to score the game&#39;s first run.
Victor Martinez snapped his 0-21 streak with runners in good running position.
Triple shorter Nick Castellanos followed with a single to right to drive in another run, but the threat ended when Victor Martinez was thrown out as he attempted to triple.
The Tigers continued in the second inning, getting a one-out, two-run home run from catcher James McCann and a two-out, one-run home run from center Anthony Gose to make it 3-0.
&quot;It was an important at-bat,&quot; Twins manager Paul Molitor said.
He didn&#39;t hit very well, but it hit the spot.
Hughes started in the pitch count and pitched a scoreless third inning before being replaced by right-handed reliever AJ Achter.
Hughes was credited with three runs on six hits and a walk with four strikeouts.
NOTES: Tigers right-handed pitcher Anibal Sanchez is out with a sprained throwing arm.
He is being examined by Dr. James Andrews, who operated on Sanchez&#39;s shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez has been on the injured list since mid-August with a shoulder strain, but was due to return on Wednesday.
With Sanchez out, left-handed pitcher Daniel Norris will come off the injured list to start against the Twins.
Norris is 1-1 with the Tigers in four starts since he was traded for left-handed pitcher David Price on July 30.
Norris has been out since August 20th with a strained right oblique muscle.
The three-game series between the Tigers and Twins ends Wednesday at Target Field.
Norris (2-2-, 4.43 ERA) will line up against Minnesota right-handed pitcher Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi calls for a wider opening of the economy to the world
The economy must open up more to the outside world to promote growth, President Xi Jinping told a group tasked with guiding the reform on Tuesday.
&quot;China should commit to attracting foreign funding and expertise and develop a policy of openness,&quot; he said, speaking at the 16th meeting of the group leading the deepening of comprehensive reform.
Supporting openness at the same time as reforms are pushed forward will increase new movement and vitality, and create new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The leadership team approved a series of guidelines, including a negative list restricting market access, loosening border control principles, urging state-owned companies to seize private capital, and revising the resident registration system.
According to the statement, a negative list will be created, naming the sectors and companies in which investments may not be made.
The system is gradually tested and improved with the help of trial programs.
The change is significant, as it gives the market a greater role in the allocation of resources, ensures a business environment based on the law and makes the market more open, the statement states.
The government also loosens its grip on the power it shares with companies, thus ensuring that companies decide for themselves how to run their business.
The statement also said that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for developing regional growth.
