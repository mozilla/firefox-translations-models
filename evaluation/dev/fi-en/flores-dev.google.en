The 800-mile Trans-Alaska pipeline was shut down after thousands of barrels of crude oil spilled in Fairbanks, Alaska.
A power outage after a routine fire engineering test caused relief valves to open and crude oil to leak out near Fort Greely Pump Station 9.
The opening of the valves allowed the pressure built up in the system to release, and the oil flowed into the 55,000-barrel (2.3 million gallon) tank on the platform.
The tank&#39;s valves were still leaking Wednesday afternoon, likely due to thermal expansion in the tank.

This is the first time that a judgment has been issued on the basis of the legislation enacted in 2003, which limits the unnecessary distribution of mass messages, or spam, to users&#39; e-mails.
Jesus, 21, joined Manchester City in January 2017 last year from Brazilian club Palmeiras for a reported £27m transfer fee.
Since then, the Brazilian has featured in 53 of the team&#39;s matches in all competitions and has scored 24 goals.
Lee also said that he is concerned about the information that Turkish children have recently been infected with the A(H5N1) bird flu virus without becoming sick.
Some studies suggest that the disease needs to become less lethal before it can cause a global epidemic, he noted.
The concern is that patients may continue to be infected by following their daily routines if their flu symptoms remain mild.
Komen Foundation spokesperson Leslie Aun said the organization has introduced a new rule, according to which organizations under police investigation cannot be awarded grants or other funding.
Komen&#39;s new policy prevented Planned Parenthood from receiving funding from it because Congressman Cliff Searns is leading an investigation into how Planned Parenthood spends and reports its money.
Stearns, in his capacity as chairman of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, is investigating whether tax dollars are being used to fund abortions through Planned Parenthood. The subcommittee falls under the Energy and Trade Committee of the House of Representatives.
Former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney won the Florida Republican Party presidential primary on Tuesday, receiving more than 46 percent of the vote.
Former US House Speaker Newt Gingrich came in second with 32 percent of the vote.
Florida is one of those states where the candidate with the most votes gets all the caucus delegates, so all fifty of its delegates went to Romney, who thus gained an additional neck as the number one contender for the Republican nomination.
According to the organizers of the demonstration, about 100,000 people showed up in such German cities as Berlin, Cologne, Hamburg and Hanover.
According to the police estimate, there were 6,500 protesters in Berlin.
There were also demonstrations in Paris, Sofia, Vilnius, Valletta, Tallinn, Edinburgh and Glasgow.
In London, about 200 people demonstrated outside the premises of some companies that control large amounts of copyright.
Last month, there were large protests in Poland after the country signed the ACTA agreement, which led to the Polish government deciding not to accept the agreement for the time being.
Latvia and Slovakia have both postponed joining ACTA.
Animal rights organizations Animal Liberation and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) are again calling for the mandatory installation of surveillance cameras in all Australian slaughterhouses.
RSPCA New South Wales chief inspector David O&#39;Shannessy told the ABC that monitoring and inspections of slaughterhouses should be standard across Australia.
The use of surveillance cameras would certainly be a clear indication to people who work with animals that the welfare of the animals is considered to be of primary importance.
The United States Geological Survey&#39;s international earthquake map showed no earthquakes in Iceland in the previous week.
The Icelandic Meteorological Institute has also not reported any earthquakes in the Hekla area during the last two days.
Significant seismic activity leading to the phase change had been experienced on March 10 on the northeast side of the volcano&#39;s summit crater.
Dark clouds unrelated to volcanic activity were reported at the foot of the mountain.
The clouds could cause confusion as to whether the eruption had actually occurred.
Luno had between 120 and 160 cubic meters of fuel when its engine broke and the strong wind and waves pushed it towards the breakwater.
All twelve crew members were rescued by helicopters, with the only casualty being a broken nose.
The hundred-meter-long ship was on its way to pick up its usual cargo of fertilizer, and at first the authorities feared that the cargo might leak from the ship.
The proposed law change has already been approved in both houses of Congress in 2011.
The change was made in this legislative session. The second sentence was first removed in the House of Representatives, then passed in a similar form in the Senate on Monday.
Since the second sentence intended to prevent same-sex civil marriages was rejected, the door may well be open to allowing civil marriages in the future.
At the end of the review, HJR-3 will be reassessed in the next post-election legislative period, either in 2015 or 2016, in order to keep it under review.
Along with directing, Vautier&#39;s achievements included a hunger strike in 1973, with which he opposed what he considered to be political censorship.
French legislation was amended. He started activism at the age of 15 when he joined the French resistance during World War II.
He documented himself in his book published in 1998.
In the 1960s, he headed back to newly independent Algeria to teach film directing.
Japanese judoka Hitoshi Saito, who won two Olympic gold medals, has died at the age of 54.
The cause of death was found to be intrahepatic bile duct cancer.
He died on Tuesday in Osaka.
At the time of his death, Saito was not only a former Olympic champion and world champion, but also the chairman of the training committee of the Japan Judo Federation.
At least a hundred people had attended the party to celebrate the first wedding anniversary of the couple who got married last year.
According to the authorities, the official wedding anniversary event was planned for a later date.
The couple had married in Texas a year ago and had come to Buffalo to celebrate with friends and relatives.
The 30-year-old husband, who was born in Buffalo, was one of four people killed in the shooting, but his wife was not injured.
Karno is a well-known but controversial English teacher who has taught at Modern Education and King&#39;s Glory prep schools. According to his own claim, he had 9,000 students at the peak of his career.
He used words in his notes that some parents considered rude, and according to reports, he used power words in class.
Modern Education accused him of printing large advertisements on buses without permission and of lying when he claimed to be a head teacher of English.
He has also been accused of copyright infringement in the past, but not officially prosecuted.
A former student said he &quot;used slang in class, taught dating skills in notes and was just like friends with the students.&quot;
Over the past 30 years, China has developed a market economy, although the country is still officially a communist state.
The first economic reforms were carried out under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping.
Since then, China&#39;s economy has grown 90 times.
Last year, for the first time, China exported more cars than Germany and overtook the United States as the industry&#39;s largest market.
Within two decades, China&#39;s GDP may become larger than that of the United States.
Tropical Storm Danielle, the fourth named storm of the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean.
Located approximately 3,000 miles from Miami, Florida, the storm has maximum sustained winds of 40 mph (64 kph).
National Hurricane Center scientists have predicted that by Wednesday, Danielle will have strengthened into a hurricane.
Because the storm is far from the coast, its potential impact on the United States or the islands of the Caribbean Sea remains difficult to assess.
Born in the Croatian capital Zagreb, Bobek rose to fame playing for Partizan Belgrade.
He joined the club in 1945 and stayed with it until 1958.
In his team years, he played in 468 matches and scored 403 goals.
No one has played in more Partizan matches or scored more goals than Bobek.
In 1995, he was named the best player in the history of Partizan.
The festivities began with a special show by the world-famous Cirque du Soleil group.
It was followed by the Istanbul State Symphony Orchestra, the Janissary Orchestra and singers Fatih Erkoç and Müslüm Gürses.
After that, the whirling dervishes took the stage.
Turkish diva Sezen Aksu performed with Italian tenor Alessandro Safina and Greek singer Haris Alexiou.
Finally, the Turkish dance group Anatolian tuli performed their Troy show.
Peter Lenz, a 13-year-old racing motorcyclist, has died after crashing at the Indianapolis track.
Lenz, who was on the warm-up lap, fell off the saddle of his bike, after which competitor Xavier Zayat hit him.
The track&#39;s medical staff immediately began treating him and he was taken to a local hospital, where he later died.
Zayat was not injured in the accident.
Zapatero further stated the following about the world&#39;s economic situation: &quot;The financial system is a part of the economy, an essential part.
We have suffered through a year-long financial crisis, the most acute of which was experienced in the last two months, and I believe that the financial markets are now starting to recover.&quot;
Naked News announced last week that it intends to significantly increase its international and multilingual news operations with three new broadcasts.
News is already available in English and Japanese, but the global company will start producing programs in Spanish, Italian and Korean for TV, web and mobile devices.
Fortunately, nothing happened to me, but the sight was macabre as people tried to break the windows to get out.
People hit the window panes with chairs, but the glass was unbreakable.
Finally, one of the windows broke, and people started getting out through the window,&quot; said Franciszek Kowal, who survived the accident.
Stars emit light and heat because energy is created when hydrogen atoms combine (i.e. fuse) with each other to form heavier elements.
Scientists are trying to develop a reactor that could produce energy in the same way.
However, the problem is very difficult to solve, and it will take many more years before usable fusion reactors start to be built.
A steel needle floats on water due to surface tension.
Surface tension occurs because the water molecules on the surface of the water attract each other much more than the air molecules above them.
Water molecules make an invisible film on the surface of the water, thanks to which, for example, a needle can float on top of the water.
In a way, the blade of modern skates has two blades with a concave groove between them. Thanks to the two blades, you get a better grip on the ice even when tilting the skate.
Since the lower part of the blade curves slightly, the edge that hits the ice also curves when the blade tilts to either side.
That&#39;s why the skater turns. If the skates tilt to the right, the skater turns to the right, if the skates tilt to the left, the skater turns to the left.
To get back to their previous energy level, they have to get rid of the extra energy they got from the light.
They do this by emitting a tiny particle of light called a photon.
Scientists use the name stimulated radiation emission for this sequence of events, because bright light brightens, i.e. stimulates, atoms and causes the emission of a photon of light, and light is also a type of radiation.
The following picture shows how atoms emit photons. In reality, the photons are of course much smaller than in the picture.
Photons are even smaller than the particles that make up atoms!
After hundreds of hours of use, the filament of the light bulb eventually burns out and the bulb no longer works.
Then the lamp needs to be changed. Be careful when changing the lamp.
First of all, the light switch must be off or the cord must be disconnected.
This is because electricity flowing into the socket where the metal part of the lamp is attached can cause a serious electric shock if you touch the inside of the socket or the metal base of the lamp while it is still partially attached to the socket.
The most important organ of the circulatory system is the heart, which pumps blood.
Blood leaves the heart in tubes called arteries and returns to the heart in tubes called veins. The smallest tubes are called capillaries.
Triceratops&#39; teeth would have been able to crush not only leaves but also very strong branches and roots.
Some scientists believe that triceratops ate conifer palms, which were common plants during the Cretaceous period.
They look like small palm trees with a crown of sharp, spiky leaves.
Triceratops could have used its powerful beak to tear off the leaves before eating the carcass.
Other researchers argue that no dinosaurs probably ate these plants because they are very poisonous. Even today, the sloth and some other animals, such as the parrot (descendant of the dinosaurs), are able to eat poisonous leaves or fruits.
How would Io&#39;s attraction affect me? If you stood on the surface of Io, you would weigh less than on Earth.
A person who weighs 200 pounds (90 kg) on Earth would weigh about 36 pounds (16 kg) on Io. So, of course, gravity pulls you down less.
Unlike the Earth, the Sun has no crust to stand on. The whole sun is made up of gases, fire and plasma.
The gas gets thinner as you move further from the center of the Sun.
The outermost part of the Sun that we can see is called the photosphere, which means &quot;ball of light&quot;.
About three thousand years later, in 1610, the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei used a telescope and discovered that Venus has phases just like the Moon.
Phases occur because only the sun side of Venus gets light (same goes for the Moon). The phases of Venus supported Copernicus&#39; theory that the planets revolved around the Sun.
A few years later, in 1639, an English astronomer named Jeremiah Horrocks observed a transit of Venus.
England had experienced a long period of peace after the Danelage had been retaken.
However, in 991 Ethelred was confronted by a Viking fleet larger than any since Guthrum&#39;s fleet a century earlier.
The fleet was led by the Norwegian Olavi Tryggvenpoika, whose goal was to free Norway back from the supremacy of the Danes.
After initial military setbacks, Ethelred managed to reconcile with Olav, and he returned to Norway to try to win back his kingdom, with varying success.
Hangul is the only specially developed alphabet that is in general daily use. The alphabet was invented in 1444 during the reign of King Sejong (1418–1450).
King Sejong was the fourth king of the Joseon Dynasty and one of the most respected.
He originally named the Hangul alphabet hunmin jeongeum, which means &quot;correct sounds for teaching the people&quot;.
Several different theories have been put forward about the origin of Sanskrit. One of them concerns the Aryans, who brought their language with them when they migrated from the west to India.
Sanskrit is an ancient language and can be compared to the Latin spoken in Europe.
The world&#39;s earliest known book was written in Sanskrit. After the compilation of the Upanishads, Sanskrit declined due to hierarchy.
Sanskrit is a very rich and complex language that has served as the source of many modern Indian languages in the same way that Latin is the source of European languages such as French and Spanish.
After the battle for France was over, Germany began preparing to invade the British Isles.
Germany gave the attack the code name Operation Sea Lion. Most of the British Army&#39;s heavy weapons and equipment had been lost in the Dunkirk evacuation, leaving the army quite weak.
Still, the British Royal Navy was still much stronger than the German Navy (Kriegsmarine) and could have destroyed any invasion fleet sent across the English Channel.
However, very few British naval ships had their bases close to likely attack routes, as admirals feared they would be sunk by German air attack.
Let&#39;s start with an explanation of Italy&#39;s plans. Italy was mainly the &quot;little brother&quot; of Germany and Japan.
Italy&#39;s land and sea forces were weaker, although it had recently, just before the start of the war, built four new ships.
Italy&#39;s main targets were in African countries. To conquer them, it needed a springboard for its troops to cross the Mediterranean by ships and invade Africa.
That is why they had to get rid of British bases and ships in Egypt. Italian battleships were not supposed to do anything beyond that.
Then Japan. Japan was an island nation, just like Great Britain.
Submarines are ships that are intended to move underwater and stay there for long periods of time.
Submarines were used in World War I and II. At that time, they were very slow, and their weapons had a very limited range.
At the beginning of the war, they mostly traveled on the surface of the sea, but as research began to be developed and became more precise, submarines had to move underwater to remain invisible.
German submarines were called U-boats. The Germans knew how to sail and use their submarines very skillfully.
Since the Germans used submarines in the war so successfully, not many submarines are trusted after that.
Yes! King Tutankhamun, sometimes called King Tut or the boy king, is one of the most famous kings of ancient Egypt today.
Interestingly, he was not considered very important in ancient times and was not included in most of the ancient king lists.
However, the discovery of his grave in 1922 made him famous. Many of the tombs of the past had been looted, but this one had remained virtually untouched.
Most of the objects buried with Tutankhamun are well preserved, and include thousands of objects made of precious metals and gemstones.
The invention of spoked wheels made Assyrian chariots lighter, faster, and better equipped to beat soldiers and other chariots in speed.
Arrows from the deadly Assyrian crossbows could pierce the armor of opposing soldiers. The Assyrians were the first to use cavalry around 1000 BC.
Cavalry is an army unit that fights on horseback. The saddle had not yet been invented, so the Assyrian cavalry fought on the bare backs of their horses.
We know many Greek politicians, scientists and artists. Perhaps the most famous figure in the culture is Homer, the legendary blind poet who wrote two masterpieces of Greek literature: poems called the Iliad and the Odyssey.
Sophocles and Aristophanes are still popular playwrights, and their plays are considered among the greatest works of world literature.
Famous Greeks also include the mathematician Pythagoras. He is mostly known for his famous theorem concerning the sides of right triangles
There are varying estimates of how many people speak Hindi. It is estimated to be the second, third or fourth most spoken language in the world.
The number of native speakers depends on whether speakers of very closely related dialects are included.
Estimates range from 340 million to 500 million speakers, with as many as 800 million able to understand Hindi.
The vocabulary of Hindi and Urdu is similar but the writing system is different. In everyday conversations, speakers of both languages are usually able to understand each other.
During the 15th century, Northern Estonia experienced considerable German cultural influence.
A few German monks wanted to bring God closer to the native people, and so they invented the Estonian literary language.
It was based on the German alphabet, to which one letter character was added: Õ/õ.
Over time, many words borrowed from Germany merged into the language. It marked the beginning of the Age of Enlightenment.
Traditionally, the heir to the throne went straight to the military after finishing school.
Charles, on the other hand, started at Trinity College, Cambridge University. He first studied anthropology and archeology in Cambridge and later history, graduating with a grade of 2:2 (lower second class grade).
Charles was the first member of the British royal family to be awarded a degree.
Turkey on the European side (Eastern Thrace or Rumelia on the Balkan Peninsula) comprises 3 percent of the entire country.
Turkey&#39;s land area is more than 1,600 kilometers (1,000 mi) long and 800 km (500 mi) wide, and is roughly rectangular in shape.
The area of Turkey, including lakes, is 783,562 square kilometers (300,948 sq mi), of which 755,688 square kilometers (291,773 sq mi) lie in Southwest Asia and 23,764 square kilometers (9,174 sq mi) in Europe.
Turkey is the 37th largest country in the world by area, and its parts are as large as the European parts of France and Great Britain combined.
Turkey is surrounded by sea in three directions: the Aegean Sea in the west, the Black Sea in the north and the Mediterranean Sea in the south.
Luxembourg has a long history, but it only became independent in 1839.
Part of present-day Belgium used to be part of Luxembourg, but was transferred to Belgium after its revolution in the 1830s.
Luxembourg has always tried to remain a neutral country, but was occupied by Germany in both World War I and World War II.
In 1957, Luxembourg became a founding member of the organization now known as the European Union.
Drukgyalin Dzong is a ruined fort and Buddhist monastery in the highlands of Paro district in Phondey village.
Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel is said to have founded the fort in 1649 to commemorate the victory he had over a Tibetan and Mongol army.‎
Due to a fire in 1951, only some of the relics of the Drukyali dzong remain, such as the image of zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal.
After the fire, the fort was left in its ruined state and protected, and remains one of Bhutan&#39;s most impressive sights.
In the 18th century, Cambodia was squeezed by its two powerful neighbors, Thailand and Vietnam.
The Thais invaded Cambodia several times in the 18th century and in 1772 they destroyed Phnom Phen.
In the late 18th century, the Vietnamese also attacked Cambodia.
Eighteen percent of Venezuelans are unemployed, and most of those employed work in the informal economy.
Two-thirds of working Venezuelans are in the service sector, almost a quarter in industry and a fifth in agriculture.
Oil is an important industry for Venezuelans. The country is a net exporter of oil, although only one percent works in the oil industry.
The expertise gained from the Singapore Botanic Gardens helped to turn the island into a true tropical garden city in the early years of independence.
The hybrid orchid vanda miss Joaquim was chosen as the country&#39;s national flower in 1981.
Almost 1.5 million herbivores migrate every year in October from the northern highlands over Marajoki ‎towards the southern plains for the rainy season.‎
And then through the west back to the north, again across Marajoki, after the rains end around April.
The Serengeti region includes the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania, the Ngorongoro Conservation Area and the Maswa Game Reserve, and the Masai Mara National Reserve in Kenya.
Interactive design requires familiar and traditional skills as well as tools learned in interactive courses (screenwriting, sound and image editing, storytelling, etc.).
Interactive design requires re-evaluating assumptions about media production and learning to think non-linearly.
Interactive design requires that the different areas of the project are connected to each other but also make sense as individual entities.
The disadvantage of zoom lenses is the complexity of the focal points and the number of lens elements needed to achieve the focal length scale is much greater than in fixed focal length lenses.
This is an increasingly rare problem as lens manufacturers get better quality in lens production.
Thanks to this, zoom lenses are able to produce images that are comparable in quality to images taken with a fixed focal length lens.
Another disadvantage of zoom lenses is that the aperture size (speed) of the lens is usually smaller.
Therefore, inexpensive zoom lenses are difficult to use in dim conditions without a flash.
When trying to convert movies to DVD, one of the most common problems is overscanning.
Most televisions are designed to please the general public.
That&#39;s why everything seen on TV has edges cut from the top, bottom and sides.
This ensures that the image fills the entire screen. It&#39;s called overscanning.
Unfortunately, when making a DVD recording, its edges will also likely be cut off, and if the video had subtitles too close to the bottom, they won&#39;t show up completely.
The traditional medieval castle has long inspired the imagination and conjured up images of tournaments, feasts and the chivalry of Arthurian stories.‎
Just standing in the middle of the thousand-year-old ruins, it&#39;s easy to imagine the sounds and smells of long-ago battles, almost hear the clatter of hooves on the cobblestones and smell the fear rising from the dungeons.
But is our imagination based on reality? Why were castles built in the first place? How were they designed and built?
Typical of its period, Kirby Muxloe Castle is more of a fortified house than an actual castle.
Its large, glazed windows and thin walls could not have withstood a determined attack for long.
When Lord Hastings began building it in the 1480s, the country was relatively peaceful and defense was only needed against the small bands of marauders roaming the country.
The balance of power was a system by which European countries tried to maintain the national independence of all European states.
The idea was that all European countries had to work to prevent one nation from becoming too powerful, and thus the countries&#39; governments often changed their alliances to maintain balance.
The War of the Spanish Succession was the first war whose main cause was the balance of power.
This marked an important change, because the European powers no longer had religious wars as an excuse. Therefore, the Thirty Years&#39; War was the last that can be called a religious war.
The Temple of Artemis in Ephesus was destroyed on July 21, 356 BC. Burned by Herostratos.
According to the story, his motivation was fame at any cost. The dismayed Ephesians declared that Herostratus&#39; name would never be remembered.
The Greek historian Strabo later mentioned the name, and that&#39;s how we know it today. The temple was destroyed on the same night that Alexander the Great was born.
Alexander, as king, offered to pay for the rebuilding of the temple, but the offer was rejected. Later, after Alexander&#39;s death, the temple was rebuilt in 323 BC.
Make sure your hand is as relaxed as possible, but still presses all the keys correctly. Also, try not to make a lot of extra movements with your fingers.
In this way, you will tire as little as possible. Remember that you don&#39;t have to press the keys hard for a higher volume like on a piano.
The accordion gets more volume when you use the bellows with higher pressure or speed.
Mysticism is the effort to connect with, identify with, or gain awareness of the highest reality, divinity, spiritual reality, or God.
A believer seeks direct experience, intuition or a deeper understanding of divine reality or a divine being or beings.
Followers engage in certain lifestyles or practices designed to promote such experiences.
Mysticism differs from other forms of religion and worship in that it emphasizes direct and personal experience of unique states of consciousness, especially those that are beautiful, insightful, Blissful, or even ecstatic in nature.
Sikhism is a religion from the Indian subcontinent. It originated in the Punjab region as a sect that broke away from the Hindu tradition in the 15th century.
Sikhs consider their faith a separate religion from Hinduism, although they recognize its Hindu roots and traditions.
Sikhs call their religion Gurmat, which is Punjabi for &quot;the way of the Guru&quot;. Gurus are a fundamental part of all Indian religions, but in Sikhism their importance is so great that it forms the core of Sikh beliefs.
The religion was founded in the 15th century by Guru Nanak (1469–1539). He was followed in order by nine other gurus.
However, Khrushchev&#39;s promises were put to the test in June 1956, when riots in Poland, where workers demonstrated against food shortages and wage cuts, turned into a general protest against communism.
Although Khrushchev eventually sent tanks to restore order, he gave in to some financial demands and agreed to appoint the popular Władysław Gomułka as the new prime minister.
The Indus Valley Civilization was a Bronze Age civilization in the northwestern part of the Indian subcontinent, comprising most of present-day Pakistan and parts of northwestern India and northeastern Afghanistan.
The civilization flourished in the Indus River Valley, which is where its name comes from.
Although some researchers think that the civilization should be more aptly called the Indus-Sarasvati culture, because it was also active in the Sarasvati river basin, which has now dried up, some call it the Harappan culture, because its first archaeological discoveries were made in the Harappa excavations in the 1920s.
The militaristic nature of the Roman Empire encouraged medical advancements.
Emperor Augustus began hiring doctors, and they even formed the first Roman medical corps for use in the aftermath of battles.
Surgeons were familiar with many different sedatives, such as morphine extracted from poppy seeds and scopolamine from wild cabbage seeds.
To save patients from gangrene, they became adept at amputation, as well as using tourniquets and forceps to staunch bleeding.
Over the course of several centuries, the Roman Empire saw great medical advances and collected much of our current knowledge.
Pureland origami has restrictions such that only one fold can be made at a time, more complex folds such as reverse folds are prohibited, and all folds have a straight line place.
John Smith developed it in the 1970s to help inexperienced artists and people with limited mobility.
Children&#39;s awareness of races and racial stereotypes develops at a very young age, and such racial stereotypes influence their behavior.
For example, children who identify as belonging to a racial minority that stereotypically does poorly in school begin to do worse in school after hearing about stereotypes about their race.
MySpace is the third most popular website in the United States and currently has 54 million profiles.
These websites have received a lot of attention, especially in the educational environment.
These websites have their advantages, among them the fact that you can easily create your own page for the class, which can include blogs, videos, photos and other things.
The site is easily accessed using just one web address, making it easy for students who may struggle with keyboarding or spelling to remember and type it.
It can be customized to be easy to read and as colorful or colorless as desired.
Attention deficit disorder is &quot;a neurological syndrome defined by the classic symptom triad of impulsivity, easily distracted, and hyperactivity or over-energy&quot;.
It is not a learning disability, but a learning disorder. It &quot;affects 3 to 5 percent of all children, perhaps as many as two million American children.&quot;
Children with ADHD have a hard time focusing on something like school, but they can focus on things they enjoy, such as playing games, watching their favorite cartoons, or writing sentences without punctuation.
These children often get into trouble because they &quot;behave at risk, get into fights and challenge authority figures&quot; to stimulate their brains, as their brains cannot be stimulated by normal means.
ADHD affects peer relationships because other children do not understand why they behave the way they do or speak the way they do or why they are at a different maturity level.
When the ability to acquire knowledge and learn changed as mentioned above, the basic level of knowledge acquisition changed.
The approach to acquiring information was different. The pressure was no longer on individual memorization, but began to focus more on the ability to remember the text.
Basically, the Renaissance brought about a significant change in the approach to learning and the dissemination of knowledge.
Unlike other primates, great apes no longer use their arms for locomotion, weight bearing, or swinging in trees.
A chimpanzee&#39;s hand and foot are the same size and length, which suggests that weight is reserved for the hand in knuckle walking.
The human hand is shorter than the leg, and its finger bones are straighter.
Two- to three-million-year-old hand bone fossils reveal this change from movement to use in the specialization of the hand.
Some believe that seeing many artificially induced lucid dreams too often can be very exhausting.
The main reason for the phenomenon is the lengthening of the periods between REM stages as a result of lucid sleep.
When there are fewer REM phases during the night, the state in which you actually sleep and during which the body recovers becomes so irregular that it becomes a problem.
It&#39;s just as exhausting as waking up every twenty or thirty minutes to watch TV.
The effect depends on how many times a night your brain tries to see the light.
The Italians did poorly in North Africa almost from the beginning. A week after Italy&#39;s declaration of war on June 10, 1940, the 11th Hussar Regiment of the British Army had captured the Capuzzo fort in Libya.
In an ambush east of Bardia, the British captured General Lastucci, the commander of the pioneer forces of the Italian Tenth Army.
Marshal Italo Balbo, Governor-General of Libya and potential successor to Mussolini, died on June 28 under fire from his own troops while landing in Tobruk.
Fencing is practiced as a modern sport at many different levels, from university students to professional competitions and the Olympics.
The sport is mainly practiced as a duel, one fencer against another.
Golf is a game where players use clubs to hit balls into holes.
In a regular round, eighteen holes are played so that players usually start on the first hole of the course and finish on the eighteenth.
The player who needs the fewest strokes to complete the course wins.
The game is played on grass. The grass surrounding the hole is cut shorter and is called the putting green.
Perhaps the most common type of tourism is the one most people associate with travel: recreational tourism.
In it, people leave their regular everyday life to a very different place to relax and have fun.
Sandy beaches, amusement parks and camping grounds are often the most popular places for recreational tourists.
If the purpose of a visit to a certain place is to get to know its history and culture, then that type of tourism is known as cultural tourism.
Tourists may visit different destinations in a given country or they may focus on only one area.
The colonists had also called for reinforcements when they saw this happening.
Reinforcing the forward positions were the 200-man 1st and 3rd New Hampshire regiments under Colonels John Stark and James Reed (both later to become generals).
Stark&#39;s men took up positions by the fence at the north end of the colonists&#39; position.
When the low tide opened an opening along the Mystic River on the northeast side of the peninsula, they quickly extended the fence to the north with a short stone wall that ended at the water&#39;s edge at a small beach.
Gridley or Stark drove a stake into the ground about 100 feet (30 m) in front of the fence and ordered that no one could fire until the British soldiers had passed it.
The American plan relied on launching coordinated attacks from three different directions.
General John Cadwalder was to launch a diversionary attack against the British garrison at Bordentown to cut off any possible reinforcements.
General James Erwing would lead 700 troops across the river at Trenton&#39;s Ferry, capture the bridge over Assunpink Creek, and prevent the enemy forces from escaping.
The main body of the raiders, 2,400 men, would cross the river nine miles north of Trenton and then split into two groups, one led by Greene and the other by Sullivan, to begin the attack before dawn.
When moving from a quarter mile to a half mile run, speed becomes less important and endurance becomes absolutely essential.
Of course, a first-class half-mile runner, a man whose time is under two minutes, must be quite fast, but endurance must also be developed by all means.
The best preparation for the running season is some cross-country running during the winter, combined with upper body gym exercises.
Appropriate nutritional practices alone cannot bring about elite performances, but they can significantly affect the general well-being of young athletes.
Maintaining a healthy energy balance, practicing effective hydration practices, and understanding the different aspects of using nutritional supplements can help athletes improve their performance and enjoy sports more.
Middle distance running is a relatively cheap sport, but there are many misconceptions about the minimal equipment required to participate.
Products can be purchased as needed, but most have little or no real effect on performance.
Athletes may feel that they like a product more, even though it is not really useful.
An atom can be considered one of the basic parts of all matter.
It is a very complex entity, and according to Bohr&#39;s simplified model, it consists of a central nucleus around which the electrons orbit somewhat in the same way as the planets orbit the sun (see Figure 1.1).
The nucleus consists of two types of particles: neutrons and protons.
Protons have a positive electrical charge, neutrons have no charge. The electric charge of electrons is negative.
Make sure the scene is safe before checking the injured person&#39;s condition.
When approaching the injured person, note their position and other obvious signs of danger.
If you hurt yourself while helping, you might just make the situation worse.
The study found that depression, fear and catastrophizing act as mediators of the relationship between pain and disability in low back pain sufferers.
Only those affected by the disaster were allowed to participate in the weekly structured physical activity sessions. Suffering from depression and fear was not a sufficient condition.
Those participating in regular activities needed more support regarding the negative perception of pain in order to distinguish chronic pain from discomfort caused by normal physical movement.
The sense of sight, or the ability to see, depends on the sensory organs of the visual system, i.e. the eyes.
There are several different structures of the eye, and their complexity varies according to the needs of the organism.
Different structures have different abilities, they are sensitive to different wavelengths and their sharpness varies. They also need different processing skills to interpret the seen input and different amounts to work as well as possible.
A population is the total number of organisms of a certain species in a certain geographical area.
When all individuals in a population are identical for a particular phenotypic characteristic, they are called monomorphic.
When individuals show multiple variations of a particular trait, they are polymorphic.
Colonies of migrant ants also march and nest in different phases.
During the migration phase, migrant ants march at night and stop at a camp during the day.
The colony starts the migration phase when the available food has decreased. During this phase, the colony makes temporary nests that change daily.
Each of these hiking battles or marches lasts about 17 days.
What is a cell? The word cell, used in many languages, comes from the Latin word &quot;cella&quot;, which means a small room. It was developed by a microscope user who studied the structure of the cap.
A cell is the basic unit of all living things, and all living things consist of one or more cells.
Cells are so fundamental and essential to the study of life that they are often called the building blocks of life.
The nervous system maintains homeostasis by sending nerve impulses throughout the body to keep blood flowing and undisturbed.
These nerve impulses can be sent very quickly throughout the body, keeping it safe from potential threats.
Tornadoes affect a small area compared to other violent storms, but they can destroy everything in their path.
Tornadoes tear trees from the ground with their roots, remove boards from houses and throw cars into the sky. The most violent two percent of tornadoes last more than three hours.
The winds of these superstorms can reach up to 480 kilometers per hour (133 meters per second or 300 miles per hour).
People have been making and using lenses for magnification for thousands and thousands of years.
However, the first real telescopes were made in Europe at the end of the 16th century.
Telescopes used a combination of two lenses to make objects appear both closer and larger.
There will always be greed and selfishness. It is also characteristic of cooperation that when acting for the interests of the majority, in the short term selfish action produces the most benefit for the individual.
Hopefully, most people realize that in the long run, their best bet is to cooperate with others.
Many dream of the day when people can travel to other stars and explore other worlds. Some wonder what&#39;s in there. Some believe that there may be aliens or other life on other planets.
If this ever happens, it probably won&#39;t be for a long time. The stars are so far apart that &quot;neighboring stars&quot; are trillions of miles apart.
Perhaps one day your great-grandchildren will stand in an unknown world and think about their ancient ancestors.
Animals consist of many cells. They eat food and digest it inside. Most animals can move.
Only animals have brains (although not all animals do - jellyfish, for example, do not have brains).
Animals can be found in every corner of the world. They burrow into the ground, swim in the sea and fly in the sky.
A cell is the smallest structural and functional unit of an organism (living being).
In many languages, the origin of the word cell is the Latin word cella, which means a small room.
If you look at living things under a microscope, you will see that they are made up of small squares or spheres.
The English biologist Robert Hooke saw small squares in the cork when he looked at it under a microscope.
They looked like rooms. He was the first to observe dead cells
Elements and compounds can change from one form to another and still not change.
Gaseous nitrogen has the same properties as liquid nitrogen. The liquid state is denser, but the molecules are still the same.
Water is another example. Water is a compound consisting of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.
It has the same molecular structure as a gas, liquid and solid.
Although its physical state may change, its chemical state remains the same.
Time is all around us and affects everything we do, yet it is difficult to understand.
Practitioners of religion, philosophy and natural sciences have studied time for thousands of years.
We experience time as a series of events that go from the future through the present to the past.
We also use time to compare the duration of events.
You can notice the passage of time yourself by observing how the cyclical event repeats itself. A cyclical event is one that occurs regularly over and over again.
Today, computers are used to process images and videos.
Advanced animations can be done on a computer, and such animations are increasingly used in television and movies.
Music is often recorded using highly developed computers. They are used to process sounds and mix sounds together.
In the 19th and 20th centuries, the first inhabitants of New Zealand were long believed to be Maori who hunted giant birds called moa.
After that, the theory established the idea that Maori moved from Polynesia to the so-called as a large fleet, took over New Zealand from the Moriori and established an agricultural society.
However, in the light of new evidence, it appears that the Moriori were a group of Maori living on the mainland who migrated from New Zealand to the Chatham Islands and formed their own peaceful culture there.
There was also another tribe in the Chatham Islands. These were Maori people who had emigrated from New Zealand.
They called themselves the Moriori. A few skirmishes took place, and eventually the Moriori were completely exterminated
People who had been involved for several dozen years helped us to appreciate our strengths and passions while also openly assessing our difficulties and even our failures.
Listening to individuals share their own, family and company stories, we gained valuable insight into the past and certain individuals who positively or negatively influenced the culture of the organization.
Although understanding one&#39;s own history does not require understanding the culture, it at least helps people get a sense of their own place in the organization&#39;s history.
When evaluating successes and becoming aware of failures, individuals and all participants as a whole learn more deeply about the values, tasks and driving forces of the organization.
In this case, remembering past instances of entrepreneurial behavior and subsequent success helped people to be open to new changes and a new direction for the local church.
Such success stories reduced the fear of change and created positive perceptions of future changes.
Convergent thinking models are problem-solving techniques that combine different ideas or fields to find a solution.
At the center of this way of thinking are speed, logic and accuracy, as well as fact-finding, reuse of existing technologies and data collection.
The most important factor in this way of thinking is: there is only one right answer. Let&#39;s think of only two answers, namely right or wrong.
This type of thinking is associated with certain scientific or standard procedures.
People with this mindset think logically, are able to memorize repetitive patterns, solve problems, and work on scientific experiments.
Humans are by far the most gifted species when it comes to reading other people&#39;s minds.
In other words, we can successfully predict what other people understand, mean, believe, know or want.
In addition to these skills, it is very important to understand other people&#39;s intentions. This way we can solve the possible ambiguity of physical actions.
For example, if you see someone breaking a car window, you probably assume they are trying to steal a stranger&#39;s car.
His actions need to be evaluated differently if he has lost his car keys and is trying to break into his own car.
MRI is based on a physics phenomenon called nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), which was discovered in the 1930s by Felix Bloch (while working at Stanford University) and Edward Purcell (at Harvard University).
In this resonance, the magnetic field and radio waves cause the atoms to emit very small radio signals.
In 1970, physician and researcher Raymond Damadian discovered how MRI can be used to make medical diagnoses.
The patent was granted four years later. It was the first patent granted in the field of MRI.
In 1977, Damadian finished building his first &quot;full body&quot; MRI machine, which he named Indomitable.
Asynchronous communication allows time to think and react to others.
It allows students to work at their own pace and control the pace of the instructions they receive.
In addition, there are fewer time constraints, and flexible working hours are possible (Bremer 1998).
Using the Internet and web content allows learners to access information at any time.
Students can also send questions to tutors at any time of the day and get relatively quick answers instead of waiting for the next face-to-face meeting.
A postmodern approach to learning frees you from absolutes. There isn&#39;t just one good way to learn.
In fact, there isn&#39;t even one good thing to learn. Learning is an experience between the learner and the presented information.
Our current experience with all the do-it-yourself programs and informative, learning-based television programs illustrates the point.
Far too many of us find ourselves watching a television program that tells us about some process or experience that we never participate in or make use of that information.
We never restore a car, build a fountain in the backyard, travel to Peru to explore ancient ruins, or renovate a neighbor&#39;s house.
Thanks to undersea fiber-optic cable connections to Europe and broadband satellite, Greenland is well connected, with 93 percent of the population having Internet access.
Your hotel or your hosts (if you&#39;re staying in a guest house or a private apartment) probably have WiFi or a computer connected to the Internet, and all population centers have an Internet cafe or a place with a public WiFi network.
As mentioned above, although the word Eskimo is still accepted in the United States, it is considered derogatory by many Arctic peoples outside the United States, especially Canada.
You may hear Greenlandic natives use this word, but foreigners should still avoid using it.
The natives of Greenland call themselves Inuit in Canada, and in Greenland they use the word kalaalleq (plural kalaalls), Greenlander.
Crime and generally bad intentions towards foreigners are practically unknown in Greenland. Even in cities there are no &quot;disreputable areas&quot;.
Cold weather is perhaps the only real danger the unprepared face.
If you are visiting Greenland during the cold season (also bearing in mind that it is the coldest in the northern parts), it is absolutely important to bring enough warm clothing.
The long days of summer may cause difficulties in getting enough sleep and related health problems.
In summer, you should also watch out for mosquitoes. Although they do not carry diseases, they can be annoying.
Although San Francisco&#39;s economy is tied to its status as a world-class tourist destination, its economic life is very diverse.
The largest employers are professional services, administration, finance, trade and tourism.
The city&#39;s repeated appearance in music, movies, literature and popular culture has made it and its landmarks known all over the world.
San Francisco has developed a large tourism infrastructure, which includes many hotels, restaurants and top-class convention centers.
San Francisco is also one of the best places in the country to explore other Asian cuisines: Korean, Thai, Indian and Japanese.
Traveling to Walt Disney World is an important pilgrimage for many American families.
A typical visit involves a flight to Orlando International Airport, a bus ride to a Disney hotel on the theme park grounds, a stay of about a week without leaving Disney land, and then returning home.
There are an endless number of different options to do this, but this is what most people mean when they talk about &quot;going to Disney World&quot;.
Many of the tickets sold through online auctions such as eBay or Craigslist are multi-day, multi-park tickets that have already been partially used.
This is done very commonly, but Disney has forbidden it: tickets cannot be transferred to another person.
Camping below the rim of the Grand Canyon requires a camping permit.
Permits are limited in order to protect the canyon and become available on the first day of the month four months prior to the start month.
In other words, a camping permit for a May start date will become available on January 1st.
The most popular areas, such as Bright Angel Campground next to Phantom Ranch, usually fill up on the first day they open for reservations.
A limited number of permits are reserved for those arriving without a reservation, which are granted in order of arrival.
Traveling to South Africa by car is a great way to see the beauty of the entire region and get to places off the beaten tourist track.
It can be done in a normal car if the trip is carefully planned, but four-wheel drive is highly recommended, and many destinations can only be reached by a four-wheel drive vehicle with high ground clearance.
When planning your trip, remember that although the situation in South Africa is stable, not all neighboring countries are.
Visa requirements and costs vary between countries, and your country of origin has a bearing.
Each country also has its own laws on what mandatory equipment must be in the car.
Victoria Falls is a city in the western part of Zimbabwe. Livingstone is across the border in Zambia, and Botswana is also nearby.
The town is located right next to the falls, and they are the main attraction. Still, the popular tourist destination offers plenty of opportunities for longer stays for those who are hungry for adventure and admirers of sights.
During the rainy season (November to March), the amount of water is greater and the falls look more dramatic.
You will definitely get wet if you cross the bridge or walk along the winding paths near the falls.
On the other hand, you still can&#39;t see the falls themselves very well - all that water gets in the way!
Tomb of Tutankhamun (KV62). KV62 may be the most famous of all the tombs in the valley, the site where Howard Carter in 1922 discovered the nearly intact royal tomb of the young pharaoh.
However, compared to most other royal tombs, Tutankhamun&#39;s tomb is barely worth a visit because it is much smaller and less decorated.
Anyone who wants to see traces of the damage done to the mummy when it was tried to remove it from its coffin will be disappointed, as only its head and shoulders are visible.
The great riches of the tomb are no longer in their former place, but have been taken to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.
Visitors with limited time should spend their time elsewhere.
Phnom Krom, 12 km southwest of Siem Reap. This hilltop temple was built in the late 8th century during the reign of King Yasovarman.
The dim atmosphere of the temple and the view over the Tonle Sap lake make climbing the hill worth the effort.
The trip to the place can conveniently be combined with a boat trip to the lake.
You need an Angkor passport to enter the temple, so don&#39;t forget to take your country&#39;s passport with you when you head to Tonle Sap lake.
Jerusalem is the capital and largest city of Israel, although most other countries and the United Nations do not recognize it as Israel&#39;s capital.
The ancient city in the Judean hills has a fascinating history that spans thousands of years.
The city is sacred to the three monotheistic religions, Judaism, Christianity and Islam, and serves as a spiritual, religious and cultural center.
Because of its religious significance and especially because of the many attractions located in the old city, Jerusalem is one of the most important tourist destinations in Israel.
Jerusalem has many historical, archaeological and cultural sites, as well as shopping centers, cafes and restaurants bursting with life and people.
Ecuador requires Cuban citizens to have received a letter of invitation before entering Ecuador through international airports or land checkpoints.
The letter must be legalized by the Ecuadorian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and must meet certain requirements.
The requirements are intended to make the migration flow between the countries systematic.
Cuban citizens with US work and residence permits should visit the Ecuadorian consulate to obtain a waiver from this requirement.
The passport must be valid for at least 6 months after the trip. To prove the length of stay, you need a return ticket or a connecting ticket.
Tours are cheaper for large groups, so if you are traveling alone or with just one friend, try to get to know other people and form a group of 4-6 people for a better individual price.
However, you probably don&#39;t need to worry about this, as travelers are often moved from car to car to fill all the seats.
It seems to be more of a way to trick people into believing they have to pay more.
Above the northern part of Machu Picchu rises this steep mountain, which is often seen in the background of photographs taken of the ruins.
It looks a little scary from the bottom, and the climb is steep and difficult, but those in reasonably good shape should be able to make it in about 45 minutes.
The path is mostly covered with stone steps, and the steeper parts are supported by a railing made of steel wire.
Even so, you can expect to be short of breath, and you should be careful on the steeper sections, especially in wet weather, as the trail can quickly become dangerous.
There is a small cave near the top that you have to walk through. It is quite low and quite cramped.
The sites and fauna of the Galapagos Islands are best seen by boat, just as Charles Darwin did in 1835.
More than 60 cruise ships operate in the waters of the Galapagos Islands, and their size varies from eight to a hundred passengers.
Most people book well in advance (as ships are usually full during high season).
Make sure the clerk you book through is a Galapagos expert who knows a lot about the different ships.
This ensures that you find a ship that best suits your interests and/or limitations.
Before the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century, northern Chile was under Inca rule, and the indigenous Araucanians (Mapuche) inhabited central and southern Chile.
The Mapuche were also one of the last independent indigenous peoples of the Americas, and had not been fully subjugated to Spanish-speakers before Chile&#39;s independence.
Although Chile declared independence in 1810 (during the Napoleonic Wars, which left Spain without a functioning central government for a few years), the final victory over Spain was not achieved until 1818.
The Dominican Republic (República Dominicana in Spanish) is a country in the Caribbean Sea that forms the eastern side of the island of Hispaniola, which it shares with Haiti.
Along with white sandy beaches and mountain scenery, the country has the oldest European city in the Americas, which is now part of Santo Domingo.
The Tainos and Caribs were the first inhabitants of the island. The Caribs were an Arawak-speaking people who had come to the island around 10,000 BC.
The Spanish conquistadors had greatly reduced the Taino population within just a few years of the arrival of European explorers
According to the Dominican friar Bartolomé de las Casas (Tratado de las Indias), between 1492 and 1498, the Spanish conquerors killed about 100,000 Tainos.
Jardín de la Union. The space was built as an atrium for a 17th-century monastery, whose only remaining building is the Templo de San Diego.
It now serves as a central square, and there is always a lot of activity around the clock.
Several restaurants surround the garden, and on many afternoons and evenings free concerts are organized in the main gazebo.
Callejon del Beso (Alley of the Kiss). An old love story is told about two balconies, only 69 centimeters apart.
Children tell the whole story in exchange for a few coins.
Bowen Island is a popular day and weekend destination with kayaking, camping, shopping, restaurants and more.
The authentic community is located on Howensalme just outside of Vancouver and is easily accessible by regular water taxis that depart from Granville Island in downtown Vancouver.
For outdoor enthusiasts, a trip to the mountains along the Sea-to-Sky Corridor is a must.
Whistler (an hour and a half drive from Vancouver) is expensive but famous for hosting the 2010 Winter Olympics.
In winter, you can enjoy skiing conditions that are among the best in North America, and in summer, you can try authentic mountain biking.
Permits must be booked in advance. A permit is required to stay overnight in Sirena.
Sirena is the only park ranger station that offers, in addition to camping, accommodation in dormitories and hot meals. La Leona, San Pedrillo and Los Patos only offer camping without food services.
Park permits can be obtained directly from the Puerto Jiménez Forestry Center, but you cannot pay by credit card there
The park service (MINAE) issues park permits no more than one month before the intended arrival time.
CafeNet El Sol offers reservations for US$30 or day passes for US$10. More detailed information can be found on its Corcovado page.
The Cook Islands is an island nation located in Polynesia, in the South Pacific Ocean. It is an associate state of New Zealand.
It is an archipelago of 15 islands in an ocean area of more than 2.2 million square kilometers.
Because the islands are in the same time zone as Hawaii, they are sometimes called the Hawaii of the Southern Hemisphere.
Although smaller than Hawaii, they remind some older visitors of Hawaii before it became a state and before all the big tourist hotels and other developments.
The Cook Islands do not have a single city, but consist of fifteen different islands. The main islands are Rarotonga and Aitutaki.
Today, in developed countries, offering luxury bed and breakfast accommodation has become something of an art form.
Of course, the best B&amp;Bs compete mainly in two main areas: accommodation and breakfast.
So at best such places can have really luxurious sleeping conditions, for example a handmade blanket or an antique bed.
Breakfast may include seasonal delicacies or some bravura of the host.
The environment can be an old historic building with antique furniture, trimmed lawns and a swimming pool.
Getting into your own car and going on a long journey is inherently attractive in all its simplicity.
Driving your own car is probably already familiar to you, and you know its limitations, unlike big vehicles.
Pitching a tent on private property or in a city of any size can easily attract unwanted attention.
In short, your own car is suitable for road trips, but less often it can be used for actual camping.
Car camping is possible if you have a large minivan, SUV, sedan, or station wagon with horizontal seats.
Some of the hotels date back to the golden age of steam trains and ocean liners, the 1800s or the early 1900s, before World War II.
The rich and famous of the time stayed in these hotels, and they often featured gourmet food and nightlife.
The old-fashioned setting, the absence of the most modern amenities and a certain dignified age are also part of their nature.
They are usually privately owned, but sometimes they host visiting heads of state and other dignitaries.
A traveler with heaps of cash might consider a round-the-world flight punctuated by visits to several of these hotels.
A hospitality network is an organization that connects travelers with local residents in the cities they plan to visit.
You can usually join such a network only by filling out an online form, although some networks offer or require additional confirmation.
A list of available accommodations is then organized on paper and/or online, and sometimes includes recommendations and reviews from other travelers.
CouchSurfing was founded in January 2004 when computer programmer Casey Fenton found a cheap flight to Iceland but no place to stay.
He emailed students at the local university and received a flood of offers for free accommodation.
Hostels are mainly for young travelers – a typical guest is in their twenties – but you can often find older travelers as well.
Families with children are a rare sight, but some hostels welcome them in private rooms.
The Chinese city of Beijing will host the Winter Olympics in 2022. Thus, it will become the first city to host both the Summer and Winter Olympics.
Opening and closing ceremonies and indoor ice events are organized in Beijing.
Other skiing events will be held at the Taizicheng Ski Area in Zhangjiakou, located about 220 kilometers (140 miles) from Beijing.
Most temples hold an annual festival between late November and mid-May. The time depends on each temple&#39;s own annual calendar.
Most temple festivals are held as part of its anniversary, the birthday of the temple&#39;s supreme deity, or any other important temple-related event.
Kerala temple festivals are really interesting to watch as they include decorated elephants in regular procession, temple orchestra and other festivities.
The World&#39;s Fair (sometimes also called Expo) is a large international art and science event.
Participating countries organize artistic and cultural exhibitions in their national pavilions, where global issues or the culture and history of their own country are highlighted.‎
International garden shows are specialized events that highlight flower arrangements, Botanical gardens and everything else related to plants.
Although in theory they can be organized every year (as long as they are held in different countries), in practice this does not happen.
Such events usually last three to six months and are organized on areas of at least 50 hectares.
Over the years, several different film types have been used. Standard 35 millimeter film (36 × 24 mm as a negative) is clearly the most common.
A new one can usually be easily replaced if it wears out, and its image resolution is somehow comparable to current digital SLR cameras.
Some medium format film cameras use a 6 × 6 centimeter image size, more specifically a 56 × 56 millimeter negative.
Thanks to this, the resolution is almost four times that of a 35 mm negative (3136 mm2 vs. 864).
Wild animals are one of the most challenging subjects for a photographer, and successfully photographing them requires good luck, patience, experience and good equipment.
Photographing wildlife is often taken for granted, but, as with photography in general, a picture is worth a thousand words.
Wildlife photography often requires a long telephoto lens, but some subjects, such as flocks of birds and small animals, require other lenses.
Many exotic animals are difficult to find, and parks sometimes have rules against taking pictures for commercial purposes.
Wild animals can be either timid or aggressive. The environment may be cold, hot or otherwise unpleasant.
More than 5,000 different languages are spoken in the world. More than twenty have at least 50 million speakers.
Similarly, the printed word is often easier to understand than the spoken word. This is especially true for street addresses, which are often difficult to pronounce intelligibly.
Many entire nations speak English perfectly fluently, and even more can be expected to have at least a limited ability – especially among young people.
Imagine, for example, a Manchester, Bostonian, Jamaican and Sydneysider having dinner at a table in a Toronto restaurant.
They regale each other with stories about their hometowns and tell them in their own accents and local slang.
Buying food from a convenience store is usually the cheapest way to get fed. However, without cooking options, the options are limited to ready meals.
The range of prepared meals in convenience stores is starting to diversify more and more. Some even have a microwave oven or other ways to heat food.
Some countries or store types have at least one restaurant, often quite casual and reasonably priced.
Take copies of your insurance policies and keep them and your insurance company&#39;s contact information with you.
They must show the insurer&#39;s e-mail address and international phone numbers for advice or authorization and making claims.
Keep one copy also with your luggage and online (send it to yourself as an e-mail attachment or store it in a cloud service).
If you are traveling with a laptop or tablet, store one song in its memory or on a disk (available without an internet connection).
Also give copies of the insurance and contact information to your fellow travelers and relatives or friends staying at home who are willing to help.
Moose are not naturally aggressive, but defend themselves when they suspect danger.
When people do not perceive moose as potentially dangerous, they may approach them too closely and put themselves at risk.
Enjoy alcoholic beverages in moderation. Alcohol affects everyone differently, and it&#39;s important to know your limits.
Long-term effects of excessive alcohol consumption can include liver damage and even blindness and death. The risk of danger increases when consuming illegally produced alcohol.
Illegal spirits can contain various dangerous impurities, for example methanol, which even in small doses can cause blindness or death.
Eyeglasses can be cheaper abroad, especially in low-income countries where labor costs are lower.
It is worth getting an eye examination at home, especially if the insurance covers it, and take the prescription with you to pick up elsewhere.
Luxury brand frames available from such regions may have two problems: some may be fakes, and genuine imported frames may be more expensive than at home.
Coffee is one of the most sold commodities in the world, and you can probably find many different types already in your area.
Nevertheless, there are many unique ways of drinking coffee in different parts of the world that are worth experiencing.
Canyoning means going to the bottom of a canyon, either dry or filled with water.
Canyoning combines elements from swimming, climbing and jumping, but getting started requires relatively little training or physical fitness (compared to, for example, rock climbing, scuba diving or alpine skiing).
Hiking is an outdoor hobby that consists of walking in a natural environment, often on hiking trails.
Day hiking refers to distances that vary from less than a mile to longer distances, if they can be covered in one day.
Day hiking on an easy route requires very little preparation and is suitable for anyone of moderate fitness.
Those traveling with small children may need more preparation, but a day outside is easily doable even with babies and toddlers.
There are nearly 200 running organizations that organize city tours worldwide. Most of them operate independently.
The successor to Global Running Tours, Go Running Tours is a network of dozens of sightseeing run organizers operating on four different continents.
It started from Barcelona&#39;s Running Tours Barcelona and Copenhagen&#39;s Running Copenhagen. Prague&#39;s Running Tours Prague quickly joined in as well.
There are several things you need to consider both before you travel somewhere and while you travel.
When you travel, don&#39;t expect things to be the same as at home. The customs, laws, food, transport, accommodation, quality levels, language etc. differ to some extent from those where you live.
This should always be kept in mind in order to avoid disappointment or perhaps even aversion to local practices.
Travel agencies have existed since the 19th century. A travel agency is usually a good choice for a trip that exceeds the traveler&#39;s previous experience of nature, cultures, languages or low-income countries.
While most travel agents are happy to accept most standard bookings, many specialize in certain types of trips, price ranges or destinations.
It may be better to use an agent who often books trips similar to the one you are going on.
See either on the website or in the store window what kind of trips the representative offers.
If you want to see the world cheaply - whether the reason is necessity, lifestyle or the fact that you want a challenge - there are ways to do that.
In practice, they fall into two categories: you can either work while traveling or try to limit your expenses. This article focuses on the latter.
For those who are willing to sacrifice comfort, time and predictability to reduce expenses to close to zero, check out minimal budget travel.
The advice assumes that travelers do not steal, break into unauthorized places, operate in the black market, beg or otherwise take advantage of people.
The immigration checkpoint is usually the first stop after disembarking from a plane, ship or other vehicle.
On some foreign trains, checks are carried out while the train is in motion, and you must have a valid ID with you when boarding such a train.
On night trains, the conductor may collect the passports so that you don&#39;t have to disturb your sleep.
Registration is an additional requirement of the visa procedure. In some countries, you need to inform the local authorities of your arrival and the address where you are staying.
Requirements may include filling out a form at the local police station or visiting the immigration office.
In many countries where such a law is in force, local hotels handle the registration (it&#39;s worth asking to make sure).
In other cases, only those staying outside tourist accommodation have to register. However, this makes the law much more unclear, so it is worth clarifying the matter in advance.
Architecture is about designing and constructing buildings. The architecture of a travel destination is often an attraction in itself.
Many buildings are very beautiful to look at, and the view from a tall building or a cleverly placed window can be eye-catching.
Architecture has considerable overlap with other fields such as urban planning, construction engineering, decorative arts, interior design and landscape design.
Considering how remote several of the pueblos are, you won&#39;t find a more substantial nightlife without going to Albuquerque or Santa Fe.
However, almost all of the casinos listed above serve drinks, and several also offer branded entertainment (especially the larger casinos in the immediate vicinity of Albuquerque and Santa Fe).
Beware: bars in small towns around here are not always the best places to hang out for locals.
First, drunk driving is a significant problem in northern New Mexico, with significant concentrations of drunk drivers near small-town bars.
Murals or graffiti that are unwanted are known as graffiti.
While it&#39;s certainly not a new phenomenon, most people probably associate it with youth vandalism of public and private property with spray paint.
However, today there are already established graffiti artists, graffiti events and &quot;legitimate&quot; walls. In this context, graffiti paintings often resemble art instead of illegible tags.
Boomerang throwing is a popular skill that many travelers want to learn.
If you want to learn how to throw a boomerang so that it returns to your hand, make sure you have a boomerang suitable for this purpose.
Most boomerangs available in Australia don&#39;t actually come back. It is best for beginners not to try casting in windy conditions
A hangi meal is prepared in a hot earth pit.
The pit is heated either with hot stones taken from the campfire, or in some places the ground heat heats some parts of the soil naturally.
Hangi is often used to prepare a traditional barbecue-style dinner.
Several places in Rotorua offer ground-heated hangi. Another kind of hangi can be tasted in Christchurch, Wellington and elsewhere.
MetroRail has two classes for commuter trains in and around Cape Town: MetroPlus (also called first class) and Metro (called third class).
MetroPlus is more comfortable and less cramped, but it is slightly more expensive. On the other hand, it is still cheaper than normal metro tickets in Europe.
Each train has both MetroPlus and Metro carriages. MetroPlus carriages are always at the Cape Town end of the train.
Carrying on behalf of others - Never let your bags out of your sight, especially when crossing borders between countries.
You may find yourself unknowingly becoming a drug smuggler, which will cause you some really bad problems.
It involves standing in line, as drug dogs can be used at any time without warning.
In some countries, extremely harsh punishments are given even to first-timers. Such can be a prison sentence of more than 10 years or death.
Unguarded bags are vulnerable to theft and can also attract the attention of the authorities, who are on alert due to bomb threats.
There is a very high probability that you will be immune to the bacteria in your home area because you are constantly exposed to them.
But in other parts of the world, where the bacterial strain is unknown to you, you are much more likely to encounter problems.
In addition, in a warmer atmosphere, bacteria both grow faster and survive longer outside the body.
And that&#39;s how we get motion sickness, or Delhi&#39;s stomach, Pharaoh&#39;s curse, Montezuma&#39;s revenge, and their many different friends.
Like respiratory problems in cold air, intestinal problems in hot air are quite common and in most cases are undeniably embarrassing, but not really dangerous.
If you&#39;re traveling to a developing country for the first time – or to a previously unknown corner of the world – don&#39;t underestimate the possibility of culture shock.
The novelty of developing world tourism has surprised many seasoned and knowledgeable travelers. In world travel, small cultural adaptations have to be made all the time.
Especially in the first few days, to make it easier to adapt, you should stick to hotels, food and services that represent Western style and quality.
Don&#39;t sleep on the ground on a mattress or sleeping pad in places where you don&#39;t know the fauna.
If you plan to camp outside, bring a field bed or hammock to stay out of reach of snakes and scorpions and such.
Enjoy rich coffee in the morning and relaxing chamomile tea in the evening.
When you&#39;re on vacation, you have time to pamper yourself and take a few extra minutes to brew something special.
If you&#39;re feeling more adventurous, take the opportunity to juice or mix up a couple of smoothies:
you can even find a simple drink that you can prepare for breakfast when you return to your daily routine.
If you live in a city with a diverse drinking culture, visit bars or pubs in areas you don&#39;t visit often.
FYI for those who are not familiar with the medical vocabulary: the words infectious disease and infectious disease have different meanings.
An infectious disease is a disease caused by a pathogen such as a virus, bacteria, fungus or other parasite.
A contagious disease is one that spreads easily by being around an infected person.
Many authorities require visitors coming to the country or residents leaving the country to take vaccinations against several different diseases.
The requirements may often depend on which countries the traveler has visited or plans to visit.
One of the great things about Charlotte, North Carolina is that there are many high-quality options for families with children.
Residents from other areas often cite family friendliness as the main reason for moving to the city, and many visitors think the city is easy to enjoy with children.
Over the past 20 years, the number of kid-friendly options outside of Charlotte&#39;s core has exploded.
Families don&#39;t usually use taxis in Charlotte, but they can be useful in some situations.
There is an additional charge for more than two passengers, so the option may be unnecessarily expensive.
Antarctica is the coldest place on Earth and surrounds the South Pole.
Tourist visits are expensive, require physical fitness, can only take place in summer from November to February, and are mostly limited to the peninsula, islands and the Ross Sea.
A few thousand staff members live in Antarctica during the summer in approximately fifty bases, which are mainly located in these areas. A small part of them live over the winter.
The interior of Antarctica is a desolate plain covered by a 2-3 kilometer thick layer of ice.
Sometimes you can get inland with specialized air tours for mountain climbing or traveling to the Pole. There is a large base at the South Pole.
The South Pole road is a 1,600 km long route to the pole from McMurdo station on the shores of the Ross Sea.
It is dense snow with cracks filled and marked with flags. The route can only be traversed by special tractors that pull sleds containing fuel and supplies behind them.
These are not very agile, so the route has to make a long detour around the Transantarctic Mountains to reach the plateau.
The most common cause of winter accidents is slippery roads, sidewalks, and especially stairs.
At a minimum, you need footwear with suitable soles. Summer shoes are usually very slippery on ice and snow, and some winter shoes are also lacking.
The pattern should be deep enough, 5 mm (1/5 inch) or more, and the material soft enough for cold temperatures.
Some shoes have studs, and for slippery surfaces, studded anti-skid pads are available to fit most shoes and boots. They are attached either to the heel and the sole of the shoe or only to the heel.
The heel should be low and wide. Sand, gravel or salt (calcium chloride) is often sprinkled on roads and paths to improve traction.
Avalanches are not unusual. Steep slopes can only support a certain amount of snow, and the amount that exceeds it comes down as an avalanche.
The problem is the stickiness of the snow, so it needs a stimulus to come down. And when some of the snow comes down, it might act as a stimulus for the rest of the snow.
Sometimes the event is triggered by the warming of the snow in the sun, sometimes by snowfall, sometimes by other natural events, often by humans.
A tornado is a rotating column of very low-pressure air that sucks the surrounding air inward and upward.
They generate strong winds (often 100 to 200 miles per hour) and can lift heavy objects into the air, taking them with them.
They start as funnels coming down from storm clouds and turn into tornadoes when they hit the ground.
Private VPN providers are an excellent way to circumvent both political censorship and commercial IP geofiltering.
They are better than proxies for several reasons: they reroute all Internet traffic, not just http traffic.
Their bandwidth is often higher and the service quality is better. They are encrypted and thus harder to spy on.
Media companies routinely lie about its purpose, claiming it is to &quot;prevent illegal copying&quot;.
In fact, region codes have no effect on illegal copying: an identical copy of the disc works just as well on the same devices as the original.
The actual purpose is to give the companies in question more power over their markets - it&#39;s all about the act of money.
Since the calls are routed through the Internet, you do not need to use the telephone operator of your place of residence or travel destination.
There is also no need to obtain the phone number of your place of residence. You can get an Internet connection via satellite in Chicken&#39;s desert fields in Alaska and dial a number that makes you think you&#39;re in the Arizona sunshine.
You often have to buy a global number separately in order to be able to call you from phones in the telephone network. Where the number is from matters to those who call you.
Real-time text translation applications - applications that are able to translate entire pieces of text from one language to another.
Some apps in this category can even translate foreign language text on signs or other real-world objects when the user points at them with their smartphone.
Translation machines have improved significantly and nowadays give a more or less correct translation (and less and less wrong), but it pays to be careful, because even a complete mistake is still possible.
One of the most prominent applications in this category is Google Translate, which enables offline translation after the information of the desired language has been downloaded to the device.
Using GPS navigation apps on your smartphone can be the easiest and most convenient way to navigate when you&#39;re not in your home country.
It can save you money compared to buying new maps for GPS positioning, buying a whole new GPS device or renting one from a car rental company.
If your phone does not have a data connection or when it is out of data range, their performance may be limited or non-existent.
Every corner kiosk has a bewildering array of prepaid calling cards that can be used for pay phones or regular phones.
Most cards are good for any calls, but some specialize in offering bargain-priced ‎calls to certain groups of countries.‎
Often these services are used from toll-free phone numbers, which can be called from most phones for free.‎
The rules of ordinary photography also apply to videography, perhaps even more so.
If taking a picture of something isn&#39;t allowed, you shouldn&#39;t even consider shooting a video.
If you plan to use a drone, check well in advance what you can film and what permits or other licenses are required.
Flying a drone near an airport or over a crowd is almost always a bad idea, even if it&#39;s not illegal in your area.
Today, flights are rarely booked directly with the airline before first searching and comparing prices.
Sometimes the prices of the same flight can differ significantly from each other on different aggregate search websites, and it is worth comparing the search results and also looking at the airline&#39;s own website before making a reservation.
Although some countries do not require a visa for short tourist or business trips, going there as an international student often requires a longer stay than as a casual traveler.
In general, spending an extended period of time in any foreign country requires obtaining a visa in advance.
Student visas generally have different requirements and different application processes than tourist and work visas.
In most countries, you need a letter offering a study place from the educational institution where you want to study, and you also have to prove that you can afford to support yourself for at least your first year of study.
Check the detailed requirements from the educational institution and the immigration authorities of the country you want to study.
Unless you are a diplomat, working abroad usually means that you have to pay income tax in your country of residence.
Income tax is created in different ways in different countries, and tax rates and tax categories vary greatly from country to country.
In some federal states, such as the United States and Canada, income tax is collected at both the federal and local levels, so tax rates and categories may vary from region to region.
Although when you return to your home country, the entry check is usually either absent or just a formality, the customs check can be troublesome.
Make sure you know what you can and can&#39;t bring into the country, and that you&#39;ll cross all legal import limits.
The easiest way to get started in travel writing is to hone your skills on an established travel blogging site.
Once you learn how to design and edit online, you can later create your own website.
Volunteering while traveling is a good way to make a difference, but it&#39;s not just about giving.
Living abroad while doing voluntary work is an excellent way to get to know another culture, meet new people, learn things about yourself, develop a sense of proportion and even gather new skills.
It can also be a good way to stretch the budget to allow for a longer stay, as many volunteer jobs include food and maintenance and some even pay a small salary.
The Vikings used Russian waterways to reach the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. Some of these routes can still be used. Check the possible need for special permits, which can be difficult to obtain.
The White Sea-Baltic Sea Canal connects the Arctic Ocean to the Baltic Sea via Ääninen, Laatoka and St. Petersburg, mostly along rivers and lakes.
Äänisjärvi is also connected to the Volga, so getting there from the Caspian Sea through Russia is still possible.
Rest assured, once you get to the marina, everything is pretty self-explanatory. You will meet other boat lifters and they will share their knowledge with you.
In practice, you post ads offering help, walk around docks, approach people cleaning their yachts, try to chat with sailors at the bar, etc.
Try to talk to as many people as possible. Soon everyone knows you and gives tips on which boat needs helpers.
You should carefully choose which of the airline alliance companies you choose for your frequent flyer program.‎
While you may think it makes sense to become a frequent flyer of the airline you fly with the most, you should know that the privileges offered often differ, and frequent flyers may receive more generous flight points from another airline in the same alliance.
Airlines such as Emirates, Etihad Airways, Qatar Airways and Turkish Airlines have greatly expanded their services to Africa and offer onward connections to many of Africa&#39;s major cities at more competitive prices than European airlines.
Turkish Airlines flies to 39 destinations in 30 African countries (as of 2014).
If you have extra travel time, it&#39;s worth checking how the total price of a trip to Africa compares to the price of a round-the-world trip.
Don&#39;t forget to add extras for additional visas, airport taxis, ground transportation, etc. in all those places outside of Africa.
If you want to fly around the world only in the southern hemisphere, the flights and destinations you can choose from are limited due to the lack of intercontinental routes.
No airline alliance covers all three ocean crossings in the Southern Hemisphere (and SkyTeam doesn&#39;t even cover the first of them).
However, Star Alliance covers everything except the eastern part of the South Pacific between Santiago de Chile and Tahiti. It is a Oneworld flight with LATAM.
This flight is not the only option if you want to avoid the South Pacific and the west coast of South America (see below).
In 1994, the ethnically Armenian Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan went to war against the Azeris.
A new republic was created with the support of the Armenians. No established state – not even Armenia – officially recognizes it.
Diplomatic disputes over control of the region continue to damage relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan.
The Canal District (Grachtengordel in Dutch) is a famous 17th-century area that surrounds Amsterdam&#39;s Binnenstad.
The entire area has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its unique cultural and historical value, and its real estate prices are among the highest in the country.
Cinque Terre, which means five lands, consists of five small coastal villages in the Liguria region of Italy. They are Riomaggiore, Manarola, Corniglia, Vernazza and Monterosso.
They belong to the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.
Over the centuries, people have carefully built terraces on the rugged and steep terrain right up to the seashore cliffs.
The lack of visible commercialization is part of its charm. Paths, trains and ships connect the villages, and cars cannot access them from the outside.
The forms of French spoken in Belgium and Switzerland differ slightly from the French spoken in France, but they are similar enough to be mutually intelligible.
In particular, the number system in French-speaking Belgium and Switzerland has its own subtle quirks that differ from the French spoken in France, and some words are pronounced slightly differently.
However, all French-speaking Belgians and Swiss have learned standard French at school, so they will understand you even if you use the standard French number system.
In many parts of the world, waving is a friendly gesture to say hello.
However, in Malaysia, and at least among rural Malaysians, it means &quot;come here&quot; a bit like the gesture used in some western countries where the index finger is bent towards the body, and should be used only for that purpose.
Similarly, in Spain, a British tourist may mistake waving goodbye, where the palm is facing the person waving (and not at all the person being waved), as a request to come back.‎
Auxiliary languages are artificial or artificial languages created to facilitate communication between people who would otherwise have difficulty communicating with each other.
They are different from lingua francas, i.e. natural or organic languages, which for one reason or another have risen to a dominant position as a means of communication between speakers of other languages.
Passengers may see mirages in the heat of the day, creating an illusion of water (or something else).
They can be dangerous if the traveler pushes towards the mirage, wasting precious energy and remaining water.
Even the hottest deserts can be extremely cold at night. Hypothermia is a real risk without warm clothing.
Especially in the summer, you have to watch out for mosquitoes if you decide to go hiking through the rainforest.
Even if you&#39;re driving through a subtropical rainforest, opening the doors for a few seconds when you get into the vehicle is enough to let mosquitoes into the car with you.
Bird flu can infect both birds and mammals.
Fewer than a thousand cases have been reported in humans, but some of them have been fatal.
Most have involved people working with poultry, but birders are also somewhat exposed.
Steep fjords and valleys that suddenly turn into somewhat flat highlands are typical of Norway.
The name vidde is often used for these plains, which means a wide and open treeless area, a boundless expanse.
In Rogaland and Agder, they are usually referred to by the word hei, which means treeless heath, often covered by Kanerva.
Glaciers are not stable, but flow down the mountainside. This causes cracks and grooves that may be covered by snow bridges.
The walls and roofs of ice caves may collapse and the grooves may close.
At the edges of glaciers, huge boulders break loose, fall and may pop or roll away from the edges.
The tourist season for hill stations is usually at its peak during the Indian summer.
However, they have a different beauty and charm in winter, as many mountain stations receive brisk snow and offer opportunities for activities such as skiing and snowboarding.
Only a few airlines still offer the so-called bereavement prices, which make last-minute funeral trips a little cheaper.
Airlines that offer them include Air Canada, Delta Air Lines, Lufthansa for flights departing from the United States and Canada, and Westjet.
In all cases, the reservation must be made by phone directly with the airline.
