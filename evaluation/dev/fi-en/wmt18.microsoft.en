Camille Auer wanted to correct her gender, was diagnosed as mentally ill and now she makes art on the subject - "Man should have the right to his own body"
Dozens of patient records hang from the ceiling of the Academy of Fine Arts' Project room gallery.
Each one bears Camille Auer's name.
The papers tell a multi-year story of how outsiders have written down their interpretations of Auer and his identity.
Decided for him who he is.
"I wanted to share my personal medical history to make the violence of the process visible," Auer says.
By process, he refers to the process of gender reassignment.
It is often a research period lasting years, including meetings with psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses and doctors.
The process starts with a referral for diagnostic examinations of "gender identity disorder", which are carried out in Tampere and Helsinki.
For Auer, the process started four years ago.
Even before this, she had been using oestrogen she had ordered online and was already very well advanced in her own repair process.
She felt that she was a woman, but according to Finnish law, a person must go through a correction process in order for her gender to be legally corrected.
The Transgender Act, i.e. the Act on the Confirmation of the Gender of Transsexuals (563/2002), obliges transgender people to undergo forced sterilisation in order to obtain the correct gender at the Population Register Centre and passport, for example.
Currently, everyone who corrects their gender is required to have a psychiatric diagnosis and proof of infertility.
People have the right to make decisions about their own bodies.
"This situation is intolerable and violates human rights," says Auer.
The reform of the Trans Act has been discussed in Finland for a long time.
The UN Human Rights Council has issued eight observations on the Act, and the European Court of Human Rights has a precedent obliging the parties to the European Convention on Human Rights to respect the right to self-determination.
Finland's previous government prepared the amendment under the leadership of Susanne Huovinen, then Minister of Social Affairs and Health.
Elections came and the Finns Party entered the government.
Now the change in the law is stalled again.
These are internal political disputes that are not even related to this particular law.
"The government doesn't want to put it on the table because there are disagreements within the government about changing the law," says Frank Johansson, Executive Director of Amnesty International Finland.
The front of the exhibition space is dominated by two large installations.
One of them consists of the packaging and instructions for use of the medicines used by Auer.
In the patient records installation, any visitor can read, for example, an interpretation of Auer by a psychologist from Tampere University Hospital's transpol.
The psychologist met with Camille Auer twice and based on them wrote a story that would define Auer's right to treatment and assistance.
The research subject's sense of reality appears to be prone to faltering.
The research subject's perception of self appears to be fragmented at the borderline level, and unstable personality traits are emphasized.
Auer did not recognize himself from these descriptions.
"It was a shock to learn that I was diagnosed as mentally ill," Auer says.
Even more shocking was when Auer was not given sex reassignment treatment.
According to medical staff, his resources were not sufficient to start the process.
He was denied his own identity.
Then, on February 11, 2015, Auer walked out of the meeting and kicked down the television in the transpol waiting lobby.
Later, a piece of art called Monument for the Excluded emerged from that television, in which Auer reflected on his experience of power and its use.
"It's crazy that anyone who is defined as female at birth can enlarge their breasts, but you need a diagnosis to remove your breasts," Auer says.
Your body is not yours if you perceive yourself as something other than your sex determined at birth.
Unfortunately, Auer's experience is not unique.
For many, the gender reassignment process is tougher for mental reasons than purely medical operations.
Those who go through it meet dozens of people to whom they need to justify their own existence and their right to their own sexual experience.
"It's crazy that people who are in need of support and help are denied treatment because they don't have enough resources," Auer says.
Many of those who have applied for the process have psychological symptoms behind them: depression, anxiety, possible experiences of bullying.
Based on these, the medical staff may order that treatment cannot be started.
"Preventing treatment and help can put a person in an even worse situation than it was before the process began," Auer says.
Auer's first-hand exhibition also deals with anxiety and thoughts about suicide.
In the text of the exhibition publication, Auer writes, "I've had suicidal thoughts my entire adult life and it's something that people usually have a hard time digesting."
Depression has been treated with medication, and when Auer started taking hormones, she felt relieved.
She had finally been able to put into words the feelings that had existed since childhood and adolescence.
Why the wide chin didn't seem to fit my body and why the pectoral muscles had to be round instead of a flat chest.
The most important thing for Auer has been that there are people around him who see him.
Being seen is a basic need.
"You have to justify yourself so much by talking, dressing, using your voice and movements," she says.
Today, Auer already feels seen, she exists as a woman.
However, in the early stages of the process, random comments from loved ones could hurt a lot.
What hurts the most is when loved ones misgender.
"They should know, and they know who I am, but they refuse or can't internalize it," she continues.
However, not all transgender people need physical changes.
They don't suffer from body dysphoria, a body contradiction in which the body or parts of it can cause anxiety and even physical pain.
However, without the use of hormones and a long examination process, one cannot get official confirmation of one's own gender.
"There is no medical basis for these studies," Auer says.
And it's true.
In Denmark, for example, in June 2014 the parliament adopted a new procedure for legal gender recognition.
The new legislation is based on self-determination over legal gender.
An adult applicant submits a written application for a new personal identity code, stating in it that he or she feels that he or she is of the other gender.
After the six-month reflection period, the applicant confirms his or her application in writing and the Ministry issues the applicant with a new personal identity code.
This right to self-determination is also demanded in Finland, and Auer's exhibition also encapsulates this demand.
It has not been a therapy experience for the artist, but the exhibition is a collection of political and artistic works.
I want to believe that art still carries weight and can bring about political change, at a time when politicians have forgotten about human rights.

Civil rights organization issues travel warning to Missouri
The NAACP, the national civil rights organization for African Americans, has issued a travel warning for Missouri. This is due to discriminatory practices in the state and racist attacks that have taken place there.
"The NAACP's travel advisory for Missouri is effective 8/28/2017 and urges African American travelers, visitors, and locals to pay close attention and exercise extreme caution when traveling in a state that has recently experienced numerous questionable race-based events," the organization said in a statement.
In Missouri, a recent law makes it more difficult to bring discrimination cases to court. In addition, the enforcement of state laws disproportionately affects minorities. According to the NAACP, these circumstances led to the issuing of a travel warning.
"People's civil rights are being violated.
They are stopped because of the color of their skin and beaten or killed," NAACP Missouri Chairman Rod Chapel told the Kansas City Star.
"We haven't heard of so many cases in such a short period of time before."
The travel advisory for Missouri is the organization's first warning for the state of the United States.
The organization cited racist comments against African-American students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a 28-year-old black man from Tennessee, as examples.
Sanders died under questionable circumstances earlier this year. He was driving through the state when his car ran out of fuel. He was arrested by Missouri police even though he was not charged with a crime.
The travel advisory also referred to a report by the Missouri attorney general, according to which police are 75 percent more likely to stop a black driver than a white driver.
"The purpose of the travel advisory is to urge people to be vigilant and warn their families, friends and colleagues about what could happen in Missouri," Chapel says.
"People need to prepare, for example, by bringing money to pay bail or telling relatives they're going to travel through the state."
According to the FBI, one hundred hate crimes were recorded in Missouri in 2015, the sixteenth-most of any state in the United States.
The travel warning is also a response to Missouri's new law that makes it harder for companies to sue for discrimination in housing and employment.
The ACLU, an organization that defends constitutionally guaranteed civil rights, recently issued travel warnings to Texas and Arizona after they passed immigration laws requiring police to arrest people for immigration violations. According to the organization, this increases racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and apply to other countries. Recently, however, NGOs have been publishing them in response to certain laws and developments in the United States.
Yle: Lintilä asked Finnair for a report on the CEO's supplementary pension
Minister of Economic Affairs Mika Lintilä (Centre Party), who is responsible for state ownership steering, has asked Finnair for a report on the supplementary pension contribution received by the airline's CEO Pekka Vauramo, Yle reports.
According to the minister, this is contrary to the will of the state.
The supplementary pension of EUR 130,000 received by Vauramo was highlighted this week when Helsingin Sanomat reported on the remuneration development of directors of listed companies.
Suomen Kuvalehti reported on Vauramo's supplementary pension in February.
Finnair announced that it will discontinue supplementary pensions in 2013.
The State has decided that supplementary pensions will not be used for rewards.
The State owns more than half of Finnair.
According to the company, the decision is in line with last year's resolution on corporate governance.
The sanctions immediately hardened the rhetoric
Not so long ago, it seemed that relations between the United States and Russia were moving from cold to warm.
US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, who met on the margins of the G20 meeting of industrialised countries in Hamburg, seemed to get along very well.
Since then, the atmosphere has cooled considerably.
The new economic sanctions approved by the US Congress last week and signed by Trump on Wednesday were met with bitter reactions in Russia.
The most shocking response so far has come from Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, who said the sanctions bill signed by Trump amounts to a "full-scale trade war."
Even if the Russian reactions are dismissed only as exaggerations and excesses inherent in political rhetoric, the strained relations between the United States and Russia are a fact of life after a short honeymoon after Trump's election.
In the United States, passing sanctions legislation against Russia, Iran and North Korea was not simple.
Although Congress passed the bill with considerable unanimity, it was reportedly much more difficult for the president to pass the bill.
Trump criticized the law he recently signed as "significantly flawed."
Russia in particular may have been responsible for President Trump's indignation, although the passage of a law restricting one's own powers must also have been repugnant.
As is well known, there is an investigation in the United States into both possible Russian interference in the presidential election and the Trump campaign's ties to Russia.
The strained relations between the United States and Russia are a fact of life after a short honeymoon.
As the White House staff has changed frequently and various scandalous twists and turns have been revealed almost to be updated, it seems increasingly clear that foreign policy in the United States is not conducted under the leadership of the president, but in spite of the president.
Such a situation is by no means desirable.
If the relationship with Russia is tricky in the United States, the same applies to the European Union.
In addition to economic sanctions, the tense security situation in the EU's core region of the Baltic Sea is also straining relations.
The EU has prominently highlighted the situation in Ukraine in its relations with Russia and called for the implementation of the Minsk Agreement.
Although the Union has so far remained united in its policy towards Russia, at least on the face of it, the interests of the Member States are quite different.
For a member state like Finland, which does a lot of business with Russia, economic sanctions have been a real nuisance.
The effects of the recent US sanctions law are still unclear.
There have been fears in the EU that sanctions will hamper the operations of many European companies.
In Finland, the impacts may be felt, for example, in the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project and possibly in Fennovoima's nuclear power plant project.
Acidity in Europe has been caused by the exclusion from sanctions, for example, of liquefied natural gas (LNG), which is important for the US economy.
Trade sanctions are a means of showing disapproval in world politics.
Economic sanctions, however, must be well thought out and specific.
Otherwise, they will easily do more harm than good.
Is nothing sacred anymore?
Trump's White House now has its sights set on the Statue of Liberty
Interfering with statues is the surest sign of regime change.
The Americans know this as well as anyone else: the Iraqis, together with American soldiers, toppled the statue of Saddam Hussein in Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the chief ideologists of the Trump administration, knew very well what he was doing in a heated debate with CNN's Jim Acosta. The Statue of Liberty came under attack from Miller over a verbal dispute over the president's proposal to drastically reduce legal immigration.
Miller didn't exactly criticize the statue itself.
If he had done so, he would have been attacked by huge hordes of cruise organizers and figures imitating the Statue of Liberty.
He attacked the significance of the statue, especially the fact that in 1903 a poem by Emma Lazarus was added to the statue's pedestal – 17 years after the statue's completion.
Here's how Miller berated Acosta: "I don't want to go into history now, but the Statue of Liberty is... Symbol of American freedom that illuminates the whole world.
The poem was added later and does not belong to the original Statue of Liberty."
Miller was not wrong per se, but it is not just history, as he himself said.
Essential are Lazarus' touching words, the only ones of its kind, in which the state calls not only immigrants but "the poorest of the poor": "Your tired, your poor, / Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, / The wretched refuse of your teeming shore."
The poem is now more relevant than ever.
Miller was by no means engaged in literary criticism. He made it clear that "the poorest of the poor" are not welcome in Trump's United States.
The controversy over the significance of the Statue of Liberty is part of a broader political and cultural controversy over the significance of the United States.
After his death, Lazarus' friends campaigned for the poem to be mounted on the statue's pedestal. They were well aware that the act was strongly political.
The purpose of the statue was to embody the connections between French and American republicanism with a classic metaphor, the feminine embodiment of freedom.
Lazarus changed its meaning: in his poem, the female figure is no longer abstract, but has a voice.
And it gives itself a new name: the mother of the deported.
Associating the poem with the image was an ingenious feminist coup d'état and a devastating attack on American nationalism.
Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, and the right has long wanted to change it back to its original.
Rush Limbaugh – a mouthpiece who can now be seen as something of a harbinger of Trump – argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is not an invitation to anyone, but an early forerunner of neoconservatives carrying the U.S. torch into a world shrouded in darkness: "Lady Liberty will step forward.
He takes the freedom to torch from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch does not show the way to the United States."
Rarely, Limbaugh was partially right.
The meaning of the Statue of Liberty depends entirely on your point of view.
Lazarus saw it like poor and exhausted but hopeful immigrants from the deck of a ship after a long and trying journey.
He saw it from the perspective of people seeking protection and a better life.
His Statue of Liberty comforts by giving hope and welcome.
And that's definitely not what Miller and Trump want.
Their torch does not show the way, but fuels the flames of hatred, their only source of strength.
2017 World Championships in Athletics: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK national team
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots made it to the British national team
Neil Black, the results director of the British Athletics Federation, says the 16 Scottish members of the national team participating in the World Cup are a "significant reinforcement".
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for the World Championships in Athletics, which begin on Friday in London.
According to Black, "something special is happening in Scotland" that British athletics must learn from.
"This is welcome, and we'll continue to explore it until we understand what's going on," Black says.
"I spoke to representatives of the Scottish Institute of Sport and they thought it was related to the activities of the Institute.
The Scottish Athletics Federation, on the other hand, believes that it is associated with the activities of the federation,
and the British Athletics Federation believes it is their actions that are behind it.
And the average street walker thinks he must have something to do with it.
But it's something amazing, whatever the reason."
Many Scottish athletes are seriously competing for medals in London, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who will compete with Sir Mo Farah in the 5,000m. Eilidh Doyle was elected captain of the national team.
"Eilidh is too modest.
His captain's speech was unbelievable," Black says.
"The athletes left the event proud of their achievements and highly motivated, no matter where they happened to live and train.
There was genuine emotion and passion for sport in Eilidh's words."
Eilidh Doyle is the silver medalist at the Commonwealth Championships in the 400m hurdles, and these are her fifth world championships. He thinks it is "incredible" that there are 16 Scots in the national team.
The previous record was seven from 1983 and 2015.
Middle distance runner Laura Muir has run five British and two European records in one year.
He competes in London in the 1,500 metres and 5,000 metres.
Chris O'Hare runs the 1,500 metres in London. He's also worth keeping an eye on: he's had an excellent season, including wins at the Great Britain's World Cup qualifiers and Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers his first World Cup, when the only Scot on the national team besides him was Lee McConnell.
The national team captain says he is "immensely proud" that there are so many Scots involved, some of whom are seriously competing for places in the finals and medals.
"Being captained is a great honour anyway, but it's even more special because the members of the national team voted for the captain," Doyle said.
"Of course I'm very proud of all the Scots who made it to the national team.
It shows how far we have come.
They are included as distinguished athletes competing for podiums.
My captain's speech?
I think it went just fine.
I focused on how lucky we are to have a home race.
It is important to enjoy the support of the home crowd and the fact that we are back in the Olympic Stadium.
I'll get another chance to compete there and I know it's going to be an amazing atmosphere."
Block critics on Facebook: Don't run for public office if you can't stand criticism
The father of our country knew what bad publicity is.
Americans loved George Washington, but newspapers soon began criticizing him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
The criticism certainly irritated,
But he did not silence his critics.
"If freedom of speech is abolished, we may be led foolish and silent like sheep to be slaughtered," Washington said in 1783.
That brings us to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who should learn from Washington.
Hogan's staff have removed at least 450 comments from his official Facebook page and blocked their authors.
The American Civil Rights Union sued Hogan earlier this week.
His staff considers the challenge unfounded, and the attitude was dismissive even online.
"What does it matter? This is just Facebook," many commented.
But it matters,
especially in the Hogan case.
Hogan is the amazingly popular Republican governor of the Democrat-controlled state.
He has received the second best ratings among 50 governors for his activities.
Hogan is not responsive to hotheads.
He has led the state steadfastly and held fast to principles.
He has also competently used Facebook as the main channel of communication with his constituents, posting a photo of his head balding during chemotherapy.
Therefore, blocking users entering the governor's Facebook page is unnecessary and even dangerous. The governor's page is a public and official forum maintained by his staff with tax revenue.
Hogan's spokeswoman, Amelia Chasse, defended the governor's actions in an interview with The Washington Post. According to him, it was just a matter of moderating comments.
However, labeling commenters as trolls, spammers or haters is too easy a solution.
The Washington Post interviewed users blocked by Hogan on Facebook.
They turned out to be ordinary people who wanted to talk to their chosen leaders. They were not trolls, but teachers, entrepreneurs and pastors, for example.
They reported that their comments were respectful, considerate and matter-of-fact.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his commentary; he wanted to appeal to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Maryland, was not hostile and asked a question about hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed that Hogan had not addressed hate crimes and other recent news," he wrote in comments to the Washington Post story.
"I also find it unacceptable that when more people comment on the same issue, they are immediately seen as somehow organised and ignored as a large group of concerned citizens."
The governor's staff called the comments a "concerted attack." Someone else might call them to promote issues that are considered important.
In the age of Facebook, communication is easy to manage by blocking a reviewer or removing a critical comment.
In the old days, staff should have been sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials, or to arrest and silence demonstrators.
In reality, however, it is the same thing, now only digitally.
Hogan isn't the first public official to be accused of shackling Facebook and other social media channels.
Twitter users blocked by President Trump have sued him.
The first major decision on the subject was taken last week in Virginia.
According to Alexandria District Court Judge James C. Cacheris, the Loudoun County government violated the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution by blocking voters on Facebook.
And the American Civil Rights Association went to talk to Kentucky Republican Governor Matt Bevin about the use of Twitter and Facebook.
This should not be difficult.
In Washington's day, low postage rates had a similar effect to today's Internet.
The number of newspapers quadrupled from 1776 to 1800, and Washington was pounded by anonymous writers.
Already at that time there were trolls.
The pseudonyms Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius, and Portius wrote letters to newspapers denouncing Washington's decisions.
The President's office was flooded with petitions criticizing the Jay Treaty, i.e. the U.S.-Britain Cooperation, Trade and Maritime Agreement. This is according to documents collected by the Papers of George Washington online project.
However, he did not silence his critics.
Freedom of expression, opinion and debate are the cornerstones of our nation.
True leadership means accepting this fact.
Summer feeding of birds should be stopped immediately
Samples have been received from about half a dozen places, as well as online advertisements from two or three.
Most of them have come from Southern and Southwest Finland, but then also individual ones from Haapavesi and Seinäjoki," says Senior Researcher Marja Isomursu from Evira.
Greenfinches have died from a parasitic disease called trichomonosis.
It is caused by a protozoan known as Trichomonas gallinae.
It has previously been known to strike pigeons, especially bunnies.
In the 2000s, however, the disease also began to be detected in finches.
In 2009, it really kicked in.
At that time, trichomonosis caused a major collapse in the Finnish greenfinch population, after which the populations of the species have been recovering.
There have now been sick greenfinches, but at least not yet on a large scale," says Juha Honkala, Museum Manager at the Finnish Museum of Natural History (Luomus) at the University of Helsinki.
It is to be feared that the previous epidemic of greenfinches will recur again if something is not done.
What needs to be done now is a very simple thing that everyone can do: stop feeding birds in the summer immediately.
More on that later.
Ronan Rafferty hopes to benefit from home-field advantage at Renaissance Club
Former European number one Ronan Rafferty will be hoping to benefit from home-field advantage for the next three days when the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th World Summit. Scottish Senior Open.
Northern Irishman Rafferty led the tournament at neighbouring Archerfield Links last year before the final round, but ultimately lost to Paul Elales. Rafferty is fond of the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador on behalf of club founder and CEO Jerry Sarvad.
"I watched the construction of the Renaissance Club, and with this event, it will reach its full glory," says Rafferty.
"The players see the pitch at its best. It is in fantastic condition.
Jerry has done a great job with this place.
He's an avid ambassador for the game, and he's proud of what he's accomplished here.
The tournament is a great showcase for this field."
Englishman Eales is defending the title for the first time, despite winning both the European Tour and the European Challenger Tour in his 32-year career.
"This feels like a really special opportunity," the Southport-based player said.
"I didn't get to defend my Extremadura Open win because the tournament is not part of the tour this year.
It's great to come back here.
This is a great place to play golf.
Last year's memories come back: winning the tournament was great for me and my wife, Sharon.
It was a great time that we will always remember."
Gary Orr is back in action on his own soil. He joined the tour after turning 50 earlier this year.
This will be his first appearance in Scotland since the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open.
"Playing at home is always more meaningful than usual," says Orr, who lives in Helensburgh.
"You want to succeed, but you also feel extra pressure.
I've enjoyed playing again and played pretty strong.
I'm happy with my game so far."
The trio will be joined on the pitch by former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior major winners Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Six Scots will take part in the tournament: Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance, as well as Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
The tournament is free of charge. Parking a car costs five pounds if there is only a driver in the car, and ten pounds if there are at least two people in the car.
All proceeds will be donated to Prostate Cancer UK.
In Säkylä, possible indoor air problems in the barracks were investigated
In Säkylä, no indoor air problems have been found in the barracks building of the Pori Brigade's signal company, at least for the time being, the brigade said on Thursday.
Indoor air quality studies are still ongoing.
The investigation began when a man who had interrupted his military service for health reasons thought that his health had deteriorated due to poor indoor air in the barracks.
According to Lieutenant Colonel Mika Holma, Chief of Staff of the Pori Brigade, no problems have been detected in the health situation of other conscripts.
It turned out that this was an isolated incident and that the others who served in that unit had no health problems.
Every report is taken seriously and we wanted to get to the bottom of this.
At the moment, we are not aware of any indoor air problems," Holma says.
The brigade's press release says that due to the arrival batch in July, goods had to be moved to the barracks, which may have caused a temporary increase in dustiness.
Because of this, the air may have seemed stuffy," Holma says.
Poverty and death in Indonesia's golden land
Bardina Degei does not use a stove in cooking.
He rarely uses the boiler either.
Degei lives in a wooden building in Enarotal, the capital of the Paniai region, located in Indonesia's troubled province of Papua. When she prepares dinner, she usually puts the sweet potato — locally "nota" — directly into the hearth.
After half an hour, the burnt sweet potato is eaten voraciously with bare, unwashed hands.
There is no furniture in Degei's home. She sits on a muddy ground floor, where she usually also does her daily chores, such as doing laundry in the murky water fetched from a nearby swamp.
The posts of the toilet are supplied by a bucket in a room without a ceiling.
Degei is the youngest of her husband's four wives and is not assigned to take care of the fields.
Polygamy is common here.
Working late can be dangerous: most of the men in the village are unemployed and many drink a lot. In addition, it is necessary to take into account the military.
"No one dares to walk in the village after five o'clock in the evening," Degei says.
This is a rare glimpse into everyday life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was annexed by Indonesia in 1969. The annexation was preceded by a controversial referendum in which 1,026 village elders were forced to vote publicly in front of the occupying forces.
The local independence movement, which opposed Dutch rule, quickly turned its anger on the Jakarta government, which maintains tight control of the region and blocks foreign journalists and human rights observers from entering.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua. The eastern part of the island belongs to Papua New Guinea.
Enarotal is remote and dreary. The journey starts with an hour-and-a-half flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabare and continues with a stomach-wrenching five-hour drive in a rental car.
There is no public transport here.
The city of about 19,000 inhabitants has wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, the corrugated tin roofs of which have been stained yellow-brown by rust.
Few Indonesians have been here, let alone journalists and foreigners.
Before the advent of Christian missionaries, the me Pago tribesmen of Papua worshipped the god Uga Tamee.
There have also been other changes.
"We didn't have clothes like this," Degei says. She means her colorful, hand-woven wraparound headdress, dark skirt, and brightly colored blouse.
"We used to only have leaves to cover our bodies."
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia. 28% of its inhabitants live below the poverty line, and infant mortality and illiteracy are among the highest in Asia.
But it is also the gold land of Indonesia.
Paniai is a highland area about the size of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants. Just about a hundred kilometers from Paniia is Grasberg, the world's largest and most lucrative gold mine. It is owned by Freeport McMoran, a company based in Phoenix, USA.
In 2015, the mine provided Freeport with $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua has an estimated $78 billion in timber reserves.
For the Papuans, however, these riches bring misery, as they mean the suffocating presence of a strong Indonesian army.
The New York Times revealed in 2005 that Freeport paid local military personnel and local military units nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004. Individual officers were paid up to $150,000.
Papua's demands for greater sovereignty threaten this source of income and are mercilessly silenced.
According to human rights activists, since 1969 the Indonesian army has killed more than 500 000 Papuans and raped, tortured and imprisoned thousands.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, massacres in the highlands of Papua tribes in the 1970s assumed genocidal proportions.
Last year, Indonesian police arrested more than 3 900 people in peaceful protests in the region.
The 2016 We Will Lose Everything report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane includes accounts of previous years' atrocities, including extrajudicial executions, torture – rape and electrocution being particularly popular methods – and relentless attacks on peaceful protest.
"It's hard to count the number of victims because there are cases every week," said Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
The screw has been tightened as Papua's natural resources attract migrants from other parts of Indonesia.
Christians make up 83% of the province's 3.5 million inhabitants, but the demographic is changing as Muslims move from Indonesia's populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi in search of a better livelihood.
Javanese warung food stalls sell fried chicken and gado-gado vegetable mix in peanut sauce.
It's hard for locals to compete.
"Migrants have started selling chicken and vegetables at the market cheaper than locals," says Abeth You, 24, who hails from Paniia and moved to the provincial capital for work.
"Local women lost their customers."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo – nicknamed Jokowi – pledged in his 2014 election campaign to address injustices and human rights abuses in Papua.
Papua is made up of 29 regions, and this former carpenter won the vote in 27 regions, including Paniai, on his way to Jakarta's presidential palace.
But little has changed in Papua, and the locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts were broken because we voted for Jokow in 2014 and expected him to fulfill our wishes and restore justice," You says.
Paniia experienced something of a nadir just two months after Jokowi's inauguration in October.
Eleven children were singing Christmas carols by a campfire in Enarotal on 7.12.2014 when two Indonesian soldiers on motorcycles appeared from the darkness.
The frightened children told the soldiers to wear headlights.
One of the soldiers did not like the remark. According to local pastor Yavedt Tebai, the man returned with four soldiers.
According to the accounts of victims and witnesses, drunken soldiers apprehended the children and beat them with rifle butts.
Thus, one of the soldiers fired at the children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, fell into a coma as a result of the assault.
A couple of hours later, the State Election Commission building near the scene was set on fire, and the next day things began to happen.
About a thousand Papuans – young men and women and children – gathered on the football field in front of the local police station and army command center to demand justice.
Carrying hunting bows for festive occasions, they began performing the traditional waita dance of the Papuan me Pago tribe, which involves dancing in a ring and imitating birdsong.
Some of the demonstrators began stoned police and army buildings.
As the atmosphere heated up, the soldiers received orders on the internal radio system: "If the masses resist more than three times, shoot them dead." The information is based on an official document seen by TIME magazine that has not been made public to local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, resident leader of the Kego Koto area, sensed that the situation was getting out of hand and asked the crowd to calm down and return to their homes.
No one wanted to listen anymore.
"When I turned around, I was shot in the left wrist," he told TIME magazine on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who shot him, but the bullet came from the ranks of soldiers.
"Several shots were fired in the crowd."
Alfius Youw was shot three times. His cousin witnessed the shootings.
"I ran up to him and made sure it was indeed him," Yohanes told TIME magazine sadly. Like many Indonesians, he uses only one name.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
Papua Police Superintendent Yotje Mende told reporters that the police were only "protecting" the police station because it was under attack.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," Papua police spokesman Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015.
"Then it's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many injured.
News of the killings reached Jakarta the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave an emotional speech in Jayapura expressing his condolences to the families of the victims and pledging that the violence in Papua would be addressed.
"I want the incident to be investigated immediately so that something like this never happens again."
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he would launch investigations into human rights violations outside the judicial system.
However, he immediately began to retract his speeches.
"Most of the violations occurred a long time ago,
In the 1990s and early 2000s.
The most important thing is that we have decided to investigate the violations, but for that we need certain processes," he said.
In an interview with TIME magazine in Jakarta on 5.6.2017, Wiranto had already changed his mind. He said he did not intend to open investigations in Papua.
"Everything will be sorted out in court," he said.
The UN accuses Wiranto of "crimes against humanity." The crimes relate to the deaths of more than a thousand people in East Timor's bloody independence referendum in 1999. Wiranto told TIME magazine that 11 cases of human rights abuses in Papua have already been solved, including those in Paniai.
The families of the victims of Paniai are greeted with dark disbelief at the allegations.
"I've been interviewed four times in the last three years, but things haven't progressed in any way," Yohanes says.
"I'm already tired of this."
She says she still lives in fear, even though it's been years since the incident.
"Yes, I'm afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid the military will arrest me. I'm afraid I'll be shot."
His brother Yacobus confirms that the Spaniels do not dare to discuss the incident.
He says he had been beaten by soldiers after helping bury four of the victims.
"The soldiers sought me out after the victims were buried," he says.
The shootings have not stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot at villagers in Paniai's neighboring Deiyai.
One person was killed and 17 injured in an altercation between villagers and the manager of a construction company that began when the manager refused to take a man who had lost consciousness to hospital. Children were also among the injured.
The man who needed hospital treatment was 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who had been caught in the water while fishing in a nearby river. He died on the way to the hospital.
Angry villagers demonstrated at a construction site in front of the company's office.
According to police, villagers stoned police officers who responded with warning shots.
However, according to locals, a mobile police unit of the Indonesian paramilitary police opened fire on the crowd, killing one villager.
"We are terrified. We are afraid of retaliation," said 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and saw the wounded being brought in for treatment.
"I've been hiding at home for two days."
Deiyai's parliament has called for the police officers who fired shots to be held accountable and for the mobile police unit to be pulled out of the area.
Paniai has always been a sticking point for the Indonesian government.
The lack of real development feeds the discontent of the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes living in Papua's lush central highlands.
Many have joined the Papuan Liberation Movement (OPM), a rebel army that claims to defend the rights of Papuans through sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian army soldiers.
Some of OPM's leaders are Panic, such as Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
The army has responded to the rebellion by arbitrarily arresting and detaining thousands of people in Paniai in the name of 'safeguarding national sovereignty'.
Some of those arrested never return.
Among the Papuans, Paniai is known as a "sad, forgotten place."
Poverty feeds discontent.
There is little rice for sale in Enarotal, and even that is too expensive for the locals,
Like bread.
People grow their own food: mainly sweet potatoes and some fruits and leafy vegetables.
Farming is women's work, and one woman can be responsible for four or five sweet potato fields.
Most of the harvest is for the family, and the rest is sold at the market.
Ten sweet potatoes cost only 10,000 rupees (75 cents).
Over time, disparities in the livelihoods of locals and migrants have widened, and the number of migrants has increased since new routes were opened to Nabare Airport.
Jobs are scarce and tend to go to better-educated and wealthier migrants than locals.
Only a few people in Papua have enough capital and know-how to run their own business competitively.
"Young people don't want to stay in the village because there are no jobs and no money here," says John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai Tribal Council.
Remote Papua receives little attention around the world.
In addition, restrictions on international news coverage remain strict.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua despite being granted rare permission to photograph. The official reason was the inability to cooperate with local institutions.
Phelim Kine, Asia deputy director at Human Rights Watch, said Jokowi had not kept his election promises. He has not increased transparency or promoted development by removing restrictions on news coverage.
"Journalists covering Indonesia's troubled easternmost provinces, Papua and West Papua, face new risks: visa denial and blacklisting," Kine said in a statement.
The lack of freedom of action for the press means that pressure on the Indonesian Government is exerted only by Papua's immediate neighbours.
In March, six Pacific nations – Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands – called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "numerous and widespread violations" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
These countries have also traditionally supported the Papuan liberation movement.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Arrmanatha Nasir denied the allegations and told reporters in Jakarta that "Indonesia remains a democracy with freedom of the press, so it would be difficult to cover up evidence of human rights violations."
The locals want foreign governments to intervene.
When an official Dutch delegation led by Human Rights Ambassador Kees Van Bar visited Jayapura on 4.5.2017, locals broke their silence and expressed their desire for freedom, according to a source who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Indonesia has a presidential election in 2019, but Papuans say they are unlikely to vote for Jokow anymore.
"Jokowi means well, but he is surrounded by people who are implicated in the shooting scene in Paniai," says Gobai, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Yokowi to know the situation of the Spaniels, who live under the rule of a greedy and unpredictable army, deprived of deprivation and poverty, virtually deprived of health services and educational opportunities.
According to Gobai, the Spaniards, like other Papuans, consider the votes they cast for Jokow to be a "debt" that must be repaid.
"They don't want money. They just want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the relatives of the victims of the Paniai shooting demonstration once again demonstrated symbolic resistance: they buried one of the victims in the country opposite the police station and army office.
They know that they may never get justice, but at least they will not let those responsible forget their crimes.
"My family members were killed," Yacobus says with his head bowed.
"What else could we do?"
Dereck Chisora slams Robert Helenius rematch cancellation: 'Even my own fans don't want to see'
Heavyweight boxers Robert Helenius and Dereck Chisora were scheduled to fight on May 27 at Hartwall Arena.
However, the match was cancelled for commercial reasons.
In a recent interview with IFL TV, Chisora puts the blame for the rematch flopping entirely on Helenius' shoulders.
My match in Finland flopped, but it wasn't my fault.
I don't live in Finland, I don't want to sell tickets there.
The reason was my Finnish opponent.
Even his fans don't want to see him fight because he's lousy.
Helenius and Chisora met for the first time in a packed Hartwall Arena in December 2011.
Helenius won the match with a controversial points verdict.
Ticket sales for the rematch were sluggish, and its promoter Nisse Sauerland told Ilta-Sanomat in May that the match had been postponed until the autumn.
Nothing new has been heard from the match since.
However, Chisora is no longer bothered by the cancellation.
The match would probably have had to be cancelled anyway after Chisora fell ill.
On Thursday, three days before the match, I woke up in severe pain.
My hernia was about to explode.
The hospital told me I had to be operated on," Chisora says.
The Briton says he is currently in about 45% condition.
By all accounts, he is not interested in a rematch with Helenius, but has his sights set on Dillian Whyte.
Chisora suffered a split defeat to Whyte in December.
Fire engulfs Torch skyscraper in Dubai for the second time
Flames engulfed one of the world's tallest residential buildings in Dubai on Friday. Hundreds of residents were forced to flee the 337-meter-high 79-storey building.
This was the second fire in two years in a building that happens to be called Torch, a torch.
The building was cleared and no one is known to have been injured. The cause of the fire was not known immediately after the incident.
"We were asleep and woke up to the sound of a fire alarm and people screaming.
We ran down the stairs from the 50th floor, which took about ten minutes," a resident named George told Reuters.
Dubai's emergency services said fire crews were able to extinguish the fire at four a.m. local time and stayed behind to cool the building.
The government announced that it would provide accommodation for those who left their homes.
The incident could raise questions again about the safety of materials used on the exterior surfaces of high-rise buildings around the world.
After the 2015 fire, the Torch building board commissioned a study that found that the boards used for façade cladding and insulation suffered the most damage.
In Britain, police believe insulation and cladding slabs at London's Grenfell Tower may have contributed to the rapid spread of flames in a fire that killed 80 people in June.
A moped was stolen from a parking lot in Joensuu during the night
A moped was stolen from a parking lot in Joensuu between 9 pm on Tuesday and 5 am on Wednesday.
The moped disappeared from Niinivaara at Tikkamäentie 2.
The moped was branded Sky Team Monkey.
It is red in colour and the registration number is 27-REV.
The moped was found later on Thursday.
The police ask for any sightings of the moped or its theft by email to This email address is being protected from spambots.

In the United States, more than 20 percent of air passengers take prohibited items on board, survey reveals
A survey of air travelers reveals that more than 20 percent of U.S. passengers had knowingly or unknowingly taken prohibited items onto airplanes past U.S. Federal Transportation Safety Administration (TSA) checkpoints. At least six percent of the passengers had knives or other objects with blades that they did not know were prohibited.
Less than one per cent said they only found out afterwards that they had mistakenly transported weapons, ammunition or explosives.
More than a thousand passengers responded to the survey and it was conducted by the charter airline Stratos Jet Charters. The results also reveal that young passengers are more likely to defy the rules.
Of the passengers who knowingly violated TSA rules, 19.7 percent were Generation Y and less than 15 percent belonged to Generation X.
Most commonly, the rules were violated by taking food and liquids on board the aircraft.
More than three per cent admitted to knowingly taking objects with blades to an aircraft. In addition, 2.2% of women and 3.7% of men said they had knowingly taken prohibited drugs on board an aircraft.
The survey included travelers from all over the United States. The company that conducted the survey wanted to find out how many people had accidentally taken smuggling goods past security and how many had done so knowingly.
Not surprisingly, those who travel the most are also most likely to take contraband goods past security – knowingly or unknowingly.
But as the company that conducted the survey notes, TSA's guidelines are quite complex and confusing.
Passengers often do not know what liquids are allowed on board the aircraft and how much.
So it's no surprise that most TSA seizures are liquids.
For some time, there was also a belief that you were not allowed to take books on board an aircraft.
Liquids may be taken on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Scott Pruitt, director of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, reversed his decision to delay Obama-era decisions to reduce emissions
A day after 15 states sued EPA Director Scott Pruitt, Pruitt reversed his earlier decision to delay the implementation of decisions taken during the Obama administration to reduce smog-causing emissions.
According to Pruitt, the change shows that the agency he heads is more responsive than previous administrations to the needs of state environmental policymakers.
Pruitt did not say a word about the lawsuit filed against his earlier decision in federal appeals court.
Länder should start complying with the 2015 ground-level ozone requirement from 1.10.
Pruitt announced in June that he would postpone the implementation of the decisions by a year to give his agency more time to review the plan because the agency "does not want to interfere in local decision-making or hamper economic growth."
Pruitt was the attorney general for the state of Oklahoma before President Donald Trump appointed him director of the EPA. Pruitt is known as an opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since coming to Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly tried to block or delay the implementation of decisions opposed by the chemical and fossil fuel industries.
Wednesday's abrupt change of heart is the latest setback in Pruitt's plan to relax regulations.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., ruled that the EPA chief exceeded his authority in an attempt to delay the implementation of the Obama administration's decision on oil and gas companies. The decision obligated the companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement Wednesday evening, Pruitt argued that his U-turn on ozone regulations will only strengthen EPA's collaboration with states in the complex process of meeting the new requirements on schedule.
"Under previous administrations, the EPA often failed to meet deadlines and then waited for activist groups and others to sue to reach an agreement on timelines," Pruitt said. In his previous position, he sued the Environment Agency more than ten times.
"We do not believe in regulation through litigation and take deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously the regulation governing our activities and the powers it gives us."
However, the EPA statement said Pruitt can still use his "powers to delay the execution of decisions, as well as his other legal powers," to ensure that regulations "are justified and based on the best available information."
Republicans are pushing for a broader change in ozone regulations in Congress.
The bill, passed last month, aims to delay the implementation of the 2015 decisions by at least eight years.
The proposal has not yet been voted on in the Senate.
New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, said the group will continue to press.
"The EPA's change of heart as a result of our lawsuits is a significant victory for the 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans exposed to the direct effects of smog in their communities," Schneiderman said.
In addition to New York, the lawsuit included California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and the District of Columbia.
Ground-level ozone is created when emissions from cars, power plants, oil refineries and chemical plants, for example, react to sunlight in the atmosphere.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing difficulties in sensitised groups of people. It is also a contributing factor to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health advocates and environmentalists rejoiced at Pruitt's surprising change of direction.
"It's disturbing how much pressure it took for the guy in charge of the air we breathe to use common sense," says Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight the Trump administration, whose ideological goal is to act on the terms of polluters and other self-interested groups."
Supercar manufacturer to become SUV - "happening in Ferrari style"
It also plans to invest in hybrid sports cars while maintaining its exclusive status.
That's likely to happen, but it's Ferrari's style," CEO Sergio Marchionne said of the plans at a news conference on Wednesday.
Details of the new strategy will be revealed next year when the Italian supercar maker unveils its new five-year plan, Automotive News reported.
All measles cases in Eastern Savo of the same virus type
The measles infection in Rantasalmi is of the same virus type as previous cases in Eastern Savo, THL informs.
The virology laboratory of the National Institute for Health and Welfare confirmed on Thursday that the fifth measles infection in Eastern Savo is the same strain as previous infections.
The Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare has confirmed that the measles infection confirmed in a person from Rantasalmi on Friday 28 July is of the same virus type as the previous cases in Eastern Savo.
Based on this information, all infections detected in Eastern Savo are related to the first measles detected in the region in June.
The news is good because it means that we have not seen any other types of measles virus.
However, it is possible that new infections may emerge after the fifth person infected until mid-August, and the epidemic is therefore not over yet," says Mirkaleena Erkkilä, physician in charge of infectious diseases in Soster's primary health care.
No new measles infections or suspicions of measles have been reported since the fifth confirmed case.
However, it is still important that everyone ensures that their vaccination protection is up to date, Erkkilä points out.

Finland prepares for permitted screaming
Moonshine soup was not even considered for legalization.
The underlying argument is that the process produces methanol, which is toxic, in addition to liquor.
Making moonshine at home will be legal next year, but legalizing moonshine soup is not even being considered.
Kilju is made by fermentation, moonshine by distillation.
The rationale behind the regulation of distillation is that the process produces methanol, which is toxic, in addition to liquor.
There has been no political will to make moonshine soup an everyman's right," says Ismo Tuominen, Senior Ministerial Adviser at the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
When the Ministry was preparing the reform of the Alcohol Act, the distillation of moonshine was not considered for legalisation.
Nor was it brought to the political table.
There was no discussion about liberalising distillation, says Member of Parliament Outi Mäkelä (Conservative Party).
She is a member of the negotiating team of the parliamentary groups of the government parties, which took a stand on the reform of the Alcohol Act.
Permission to distill moonshine at home cannot be granted even on application.
Commercial manufacturing will also remain subject to a licence.
Tuominen says that there will be a simple rule for home production of alcoholic beverages: alcohol can be prepared at home by fermentation.
This means that now, in addition to beer, cider and wine, you can legally scream at home.
The government has wanted to simplify the regulations.
The new act removes the requirements for flavourings and flavourings and enables the production of squeak," Mäkelä explains.
The preparation must still take place in such a way that the raw materials or the flavour and aroma ingredients created during their fermentation are clearly visible in the drink.
According to the new law, you can make as many drinks as you want, and you can give homemade alcohol as gifts.
It is still not allowed to be put up for sale.
Screaming is no longer a public health problem in Finland, Tuominen believes.
A much bigger change took place in 2004, when passenger imports from Estonia and other EU countries were liberalised.
75 per cent of the alcohol consumed in Finland is imported from Estonia.
The draft Alcohol Act is now under review by the Ministry of Justice.
The Alcohol Act will be submitted to Parliament as soon as the autumn term begins.
The plenary session is 5.9.
The Act will enter into force at the beginning of 2018.
The law is well prepared.
It is as if Parliament has already taken a stand, Mäkelä rejoices.
Oscar Pistorius was rushed to hospital escorted by armed guards
Oscar Pistorius, suffering from chest pain, was rushed to a South African hospital due to suspected heart attacks.
Pistorius has already been released from the hospital.
Oscar Pistorius is serving his prison sentence at Atteridgeville Prison.
According to the British newspaper Mirror, Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital this morning, escorted by armed guards.
Pistorius suffered from chest pains, but was discharged from the hospital in the afternoon.
A prison spokesman confirmed that Pistorius was taken to hospital for examination.
A spokesperson for the Pistorius family, meanwhile, said the former elite athlete is fine.
Last summer, the Supreme Court sentenced the six-time Paralympic gold medalist to six years in prison for the murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp.
Pistorius shot Steenkamp in February 2013.
Transcribed phone conversations reveal Trump pressured Mexico to build a border wall
Transcribals of telephone conversations between US President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia have been leaked to The Washington Post.
In a phone call on 1/27/2017, Trump urged Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto to stop his public speeches about not going to pay for the proposed border wall.
The President of the United States reproached Nieto for publicly rejecting the wall project. "You can't say that to the press," Trump said.
Trump launched his presidential campaign by promising to build a wall on the southern border of the United States at the expense of Mexico.
The Washington Post also published a transcript of Trump's first phone call to Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. There was a tense exchange of words during the call.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement that the U.S. would take in refugees en route to Australia was "ridiculous," "lousy" and "stupid." Trump said the deal negotiated under Obama would make him look like an "idiot" for proposing a ban on the settlement of refugees in the United States.
Trump ended the call by telling Turnbull that "this was the most unpleasant call of the day."
Georgia massacre: Activists re-stage racist lynching in hopes of justice
A Ford Mercury car passes the crowd in the small town of Monroe in rural Georgia and continues toward the small Moore's Ford Bridge.
There are four black passengers and a white driver in the car. Four armed men block the road before the car reaches the bridge.
The leader of the group, a middle-aged man dressed in a striped suit, takes a deep breath from his cigar and peers through the windshield.
Passengers are scared.
"Roger, n---u!" the man groans.
"Get out of the car!"
Shouts break the silence as a young black man is pulled out of the front seat.
Fortunately, this shocking event is just a re-enactment that aired on 22.7.2017.
However, the sighs of shock are genuine when the noose is threaded around "Roger's" neck.
Since 2005, human rights groups have returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to re-stage the events of 1946. At the time, two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey, were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan.
No one has been charged with the murders.
"It's baffling that no one has been arrested in all these years — even though the murderers live among us and many need to know who they are," says Tyrone Brooks, who helps arrange the re-stage.
"It is a stain on history, but above all it is a burden that weighs on our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old civil rights activist and former Georgia congressman.
For him, the re-staging is a startling call to action. It also reminds Monroe residents that the wrong has never been righted.
"We want those responsible to be brought to justice. We want things to finally come to an end, and we want to recover from the grief and reconcile, but most of all we want justice," Brooks says.
"We cannot recover and reconcile until we get justice."
The coroner covers the body of the victim who died in the Georgia massacre on 27.7.1946.
According to FBI documents obtained by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties were suspected of lynching.
However, no one was charged with murder.
Although the perpetrators have been at large for decades, activists say the motives for the lynching have always been known to locals: politics and sex.
In 1946, the Supreme Court ruled that blacks in the state of Georgia were allowed to vote for the first time in a presidential election. The Supreme Court handed down its decision in April, and elections were held in the summer.
According to the FBI, there was an incident around the election in which Roger Malcom, a black tenant farmer, stabbed Barnett Hester, a white landowner, during a fight apparently involving Malcom's wife, Dorothy.
According to Brooks, the town rumored that Hester had been having an affair with Dorothy and that Dorothy was expecting a child for her.
According to FBI records, on 7/25/1946, influential white landowner Loy Harrison paid Malcom's $600 bail, in exchange for which he was released from prison.
On the way home, Malcom and Dorothy were accompanied by their cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
The mob stopped their car before Moore's Ford Bridge.
"It turns out that Harrison ordered and orchestrated the murders," the FBI report states.
"It is also evident that there was a conspiracy between state and local authorities. The authorities were complicit in the murders and destroyed the evidence and did not reveal the identity of the witnesses."
Brooks puts it more succinctly.
"It was a suffrage killing," he says.
"They were murdered because they wanted to send a message to black people that the same thing would happen to them if they were going to vote."
Cassandra Greene has been directing a re-enactment of the Georgia massacre for nearly a decade.
The performance is extremely realistic and captivating. It is a description of the shocking racism that many would like to believe has disappeared from today's United States.
It's hard to watch the show, but even harder not to watch, which Greene says is the intention.
"We don't want to talk about lynching because we'd have to face our own dark sides," the director says.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you can't hear me or don't want to hear what I've been through."
Rehearsals for this year's show began in June. On the first day, about 30 actors—a dozen black and twenty white—gathered to listen to Greene's routine summary of the show.
Wade Marbaugh serves as Greene's assistant director.
He has played the local Ku Klux Klan leader in the re-set for years, but the role is always difficult and repulsive.
"I feel dirty because I'm not myself," Marbaugh says.
"However, it is important that this aspect of history is also highlighted so that it never happens again."
Across the room, Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, aka Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, practice their lines.
The show begins with a scene where Malcom yells and nudges Hester. He is furious that Hester has had an affair with Dorothy.
"Didn't you hear? I said get out of my lands, n---u!"
Rascona aka Hester answers.
Then leaves the beat.
And then everyone (at least all the black actors) bursts into laughter.
Greene laughs the hardest.
"What?!" Rascona asks.
He is confused.
"Did I accidentally hit too hard?" he asks.
"No," Greene chuckles.
"I just don't think whites used the word n---u."
"Yes," another black actor confirms.
"It's slang. You have to use a longer version."
The subject matter of the performance is unpleasant, but the room is invaded by a spirit of friendship.
Everyone wants to succeed, and not just for the sake of the show. They want to honour the memory of those who died.
The scene starts all over again.
Now Rascona's words are catching on.
No one laughs.
The re-staging ends quickly and violently.
Shouting, gunshots – and silence.
A woman dressed in a black funeral costume stands beside the bodies and sings Billie Holiday's "Strange Fruit."
His voice breaks with every other word.
A few dozen meters away, about fifty spectators wipe sweat and tears from their eyes.
Almost exactly half of the audience is black and half white.
Among them is a couple who have come to see the show from Ithaca, New York, but most are locals.
Under Brooks' guidance, they have visited the graves of the victims in the oppressive humidity of Georgia.
The murders have gone from story to reality. The atmosphere at the venue is heavy.
After the singing performance, Greene calls the crowd to inspect the bodies.
Children squat down to watch fake blood and motionless corpses and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead," the little boy mutters, as if to remind himself.
After a few minutes, Greene thanks the audience.
The actors who played the lynchers take off their cloaks and wipe away tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man who played the local Ku Klux Klan leader.
Nick Rascona hugs the two actors and then bursts into tears after a tough performance.
"It's okay," the woman involved in the performance comforts.
"We know you're not him.
You did this for a good reason."
Later, the audience and actors gather for a joint dinner.
A white couple from Altanta has a lively conversation about the show with a black couple they have just met.
Denise Duplinski struggles to find words when describing the feelings evoked by the performance.
"It's hard to listen to horrible words and watch the horrible things that people say and do that look like you — just because they look like you," she says.
"What made me aware of the show was that lynchings are still happening," he added. "They're just called arrests."
Across the room, Brooks recalls the development of civil rights to listeners sitting at the same table.
He says he has already started planning next year's show.
"Re-staging is a powerful experience because it portrays the horrors we've experienced, but it's also an educational experience," Brooks says.
"Its message is that this can happen again if we don't learn from it.
Those who do not know their history are doomed to repeat it."
Hanging vegetables in stores is a stir: This is how much you can actually save by removing "extra parts"
Is it allowed to peel off cauliflower leaves already in the store before weighing?
How about taking off a big hat from the pineapple - it weighs how much?
Opinions are strongly divided: for some, it is an indication of austerity taken to extremes, while others do not want to pay for the parts of vegetables that they do not use and nevertheless go to the trash at home.
The phenomenon is recognisable in shops.
For example, there are cardboard boxes in the vegetable section of K-Citymarket in Ruoholahti, Helsinki, because many people tear off the leaf parts of cauliflower, for example.
From the box, the leaves are taken to the store's biowaste.
According to a news article published by Taloussanomat, shopkeepers are surprised by the snooping at the vegetable counter.
But how much does removing excess parts of vegetables before weighing actually save money?
How important is this taking?
We Women tested how the price changes when you take the leaves or stumps out of pineapple, artichoke, mushrooms, broccoli and cauliflower.
Cauliflower: The price of a cauliflower costing €2.10 was €1.80 when you peeled off all the leaves.
Pineapple: The price of a whole pineapple costing €2.30 dropped to €1.95 when the stock was wrung out.
Artichoke: The price of €2.60 became €2.40 when the short stock was cut off.
Mushrooms: Two mushrooms cost a total of 75 cents.
Without stumps, the price was 60 cents.
Broccoli: A medium-sized broccoli cost 1 euro and without a strain 80 cents.
The result: If you start plucking leaves and stumps, you can save a few tens of centimetres per vegetable.
In percentage terms, the price of vegetables fell by as much as 20 percent.
So these purchases would have saved a total of 1.20 euros!
Neymar bought out of Barcelona - brass star signs five-year contract with PSG
Brazilian star Neymar has signed a five-year contract with French football club PSG, according to AFP.
Earlier on Thursday evening, it was reported that Neymar's representatives had paid FC Barcelona, who play in the Spanish league, a buy-out price of €222 million.
The staggering transfer sum of €222 million is the highest in football history.
Previously, the record was held by Manchester United, who paid €105 million for Frenchman Paul Pogba last summer.
The Spanish league put the brakes on the transfer earlier on Thursday when it rejected the first payment attempt by Neymar's representatives.
According to the league rules, the buying club cannot pay the buyout price directly to the seller, but the player must buy out his contract himself, which is done by recycling the money through the league.
In practice, PSG have paid the sum to Neymar and his representatives, who supplied the money to Barcelona via the league.
Neymar is expected to arrive in Paris on Friday.
He will potentially be introduced to a new home crowd in PSG's season opener against Amiens on Saturday.
Uefa will investigate the details
Barcelona also said in a statement that it would provide information about the payment to the European football federation Uefa so that the federation can determine any disciplinary action that may result from the incident.
Among others, Spanish league president Javier Tebas has accused PSG of violating Uefa's financial fair play rules with their spending.
Uefa can penalise a club that makes a loss of more than €30 million over three years.
According to Uefa, Neymar's transfer does not automatically breach its financial clauses.
Neymar's transfer to PSG will affect the club's finances for many years, but the impact cannot be predicted in advance.
PSG, for example, may sell several players for substantial sums, Uefa said.
PSG is owned by the state-owned Qatari company Qatar Sports Investment.
The club is chaired by former professional tennis player Nasser al-Khelaifi from Qatar.

Austin, 21, suffered severe burns from lightning strike - flare captured on airport security camera
Austin Dunn was doing normal work for an airplane at Southwest Florida International Airport with a couple of coworkers when suddenly the plane was struck by lightning from a rainy sky.
The force of lightning threw Dunn, who was near the wing of the plane, to the ground.
Dunn was rushed to the hospital.
He had third-degree burns all over his body.
My father called me and said my brother was electrocuted and he is in the hospital.
I just asked if he was alive," Austin's sister Autumn says.
Austin spent two weeks in the hospital.
In addition to burns, he had muscle damage and cerebral hemorrhage.
It was a tough experience for the whole family.
You don't expect that.
It's traumatizing for everyone," Autumn says.
According to an airport spokesperson, the lightning risk warning system was in place at the time of the incident and it is up to the carrier to decide whether to comply.
Pearson cuts 3,000 jobs and revitalizes business by cutting dividends
British education group Pearson announced on Friday it will cut 3,000 jobs and cut dividends by 72% as it embarks on a new restructuring programme in response to pressure on its business.
According to CEO John Fallon, the job cuts will mainly take place at the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019. The company already cut 4,000 jobs in connection with the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced another £300m cut in costs in May as part of its third austerity programme aimed at reviving a business weakened by rapid digitalisation.
Last month, Pearson decided to sell his stake in Penguin Random House to his partner Bertelsmann. The company announced that it will keep its outlook for the current year unchanged. Its revenue increased by one per cent in the first half of the year to £2.05 billion.
Attack on convoy in Kabul: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
A suicide bomber struck a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul. Officials said a NATO soldier was killed and several others were wounded in the attack.
According to a NATO statement, five soldiers and an interpreter were injured in the attack.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians were also killed in the attack in Kabul's Qarabagh district.
The explosion is the latest violent attack in Afghanistan this month. On Tuesday, 30 people were killed in an explosion at a mosque in Herat.
On Monday, two people were killed in a suicide bomber attack on the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
According to a NATO statement, Thursday night's explosion occurred when a joint patrol of NATO and the Afghan army was attacked by an "improvised explosive device carried by a person".
The statement said all the injured were in stable condition and were being treated at a U.S. military hospital at Bagram Airport.
According to correspondents, the strengthening of the Taliban and the presence of the ISIS terrorist organization in Qarabagh are of major concern to NATO forces near Bagram.
According to the UN, at least 1,662 civilians were killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, 20% of them in the capital.
At the end of July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in a suicide attack in Kabul, an area populated mainly by Shiite Muslims.
The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack.
On the last day of May, more than 150 people were killed in a bomb attack in central Kabul, the country's deadliest attack by a militant group since the Taliban were overthrown by US-led forces in 2001.
The violence highlights the volatile situation in Afghanistan as President Donald Trump considers whether to send more troops to the country to help the local military and police.
According to correspondents, the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also significantly undermined people's trust in the government, its policies and, in particular, President Ashraf Ghan.
EPA reverses decision to postpone implementation of smog regulations
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reversed its decision to delay implementing decisions taken during the Obama administration to reduce emissions from smog a day after 15 states sued the agency.
The EPA announced its decision to implement the 2015 so-called "ozone specifications" late Wednesday. According to the agency, the decision demonstrates its commitment to working with the states.
"We believe in dialogue and want to meet the needs of the states," Director Scott Pruitt said in a statement from the agency.
In June, Pruitt announced the agency's intention to postpone the implementation of ozone specifications by one year until October 2018. According to the definitions, smog pollution will be measured in specific parts of the country to determine where pollution needs to be reduced in line with higher air quality standards.
On Tuesday, the agency was sued by 15 predominantly Democrat-controlled states, including the District of Columbia. According to them, the moratorium was illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration has been looking for ways to relax Barack Obama-era environmental regulations. According to Trump, the measures are part of a broader program aimed at economic growth.
Trump's measures have been opposed by Democrats and environmentalists concerned about the health effects of rising emissions.
According to the EPA's website, inhaling ozone-containing air "can impair lung function and increase respiratory symptoms," such as asthma.
According to the Sydney Morning Herald, one of the leading figures of ISIS had also sent bomb building blocks to Sydney.
It was suspected that the bomb was supposed to be taken to the plane on July 15, but the attempt was interrupted before security checked.
Police will not elaborate on why the attempt was interrupted.
Another plan of the suspected terrorists was to build a device to emit toxic colourless gas and take it to a crowded public place, such as public transport.
Australian Deputy Commissioner for Federal Affairs Michael Phelan says the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
Four men were apprehended in police raids on Saturday because of suspected terrorist plans.
One of the men has been released, but his questioning is also continuing.
Neste's President and CEO: Renewable fuels performed well
Oil refiner Neste's profit before taxes declined, but beat forecasts in the second quarter.
According to CEO Matti Lievonen, the company performed well in Oil Products, sales volumes in Renewable Products reached a record level and the Development of Marketing & Services' operating profit was in the right direction.
Last year, comparable operating profit was improved by the US Blenders Tax Credit.
According to Lievonen, Renewable Products' operating profit remained at a good level this year thanks to higher sales volumes and more favourable markets, even though the tax relief ended.
The implementation of our strategy is progressing well.
We will continue to focus on our customers and growth projects and complete the strategic investments we announced earlier in 2017," Lievonen said.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko discuss a possible match in their first meeting
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course heading into the most interesting boxing match in the under-66.7kg division in the near future, faced each other for the first time on Thursday.
The men were in their own rooms at ESPN's Los Angeles sports station until WBC's undefeated lightweight champion Mikey Garcia walked down the aisle to greet Lomachenko, the WBO upper-featherweight champion.
Garcia defeated former four-weight world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday on Showtime by unanimous decision. Since then, Garcia and Lomachenko have been in the top five on a list comparing boxers in different weight classes.
Garcia held out his right hand and asked, "How's it going, Master?
Good luck!"
Lomachenko will defend his title against Miguel Marriaga on ESPN at seven o'clock on Saturday.
As the duo posed for photographers, Lomachenko's manager, Egis Klimas, remarked that the men's match would be "perfect in terms of sizes."
"I'm a former featherweight," Garcia recalled.
"I moved up the league [63.5 pounds] for Broner, but I'm not that big.
I am small to 63.5 kg.
I want to go back to the lightweight division.
He needs to move up to the lightweight division [61.2 pounds]. Then we can grip.
That's what our fans are hoping for.
Let's fulfill their wishes."
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boxing needs this fight."
Klimas asked if the match should be held on a pay channel. It's part of his strategy for Lomachenko to make his lightweight debut later this year and fight Garcia (37-0, 30 knockout wins) next summer. Garcia would also be interested in facing the winner of the match between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell. Linares and Campbell will fight in the lightweight division at Forum on September 23.
"The match could be on the pay channel because fans have asked for it," Garcia said, later stating that he was willing to fight on the channel that offers the best prize package.
"We are the most interesting names.
No one else attracts as much attention.
I'll be fine as soon as an agreement is reached..."
Garcia said he appreciates Lomachenko as an "incredible fighter" and plans to go see Saturday's fight.
Lomachenko interrupted Garcia's profuse praise and said the three-weight champion from Riverside looked "really slow. Sorry, Mike... But you needed that knockout."
Garcia said he focused first on showing punch power and then on boxing.
The men said they felt they wanted the match between them to happen even stronger.
"This is the match we are waiting for.
No other match attracts as much attention and interest.
I'm definitely in this thing," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said he was looking forward to fighting the best. "Mikey is a legend.
It's going to be a great match."
Average salary €5,300, training whatever happens - investment advice situation has been "wild and free"
The quality of investment advice has been a hot topic lately.
Most recently, Helsingin Sanomat reported on Ritva, 68, to whom the investment advisor of a brokerage firm spoke full nonsense when selling investment products.
The rules on investment advisers and the sale of various investment products will be tightened at the beginning of next year.
The tightening is based on the new MiFID which will apply from the beginning of next year.
At present, the assessment of the competence of investment advisors and employees selling investment products is mainly based on self-regulation.
The Act does not define competence requirements.
The financial sector (FA) itself recommends that those working in investment services complete its own APV1 or APV2 degree.
The financial sector has authorised the organisation of degrees for a company called APV-sijoitustutkintot Oy, whose degree working group includes experts from the Financial Supervisory Authority (FIN-FSA), universities and operators in the field.
The scope of the degrees is 12-15 ECTS credits, and their exams are prepared by Aalto EE, Aalto University Executive Education Oy, which provides management development services.
Its website states that, in general, both exams are "quite extensive in terms of requirements".
The study material for the degrees includes 10-15 books as well as numerous other guides and works.
Markku Savikko, Managing Director of APV Investment Degrees Ltd, says that the pass rate of exams is roughly 70%.
Roughly all of the personnel of the largest banks offering investment services have completed either the APV1 or APV2 examination, because their completion is mandatory according to the companies' own rules.
Then there are smaller brokerage firms, without naming names, whose personnel seem to have avoided completing degrees," Savikko says.
According to him, there are "a few" such brokerage firms.
According to Saviko, 13,000–14,000 people have completed the APV1 degree since 2000 and about 3,000 people have completed the more demanding APV2 degrees recommended for investment advisors.
Some brokerage firms consider having a degree to be an advantage.
Many other industries have significantly stricter competence requirements.
Savikko says that the recommendation of the Financial Services Finland requires the completion of APV degrees, because then competence related to the investment sector is ensured.
According to Statistics Finland, financial and investment advisors earn an average of several thousand euros per month, including commissions, fringe benefits and performance-based bonuses.
The average earnings for regular working hours of monthly-paid employees are approximately EUR 5,300.
On average, men working in these tasks earn good EUR 5,900 per month and women over EUR 4,500.
The tenth of the highest earners earns, on average, around EUR 8,100.
One-tenth of the highest earning men earn over EUR 9,000 per month or more, one-tenth of the highest earning women earn EUR 6,400 or more.
Investment advice in accordance with the Act on Investment Services can only be provided by an authorised company.
Until now, self-regulation has been relied on at the employee and task level.
According to the FSA, its audit revealed individual cases where the professional skills and qualifications of the investment adviser were not sufficient based on the adviser's activities.
In principle, you can also act as a seller of investment products, even if your professional skills and qualifications are at a low level.
In principle, the situation in this regard has been wild and free.
Many other industries have considerably stricter competence requirements, Savikko says.
According to Saviko, this will be tightened from the beginning of next year with the new Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II).
It requires that each company is responsible for ensuring that the personnel providing investment services are sufficiently competent.
The Financial Supervisory Authority, on the other hand, will be given the authority to determine what needs to be done.
Marko Hovi, Market Supervisor at the FSA, says that one of the clear changes to the current situation is the regulation on the competence and experience requirements for investment advisors and sellers of investment products.
According to Hovi, the new requirements apply to both investment firms' own staff and tied agents who sell products on behalf of a company.
Hovi says that according to the government proposal issued by the Ministry of Finance, the FSA will be given the authority to determine competence and experience.
What exactly they will be decided during the coming autumn.
The company must continue to provide the necessary training and, if necessary, monitoring and supplementary training.
All this must be documented, and the company has the burden of proving that this has also been done.
Hovi specifies that, in practice, the company must, for example, map out the job descriptions of its personnel on an individual level.
There will certainly be different levels of requirements depending on whether it is investment advice or selling products.
According to Hovi, another new feature is the requirement to work for a fixed period with someone more experienced if the skills or experience are not at a sufficient level.
That is, if the company hires a new employee who does not quite meet the specified criteria, the employee must work for a certain amount of time with the person who meets the criteria.
According to Hovi, the change will tighten the rules and make them more concrete.
The legislation on the sale of investment products will be tightened at the beginning of 2018.
Image: 787 Dreamliner airliner "draws" a giant plane on top of the United States
The route flown by the plane was drawn over the United States by Flightradar24.
The flight was carried out Thursday with a 787 Dreamliner, which Boeing used to test the durability of the aircraft's Rolls Royce engines on a long flight.
The plane, which departed from Seattle, flew a distance of 15,700 kilometers in 18 hours and 1 minute, which is longer than any regular scheduled commercial flight in the world.
The flight remained within the borders of the United States throughout the voyage.
It flew through a total of 17 states.
Imatra's resilient beach swimming school students are not bothered by rain or sunshine - Iines Kaikkonen splashed persistently with the help of a swimming bug
Iines Kaikkonen progressed at a good pace, followed by Taina Itkonen.
Imatra beach swimming schools will run in Liette and Lempukka this week and next.
Even though it rains sometimes and then shines again, the young swimmers are not too bad, praises swimming school leader Taina Itkonen.
In this week's swimming schools, a total of 13 children will increase their swimming skills, next week about a dozen.
The number of children in the coming week was affected by the fact that school and preschool will start by then, Itkonen estimates.
The Imatra Beach Swimming School is organised in cooperation between the Sports Unites project and the City of Imatra.
On Thursday, Sludge beach had a nice atmosphere.
The sun was shining and the young swim school students were practicing staying afloat with swimming bugs, some even without.
Smaller siblings also enjoyed the water.
Iines Kaikkonen, 5, was initially hesitant about going deeper into the water.
However, Taina Itkonen encouraged him to splash towards the shore.
It's going great!
Iines Kaikkonen said that she has gone swimming a lot this summer.
Sludge beach is good for him.
Like Iines Kaikkonen, Vili Huhtanen, 5, practiced swimming persistently with the swimming bug.
You, too, can be satisfied with today's achievements, the swimming instructor praised.
Jami Kallio, 4, wanted to go to water wars sometimes.
Ilona Villberg, who watched her daughter Anna Villberg, 6, swim from the beach, thinks the beach swimming school is a good start for learning to swim.
Even though the weather has been what happens, Anna has loved going here every day.
Sometimes I had to warm up.
Swimming school students packed onto the pier.
The boys had plenty of fun with the frog found on the beach.
Milja Luukkonen, 3, and Anna Villberg spread towels, snacked on fruit and basked in the day.
In the water, teaching continued, but there was no hurry on the pier.
The kind of thing that doesn't belong in summer.
The Unknown Soldier Sells Toilet Brushes - "Here's Such a Connecting Story"
You see all sorts of things.
Sinituote, a manufacturer of cleaning products, launched the Unknown Soldier product line a couple of days ago.
That is, dish brushes and laundry racks - as well as a "toilet brush with edging brush".
The Unknown Soldier refers to the film that will premiere in the autumn and the marketing of the film.
Still, there's something special about the combination, and the products have been mocked on social media: When will the Unknown sanitary pads come?
You have to call the company and ask what this is all about.
What does Aino Määttä, Executive Vice President of Sinituote, say?
We are the film's partner.
We are supporting this film, as are many other companies.
We wanted to support Finnish production and cult films, Määttä says.
According to him, the products will be presented in stores with special displays, and the film will thus gain visibility.
Isn't there something a bit funny about this - often when you think that the products and the stories associated with them have something in common?
There is such a unifying story here that we are a Finnish operator and these are Finnish products, Määttä says.
According to him, the company supports the same basic Finnish values that are supported by those who have seen the Old Unknown Soldier.
And cleaning is no stranger to military culture either, Määttä points out.
Other corporate partners in the film The Unknown Soldier include Valio, Hartwall, Saludo, VR and Sato.
So far, Hartwall's vichys, which can be found under the names Rokka, Hietanen and Koskela, have been launched on the market.
Unknown products were already being picked up by Suomen Kuvalehti's blogger Kalle Kinnunen
Coffee and watches are already available.
Kinnunen points out that there is still time before the film premieres, so there is still more to come.
Unknown partners have not yet revealed their war products, such as Valio, Jalostaja, Neste and the German retail chain Lidl, Kinnunen writes.
New age test results for Swedish asylum seekers published
The latest results of medical age tests for asylum seekers in Sweden have been published. The results of tests carried out using the new assessment method reveal that more than 80% of those tested were determined to be over 18 years old. However, not everyone considers the tests reliable.
The Swedish National Forensic Agency began testing earlier this year.
The tests can be used to estimate the age of asylum seekers more accurately than before. The new test was introduced after the Swedish Immigration Service was criticised for failing to determine the real age of applicants claiming to be minors.
So far, the Finnish Immigration Service has commissioned 6,880 tests, and the Forensic Office has now published the results of 2,481 tests. The tests were carried out between mid-March and late July 2017.
Of those tested, 80 per cent, i.e. asylum seekers in 2002, were determined to be over 18 years of age. In addition, in 25 cases, the Bureau of Forensic Medicine determined that the test subject was "possibly 18 years of age or older."
In 432 cases, it was concluded that the asylum seeker was "possibly under 18 years of age".
Tests were carried out only in cases where there was reason to doubt the age indicated by the applicant.
Johan Göransson from the Office of Forensic Medicine says that the results are consistent with those of previous months.
"The numbers are pretty consistent. There are no big differences from previous months' statistics," he told The Local.
Although a large percentage of applicants were determined to be over 18 years old, that does not necessarily mean that applicants lied about their age.
In May, the agency released the results of 581 tests and reported that in 442 cases there were "indications that the subject is 18 years of age or older."
When Svenska Dagbladet examined the same results, it turned out that in 243 cases the applicant had openly stated that he would turn 18 this year.
The medical age assessment method used in the tests involves taking X-rays of wisdom teeth and magnetic resonance images of the knee joints. Then dentists and radiologists analyze the images. The method has also been criticised.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at Karolinska Institutet, whose work includes assessing human biological maturity. The assessment can be used to determine whether the person has reached puberty earlier or later than usual.
"I've had reason to think about it, and I don't think the method used is the right one.
Determining biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't determine age for sure, we shouldn't pretend we can do it," he told Metro newspaper.
However, Göransson from the Forensic Medical Office defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, the risk of defining a child as an adult is low.
The risk is greatest in a situation where the test subject will soon turn 18. Then the risk is about 10 percent."
Ilonen collapsed 30 places in Scotland
A five-over-par score in the third round took Mikko Ilonen down 30 notches in the European Tour of Golf competition in Scotland.
Ilonen started Saturday day in shared 11th place, but was found sharing 41st place at the end of the round.
In difficult weather, Ilonen accumulated one double bogey with three bogeys.
Others had a hard time, too.
Englishman Ian Poulter moved up to share the top spot in the one-under-par round, despite saying there was plenty of work to be done holding the umbrella.
The weather was brutal, but I hung on and in the end the day was good," Poulter said.
He shares the top spot with compatriot Callum Shinkwin and Australian Andrew Dodt.
West Virginia governor changes party
West Virginia's Democratic governor, Jim Justice, announced Thursday night at a Trump campaign rally that he is switching parties.
"The Democrats simply rejected me," Justice said.
"Today I can tell you, after many prayers and thorough reflection... Today, I'm telling West Virginians that I can no longer help you as Democratic governor."
The crowd erupted into resounding applause.
"Tomorrow I registered as a member of the Republican Party," Justice added.
"As a coach, I would tell you it's time for another game."
Trump previously promised a major announcement at a campaign event in West Virginia.
Trump won West Virginia by 42 points because Justice did not support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice was elected governor in 2016. According to Forbes, he is the only billionaire in his state.
He inherited a mining company from his father and owns coal mines in five states.
His fortune is worth about $ 1.59 billion.
The Republican National Committee (RNC) released a statement Thursday night saying that "Governor Justice's party change is yet another blow to the Democratic Party, which prefers to build barriers rather than a better America."
"Democrats have only 15 governors and fewer states than ever before. In this situation, Justice's announcement is the latest setback for a party that lacks leadership and cannot find a positive, people-uniting message," RNC spokeswoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
Lightning sown damage - Thursday becoming even the toughest thunderstorm day of summer
Towards the end of the week, there will also be more thunderstorms in southern Finland.
During the past week, thunderstorms have occurred especially in the central and northern parts of the country and in Southwest Finland.
During the night between Wednesday and Thursday, lightning strikes started several fires.
According to the meteorologist, Thursday could become the toughest thunderstorm day of the summer so far.
Thunderstorms have finally found Finland as well.
During the past week, lightning has occurred especially in the central and northern parts of the country and in Southwest Finland.
On Pöytyä, lightning struck the electrical switchboard of the terraced house, causing a small fire.
The rescue department received a report of the fire about a quarter to midnight on Wednesday.
The switchboard was located in the sauna at the end of the terraced house.
The rescue department dismantled the roof and wall to find fire hotspots and quickly extinguished the fire.
A total of eleven apartments were left without electricity, but personal injuries were avoided.
In Loimaa, on the other hand, lightning set an outbuilding ablaze on Harjulantie before midnight.
When the rescue department arrived, the building was already in full fire stage, and all the rescue department could do was prevent the fire from spreading.
An outbuilding of about fifty square meters burned to the ground.
In Rääkkylä, in the direction of Kuopio, lightning struck a detached house.
The residents of the house were outside the building and witnessed a flaming lightning strike.
The rescue department went to the scene to check the incident, but this time the lightning did not cause a fire - only a few fuses burst.
In traffic, thunderstorms caused problems on the railway line between Seinäjoki and Vaasa, when a lightning strike damaged the traffic control system.
The fault was reported between eight and nine on Thursday morning, after which trains in the meantime were replaced by buses.
The problem was not fixed until shortly before five o'clock in the afternoon.
Since then, train traffic has been able to continue normally also on the thunderstorm-ravaged railway section.
Lightning has wreaked havoc in different parts of Finland.
However, lightning has been relatively low this summer.
These thunderstorms this summer have been absolutely miserable! estimates Jari Tuovinen, on-call meteorologist at the Finnish Meteorological Institute.
The thunderstorms on Wednesday and Thursday have mainly been moderate in intensity, but thanks to the low lightning balance in the summer, it also feels strong to many.
This might seem like a very loud thunderstorm, but that's what it has been compared to this summer's thunderstorms, Tuovinen says.
On Wednesday, ground lightning flashed 1,700 times, and Thursday has even had the potential for the heaviest thunderstorm day of the summer: by about 4 p.m., there were 1,790 ground lightning strikes.
If the lightning continues into the early evening, it will be possible to reach more than two thousand lightning bolts, Tuovinen predicts.
The previous record weak thunderstorm year was in 2015, when the amount of lightning during the year was about 30,000.
By Wednesday, this year's lightning tally had risen to 18,386.
So there is still catching up to be done so that this year does not break the "record" of two years ago.
However, the thunderstorm can be expected to continue.
According to Tuovinen, the air mass over Finland will remain warm and humid during the rest of the week, which is a favourable environment for thunderstorms.
The main focus of thunderstorms is likely to shift from the northernmost parts of the country to the south on Saturday, where days of around 2,000 lightning could be recorded on both Saturday and Sunday.
A more uniform rain front is expected in the central parts of the country.
According to Tuovinen, thunderstorms occur only rarely in such cases.
Coe praises Russia's 'open-minded' apology for doping scandal
World athletics boss Sebastian Coe praised what he described as an open-minded apology issued by Russia over the doping scandal on Thursday. However, Coe added that it was not yet time to end Russia's ban on participation.
Russian athletics director Dmitry Shljahtin said at the IAAF Congress on Thursday on the eve of the World Cup that Russia's ban was appropriate and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he felt sorry "for all the athletes who were deprived of a gold or silver medal at the Games."
Despite his comment, the IAAF Congress voted to extend the ban. Russia was excluded from athletics competitions in November 2015 after a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report presented evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I think his answer today was very direct. It was a very open-minded performance," IAAF President Coe told reporters.
"The entire Council and Congress welcomed the fact that the Russian Athletics Federation acknowledged that the country was going through difficult times and announced that it would do everything possible to reorganize its activities."
Coe said he was also "pleased" that Russia accepted the terms of ending the ban.
"I think we had a very constructive day and progress has been made, but Congress supports the task force's recommendation that now is not the time to end Russia's ban," Coe said.
"We must do everything we can to normalise the situation in the coming months.
The guiding principle has always been that we want to keep clean athletes separate from a corrupt system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes will compete with neutral athlete status at the World Championships in Athletics, which begin in London on Friday. They have met the IAAF's strict criteria.
Rune Andersen, head of the IAAF task force, said Monday that Russia still needs to meet many requirements before its status can be restored.
"Testing is still inadequate, and banned coaches continue to operate freely," he told reporters Friday after his presentation to the IAAF Council in London.
Production company disappointed with the poor success of Tom of Finland
The film Tom of Finland did not turn out to be as successful as the makers had hoped, reports Yle.
To be honest, I'm disappointed, admits Annika Sucksdorff, CEO of Helsinki Film, who produced the film, in an interview with Yle.
I was afraid that the Finnish film audience might be conservative, and it seems that it is.
The film premiered in February 2017.
By the end of June, it had reached more than 100,000 viewers, which is low compared to the film's budget, about five million euros.
It didn't turn out to be a lottery win, but now it's important that investors get theirs back.
If the film had been more successful domestically, they would have already received their money.
Now we have to wait for small streams from foreign distributions," says Sucksdorff.
Tom of Finland is a film directed by Dome Karukoski.
How football's financial rules affect Neymar's transfer to Paris
Regulations restricting the spending of European football clubs do not prevent Neymar from being transferred from Barcelona, Spain, to Paris Saint-Germain in France. It is football's most expensive transfer ever.
Its possible consequences for Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) will be decided by UEFA, which regulates European football, which could prevent teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League.
In 2011, UEFA introduced fair play financial rules. According to them, PSG must be able to prove that Neymar's transfer has been financed without major losses.
Barcelona were paid €222 million to terminate the Brazilian's contract, and Neymar's annual salary at the new club runs into tens of millions of dollars.
Neymar's transfer to France involves a wide range of financial considerations.
PSG will have no trouble paying Neymar's transfer fee and adding him to their all-star roster, as the club is funded by Qatar's oil-rich royal family.
Clubs are allowed to spend large sums of money on the acquisition of players, but these must be balanced by real sources of income so that football-related business is not loss-making.
The Fair Play Financial Code was drawn up on the initiative of Michel Platini, a Frenchman elected President of UEFA in 2007.
As a former footballer, Platini felt that the pursuit of success through debt was cheating and led to serious problems if banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, the focus of fair play financial rules shifted from club debts to monitoring their losses.
The change meant that Roman Abramovich's business model, which was first used at Chelsea in 2003, became significantly more difficult to implement. Abramovich bought a promising team, spent huge sums on player acquisitions and created a global brand.
The current three-year evaluation period of the Fair Play Financial Code runs until 2018. During this period, clubs are allowed to make a loss of up to €30 million.
Although Platini was scandalously forced to step down as UEFA president in 2015, his successor, Aleksander Ceferin, also wants to curb the clubs' reckless spending.
"The fair play rules are still in place and we will continue to apply them in the future," Andrea Traverso, UEFA's head of financial rules for fair play, told the Associated Press last week.
Although PSG paid Neymar out of his contract in a lump sum, they can spread the amount over the entire duration of his new contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so the transfer amount can be recorded as an annual expense of €44.4 million for the next five years.
Based on fair play financial rules, the first sanctions were handed out in 2014. The biggest sanctions were imposed on PSG and Abu Dhabi-funded Manchester City.
PSG was fined €60 million, which was later reduced to €20 million. In addition, the club was ordered to limit its Champions League squad to 21 players for the 2014–15 season instead of the usual 25.
UEFA monitors clubs that may try to circumvent its financial regulations by increasing their income through companies linked to club owners.
For example, if a Qatari company supports PSG but the value of the aid is considered to be above the normal market level, UEFA will not count the aid as actual revenue.
This happened when UEFA decided in 2014 that the Qatar Tourism Authority's support for PSG was excessive.
It has also emerged that part of Neymar's earnings at PSG could be funded by fees from Qatar's 2022 FIFA World Cup organising committee.
However, PSG and the organising committee have denied that Neymar is being made an ambassador for the World Cup. It would be very easy for UEFA to reveal such an arrangement.
Due to PSG's previous sanctions, UEFA is monitoring attempts to circumvent the rules even more closely than usual.
Sources familiar with the situation said on Thursday that UEFA had not held talks with PSG over a transfer for Neymar.
The sources gave an interview to the Associated Press on the condition that their identities would not be revealed as they were not authorised to discuss PSG's situation.
According to the latest published financial statements, PSG's turnover for the period 2015–2016 was €542.4 million and operating profit exceeded €10 million.
Last period's financial statements have not yet been published.
PSG expect Neymar's arrival to attract new sponsors and boost sales of club merchandise and jerseys.
The club estimates that its turnover will increase by at least 30 percent with Neymar's contract.
Clearly irritated by the departure of one of the best players in the world, the Spanish league tried to complicate Neymar's transfer. It allegedly violated the financial rules of fair play.
"This is a clear case of financial doping, both for the club and for the state," Spanish league president Javier Tebas told Spanish newspaper AS. By state, he was referring to PSG's Qatari ownership.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger also has reservations about state funding of the football club. Arsenal is owned by an American sports tycoon.
"The incident is the result of ownership that has completely changed the landscape of football over the past 15 years," Wenger said Thursday.
"Anything is possible after the state owns a football team.
It will be very difficult to comply with the financial rules of fair play. There are so many interests involved in a famous player representing the state."
Now it's urgent: Finland's World Championship athletes' coach stuck in Helsinki
Long jumper Arttu Pajulahti and triple jumper Kristiina Mäkelä's coach Suren Ghazaryan is stuck in Helsinki even though he is supposed to be coaching at the World Championships in Athletics in London.
Kristiina Mäkelä may have to compete without the advice of her coach.
Pajulahti will compete tomorrow in the long jump qualification and Mäkelä in the triple jump qualification on Saturday.
However, the duo's coach, Armenian Ghazaryan, has not been granted a visa to the UK.
Ghazaryan has tried to deal with the matter at the British embassy to no avail.
The coach has an invitation from the World Cup organizers as a document, but even that has not been valid for a visa.
I wonder if this is one of the first symptoms of Brexit, or what," said coaching director Jorma Kemppainen.
In the past, he has always dealt successfully with visas himself, but now there are some problems.
He will do everything he can to get there.
Ghazaryan has worked for the Finnish Athletics Federation SUL for years.
It doesn't matter that much.
As long as someone looks at the steps in the stadium, Arttu Pajulahti said of his coach's possible absence.
World Cup medal for Finland from London requires a miracle
The World Championships in Athletics begin in London today, Friday, and last for just over a week, ending on Sunday 13 August.
Athletics, cross-country skiing and ice hockey are the sports that Finnish bench athletes are passionate about year after year, whether they succeed or not.
In the hearts of bench athletes, success is measured in medals.
Of course, there are other metrics.
Less attention is paid to the beautiful growth stories of young athletes from one prestigious competition to another, where experience matures the athlete's performance to such a level that a World Championship medal for adults is genuinely possible.
Now Finland's small World Cup team does not have such young athletes, nor even veterans.
A World Cup medal for Finland requires a miracle.
Fortunately, the interest and surprise of sports means that miracles can happen.
It pulls the athletes on the bench to the television screen and glues them to watch the Games, even though the medals in London are not decided until late at night due to the time difference.
At the previous World Championships in Athletics in 2015, Finland won one bronze medal.
It was brought by javelin thrower Tero Pitkämäki.
Daring people expect a medal from Pitkämäki even now, although the recent results of him and other throwers and Pitkämäki's failure to qualify at last summer's major competitions tell another story.
Whatever happens at these Games, Pitkämäki will go down in history as a great Finnish sports hero.
For the other Finnish athletes at the Games, reaching the final or setting their own record is a good enough performance.
Hope and faith in the realistic medal hunt in Finnish athletics in the coming years is given by good success in international youth competitions again this summer.
Breeding young talent and financially supporting its work is more important than maintaining a small elite group of representative athletes.
Success does not come overnight, but requires years of sweaty work from athletes and patience from both coaching and bench athletes.
Finns also know how to appreciate international sports stars and enjoy their unique performances.
Hopefully, the London Games will go down in history as the Games of Usain Bolt and Mo Farah, and not, for example, because of terrorist deterrence or cowardly attacks.
Enni Rukajärvi second in Copper's big air - "But yes annoying"
Snowboarder Enni Rukajärvi has finished second in the big air competition in Colorado, USA.
The runner-up at Copper Mountain is Rukajärvi's best in the big air World Cup.
The women's race was won by Jamie Anderson of the United States.
Rukajärvi collected 147 points in the competition.
On his last jump, he attempted a caballerial 1080 for the first time at the Games, and it was very close to succeeding.
I feel good and feel good now, but I'm sorry that the last jump didn't go quite right.
I will try it again in the competitions from now on, says Rukajärvi.
In snowboarding big air, a competitor jumps from a jump made specifically for the sport.
Viking Line's new high-speed vessel stuck in harbour in Helsinki
Viking's new fast vessel, FSTR, is seriously behind schedule.
The fast ferry was supposed to depart from Helsinki to Tallinn at 6 pm.
The ship was eight ashore loading in progress.
The ship arrived in Helsinki already late.
For at least an hour and a half I've been waiting to get on board.
Now the queue of cars is moving slightly," said Johannes Rebane, an Estonian waiting to board the ship at the Port of Helsinki, at 7.30 p.m.
Rebane speculated that the new vessel had suffered a technical failure.
Rebane said that the shipping company had brought water bottles to those waiting to board the ship in their cars.
Viking's communications manager Christa Grönlund told IS that there was a technical failure.
It was repaired at the Port of Helsinki.
The ship departs from Helsinki a couple of hours late.
Grönlund says that the ship will also be delayed by a couple of hours from the return journey to Tallinn.
The ship was supposed to depart from Tallinn and back to Helsinki at 20:15.
A 42-metre special transport will disrupt traffic on Kuutostie on Thursday evening
The 42-metre-long special transport will move from Muukko to the port of Mustola on Thursday evening.
The transport departing at nine o'clock should arrive by eleven o'clock in the evening.
The police will direct traffic on Kuutostie, and traffic may be stopped from time to time.
From Mälkiä, the transport proceeds along road 13 to the port of Mustola.
Small Circle Nostalgia: Wet Hot American Summer and Comrade Detective
The story simultaneously yearns for the characters' glory days in the '80s and grunge of the '90s (at the time, David Wain and Michael Showalter were making the brilliant sketch series The State for MTV) and its own time – 2001, before Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, Paul Rudd, and the show's other stars moved on to bigger things in their careers.
As a cultural product, it is both a parody and a depiction of the constant reminiscence we are stuck in in the Facebook era.
As a commercial product, it feels outdated.
First Day of Camp worked surprisingly well, and not only because of its absurd humor (among other things, it told the backstory of a can of vegetables speaking in the voice of H. Jon Benjamin).
The crux of the joke is that middle-aged actors play lustful teenagers approaching adulthood. Emphasizing it makes the impossibility of reaching for the past part of the joke.
Ten Years Later, in which adults play adults, is less emotional and its parody is more fragmented: it parodies 90s stalker films such as the horror film The Hand That Rocks the Cradle.
At one point, one of the characters digs out an Apple Powerbook, inline skates and "other stuff from 1991".
Many of the stories are the same as before.
The kind-hearted Coop (Michael Showalter) is now a writer, but still hasn't gotten over Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
And there's a crazy plot involving Ronald Reagan (also Michael Showalter) with his partner in crime George H. W. Bush (aptly played by Michael Ian Black).
As always in such series, the best thing is the side paths.
It's especially fun to see the ever-young Paul Rudd wearing a tassel of beards under his lower lip, aka Matt Dillon's "soul patch" from the movie Singles. Andy, the king of the camp, played by Rudd, is starting to be an old guy.
Moments of random madness might propel this series into flight as a kind of recursive Seven Up! series until it reaches its obvious conclusion: Wet Hot American Summer – Twenty Years Later. In its final scene, a group of friends goes to the premiere of Wet Hot American Summer.
Amazon's Comrade Detective series, on the other hand, appeals to a different kind of nostalgia: The Americans' Cold War spirit, Atomic Blonde, and even the GLOW wrestling imagery where East meets West.
The comedy series was created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka and directed by Rhys Thomas. It is made into a Romanian police drama of the 1980s, in which a Bucharest cop fight for truth, atheism and Marxism-Leninism.
Starring the tough-faced Gregor and idealistic Iosef are Florin Piersic Jr and Corneliu Ulici. Their lines have been dubbed in English by Channing Tatum (executive producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a great idea,
But it is not much more than that.
There are some good visual jokes in the series (cops spend time watching chess on TV the same way Americans watch football).
It features a cast of famous voice actors, including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny. Spotting them makes for a fun game.
However, Comrade Detective gets too caught up in the imitation of clumsy socialist drama – there's a killer hiding behind a Reagan mask, for example. That's why the series often really starts to feel like clumsy propaganda.
Six long episodes are too long, and the humor of the series is neither fast nor rich enough.
In a nutshell, the series might work better as agitprop satire, for example when Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the U.S. Embassy and there are always two fat men in the lobby devouring hamburgers.
The message to the imagined communist public is that Western culture can make everything a consumer commodity and fast food.
The fictional Romanian creators of the series were not wrong: we devoured our own recent history and theirs as well.
Toni Tauru from Kouvola will take to the ring in Macau on Saturday against former UFC fighter
Toni Tauru wants to keep the match going.
Toni Tauru will face a tough bone in Macau, as Brazilian Leandro Issa was still fighting in the UFC organization last year.
The Brazilian also holds a black belt in jujutsu and a world championship in the sport.
For once, I'm fighting someone older than me.
It's funny," says 32-year-old Tauru.
The Kouvola native was supposed to get into the ring in Indonesia last Saturday.
The match was cancelled due to logistical problems, but three fights were quickly scheduled for the Chinese autonomous region of Macau.
Tauru has never encountered such a thing before.
This was the first time my match was cancelled.
It was annoying because it took a lot of time to prepare and train.
However, the fighter is pleased that a new date was set for the fight.
Waiting for a week has little effect on preparation.
The transfer does not affect the condition, as it does not improve in a week.
Your fitness can get even worse if you train too much now.
In his last few fights, Tauru has faced opponents whose strengths lie in standing up.
This time the situation is different.
Issa from Kouvola is described as a typical Brazilian.
He's a pretty aggressive fighter.
My guess is he'll come out hard in the first round and try to take it to the mat.
He has won the world jujutsu championship, so he can wrestle.
Kouvolalainen's previous match did not go according to plan.
Tauru was badly punched in the eye by Filipino Kevin Belingon, and the victory fell to the Philippines.
I've never fought so well, especially upright: he didn't get a single hit.
As I started pouring, he hit the corner of my eye.
It annoyed me for a very long time.
New motivation
Some MMA fighters fight once a year, while others get in the ring more frequently.
For example, the upcoming opponent Issa last fought in September.
Tauru, on the other hand, had three matches last year.
Now we are facing the second battle of the current year.
At times, the pace has gotten heavy.
In recent years, I've been training and being in good shape all the time.
But I've only fought for the sake of fighting.
When the 32-year-old heard about the upcoming encounter, he decided to change scenery for a while.
I was training in Espoo and got the joy of doing things back.
We got really good training with one guy from Sweden as well.
Training was a great help, as on Saturday the Kouvola resident will have to prepare for a physical struggle.
I have been able to train against opponents of the same size and practice a vertical match.
Fighting upright is the 32-year-old's main tactic.
Must hit sensibly.
If the opportunity arises, I will of course take it to the plot myself.
Take-downs should not be given away for free, as they consume the most.
Macau attracts Tauru, who has previously fought in China.
It is reportedly China's Las Vegas.
I believe there will be a big and great evening ahead.
Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce that it will keep interest rates unchanged as economic growth has been sluggish and easing inflation has put an end to speculation of rate hikes.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain sluggish. The bank postponed interest rate hikes as families' incomes come under increasing pressure.
The decision-makers of the central bank's monetary policy committee voted 6-2 to keep interest rates at 0.25%. There was even less support for raising interest rates this month due to sluggish economic growth.
In its quarterly inflation bulletin, the bank lowered its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7% and its forecast for 2018 to 1.6%. It also warned that household incomes are under increasing pressure as inflation is expected to continue to accelerate to close to three per cent in the autumn.
However, according to the bank, interest rate hikes will be needed in the coming years to curb inflation fuelled by Brexit. In addition, the bank indicated that borrowing costs may need to be increased more than expected by the financial markets.
In addition, the members of the committee decided to cancel part of the massive economic package that began implementation a year ago in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum.
The bank will end the Term Funding Scheme in February 2018, although it is now expected to provide an additional £15 million in low-cost financing to banks through the scheme, totalling £115 million.
The minutes of the Bank's interest rate decision state: "According to the forecast of the Monetary Policy Commission, the slow development of GDP will continue in the coming years as the fall in real household incomes reduces consumption."
On interest rates, the bank reiterated that "some tightening of monetary policy" is needed to curb inflation "somewhat broadly" than market expectations.
The market is currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of 2018 and the second in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that any increases will be "gradual" and "limited".
In May, the bank forecast growth of 1.9% for this year and 1.7% for next year.
It now kept its growth forecast for 2018 at 1.8%.
The pound weakened against the dollar and euro as a result of the news.
Against the dollar, the pound depreciated 0.5% to $1.31. Against the euro, it weakened by 0.4 per cent and stood at EUR 1.11.
The decision to keep interest rates unchanged came after weaker-than-expected growth rates dampened increased expectations of rate hikes. GDP grew by 0.3 per cent in the second quarter and by 0.2 per cent in the first quarter.
The bank expects growth to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter but to pick up slightly at the end of the year.
Its latest inflation survey offered little hope to households suffering from soaring inflation and meagre wage increases. According to the bank, the situation will get even worse before it gets better.
The bank added that monetary policy "cannot prevent" a drop in income in the next few years. However, it expects wage developments to recover "significantly" at the end of the three-year forecast horizon.
The economy will also be boosted by strong growth in demand for British products as a result of the weak pound. It offsets part of the effect of the fall in private consumption.
The decision comes a year after interest rates were cut to 0.25% following a shocking EU referendum that plunged the pound into decline.
The Bank estimates that the full impact of the decision is likely to start to be felt in prices and the economy only after four years.
Prior to the central bank's latest decision, calls for interest rate hikes had become increasingly vocal as inflation put pressure on households. Three policymakers called for a 0.5% rate hike in July.
Inflation eased to 2.6% last month from 2.9% in June. However, according to the bank, this was expected and inflation will rise again in the coming months.
According to the bank, the two per cent overshoot was "entirely" due to the weak pound.
"Given the recent decline in swap rates, competition in the mortgage market appears to be intensifying further as lenders frantically seek customers and want to end the year strong," said Andrew Montlake, president of Coreco Mortgage Brokers.
"The market looks particularly good for those whose current loan agreement is about to expire. Renewal contracts are becoming more popular, have low interest rates and offer cost-free options."
NHS prescribes 10,000 controversial HIV drugs
From September, patients may be prescribed a "revolutionary" HIV prevention drug. The Supreme Court settled a dispute over the funding of the drug in England's National Health Service (NHS).
The NHS announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) will be prescribed to around 10,000 people during the first three-year trial. A drug taken before sexual intercourse has been found to reduce the risk of infection by about 86% in high-risk individuals.
The NHS agreed to fund the experiment after the Court of Appeal upheld last year's Supreme Court ruling. It says the NHS is able to pay for PrEP, despite claiming that local authorities should fund it.
Simon Stevens, head of the NHS in England, called the decision announced on Thursday a "significant new intervention" and the National AIDS Agency described it as a "crucial moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first to start accepting registrations for the trial, which will expand to other clinics in October. The experiment will reach its full extent in England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an HIV drug taken before sexual intercourse that reduces the risk of infection.
Experiments have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV infection in high-risk groups.
A medicine taken before intercourse means that there are enough drugs in the body during intercourse that prevent HIV infection.
The drug can be taken daily or two hours before sex.
The target group for treatment includes gay men, bisexual men and transgender people, as well as people who have an HIV-positive partner who does not receive effective treatment.
The clinics will select eligible applicants for the trial from men, women and transgender people, as well as those whose HIV-positive partner is not known to receive antiretroviral therapy for their condition.
People living in England and enrolled in general practitioner care can also apply for a trial at their local sexual health clinic.
The programme costs £10 million, and the NHS in England this week signed a procurement contract for medicines following an international tender.
The purpose of the trial is to assess the potential of PrEP by gathering extensive clinical evidence on targeting, taking and implementing treatment.
"This major new intervention should complement and enhance the diverse and increasingly effective approaches we already have to prevent HIV," says Stevens.
"It is yet another remarkable achievement in more than 30 years of fighting to solve one of humanity's greatest health challenges."
"This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV," said Deborah Gold, executive director of the National AIDS Organization.
"If PrEP is properly targeted at those who need it and those at risk, it could have a game-changing impact on the HIV epidemic in England.
From September, those at risk will receive a medicine through an NHS-funded trial that they can decide on independently without having to consult a partner. It has an empowering effect that will improve the lives of so many people.
This was welcome news."
"The most important thing now is to ensure that the trial is launched quickly across the country and that no one at risk is left out," said Ian Green, director of the Terrence Higgins Foundation.
"The PrEP drug used in the trial has been procured and we will soon be able to protect ten thousand at-risk people from HIV infection."
"The launch of the PrEP trial is a welcome event that was needlessly prolonged by several months due to government delays," said shadow health minister Sharon Hodgson.
"We have evidence that the drug can have a game-changing effect on the work we do to prevent HIV and stop the spread of this threatening disease.
The trial will help us better understand the real benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that the experiment is launched as soon as possible throughout the country. In this way, we can protect those exposed to HIV and get one step closer to stopping the spread of HIV in society."
Quality of life: a mezzanine floor and clever décor solutions have turned a small Earl's Court apartment into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker enthusiastic about property renovation, moved from Knightsbridge to a smaller flat in Earl's Court in 2014.
The apartment is on the first floor of a Queen Anne-era style house. The success of the renovation is indicated by the fact that Joanne has not yet packed her cabins and moved.
"Before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger apartment," Joanne says.
"I'm looking for something similar in my price range.
I visited the apartment display here and found that the rooms were as tall as in my apartment at the time.
I fell in love immediately and made an offer the same day."
Since then, the apartment of about 90 square meters has undergone a complete transformation.
It was a two-room apartment where the bedroom could only be accessed from the kitchen. Joanne wanted more storage space and a mezzanine to make the most of the room height.
"I wanted space, big windows and lots of light.
Those were my demands," he says.
He hired Erfan Azad of the Duck & Shed design office in Notting Hill. Erfan was commissioned to take advantage of the space of the nearly four-metre-high rooms and create an apartment that would not only be a renovation and sale target, but a home.
The room height was not quite enough for two overlapping spaces, so the challenge was to build a mezzanine where you could stand.
The solution required creative thinking from Erfan.
"Steel structures are quite complex.
The spaces had to be arranged on top of each other so that there was no need to crouch in them.
The structures had to be modified so that the height was just right, both above and underneath them."
Erfan was able to place two full-height rooms with fascinating details on top of each other.
On the mezzanine floor, a Retrouvius copper lattice window opens onto the elegant living area.
Mirror gold furniture, silver accents and vintage lamps by Serge Mouille create a distinctive style.
The use of mirrors brings theatricality, a sense of space and light.
Mirrors at each end of the short corridor make the corridor seem longer than it actually is.
A mirror in the space between the kitchen is like a window overlooking another room.
The mirrored furniture at the entrance has storage space for Joanne's cutlery and glassware.
The elegance is enhanced by the fact that the kitchen can be hidden when not in use.
Kitchens with a folding door are not a new solution,
but what's unique about Joanne's kitchen is that the door is lifted up in the same way as the garage door.
"It took a bit of planning," says Erfan about the steel-reinforced veneered MDF door.
"It's balanced, so it slides into place very easily when lifted."
With sensible use of space and storage planning, Joanne got 16 extra square meters, a second bedroom and an even better layout.
"When selling a home, it's the floor area that counts – or the valuation of the property," says Erfan.
"In a basic case, a real estate agent walks into the apartment and calculates the price based on the area."
In Joanne's apartment, the area was increased by using high-quality materials that bring luxury to the space.
"The resident is in contact with the materials of the apartment, and the emotional bond with the apartment is partly based on them," says Erfan.
"No one gets attached to the electrical wires running in the walls.
They're important too, but not in the same way."
Joanne's apartment is an example of how good design and extra square meters can make a basic apartment exceptionally great.
Then it may also happen that you no longer want to move out of the apartment.
Pregnant Princess Sofia beamed in her summer look
Princess Sofia's outfit choice hit the mark.
Princess Sofia represented Sweden in Båstad for the last time before giving birth.
For dinner at A Sustainable Tomorrow, the princess had chosen a delicate light blue dress.
Sofia represented the event smiling.

Sofia arrived at the event in a dark blue outfit.
This is the last representative event where Sofia will represent before giving birth.
His due date is September.
For dinner at the event, Sofia had chosen to wear a beautiful pastel blue dress that landed magnificently.
The style was crowned with large earrings and a stylish little bag.
Pastel blue dressed the princess nicely.
Sofia has been on a representative trip to Båstad, Sweden, this week.
Sofia complemented her outfit with a small bag.

Sofia even got excited to talk to photographers at the event.
Now I'm just holding my stomach," Sofia said with a laugh, referring to the rest of her pregnancy.
He grows us with sweet chili
In the summer of 1996, a stall selling Thai food appeared at the Lahti market.
The people of Lahti did not dare to taste, but walked past.
At the stall, food was sold by Panya Suamsri-Penttilä, Panja among acquaintances.
He didn't know much Finnish, and Finns didn't know Thaii at that time.
Since the people did not dare to go out to eat, Panja offered free tastings.
This is how he taught the people of Lahti to eat Thai food, one spring roll at a time.
Taste the countries, he said.
I was hooked.
I visited more and more often, eventually every day.
In the summer of 1997, Panja opened its Thai canteen in the Lahti Market Hall.
It had two small tables, I think there were less than 20 seats.
He taught us not only to eat Thai food, but also to sit next to a complete stranger.
When you're hungry and places are limited, you can't leave an empty chair between yourself and a guest.
Little by little, we got to know each other better and became friends.
Finally, I sat at a plate with a dictionary learning Thai.
Two years went by in the market hall, but then the restaurant had to move because the homemade spice pastes reportedly smelled too much in the hall.
A new place became available at the end of the Market Hall.
There is room.
Now we drinkers are allowed to sit at our own tables again, only during the busiest times do we have to shyly ask guests if there is room next door.
Panja knows its customers.
They are told how they are doing, where they have been and who they have seen.
He knows what food each person eats.
She has seen how customers' life stages vary and the food club changes.
He remembers the name of the man I went to eat my first spring rolls with.
He remembers me as thin and fat, and remembers what I was like when I was young.
It's nice to go to lunch a little later than everyone else, sit in my seat next to the kitchen door and catch up with Panja leaning on the counter.
Food is not the main thing we get from him.
She has taught tolerance and internationality with sweet chili sauce.
He has opened not only our sense of taste, but also our thoughts and hearts.
Today, many people speak Thai to him - thanks to the growing popularity of travel.
I admire Panja.
Even though he's had a hard time, he's always friendly.
He is hardworking.
On top of restaurant work, he goes for mushrooms and blueberries.
Last week, the restaurant surreptitiously celebrated the two-decade anniversary.
We customers got strawberry cake for dessert.
Without any noise or attention, this remarkable day went by, at work.
The discovery of an underground base revealed 173 ISIS terrorists ready to strike in Europe
At the beginning of the year, the security authorities obtained a list that is significant for counter-terrorism work.
The list includes information on more than 170 ISIS fighters who are ready to attack Europe.
According to the German newspaper Die Welt, there are a total of 173 people and the document contains not only their personal details but also pictures of each of them.
More than 130 of the people on the list are Iraqis, but there are also six Europeans.
They come from Belgium, Holland, France and Germany.
The rest are from Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Tazjikistan, as well as Saudi Arabia.
Ilta-Sanomat reported on the list and a couple of weeks ago.
Now the place where the list was found and the information it contains have become more precise.
According to the newspaper, Iraqi army special forces found a list containing the terrorists' personal details and pictures while searching the terrorist organization's underground base in Mosul.
U.S. intelligence officials assessed the authenticity of the papers and forwarded them to Interpol.
The list was distributed by Interpol to all European security authorities in May.
The underlying fear was that something big and serious would be planned in the West by terrorists after the defeat of ISIS in the Middle East.
According to Die Welt, the list includes not only the names and pictures of all the people, but also their date of birth, fictitious aliases and information about the person's country of origin.
The list also specifies the specialties of terrorists.
For example, the 27-year-old German Sami J. on the list has the battle name Abu Assid al-Almani, meaning German.
He reportedly left Germany in 2012, traveling first to Egypt, then Libya and later via Turkey to Syria to join ISIS.
Next to his picture is written suicide bomber as a specialty.
There is no further information about the fate of the man.
A total of about 6,000 fighters have left Europe to join ISIS, whose fate is uncertain.
A man sank beneath the surface in Tokoinranta, Helsinki
Based on interviews with the rescue department, the man had wanted to show that he could swim.
Even a bucket can save a drowning life.
A person who was submerged in water was rescued on Thursday in Tokoinranta, Helsinki.
According to Ville Estlander, the on-call fire chief of the Helsinki City Rescue Department, the situation was over quickly.
The person was found underwater about 15 minutes after the report.
A diver from the rescue department found him beneath the surface, Estlander says.
The rescue department was notified after half past four in the afternoon.
The person was delivered into the hands of paramedics.
Estlander says it was a man in his 50s.
Based on the interviews, the man had wanted to show that he could swim.
The situation in Tokoinranta is already over.
Estlander praises the cooperation between the authorities and the Finnish Border Guard and the police.
This was a task led by the Finnish Border Guard.
The divers were also superbly guided by those present.
The situation was over in 15 minutes.
The man was rescued from the water together with the Finnish Border Guard and the police.
Two passenger cars collided in Eura - nine people in cars, three seriously injured

According to the rescue department, there is a speed limit of 80 kilometres per hour in the intersection area.
The brothers battle over more than $500 million in real estate assets
Two brothers are battling over one of Victoria's largest real estate empires worth more than $500 million. The dispute relates to a family business founded 40 years ago by their Italian family.
Former Carlton Football Club chairman and real estate developer Colin De Lutis lives in a prestigious Torah neighborhood just three houses away from his younger brother Paul. The younger brother has taken a dispute to the Supreme Court over the division of real estate and business assets between the brothers.
Paul has wanted to leave the family business since 2014, but there is a bitter controversy over the divorce.
The brothers and their mother, Anna, together own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars. The family began to accumulate a fortune when they bought a shop on Smith Street in Collingwood in 1973.
The family established the Westco Jeans store there, which expanded into a chain of 160 stores.
The chain of stores was sold for $85 million in 1999.
The money was spent on real estate, and the family now owns offices, property development areas in Brunswick and Sorrento, and apartments on the Gold Coast and Mt Buller, as well as suburban shopping malls.
According to an agreement with the family's late father, Colin owns about two-thirds and Paul about one-third of the company's assets. Paul describes his father as "the driving force and central figure of the family".
According to court documents, the asset sharing ratio means Colin owns properties worth about $316 million and Paul about $176 million.
Paul is not happy with the division of real estate and money.
"I think Colin left the best real estate to himself in his proposal," Paul wrote in his first affidavit to court in 2015.
The case was heard last Friday for the first time in the Supreme Court after several mediation attempts.
The brothers are now also arguing over who controls the existing business. Paul claims Colin has excluded him from the business.
According to Colin, this is not true. He accuses Paul of mismanaging some properties.
Colin writes in one of his first sworn testimony that he would like to find a solution.
"In keeping with our Italian traditions, family is the most important thing to me," Colin said in a statement.
The costs of the case are constantly increasing. There are hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails and reports. The case is being investigated by consulting firms such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, as well as some of the best and most experienced lawyers in the country, such as Allan Myers.
Anna De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who founded dairy bars and delicatessens in the late 1950s. In the early 1970s, they bought a shop in Brunswick.
They were used as collateral when the family bought a property in Collingwood, where Colin set up the family's first jeans store.
Colin says he started the shop "in his last years of high school, when Paul was still a kid (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, wanted to transfer the property to their sons amicably.
"Luigi often stated that he did not want the brothers to end up in court," Anna writes in a statement.
The family's other two sons, Mark and Luke, are no longer involved in the De Lutis Group's business. According to Colin, Mark received $10 million and Luke $26 million when he left the company.
According to Paul, Luke and Mark are "bitter about the financial terms of their departure."
Colin has kept a low profile, despite being a former board member of the Australian Football League club and best friend of television star Eddie McGuire, according to his 2015 biography.
Fairfax Media reached out to Colin and Paul De Lutis and their attorneys on Friday.
Only Colin answered. He said in a text message that he could not really comment on the matter because it would be dealt with in court.
"It is very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and drag our family's name into the legal battle," she wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to accede to his brother's demands.
"Our father wouldn't have wanted us to argue like this," Colin continued, adding that he still hopes a solution can be reached.
On Friday, hope seemed extinguished.
"Our case will be resolved in court in the near future," Colin wrote.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to limit the president's use of media.
Others have tried and failed.
Perhaps John F. Kelly will finally succeed.
First.
According to Poltico, the new White House chief of staff plans to limit President Trump's use of media and news monitoring so that the boss doesn't get into trouble as often.
Journalist Josh Dawsey reports:
"When John F. Kelly, the new White House chief of staff, met with senior staff on his first day in office, he raised a key problem he intends to solve: he is going to limit President Donald Trump's access to information.
Kelly told White House staffers that all information—both printed and heard at news conferences—must go through him because the president makes better decisions when he gets good information.
Kelly's words make sense, but others have tried to limit Trump's use of media and failed.
President Trump has a decades-long relationship with television — and as president, he still watches a lot of television.
"If presidential candidate Trump was upset about unfair reporting, it was worth showing him that sympathetic media coverage was more even-handed," Sam Nunberg, who worked as an adviser to Trump's campaign, told Politico in February.
Politico reporter Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "according to six former campaign staffers, it is essential to controlling Trump's use of Twitter that his personal media stream includes a steady stream of praise."
Clear.
But it's ridiculous to claim that Trump's use of Twitter was ever under control.
Maybe these campaign workers know something the rest of us don't — maybe Trump's tweets would have been even wilder without their efforts.
We will probably never know what kind of messages Trump missed.
If his staff has been able to prevent him from causing problems even a few times, their work has not been in vain.
However, no one has been able to consistently stop Trump from causing a stir.
The problem is partly due to the fact that there are rival factions in the White House that are trying to advance their cause by giving Trump information that supports their view. That information may or may not be reliable.
In May, Politico wrote that advisers are deliberately giving questionable information to the president.
Journalist Shane Goldmacher reported on one incident:
Trump's current and former employees say he can be immensely outraged by newspaper clippings criticizing him — especially if they report malicious information leaks. Then he will be absolutely obliged to know where the information comes from.
That's what happened in late February when someone mischievously gave the president a copy of a story on GotNews.com, a website founded by online provocateur Charles C. Johnson, which blamed Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh for multiple White House leaks.
Johnson had been permanently removed from Twitter for harassment and had previously spread false allegations and later retracted them. Nor did he provide concrete evidence.
Nevertheless, after reading the story, Trump had started asking staff about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that then-chief of staff Reince Priebus and White House staff secretary Rob Porter "had tried to implement a document management system that went to Trump."
And what was the result?
Kelly tries the same three months later.
Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective leader than Priebus, but Trump is still his own impulsive self and his aides are still pushing their own agendas.
These immutable facts make Kelly's task extremely difficult.
Neymar signs five-year contract with PSG
Brazilian star Neymar has signed a five-year contract with French football club PSG, according to AFP.
Earlier on Thursday evening, it was reported that Neymar's representatives had paid FC Barcelona, who play in the Spanish league, a buy-out price of €222 million.
Neymar's contract with Barcelona had therefore been terminated and he was free to move to Parisian club PSG.
The staggering transfer sum of €222 million is the highest in football history.
Previously, the record was held by Manchester United, who paid €105 million for Frenchman Paul Pogba last summer.
PSG is owned by the state-owned Qatari company Qatar Sports Investment.
The club is chaired by former professional tennis player Nasser al-Khelaifi from Qatar.
Neymar is expected to arrive in Paris on Friday.
Bestselling author Raija Oranen beat alcoholism and fear of flying with hypnosis: "I'm in the shape of my life"
Raija Oranen, a bestselling author known for the TV series Time of the Rose and Clean White Sheets, just celebrated her 69th birthday.
Hypnosis helped Raija Oranen.
Five grandchildren hold Granny so much in their grip while writing that Raija and her husband Jyrki gave up the Spanish sun and Fuengirola's apartment after 18 winters.
At first they sold their house, but now in the spring they also left for a rental apartment.
Into light and sun, away from old circles, Raija was once taken away by depression and alcoholism, which she has survived.
The appearance is also 20 kilograms lighter.
The weight started to drop when the serotonin drugs were stopped, they were anti-depressants.
I used hypnosis to help with alcoholism, which also worked for my fear of flying, I overcame it.
I have now been alcohol-free for 15 years.
Alcohol takes a person, the beaming author says openly.
Raija and Jyrki Oranen have travelled the same journey for over 45 years.
I'm feeling better than ever.
Raija and Jyrki Oranen, who has also worked in the tourism industry, have been walking together for over 40 years.
I proposed, and it was getting married in two weeks, Raija laughs.
That's the kind of queen of drama she's always been, ending her life every now and then, Jyrki laughs at his wife.
Oranen, who has had an extensive career as a writer, only has fond memories of the 44-part TV series Clean White Sheets, which touched and moved Finland during the depression.
I finally decided that the Raikkaa family's business was the clothing industry when I read Liisa Seppälä's 50th birthday interview on the plane.
I was the daughter of a seamstress myself, my mother also had a clothing shop and sometimes worked as a mannequin," Oranen recalls.
For him, the plot and story of the series changed the attitude of Finns towards entrepreneurship.
Anita Savelainen's research and doctoral dissertation revealed this, Oranen says.
Raija Oranen lives an active time as a writer, she has many manuscripts in the works – hundreds of ideas.
The nomads returned across the ditch to the "millionaires' alley"
Some of the wealthiest homeowners in the West Midlands are once again at loggerheads with persistent travellers who managed to cross a ditch dug by the municipality and return to the field next to their houses.
Travellers park their twenty or so caravans near a street called Millionaires' Alley in Solihull.
They were driven out of the area in May, but managed to cross the moat dug by the municipality as a barrier. They brought with them children, horses and an army of vans.
The travellers managed to cross the barrier at a point that had been left unprotected due to the path.
Enraged residents have accused the municipality of Solihull of a "complete inability to solve the problem".
The resident, who wished to remain anonymous, said the travellers came from Bentley Heath on Monday evening, where they had thrown rocks at passers-by.
"The municipality needs to be pushed to act because it seems to be completely incapable of solving the problem.
The travellers were here in May, then they left but came back again.
There were more of them in the evening and probably even more today."
The resident said that the municipality of Birmingham had solved the problem by banning access to the parks.
"I live on Streetsbrook Road and it's frustrating to pay council tax when the municipality can't do anything about it."
Another resident, who wished to remain anonymous, said it was ridiculous that the travellers returned so soon after they were driven away.
"There are more of them than before, and they have even landed a horse in a grazing park."
A spokesperson for Solihull Municipality said the municipality was aware of illegal camping in the vicinity of Streetsbrook Road. "We are taking the necessary legal steps with Solihull Police to evict the campers as soon as possible.
In order to gather evidence, it is very important that as many locals as possible report disruptive or criminal activity to the police.
It helps to form an overall picture of the situation for legal proceedings."
Enraged people besieged Portugal's crash plane
In Portugal, men who crash-landed on a beach full of people have been questioned in court today.
Two people died yesterday as a result of the forced landing.
The two men who flew the plane could face charges of manslaughter.
The maximum penalty in Portugal is 16 years' imprisonment.
Yesterday, due to a technical problem, a small plane flown by men had to make an emergency landing on Sao Joao da Caparica beach near Lisbon.
There were hundreds of people on the beach at the time of the incident, some of whom ran away from the landing plane into the water.
Upon landing, the plane hit a 56-year-old man and an 8-year-old girl, who died instantly.
The plane first hit a man with his back to the plane.
Immediately afterwards, the plane took off and when it landed again, it hit the child's head, Filipe Janeira, who was on the beach, told Jornal de Noticias.
The little girl who was killed was on the beach with her parents.
The girl's parents were not injured.
Immediately after the crash, those on the beach surrounded the small plane in anger.
The girl's father and other people went to the plane and started beating its stern, Celia Rocha, who witnessed the incident, told Correio da Manha newspaper.
The man called the pilot a criminal, he was desperate.
It is a miracle that no more people died.
The two men on board were not injured in the forced landing.
Finnish star who tragically lost his leg wins World Cup gold again: "Without the accident, I wouldn't be world champion"
Matti Suur-Hamari celebrated World Championship gold in banked slalom in Big White, Canada, early Wednesday morning Finnish time.
Suur-Hamari also won gold at the World Cross Championships earlier in the competition.
A total of three World Championship titles have now been collected.
Pretty amazing World Cup!
Twice we took care of gold, we pulled with a pretty good heart rate, Suur-Hamari, who was reached by phone, rejoiced.
The 30-year-old skier praised his coach and the very successful preparation in Finland.
According to Suur-Hamar, the number of challengers in the sport is constantly increasing.
Parasnowboarding as a whole has grown and developed a lot lately.
The differences are getting smaller, and there are a lot of new riders involved.
You always wonder if there's a black horse coming from behind.
There seems to be a different winner in every race.
Suur-Hamari lost one leg in a motorcycle accident in 2009.
He had been skiing enthusiastically since he was young with his friends, and the accident did not take away his desire to get to the slopes.
After all, it sometimes occurs to me that what my life would be like without that accident.
But my attitude has always been that there are no ifs or buts.
The cards that have been dealt are played with, Suur-Hamari emphasizes.
It would be cruel to call a serious accident and loss of a limb a stroke of luck, and Suur-Hamari does not.
But he turned the awful difficulty to his advantage.
Yes, I would say that the situation turned into a victory.
I wouldn't be a three-time world champion without an accident.
Before the accident, the 23-year-old Suur-Hamar's greatest enthusiasm for snowboarding was already waning.
The work towards the summit only really started after the accident.
I used to train with friends when I was young, and we were always excited to play X-Games.
But they were distant dreams that dimmed somewhat over time.
After the accident, I somehow found myself there at the start of X-Games.
I could not have imagined beforehand.
I was 23 years old and I thought this was going to be a really long life if I stayed here bitter and lamented.
I decided to pull on my overalls and get to work.
I would say that I have succeeded quite well.
The skier was delighted with the selection of wheelchair bowler Leo-Pekka Tähti as Athlete of the Year.
The four-time Olympic champion received his award at a sports gala in January.
According to Suur-Hamar, Star's victory is an important signal to the parasports crowd.
It was a really big deal, and the win was definitely deserved.
This will certainly also open eyes to the world of parasports.
When is it time to launch the Athlete of the Year campaign for two-time world champion Matti Suur-Hamar?
We'll see in due course.
I try to do my best to be successful.
Suur-Hamari has not yet conquered all the peaks it covets.
Next year we have a big goal.
In a year's time, the Paralympics will take place in South Korea.
Yes, we will go there to get a medal!
The majority of Syrian refugee youth do not believe they will return to their homeland permanently unless the war ends and ISIS leaves the country
The A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees survey surveyed the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
Syrian refugees baking bread in a refugee camp in Jordan.
The majority of Syrian youth do not believe that they will return to their home country permanently.
According to them, the end of the war in Syria and the departure of ISIS from the country are the most important things that should happen in order for them to return to their homeland.
The Trump administration is not seen as bringing about change in the Syrian conflict.
The communications agency chain Burson-Marsteller surveyed the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees in an international survey.
For nine years, Burson-Marsteller has studied the opinions and attitudes of Arab youth.
This year, the A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees survey surveyed the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
A total of 400 Syrian youths aged 18–24, half of whom are women and half men, responded to the survey in February–March 2017.
Half of the interviews were conducted in Jordan and half in Lebanon.
According to the study, more than half of young Syrian refugees do not believe that they will return to their home country permanently in the future.
Of the respondents, 42 per cent may think of returning to their home country and four per cent could not say.
According to the study, young people's decision to return home is most influenced by the ongoing war in Syria and the presence of ISIS in the country.
Nearly half (47%) consider the end of the war to be the most important factor in their permanent return home, while a quarter think the most important thing would be for ISIS to leave the country.
Only less than a tenth cite the improvement of the economic situation or Bashar al-Assad's departure from Syria as the most important factors influencing the decision.
Military action alone will not resolve the conflict
Syrian youth were asked which factor is most important for ending the conflict.
The majority believe that an end to the war is more important than the abdication of President Bashar al-Assad.
More than a quarter see al-Assad's presidency as an obstacle to a peace deal.
Nearly half feel that both political and military solutions are needed to end the ongoing conflict in Syria.
Only a quarter believe that the conflict can be resolved through military action alone.
The majority of Syrian refugee youth see the weakening of ISIS's power over the past year, while a fifth feel that its power has strengthened.
According to the respondents, the most important thing in the fight against ISIS, and terrorism in general, is for the media to convey to people the information that ISIS has nothing to do with Islam.
Almost as many cited military measures and education reform as their primary means.
More than a tenth think that the most important thing would be to create better-paid jobs for young people.
When asked about the Trump administration's impact on the Syrian conflict, 66 percent of respondents believe the conflict will not change under the Trump administration.
Nearly one in four believe that the conflict in Syria will worsen under Trump.
Opinions are divided on whether the involvement of Russia and Iran has improved or worsened the conflict.
Monty Widenius spends half of his time coding to keep the internet organized - the database he developed is used by companies such as Wikipedia and Google
Espoo-based company MariaDB is developing the "fastest growing open source database in the world".
Founded by coder entrepreneur Michael "Monty" Widenius, MariaDB's main product costs absolutely nothing to users and can be developed online by any skilled programmer.
For example, Google and Wikipedia are users of the Finnish database, but they are not necessarily paying customers.
Databases keep huge amounts of data organized and quickly accessible.
For example, if you use Linkedin, Twitter, or Booking.com, they use a database from MariaDB or MySQL.
"All information that is not in image format comes from the database, and the images are linked there," explains Widenius.
Widenius, who works as MariaDB's CTO, spends about half of his time coding.
A man who works remotely from Kauniainen does his part to ensure that the internet works smoothly.
Widenius developed MySQL, the world's most popular open source database, together with David Axmark from Sweden.
In 2008, technology company Sun bought MySQL for $7 billion, and a year later, software giant Oracle devoured Sun for $7.4 billion.
When the Oracle deal took place, a large number of MySQL developers announced they were leaving.
"They didn't want to work for Oracle, which didn't give a firm promise about the future of MySQL," Widenius recalls.
Already at this point, he had founded a company that began to develop MariaDB.
He didn't want his life's work to die.
I hired about twenty of the best developers from Sun to ensure that the continuity of the code is secured with the help of the same guys who created it.
Since MySQL is an open source database, MariaDB was able to develop its own branch.
The name just had to be changed.
A foundation was established to oversee the freedom of MariaDB code development.
"During MySQL, these verifications were not made," Widenius laments.
Although many people have heard about Widenius and MySQL's billion-dollar deal, few Finns know anything about MariaDB.
"In recent years, our growth rate has been around 50 percent per year," says Kenneth Paqvalén, CFO of MariaDB.
MariaDB, which focuses on growth, is not yet making a profit, and Paqvalén is tight-lipped about the company's key figures.
He reveals that MariaDB expects to receive orders worth EUR 20 million in the current financial year.
Since the database is free, the company has developed services around it that corporate customers are willing to pay for.
MariaDB also helps with the exchange of databases, which can be a task of more than a year if the customer has used a closed database.
Switching from MySQL to MariaDB is instantaneous because they are versions of each other.
Among others, the Spanish operator Telefónica and the largest bank in Southeast Asia, DBS, are paying customers of MariaDB.
The most popular cloud services such as Amazon's AWS, Microsoft's Azure, Alibaba's Cloud offer MariaDB to their customers.
At the same time, MariaDB is automatically distributed to new users in Linux operating system distributions, where MariaDB has largely replaced MySQL.
Even though we are a small company, we have connections to the biggest players.
"Our customers include the world's largest telecom operators, gaming companies, banks and even a few central banks," Paqvalén lists.
The database market is still dominated by giants such as Oracle, Microsoft, IBM and SAP with their closed databases.
Even for Oracle, MySQL is a modest side business compared to the company's traditional closed database.
Although according to research firm Gartner, the largest database companies have lost market share in recent years, in terms of revenue, players like MariaDB are still negligible, albeit fast-growing.
With a database market of about $50 billion, open source databases don't even reach a billion.
However, the weight of open source cannot be measured only in terms of money, since most users do not pay anything for this software.
Research firm Gartner predicts that by 2018, companies will already develop more than 70 percent of their internal applications on top of open databases.
In addition, more than half of the old databases would then have been replaced with open ones, or at least the migration would have begun.
Big companies don't get new customers because most choose open source next.
This has led to license fees for commercial databases skyrocketing.
Companies want to make as much money as before with fewer customers," Widenius says.
Since changing a closed database is a hassle, most client companies have obediently swallowed price increases.
"There are a lot of customers for whom migration is really difficult because their old applications and other things are closed in a closed database," Widenius says.
Still, he believes that customers are reaching their limit.
As license fees increase every year, sooner or later the customer switches to an open source database.
The price is 10-20 percent of the previous one, and the service is better because the customer can easily switch to another database if they wish.
In addition, many companies are facing major system changes as they move their operations to cloud services.
At the same time, many people change database software.
Last spring, MariaDB received a EUR 25 million loan from the European Investment Bank (EIB).
It was the largest growth financing ever granted by the EIB to the Nordic countries.
The company has around 115 employees worldwide and plans to hire more now.
One of the reasons for the EIB's financing was the impact of MariaDB on public IT procurement.
The company has public sector customers in countries such as the UK and Germany.
The public sector in Europe pays billions of euros annually for databases.
"Many countries want to switch to open source solutions and thus use tax money more efficiently," Paqvalén says.
Widenius is annoyed by how money is wasted in Finland, for example, on closed healthcare systems, when open systems are cheaper and the client is not at the mercy of one software company.
Some people say that open source is an ideology, but I think it's a better way to make code.
The community helps and does things that it cannot invent or be able to do.
The 55-year-old Widenius is, along with another Finnish Linux developer, Linus Torvalds, one of the best-known promoters of open source.
Widenius helps other companies develop functional business models on top of open source.
I still give 4-5 speeches a year around the world on this topic.
Italy toughens its stance on NGO rescue vessels
Italy has warned NGOs rescuing refugees in the Mediterranean on their ships that they must not continue their activities unless they commit themselves to complying with the new rules governing their activities.
"If NGOs do not commit to the new code, it is difficult to see how they can continue to operate," Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with Turin newspaper La Stampa.
Minnit's warning came a day after Italian authorities seized a vessel belonging to the German aid organisation Jugend Retpet. Its crew is suspected of collaborating with people smugglers that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organization, which has been in operation for just a year, declined to comment on prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio's detailed charges.
"For us, saving lives is and will continue to be the most important thing. We deeply regret that we are currently unable to operate in the search and rescue area," the organization said in a statement posted on social media.
"We can only assess the allegations once we have gathered all the necessary information and are able to assess the situation."
The Iuventa vessel of the Art Nouveau Rettet organisation had been monitored by the Italian authorities since October.
The crew is suspected of taking boatloads of refugees on board directly from human smugglers, who regained possession of the boats.
One such incident allegedly took place just a few kilometres off the Libyan coast. This information appears from a prosecutor's document, the contents of which have been published by the Italian media.
The crew is suspected of defying the Italian coast guard, which oversees rescue operations in the area. The motive is considered to be the eagerness to help.
According to the Code of Conduct, vessels such as the Iuventa must be accompanied by an Italian police officer to supervise the operations.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue have so far agreed to comply with the Code of Conduct: Save the Children and the Maltese MOAS and the Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms.
said Thursday that it considered the new rules unnecessary but acceptable because they would not create "significant changes or obstacles" to the organization's rescue operations.
Among those who refused to comply with the code is the Nobel Prize-winning organisation Médecins Sans Frontières.
Minniti said that the number of migrants arriving in Italy as a result of rescue operations has fallen sharply in recent weeks, which she sees as an indication that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast guard and work with local mayors are starting to bear fruit.
"In recent days, we have started to see light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He revealed plans to continue discussions this month with Libyan mayors on economic development projects and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of refugees leaving for Europe.
Seasonal worker suspected of killing his common-law partner in Enontekiö, suspect found in the terrain - case to prosecutor
The suspected crime took place in Kuttanen in Enontekiö last December.
Police said a 36-year-old Czech man is suspected of killing his 26-year-old Scottish partner.
It has previously been reported that both were seasonal workers.
The police have also said that the suspect would have fled with two dogs to the terrain after his act.
The man was found cold in the terrain and made no resistance when captured.
Charges in the case must be filed within less than a week.
The case may be heard in the District Court of Lapland during August.
Robert Hardy, known for Harry Potter and My All Furry Friends, has died
British actor Robert Hardy has died at the age of 91.
The actor's death was announced Thursday by his family.
Born in 1925, Hardy began his acting career at the age of 24 in the theater.
During his long career, he also starred in film and television.
Hardy is especially remembered for his role as Minister of Magic Cornelius Toffee in the Harry Potter films and his role as a veterinarian in the television series My All Furry Friends, based on James Herriot's book.
The popular BBC series was filmed for a total of seven seasons.
Michelle Carter sentenced to prison for text messages inciting suicide
A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two and a half years in prison for text messages and phone calls allegedly inciting her boyfriend Conrad Roy to suicide.
Michelle Carter, 20, is serving 15 months of her sentence in prison and five years on parole.
Carter was convicted of manslaughter in June. Her boyfriend Conrad Roy committed suicide on 13.7.2014.
"My family is heartbroken," Conrad's father said during Thursday's hearing.
"My son was my best friend."
Carter appealed the conviction and was allowed to await the hearing of the application in free.
He was threatened with a 20-year sentence, but according to his lawyers, both Carter and Roy suffered from mental health issues.
Dressed in red pants and a cream-colored blouse, Carter listened to his doom with his arms folded with his tearful gaze fixed on the ground.
"His actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"He ended Conrad's life to improve his own.
He has not taken responsibility for the act," the prosecutor continued.
"He has shown no remorse."
According to Carter's attorney, the incident stemmed from "shocking circumstances that Carter deeply regrets."
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz ruled that Carter's "age or maturity level, or even mental health issues, had no significant impact on his act."
The prosecution read a statement from Conrad's mother, Lynn Roy, in which she said that "not a day goes by that I do not mourn the death of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I'm coping with all this. I will try my best to comfort her sisters in this pain we will always bear."
Conrad's sister, Camdyn Roy, told the court she was "haunted" by the thought that she would never see her brother's wedding or be an aunt to his children.
"It's painful to lose someone who has been in my life every day since I was born. That pain will never go away," Camdyn said.
The case seems to set a precedent, as there is no law in the state of Massachusetts that makes incitement to suicide a crime.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning in a car in 2014.
The case attracted national attention when it emerged that Carter had incited her boyfriend to commit suicide in her text messages.
"Hang yourself, jump off the roof, stab yourself. I don't know, there are many ways," Carter wrote in many messages he had sent to Roy in the two weeks leading up to his death. Roy was on vacation with his family at the time.
Just before Roy's suicide, Carter wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad" and "You just have to turn on the generator, and you'll be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said Carter sought attention with Roy's death. The judge ordered that Carter not benefit from the case by giving interviews.
The case has divided the opinions of experts.
Few have defended Carter. One of the defenders is Amanda Knox, 30, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007. He was released two years later.
The Los Angeles Times published Knox's opinion piece stating, "Michelle Carter needs compassion and help, not jail."
NATO Secretary General: Relations with Russia the worst since the Cold War
Relations between NATO and Russia have deteriorated markedly, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said on Thursday.
Stoltenberg blamed Russia and its role in the conflict in Ukraine.
I think you can say that NATO's relationship with Russia is more difficult now than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War," Stoltenberg said in an interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could seek close cooperation with Russia.
But especially since the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the ongoing instability caused by Russia in the region of eastern Ukraine, NATO's relationship with Russia has deteriorated considerably.
According to Stoltenberg, however, NATO remains committed to working to prevent tensions from escalating.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can engage in political dialogue with Russia in order to avoid escalation and a new Cold War.
Before Stoltenberg's comments, U.S. President Donald Trump noted that relations between the U.S. and Russia had even reached a dangerously bad level.
Trump called for thanks for the bad relations between the two countries to Congress, which last week passed new sanctions against Russia.
Audi makes changes to 850,000 diesel engines due to setback experienced by car manufacturers
The day before Audi's announcement, BMW offered to update software for more than 350,000 cars.
BMW's chief said the company believes "there are more sensible options than driving restrictions." He referred to European cities, including BMW's hometown of Munich, which are considering restricting or banning the use of diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will make changes to the engines of more than three million Mercedes to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies talked about the recall.
European car manufacturers have heavily marketed the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to meet carbon dioxide emission targets.
Nitric oxide emissions from diesel engines are considered to cause cancer and asthma.
The installation costs of emission-neutralising devices are rising, making it difficult to price cars competitively.
German car manufacturers are under close scrutiny, and Chancellor Angela Merkel has been accused of complicity with the big car companies and ignoring the problems.
The companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen's mistakes. Volkswagen installed cheating devices in the cars that reduced emissions to comply with regulations in tests. In normal driving, emissions were higher.
Several Volkswagen executives have been prosecuted in the United States, but their actions are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics in Audi's engine development department was arrested in Germany.
Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian and could therefore be extradited to the United States for possible trial.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in a criminal investigation into Volkswagen. The authorities suspected that Audi had installed a system in its cars that could circumvent European emission requirements. The accusation was based on a similar investigation in the United States.
The Audi investigation could significantly weaken Volkswagen's position: the luxury car maker accounts for a disproportionate share of Volkswagen's profits.
Venezuelan vote sparks fraud investigation, big protests in store
According to the company, the number of voters reported by Venezuelan authorities is at least one million higher than the number of actual voters.
This is an unprecedented opinion from a firm that has no role in the election results," Tibisay Lucenan, chairman of the National Electoral Commission, told reporters.
Maduro assures end of crisis
Venezuela elected a representative council in a controversial vote on Sunday to amend the country's constitution.
The opposition has strongly criticised the vote and organised demonstrations against changing it.
The opposition to Maduro has postponed its own demonstrations until they were held at the time of the appointment.
According to El Pais, the country's national security forces began taking over the country's parliament building on Wednesday evening local time.
The purpose of the force is to ensure the security of the appointment ceremony.
Climate change threatens Provencal lavender
Lavender has become a symbol of the Provence region in southern France, but now it is threatened by climate change.
Lavender had declined due to drought and disease-carrying insects. Scientists and farmers are frantically trying to find a solution to the problem.
"Lavender is downright endangered in Provence because it has suffered from the effects of climate change in recent years. As a result, rainfall in spring and especially autumn has clearly decreased," says Eric Chaisse, an expert at CRIEPPAM, a research institute specialising in agriculture in Provence.
"This shortens the life span of lavender.
In addition, the drought has brought a lot of small cicadas to the area, which spread microbacteria."
The stakes are high.
Lavender oil attracts tourists and is also a highly sought-after ingredient in perfumes and cosmetics.
"Instead of long cobs and large flowers, we now have smaller flowers that are poorly developed or weakened, or missing altogether," Chaisse says.
"In other words, there are fewer parts containing essential oil."
The solution is sought by intensifying watering, slowing down the evaporation of soil moisture and spraying plants with a protective mixture of clay and water. In addition, varieties that are more drought-resistant are being developed.
Murder of journalist highlights growing threat in Mexico
The editorial staff of the weekly newspaper Riodoce usually meets on Wednesdays to discuss how the paper covers the latest cases related to organized crime, corrupt authorities, and the never-ending war on drugs in the state of Sinaloa.
Today, however, security is being discussed in the light of the recent tragedy.
Journalists have been urged to change their daily routines.
Two experienced journalists discuss which is safer: leave the children at home or take them with them to the editorial office that was hit by a grenade in 2009.
Security experts have written three words on the blackboard at the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
They ask journalists for names for each group. No evidence is needed, observations and sensations are enough.
On the board are written the names of drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and journalists suspected of being employed by the government or drug cartels. They are the criminals who make news coverage of the chaos in Mexico life-threatening.
The violence is incessant and journalists are increasingly being targeted. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, at least 25 journalists have been murdered since President Enrique Peña Nieto took office in December 2012. There are 589 journalists under federal protection who have been attacked and threatened. At least seven journalists have been murdered in seven states this year.
One of the latest victims is Javier Valdez Cardenas, the founder, journalist and inspiration of Riodoce.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug violence.
He is deeply missed, even though he is omnipresent. The façade of the building in Riodoce is covered with a huge picture of Valdez showing the middle finger. The picture reads: "Justice". Journalists in their thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, are wearing T-shirts adorned with Valdez's smiling face. Valdez wears glasses and a trademark panama hat.
The meeting will take place less than two months after Valdez's death. Journalists discuss their shared trauma, nightmares, insomnia and fears that have escalated into paranoia.
In 2010, a federal prosecutor's office was created specifically to deal with journalists' cases, but according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, only two charges have been filed so far.
Journalists' murderers are rarely brought to justice, just as of the thousands of murders each year linked to drug trafficking and organised crime, few end up in court.
Riodoce journalists plan to continue covering the violence in Sinaloa, even though they are heartbroken and the situation is even more dangerous.
According to Ibarra, the security meeting is of little use because the killers are unknown and there is no hope of justice.
"This meeting is frankly a waste of time," he says.
"We can't trust anyone as long as we don't know the cause of what happened."
Valdez had left the delivery of Riodoce in the state capital Culiacan on the morning of 15.5.2017.
He had been driving his red Toyota just a couple of blocks when two men stopped him and forced him out of his car and fired twelve shots. The amount is presumably related to the name of the magazine: Riodoce means twelfth river.
The gunman drove away Valdez's car and crashed it some distance away.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He is survived by his wife and two adult children.
Rumours circulate quickly and circulate freely in Culiacan.
However, there is silence about Valdez's death.
Sinaloa has been one of Mexico's bloodiest battlefields since Guzman was arrested last year and deported to the United States in January. Rival factions want to fill the void.
Someone or several people are shot dead on the streets of Sinaloa every day, and the cemetery is home to ornate two-story grave buildings of drug barons that are larger than the homes of many.
It's "peaceful" in a coastal state when only one cartel controls ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Although Valdez was well aware of the dangers of his job, the founder and director of Riodoce, 60-year-old Ismail Bojorquez, feels guilty for not being able to protect his friend.
He believes two mistakes led to Valdez's murder.
In February, Riodoce published an interview with Damaso Lopez. He leads a rival faction waging war against Guzman's sons.
The story may have angered Guzman's sons: customers suspected of being gang members bought every issue of the magazine as soon as it hit the outlets.
Another mistake was not forcing Valdez to leave the country after another newspaper that published the same story was attacked.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder is considered a turning point in violence against journalists.
He had survived so many that his friends and colleagues could no longer fear for him.
He had had a long career in Noroeste when he decided in 2003 to found Riodoce with five colleagues. Shares in the magazine were sold for $50 at the time.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalism without addressing the drug problem," Bojorquez says.
Over time, the magazine became known for its bold and honest stories, and its sales and advertising revenue increased.
Journalists appreciated the opportunity to publish high-profile investigative journalism without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by stories that no one else dared to publish.
Eight years after its founding, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for its coverage in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez received the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to Protect Journalists for his courage in following the story of drug trafficking in Mexico relentlessly.
He openly admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to be able to get on with my life," he said after receiving the award from the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.
Drug trafficking is a "way of life" in Sinaloa, Valdez said in an interview with Rompeviento TV last October.
"A journalist has to take on the task that falls to him – or act stupid.
I don't want anyone to have to ask me where I was when death was being sown here – why didn't I tell me what was going on?"
The staff at Riodoce miss Valdez – the joker who cursed like a dockworker. They miss a friend who always gave them hugs and advice. They long for a teacher who knew how to cope.
They trusted his routine.
He always wore a panama hat.
He went to the El Guayabo bar opposite the editorial office and always sat at the same table.
Now they ask if routine was his fate.
The death of a colleague has also made them reflect on how best to do their job and stay alive.
"Criminals don't like it if we deal with their women and children and their pure businesses, their secret drug trafficking runways.
They were left out of the case," Bojorquez says.
At best, it meant strong self-censorship and self-protection,
trusting one's own instincts.
If you feel like something isn't right, you have to stay away.
The problem, according to Riodoce journalist Andres Villarreal, is that "impression can be deceiving, and that is what happened with Javier".
The old rules no longer apply in Sinaloa, nor do they apply in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero, and other states with dangerous networks: attractive smuggling routes, weak agencies and corrupt authorities.
The operating environment is constantly changing.
Mobile phones were not allowed to be brought into the room where Riodoce's safety training was held. A few days earlier, it had come to light that spyware sold only to governments had been used to track activists and journalists in Mexico.
Outside the building, two police officers had sought shelter in the shade of a tree in the 40-degree heat.
The state government had ordered them to guard the Riodoce premises, which are located in a four-story building in the middle-class Culiacan district.
Some reporters half-jokingly speculated whether these two police officers were among the 50 percent that the state's governor did not consider reliable.
Months had already passed since journalists had visited the mountainous countryside dominated by drug gangs.
For this week's issue, the editorial staff of Riodoce planned three main stories.
Boxing great Julio Cesar Chavez's brother had been killed in Sinaloa.
The newspaper also intended to reveal that the government's spending was concentrated in the governor's hometown.
In addition, in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, just one block from the prosecutor's office, there was a group of kidnapped people.
There was no official information about who had been kidnapped and how, so we had to proceed with caution: everyone in the city knew that the restaurant was popular with both drug dealers and the authorities.
The journalist found out from public documents that the restaurant was registered in the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). The PRI has dominated Mexican politics at all levels for nearly a century.
Its governors have recently been accused of corruption in highly publicised cases.
Villarreal asked the journalist to write about previous cases in the same place. In one of them, the son of "El Chapo" Guzman managed to escape and avoid an army raid.
A few months earlier, readers would have known that Valdez's column would have provided reliable information about the abduction.
"Before, we would have known what had happened," says the 46-year-old Villarreal, who has earned the nickname "El Flaco" due to his slim physique.
"Now all connections to our data sources are cut off."
Valdez's office has been converted into a warehouse where signs and stickers against the persecution of journalists are stored. The newspaper's employees have been given a new, unexpected task: they have become press freedom activists.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez took a few signs with her when she left for a demonstration outside the local prosecutor's office the next morning for yet another murder of a journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after Valdez's murder.
After the disappearance, a cremated body was found, which, according to DNA tests carried out by the authorities, is Adame.
Journalists have started protesting more loudly across the country. During demonstrations, "SOS Press" texts appear on sidewalks and buildings.
Today, Director Bojorquez is in Washington, D.C., where he is trying to gain international support for the investigation into the Valdez case.
The day after Valdez's murder, Ramirez met with the governor of Sinaloa and accused authorities of spying on and killing journalists for telling the truth.
He has since asked to be removed from government cases because he is concerned that he will not be able to be objective in his anger.
Valdez had repeatedly stated that in Mexico, journalists were surrounded by organized crime, authorities that allow crime, and an indifferent society.
In his last book, Narcojournalism, Valdez writes that journalists are killed by drug gangs, but they are also killed at the behest of politicians and security forces in agreement with organized crime.
According to the Articulo 19 monitoring group, more than half of the attacks on journalists last year were carried out by the police and authorities.
"In Mexico, people are silenced by killing," Ramirez says.
Murder has a paralysing effect.
No one will forget the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
At his body was a message signed by the Zetas cartel: "I am here for my writings."
Next to his severed head was a computer keyboard and headphones.
Some newspapers have decided to close down, such as the El Norte newspaper in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the March murder of correspondent Miroslava Breach.
Some continue to operate, such as Nuevo Laredo's El Manana, even though its leader was assassinated in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez posted a message to drug cartels on its front page: "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their states or the whole country.
It is a difficult decision.
It is difficult to find a job in exile, and you have to be on guard all the time.
Sometimes criminals seek out a journalist, as apparently happened to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered with four women in an apartment in Mexico City in 2015, three months after fleeing Veracruz.
For those who continue their work, every day is filled with dangerous decisions.
Ibarra – who was once supposed to become a poet – admits that writing about drug trafficking is scary.
"I became a journalist because Mexico is heading to hell," he says.
Some time ago, at midnight on Friday, the editors of Riodoce were sitting on the sidewalk in front of the editorial office with a beer after the latest issue of the magazine had been completed. Suddenly, their phones began to vibrate to signal a message.
A shootout between rival gangs and security forces at the beach resort of Mazatlan had killed 19 people.
The war escalated, as promised in cartel messages found in the area.
Journalists posted the news on the Riodoce website from the sidewalk on their smartphones.
The front page had to be redesigned the next day.
Sirens howled nearby – yet another shooting scene.
Bojorquez glanced at the police officers guarding the delivery:
If they were scared, they covered it very well.
The editorial staff of Riodoce continued the tradition of the murdered founder of the magazine under this massive portrait of a man pointing the middle finger at all of Sinaloa.
Bojorquez says he can't even consider shutting down. "How could I close down the paper when our intern asked to go out on the street and do a story on the same day that Javier was murdered?"
Hannu Manninen's Olympic project started with a huge setback - "Tough place"
The celebrations of Hannu Manninen, who turned 39 in April, were short-lived, as the professional pilot began preparing for the Olympic season.
However, the training season started disastrously when Manninen fell ill with the flu.
That was the beginning of a long period of illness that lasted almost five weeks.
May was practically completely spent ill.
First I had the flu and finally I had a childhood disease like an ear infection, for which I had to take a course of antibiotics.
I was only able to do ten percent of the planned exercises.
I can't remember the last time I was sick for so long.
It was a tough place when I couldn't take advantage of my enthusiasm for training," Manninen tells Ilta-Sanomat.
Test result collapsed
The 2007 World Champion did not receive a training permit until the second week of June, which was shown in the roller mat test carried out by the Research Centre for Competitive and Elite Sports KIHU on 12 June.
In the test, the athlete skies on roller skis on a mat, the speed of which is increased every three minutes.
After each three minutes, the mat stops for about ten seconds, and the tester takes a lactic acid sample with a needle from the athlete's fingertip.
Last fall, I stayed on the mat for 32 minutes, but now I only stayed for 28 minutes.
We came up against a wall," Manninen says.
Better
After the initial difficulties, Manninen says he has remained healthy.
I have done a wide range of calm aerobic exercises to normalize the body's metabolism.
Now we have a really good five-week period behind us.
Midsummer also included a week and a half off from flight work.
I also had time to visit the cottage with my family.
Last season, Manninen participated in only four World Cup competitions before the home World Cup in Lahti.
The best result was seen right from the opening race, when Manninen rose to 18th place in top skiing.
Guidelines drawn
Manninen and national team head coach Petter Kukkonen have drawn up a training and competition plan until next February.
We are now looking for a different rhythm in training compared to last season.
After the first snow races, Ruka would have a weekend of three World Cup races.
In December, the intention would be to participate in at least one World Cup weekend, perhaps in Ramsau.
At the end of January, the plan is to be involved in Seefeld.
Hopefully, after that, the name will be on the list of the Olympic team, Manninen says.
The Pyeongchang Olympics would already be the sixth Winter Olympics of Manninen's career.
Now the most important thing is to stay healthy, underscores Nummelalainen, who celebrated gold in the team competition in Salt Lake City in 2002.
The dinosaur protected itself from its enemies by disguising itself
At first it looks like a scary statue.
Now, scientists have revealed the first results of research on a rhino-sized creature discovered by a Canadian miner that was so well preserved that experts call it the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs.
It had been preserved so well that researchers could even determine that its scaly skin was reddish-brown and had had a "problematic past."
According to the journal Current Biology, it is the best-preserved armored dinosaur of all time and one of the best representatives of its kind in the world.
The recently discovered fossil is a nodosaurus that lived in the middle of the Cretaceous between 110 and 112 million years ago.
Scientists consider this amazingly well-preserved fossil to be a truly remarkable discovery.
According to National Geographic magazine, the armored herbivore is the best-preserved fossil of its kind ever.
It was found at the Suncor Millenium mine in northern Alberta, Canada, on 21.3.2011 by a miner named Shawn Funk.
He hit something that didn't seem to be a natural part of the surrounding rock and decided to investigate his discovery further.
The fossil found in the rock was sent to the Royal Palaeontological Museum in Tyrrell.
There, the beast was dug up for six years from a 1,100-kilogram boulder.
The results of our hard work are now visible.
"If you squint your eyes, you can almost believe it was sleeping," says science writer Caleb Brown, who works as a researcher at the Royal Museum of Tyrrell.
"It will go down in the history of science as the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs, as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs.
Leather's research found that meat-eating dinosaurs were likely a significant threat to this herbivore, even though it had armor and resembled a walking tank.
Its red-and-white armor camouflaged it from predators, and it was also protected by a darker color on top and lighter underneath, which is still found in many animals today.
According to experts, this allowed it to blend in better with its surroundings and avoid its enemies, the larger dinosaurs.
The 110-million-year-old nodosaur made headlines in May and is now on display at the Royal Paleontological Museum in Tyrrell.
Researchers have named it Borealopelta markmitchell after museum technician Mark Mitchell. Mitchell was part of a team that took more than 7,000 hours to unearth a dinosaur.
Nodosaurus has been preserved so amazingly well that Mitchell and an international team of scientists have been able to determine the patterns and shape of the scales and armor on its body.
They found that it was still protected by the colouring common in the animal world, where the body is darker on top and lighter underneath.
The finding was still a surprise, since the Borealopelta is significantly larger than today's animals with similar coloring.
It suggests that meat-eating dinosaurs preyed on it to such an extent that evolution favored hiding rather than fighting as a means of survival.
Among the existing animals, deer, zebras and armadillos, for example, have a similar coloration. They are significantly smaller and therefore easier to catch, suggesting that the nodosaurus was also seriously threatened.
"The predation of a large, heavily armored dinosaur shows just how dangerous Cretaceous dinosaurs were," Brown says.
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in Nodosaurus' scales reveals that its skin was reddish-brown.
Scientists continue to study the nodosaurus in order to draw conclusions about its life. Among other things, they examined its intestinal contents to find out what it ate at its last meal.
Scientists believe that when it died, it fell into the river and drifted into the sea, where it sank on its back to the seabed.
It was as warm in Alberta then as it is today in Florida, and the rivers and seas likely stretched much further than they do today.
"This nodosaurus is really remarkable because its scaly skin has been preserved and it has also been preserved in three dimensions in its original form," Brown says.
"That's why it looks almost the same as it did in the Early Cretaceous
It doesn't take a lot of imagination to figure it out: if you squint your eyes a little, you can almost believe it was sleeping."
The Cretaceous was the era of theropods, huge bipeds, carnivorous dinosaurs.
Although their king, Tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years before Borealopelta, its mighty predecessors may have preyed on this armored dinosaur.
Tyrannosaurus rex's predecessors included Acrocanthosaurus, a six-ton monster about 11.5 meters long.
The latest findings by Nodosaurus scientists have been published in the journal Current Biology. They believe that Borealopelta washed into the sea after his death and was mummified in mud.
It was found at the Suncor Millenium mine in northern Alberta, Canada, on 21.3.2011 by a miner named Shawn Funk.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved armored dinosaur in the world with skins and armor from muzzle to hips.
Nodosaurs averaged five meters long and weighed up to 1,300 kilograms.
Two half-metre spikes rose from their shoulders.
Scientists believe that this armored herbivore passed through present-day Western Canada until a flooded river carried it into the open sea.
Its armour has been preserved down to the smallest details in an undersea tomb.
Its fossilized remains have been preserved so well that its skin still remains in the bumpy plates of armor along its skull.
Michael Greshko wrote in National Geographic that such survival is "as rare as winning the lottery.
The closer you look at it, the more amazing it feels.
The bumpy plates of its skull armor still have fossilized leather.
Its right front foot is on its side, five toes up.
I can also calculate the scales on the sole of its foot."
How did one activist learn to answer the question: who do the streets belong to?
Brittany Ferrell was deeply shocked on 09/08/2014.
He had arrived in New York the day before from his home in St. Louis and was sitting on the bed of his Airbnb apartment, scrolling through Facebook on his phone.
That's when she noticed a message from a high school friend:
"The police just killed an 18-year-old youth, and his body is still on the street."
Confused, she noticed that no one else had posted the same information on her feed. That's why he shut down Facebook and opened Twitter.
His timeline featured numerous retweets from a user @TheePharoah.
The username belongs to the St. Louis-based rapper who tweeted in real-time about Michael Brown's death. Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man, had been shot dead by white police in Ferguson, Missouri.
The user in question had also posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body on the street, where it was left for four hours.
"This is incredible," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to him and his community.
He put his phone away. When he returned to Twitter later that night, there were reports that people were gathering on Canfield Drive.
Users posted pictures of police barracks and screaming people, as well as a man claiming to be Brown's father, carrying a sign that read, "My unarmed son was just killed by Ferguson police!"
Ferrell watched real-time video footage of police standing in front of protesters with a barking dog.
He says he also saw a video of another police officer cocking his rifle and shouting, "I'm going to kill all of you... animals."
"This is not normal," Ferrell remembers saying.
"It wasn't the kind of murder we're already used to and could be called typical.
That's when I felt cold shivers.
I was angry and crying."
He booked a return flight home the next day.
The plane landed at eleven o'clock in the evening. Ferrell went to pick up her six-year-old daughter from her father and decided they would leave for Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next nearly three years has been the subject of a documentary called "Whose Streets?". It premiered in cinemas on 11.8.2017.
The film is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, and strength and resilience from the point of view of the local people who took to the streets to demand answers.
As Ferrell drove toward Ferguson with her daughter, dressed in a floral dress and matching crown, they had another conversation about "what it's like to live black and under what circumstances." They had talked about it countless times before that morning.
"Remember when I told you how blacks have had to fight for the things they believe in?" Ferrell remembers saying to his daughter.
"We're going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that's not right."
"I couldn't help but take my daughter with me," Ferrell later recounted.
"Today's events are... the culmination of events from the past.
My daughter has the right to know that and grow into it.
They need to be prepared for activism and organization, but they also need to know the different layers and circumstances of the experience of living as a black person. And he needs to know what we have to do to liberate, to free ourselves.
While I've thankfully been able to protect her from blatant racism, she's still like other black girls.
I feel like I would hurt him if I protected him from reality."
Their first stop in Ferguson was South Florissant Road, located across from the police station. It became a camp for activists as they waited for information on the handling of the case and eventually learned that no charges would be brought against the police.
From there, Ferrell and his daughter went to help a local entrepreneur who made packed lunches.
They packed lunches in bags and distributed them to protesters.
Ferrell gradually began to take a new approach to activism.
"My activism changed completely after August 9th," she says. While attending the University of Missouri in St. Louis, Ferrell was president of the Association of Minority Nursing Students. At the time, she focused on food justice and health inequalities in Black communities.
"I had no experience of organizing.
Somehow it just happened."
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, the documentary's assistant director, at an evening protest.
Folayan said he and cinematographer Lucas Alvarado-Farrar "simply wanted to tell" what was happening.
Doubt crept into Ferrell's mind. He asked, "Do you really want to tell what is happening, or do you want a story that you can use to your advantage?"
The suspicion stemmed from the countless times people had appeared in the local community, usually white, who simply wanted to profit from its difficulties and perseverance.
"We had heard that those born and raised in Ferguson did not have a common voice," Folayan said in a recent interview. "We wanted to do things differently."
Folayan had already contacted assistant director Damon Davis, known for his activism with death row inmates.
Davis' involvement led Ferrell to join the project with six other locals. The film crew followed the events in the years following Brown's shooting.
"This is not a documentary where someone speaks to us or speaks for us, we speak," Davis says.
"For me, the most important thing was how the local people are portrayed in the film, because I'm portrayed the same way."
According to Folayan, the intention was not to focus on Ferrell's experiences because they wanted to show that the popular movement "is not about a charismatic leader, but about a community." However, Ferrell proved to be the most open of the subjects.
That's why the documentary shows surprisingly private aspects of Ferrell's life, such as falling in love and getting married.
"I felt pretty naked," Ferrell laughs as he explains how it felt to see the film for the first time.
"But I realized that this work and the humane portrayal of blacks requires a certain vulnerability."
In addition, Ferrell's story recaps and refocuses on the role of black queer women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
The movement was born on social media (#BlackLivesMatter) after police shot and killed a black teenage boy, Trayvon Martin, in 2012. Two of the movement's three founders identify with queer identities.
"The leadership of black queer women has kept the whole movement going," Ferrell says. "That's because we have to fight constantly on many fronts.
Black queer women have had to endure everything."
Folayan agrees, "The movement is really run by black women, including a lot of queer women."
However, he emphasizes that Ferrell was not chosen for the documentary "as an end in itself" because of his queer identity.
"He got the energy going," Folaya says.
"However, it is no coincidence that he was on the front line. Black queer women live at the intersection of many things, and they have a lot at stake.
His energy is conveyed on screen."
News crews have long since left Ferguson, but relations between the community and police remain strained.
Ferrell still has two and a half years left on parole. He was convicted of blocking a motorway during a demonstration.
His description of the sociopolitical climate in his home neighbourhood is short and to the point: "A mess."
Yet he still relies on a slogan he memorized on the streets of Ferguson three years ago:
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We can only lose our chains."
Matching resemblance: artist creates portraits of Chelsea Manning's DNA
The Fridman Gallery in New York has faces hanging in the middle of the exhibition space – white, black and brown faces that resemble each other on closer inspection.
These 30 works are portraits by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg based on DNA samples taken from Chelsea Manning's cheek and hair.
Manning sent samples from Fort Leavenworth Prison, where he was serving his 35-year sentence. Manning was convicted of leaking classified diplomatic telegrams to WikiLeaks.
Dewey-Hagborg's exhibition A Becoming Resemblance opened on 2.8.2017.
It is based on two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg and Manning. Dewey-Hagborg's work combines technology, information technology and art. Manning is a trans woman and pioneering dissident whose prison sentence was commuted by Barack Obama on the third-to-last day of his term.
Dewey-Hagborg algorithmically analyzed Manning's DNA and created 30 portraits based on his genetic data. They are a sharp, if somewhat theoretical, statement on the modifiability, ambiguity, and cause-effect relationships and identity behind DNA data.
Chelsea Manning, born Bradley Edward, has openly stated that she has identified with women since puberty. He was found guilty of 20 offences in 2013, including violation of the Espionage Act, computer fraud and theft.
There was only one photo of Manning, who had been sentenced to prison: a grainy, black-and-white selfie of an embarrassed Manning sitting in the driver's seat of a car. She wears a platinum blonde wig, which became her hallmark.
Dewey-Hagborg had the hugely popular Stranger Visions project behind her in 2015, which she carried out in 2012.
In it, he created portraits based on forensic data. He obtained DNA data from cigarette butts and chewing gums, for example, and created images of what the people in question might have looked like.
Then the artist received an email from Paper Magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning and needed a picture for their story," Dewey-Hagborg told a news conference for the new show.
Manning could not be visited or photographed in prison. So the magazine contacted Chelsea and asked if she would be interested in making a DNA portrait of Manning.
The artist and his imprisoned muse unexpectedly became correspondent friends. They wrote to each other for a couple of years.
They even made a comic book together, Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanungo. It depicted a future in which the president would have commuted Chelsea's sentence and he would get to see the show.
In reality, Obama shortened Manning's sentence just days after the comic book was published. It was a fortunate coincidence after seven tough years in a military prison in Kansas.
It's also impressive that the exhibition opens right now, when Donald Trump is waging his own war against whistleblowers and transgender soldiers, finding more and more ways on Twitter to reinforce the strong divisions he actually needed to defuse.
Dewey-Hagborg believes that "everything has a purpose."
On the wall of the gallery is a statement by the artist and underneath it is a large autograph of Manning, where the dot of the i in the surname is the heart. In his statement, the artist calls for an end to "the automatic divisions on which gender, race, sexuality and culture are based."
On the opposite wall is a sequence of Manning's DNA: a long string of letters C, G and A written in pencil.
With this combination of 200 letters – or nucleotide, as the artist's scientific definition goes – Dewey-Hagborg wants to illustrate how similar we all are, at least in terms of biology.
"I hope that my exhibition will help people understand that we are genetically equal and that genetic information is very personal and open to interpretation," Dewey-Hagborg says. The exhibition also features his video work Spurious Memories from 2007.
"DNA tells countless stories. 30 of them are on display here."
The last work in the exhibition is in its own room: a page from Manning and Dewey-Hagborg's comic book.
In it, Manning's figure emerges from prison like King Kong, holding a megaphone.
"If they can silence you, they've won," the image reads.
"Never be silent."
"The text is from a letter I received from Manning," the Philadelphia-native artist says.
"It's so impressive that I still get chills."
Contrary to what was portrayed in the comic book, Manning has yet to see the show. When Manning arrives, he is greeted by faces based on his own genetic information, like a crowd of protesters in the middle of the showroom.
It is intentional, like everything else in this exhibition: for example, Manning's DNA sequence is written in pencil at a height equal to his height (157.5 cm).
"The face used to be on the wall, but I wanted to give it the feel of a crowd," Dewey-Hagborg says.
"I wanted to describe the mass movement created by Chelsea, which was also behind his release."
Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee wanted on suspicion of murder
Police say they have launched a nationwide search to find a Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee suspected of stabbing a man to death in a luxury Chicago apartment.
Court documents in Cook County show that arrest warrants were issued Monday for Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, suspected of involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau. Arrest warrants have been issued for first-degree murder without the possibility of release on bail.
According to documents, Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after being stabbed multiple times.
According to a local bulletin released by the Chicago Police Department, the body was found on 7/27/2017.
Police officers alerted to the Grand Plaza apartment building found the victim with multiple cut wounds on his body.
Authorities said Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead at the scene and the stabbing is being investigated as a homicide. Police are actively searching for two suspects.
Lathem has worked as an assistant professor of microbiology and immunology at Nortwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the university's vice president for public affairs, said in an emailed statement that Lathem is now on administrative leave and has been banned from Northwestern University campuses.
"This is a criminal case that is being investigated by authorities and Northwestern University is assisting in the investigation," Cubbage wrote.
Warren works as a senior finance assistant at the University of Oxford.
A spokesperson for the university and Somerville College said in an emailed statement: "We have been in contact with police in the UK and stand ready to assist the authorities investigating the case in the United States in any way we can."
In addition, the statement said Warren's colleagues are shocked and hope she will surrender.
Chicago Police Department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said he is seriously urging suspects to surrender to authorities.
"The police have an idea of their whereabouts, and we are constantly refining our search," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities are assisting in the search for suspects.
He said police received a call from the property manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had received a vague tip that something had happened in apartment 1008.
Police described the scene as horrific.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the victim was murdered on the same day or earlier.
He said security cameras revealed that Lathem and Warren had been in the building.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had an affair," Guglielmi says.
Grand Plaza's management team issued the following statement to residents: "Police are currently investigating the course of events and the victim's background, as well as possible motives, including the possibility of domestic violence."
Man threatened to blow up Islamic bookstore and 'kill Muslims' in London
"I am not anti-Muslim, I am Catholic," the convict told police.
Moffatti must complete one hundred hours of unpaid community service.
A 39-year-old man was convicted of threatening to blow up an Islamic bookshop in London and "kill all Muslims".
According to the Independent, David Moffatt was convicted of aggravated harassment, among other charges.
According to police, bookstore staff alerted them on May 23.
Staff said the man had "threatened to blow up a bookstore and kill Muslims."
The suspect left the store after the threats.
Moffatt was caught when he called the police about threats.
The threats were not related to the events at the bookstore.
Authorities discovered that Moffatt was wearing the same outfit as the suspect in the bookstore incidents, a police spokesman said.
I'm not anti-Muslim, I'm Catholic," Moffatt told police during questioning.
As punishment, the man must perform one hundred hours of unpaid community service and pay legal costs of £620, or approximately €690, and compensation of £85, or approximately €95, to the victims.
According to a Scotland Yard spokesperson, several hate crimes remain unreported.
"We will complete the actions according to WADA's roadmap in the near future" – Vitaly Mutko Deputy Prime Minister of Russia
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko has said that Russia will soon complete measures in line with the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) roadmap to restore the mandate of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
"Some of the measures outlined in the roadmap have already been implemented, and RUSADA was given the right to design and test in cooperation with UKAD, the UK Anti-Doping Agency.
WADA's roadmap has been updated in this regard," Mutko said on Thursday.
The Deputy Prime Minister commented on the second part of WADA's roadmap, which sets out the conditions for the restoration of RUSADA's powers. The second part of the roadmap was recently published on the organisation's website.
According to Mutko, it does not contain anything worrying for Russia.
"Everything has been announced, and everything will be implemented.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee and WADA in the near future," Mutko added.
However, one of the points in the roadmap requires Russian anti-doping authorities to publicly approve the results of the WADA-ordered investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren. McLaren is investigating the state's alleged involvement in doping in Russian sport.
To which Mutko stated: "The investigation is ongoing because our anti-doping system has admitted failure.
All measures have been taken.
There were no government programs, and we can't admit things that didn't exist."
Mutko's words echoed a statement by Vitaly Smirnov, chairman of Russia's independent public anti-doping agency.
Speaking to Russian sports media RSport earlier in the day, Smirnov admitted that there have been problems with Russia's anti-doping bodies. "We have said several times that the report contains controversial positions and provisions.
We will not accept the report unconditionally," he added.
WADA ordered RUSADA to stop doping control in Russia in November 2015 after the extent of the doping scandal was revealed.
However, last June it was authorised to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and UKAD.
WADA Director Olivier Niggli visited RUSADA headquarters in Moscow in July. After the visit, he said the organisation was "on the right track" towards restoring its mandate.
British organisation sceptical about innovation dear to Finns: There is "no evidence" of the health benefits of maternity packages
A British organisation doubts the benefits of Finnish-style maternity packages.
The BBC and the Guardian, among others, report that the Lullaby Trust, which fights sudden infant death syndrome, bans the use of its own brochures on maternity packages distributed in Britain.
The distribution of maternity packages to all pregnant women will begin this month in Scotland.
In England, too, packaging is distributed in some regions.
According to the Lullaby Trust, there is no evidence that the maternity package reduces the risk of sudden infant death syndrome.
Cot death refers to the sudden and unexplained death of a baby.
The Lullaby Trust is the UK's health authority expert on safe sleep for children.
We will no longer allow our official brochures to be packaged in them, as this would imply that we recommend this product.
Finland has one of the lowest infant mortality rates in the world, with only two deaths per thousand births.
According to the Lullaby Trust, Finland's good figure is due to a variety of reasons, including the low number of teenage pregnancies.
The fact that they give each family a box may be one factor.
But you can't say that for sure," Lullaby Trust CEO Francine Bates said.
We are concerned that maternity packages are being marketed as products that reduce infant mortality and cot deaths.
The maternity package is a Finnish invention, and it has been given to all mothers in Finland free of charge for 80 years.
The package includes various accessories, such as children's clothing.
This year, there are 53 items in the package.
The packaging itself is a cardboard box in which the child can be put to sleep.
According to the Scottish Government, the boxes it distributes meet all safety standards.
The Lullaby Trust, on the other hand, says there is no safety standard for cardboard boxes as a sleeping place.
According to the Lullaby Trust, packaging may be the best option for a sleeping place if there is no cradle or crib available.
The organization recommends using the kit only for naps and stopping using it when the child is able to turn.
The organization also recommends keeping pets out of the packaging and making sure they don't get wet or dirty.
A nimble villain escaped from a Japanese zoo for the second time
Staff at a Japanese zoo search for an escaped turtle.
The giant turtle has surprised the staff with its speed and escaped for the second time in two weeks.
The turtle escaped from the Shibukawa Zoo in Okayama, western Japan, on Tuesday morning.
Security cameras revealed that the villain left the zoo through the main entrance.
It won't die right away because it eats the grass around the zoo, but we're very worried," said Yoshimi Yamane, who works at the zoo.
The escaped 35-year-old villain is a female, 55 kilograms tall and about a meter tall.
Yamane describes the fugitive as quiet and gentle.
During opening hours, the villain is allowed to roam freely around the shelter area.
The zoo has not received any eyewitness sightings of the turtle.
The villain's last escape took place the week before last.
Yamane found the fugitive walking along a road 150 meters from the zoo.
I noticed it on the way to the zoo.
I stopped my car and asked my colleagues for help," Yamane said.
It can walk faster than we could ever imagine.
These startups will help your business avoid Uber's mistakes
Amy Errett wanted to measure employee satisfaction at her e-commerce startup, but the surveys didn't work.
The answers were often vague, useless, or even misleading.
Although he assured that the surveys were anonymous, some employees were suspicious of them.
"The surveys were simply neither consistent nor objective," Errett says. As her hair care company, Madison Reed focuses on e-commerce. The company has 75 employees.
Errett decided to resort to outside help.
More and more new types of HR startups have entered the market to help other companies figure out how their employees are doing.
They develop and license software that can measure employee engagement. Companies can conduct surveys and target specific teams and demographics, as well as provide anonymous whistleblowing services to their employees and, in some cases, direct access past senior management to the board.
"You can track your health with apps like Strava and Fitbit, but where is Fitbit?" asks Jim Barnett, founder and CEO of Redwood City-based startup Glint. Glint provides companies with analytics software to measure employee engagement.
Errett has been using Glint's software for three years. He says he has gained a deeper insight into the thoughts and feelings of his employees.
The program can be used to make quick polls and polls for specific teams. It can also be used to create a map that shows at a glance which departments have the most dissatisfied employees and which managers have received the lowest ratings. Based on these, Errett has been able to drill down to the root of the problems.
Companies have realized that they need to follow workplace culture so they don't become the next Uber. There has been turmoil around the transport company ever since a former employee wrote on his blog about a culture where employees are harassed and those who talk about problems are punished.
For startups like Glint, such omissions are an attractive business opportunity.
Corporate governance, regulation, and compliance is a global industry that could reach a value of more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to Let's Talk Payments.
Based in Denver, Colorado, Convercent is a startup that helps businesses detect and prevent inappropriate behavior. Interest in the company grew earlier this year when Uber's reputation suffered a blow.
Convercent has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
It also recently entered into an agreement with Uber.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to conduct customized surveys, collect responses confidentially in real-time, and map problem areas.
In addition, employees can report inappropriate behaviour anonymously via text message.
And if there is reason to suspect the manager of impropriety, complaints go directly to the board of directors of the company.
"Public opinion has sidelined the authorities," says Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent.
He points out that if a company treats its employees badly or acts unethically, the consequences can be costly even if the authorities do not intervene. Consumers can start boycotting the company, and it can also lose employees and be sued.
The Ruby Tuesday restaurant chain has more than 25,000 employees in 500 locations. The company has been using Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of policies and procedures and have easy access to headquarters.
Previously, if an employee wanted to report a problem, they first had to find out a phone number or email address that could be used to report it to headquarters. Then he had to file a formal complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
"It was often a scary and unpleasant experience," says James Vitrano, general counsel at Ruby Tuesday. According to him, complaints from employees were difficult to follow.
In the past, problems remained hidden from managers working in another city or state. Now problems such as discrimination, harassment and unfair wages can be detected and dealt with more quickly.
"It gives me a more holistic and comprehensive understanding of the employee's reality," says Vitrano, who leads Ruby Tuesday's risk management team.
"At the same time, we protect our shareholders from employment litigation."
According to Quinlan, companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously after auditing firm Arthur Andersen collapsed as a result of unethical conduct in connection with the Enron scandal.
It wasn't until the advent of social media that companies realized that they could no longer prevent their dirty laundry from being publicly cleared.
"Hope was used as a strategy before technology came into the grip of ethics," Quinlan says.
Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service that is subject to regular charges.
It is a business model and opportunity accepted by venture capitalists. Both Glint and Convercent have the support of venture capitalists.
Convercent raised $10 million in funding in February from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital. It has raised a total of $47 million in capital.
Glint received €10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November and has raised a total of $60 million in funding.
The investments come as no surprise, given the links between companies, corporate culture and venture capital.
According to several studies, employees expect more from their jobs.
In a competitive market like Silicon Valley, good salaries and interesting projects are just the beginning.
Employees want to feel accepted, valued, and giving their time to a genuinely useful company.
"Employees are more committed to the success of the company if they enjoy the company, feel listened to and rewarded," says Nina McQueen, LinkedIn's senior vice president of employee compensation and wellbeing.
Investors get returns when companies are successful. Companies thrive when employees engage.
Third-party analytics tools promise to amplify employee engagement, so it's no wonder they're attracting investors.
According to workplace culture experts, knowledge of employee engagement is important,
But it will be useless if no action is taken on its basis.
If a company asks its employees for feedback, it can be seen as a sign of change.
And if change doesn't come fast enough or nothing changes, disappointment can reduce employee engagement.
"If you ask for four thousand proposals, you have to be prepared to have four thousand conversations," says Russell Raath, chief executive of management consulting firm Kotter International, who has seen companies rely too much on data collection alone.
"If the company doesn't take action, employees start to wonder if they were heard
And whether their opinions matter at all.
If the company doesn't care about them, why should they care about the company?"
According to Errett, Madison Reed now conducts employee surveys on a monthly basis and is able to address the issue on the same day it is reported on Glint.
After collecting feedback from employees frustrated with slow decision-making and communication quality, Errett was able to make team changes and conduct communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday understands its employees better and hopes that deeper understanding will help it improve long-term employee retention in an industry known for high employee turnover.
"If a company doesn't commit to creating a culture of transparency, it will lose employees," Vitrano says.
"If it loses employees, it also loses customers.
And without customers, there are no companies."
In Sweden, a 20-year-old man is suspected of secretly photographing his naked female neighbour, according to news agency TT.
A woman in Gothenburg had taken a shower at home when she noticed a mobile phone hanging from the end of a string outside her window.
According to the woman, the cell phone camera filmed into the apartment.
The woman, frightened by the incident, had run to another room to get dressed.
When the woman arrived to check on the situation, the mobile phone had first been pulled up, but soon after lowered into the window again.
A 20-year-old man suspected of undercover photography has admitted to photographing a woman.
However, he claimed to have only photographed the woman's face.
The mobile phone video had been deleted and the police had not been able to return it as evidence.
During interrogation, the man has admitted to the act but denied committing the crime.
The man had justified his filming by saying that he loves his neighbor "absolutely crazy."
According to news agency TT, the man will be charged in connection with the incident.
Teachers demand more liquor in autumn negotiations
Wage development cannot be lower than, for example, in the export industry, but the gap should be narrowed, said Olli Luukkainen, Chairman of OAJ, on Thursday.
The temporary cut in public sector holiday bonuses highlights the difference, he points out.
We are not in a position to make agreements that do not in some way include the cuts in holiday bonuses that have been made.
In the municipal sector, agreements are likely to be concluded only after the private sector papers have been signed and the increase percentages are clear.
Luukkainen predicts that, for example, OAJ's terms of employment will have been agreed in January.
Luukkainen did not yet reveal the percentage targets.
Luukkainen is also the chairman of Juko, the negotiation organisation for educated people in the public sector.
Luukkainen: Holiday bonus cut increases earnings development differentials
According to OAJ, statistics and forecasts show that the purchasing power of public sector wage earners is weakening, while the purchasing power of the private sector is increasing.
According to Luukkainen, the fixed-term holiday bonus cut will further exacerbate differences in earnings development.
In Finland, it must be determined how many pupils there can be per teacher
OAJ also points out that equality in basic education must be ensured, as the differences between those who do best and worst are constantly growing.
According to the organisation, learning outcomes are deteriorating and disparities between both pupils and regions are constantly increasing.
Bruins players' day lengthened as the NCAA reduced daily practices from two to one
It will soon be eleven o'clock in the evening. A group of UCLA American football players have stayed to chat on the other side of campus' new practice grounds.
Some have taken off their jerseys. Their backs glow with sweat after the drudgery of the first day of training camp.
For quite a few of them, this few minutes of chatting is a midday break.
Players studying in the university's summer courses return to the dormitory after three hours of practice to read for the final exams. The next morning they gather at half past seven at the Wasserman Football Center.
"The next three days are going to be tough for these guys," Bruins coach Jim Mora said shortly before Monday turned into Tuesday.
The umbrella organization for university sports reduced the number of daily training sessions from two to one. The change was meant to lighten the workload on the players, but it has extended their days – at least until Friday, when the final exams will be held.
That's why UCLA's first three drills began at a quarter past seven in the evening. It was difficult to find space in the already full schedules of the players.
Limiting the number of training sessions to one per day means that there will be more training days than before. Camp started almost a week earlier this year than last year, and this is the first time in Mora's six seasons as Westwood's coaching staff that practices have been held to coincide with summer classes.
Practices are scheduled to be held 18 times before Aug. 20, when the actual preparations for the season opener begin: UCLA will face Texas A&M University in September.
Mora says he supported the NCAA's rule change, even though it made players' schedules even tighter.
"We put a lot of strain on them for three or four days, and that's very challenging," Mora says.
"But the players are ready to work. They're great guys.
I think things will get easier when we get to Saturday. Then we will have more time.
UCLA closes training sessions to outsiders after camp. It is not easy, given the direct view from the training grounds to the adjacent car park and the Luskin Center, an upscale hotel that has already been bombarded with footballs flying over the protective net behind the goalpost.
Bruins players are scheduled to move into the hotel this coming weekend, but Mora admits problems can arise during the season when rooms are available to outsiders.
"We have security arrangements," Mora says.
"The concern is that people can book a room and shoot exercises on video. That is not an exaggerated concern.
A video of rehearsals is paid quite a lot.
But we have guards there and in the parking lot.
We will do our best.
I'm not going to bother my head too much about it.
We have a plan."
Freedom in Rwanda
Presidential elections will be held in Rwanda in Central Africa on Friday, the winner of which is already considered clear.
Paul Kagame is officially running for his third term, but in practice he has influenced the leadership of the country since 1994.
It was then that the rebel group RPF put an end to the genocide organized by the Hutu extremists.
Kagame was the commander of the RPF.
Kagame has been criticized, among other things, for crushing the opposition and restricting freedom of speech.
He has also been accused, for example, of falsifying poverty statistics.
Kagame will be able to run for a third term because the constitution limiting his presidency to two terms was amended.
In Rwanda, however, Kagame is also a genuinely well-liked leader.
During his time, Rwanda has undergone social reforms and international investment has flowed into the country.
In addition, Kagame has played a big role in uniting a country divided by genocide.
The success of Rwanda has led many Africans to question whether liberal multi-party democracy is the right model for African states.
However, Kagamekin has promised his people more freedom once the country has been lifted to its feet.
Now might be a good time to start.
Facebook fights fake news by stepping up fact-checking
Facebook plans to increasingly send potential fake news to independent fact checkers and present the results below the original story. The world's largest social network made the announcement on Thursday.
The company released a statement on its website saying it will start using updated machine learning to identify fake news. Any fake news is sent to fact checkers and the results may be published below the original article.
Facebook has been criticized for being one of the biggest disseminators of fake news. Many believe that fake news influenced the outcome of the US presidential election in 2016.
The topic has risen to the forefront of political debate in Europe, where French voters were bombarded with fake news ahead of May's presidential election, and Germany, which is preparing for September's elections, supports a plan to fine social media networks if they do not remove hateful content urgently.
On Thursday, Facebook announced in a separate statement in Germany that fact-checking is being tested in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"People want to see which stories don't pass the screening of independent auditors. They also want more background information so they can decide more informed what to read and share," Sara Su, product manager for Facebook's News Feed, wrote on the company's blog.
He added that Facebook will continue to test Related Articles and make other changes to its News Feed to reduce fake news.
The Birth of a Comic Book: The Story of a Castle
Small Scotney Castle in County Kent is now known for the Squeeze music video and as Margaret Thatcher's hideout from the 1970s and 1980s.
However, it has 700 years of turbulent history behind it. Now this picturesque castle in the Bewl River Valley is the subject of a comic book by Jamie Rhodes, a mop-haired writer fond of old documents.
"I love being able to study a text written by someone who died over 300 years ago," Rhodes says wistfully.
"I feel a personal connection when I hold a letter in my hand."
Rhodes' book, A Castle in England, tells the stories of families who lived in Scotney from the Middle Ages to the Edwardian era. Each story is illustrated by a different artist, a promising British cartoonist: Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer or Isabel Greenberg.
This is not Rhodes' first book based on archives. In 2014, he published Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories, inspired by documents from the British National Library. The project was emotional.
"I was moved to tears when I noticed a thumbprint in the letter. The letter was written by a double agent who worked for the Jacobites in the 1700s," Rhodes says.
"It was his fingerprint!
And the letters smell like smoke, because at that time fire was used as lighting.
Three centuries later, the fragrance makes the reader feel that he himself is on the spot.
I love archives!"
Fascinated by old documents, the author was allowed to live in the castle for almost four months with the support of the National Trust and the National Arts Council of England, which seemed too good to be true. He admits that he couldn't wait to stay at the castle a little longer than he would have liked.
He spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, archives, treasures and rarities such as hyena heads hung on walls and bottles that had been in moats for centuries.
He toured the ruins and grounds of the old castle and talked with rangers, gardeners and sometimes artists illustrating the book.
In the evenings, he "took whiskey and began writing."
Scotney's closer history is relatively unknown, as the castle only passed entirely to the National Trust after the death of its last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, in 2006.
When Rhodes arrived about ten years later, the foundation's staff was just beginning to go through the archives. Rhodes describes that archives had been kept for hundreds of years using the same method: taking all the excess to the attic.
The archives contained diaries, letters from the times of the English Empire, and maps of who owned what. "You would think land disputes are boring," Rhodes says. "Here, however, families even fought over one birch.
It occurred to me that we shouldn't let it be."
Some of the stories in the book progress from the castle to English history, such as The Labourer. It tells the story of a man who, shortly after the castle was completed, joins the English Peasant Revolt in 1381.
"The Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex book mentions that there was a riot at the castle in 1380," Rhodes says.
"The peasant revolt in England started in the same area, and it occurred to me that a rebellion could start with a riot.
Maybe these events are connected?"
Other stories in the book are closely linked to the history of the castle – such as The Priest, the story of a priest whom Darrell's family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
The Smuggler tells the story of smuggler Arthur Darrell from the 1700s. He is said to have staged his own funeral by filling the coffin with stones (it was discovered years later when his tomb was opened).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family in Scotney. "The men in the family seem to have been quite rogues. They constantly got into debt and bought things they couldn't afford.
The men of the Darrell family solved their debt problems by marrying wealthy old women. I see them as handsome guys who knew how to court heiresses."
Now Rhodes is looking for new writing experiences.
He spent two weeks in Finland writing a comic book about Life Hill, a sanatorium that operated in the early 1900s, of which only a eutrophic plot remains.
Scotney Castle holds a special place in his heart.
"It was sad to leave," she says.
"I wouldn't have wanted to go back to this damn thing yet."
Relations with Russia the worst since the Cold War
Relations between NATO and Russia have deteriorated markedly, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said on Thursday.
Stoltenberg blamed Russia and its role in the conflict in Ukraine.
I think you can say that NATO's relationship with Russia is more difficult now than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War," Stoltenberg said in an interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could seek close cooperation with Russia.
But especially since the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the ongoing instability caused by Russia in the region of eastern Ukraine, NATO's relationship with Russia has deteriorated considerably.
According to Stoltenberg, however, NATO remains committed to working to prevent tensions from escalating.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can engage in political dialogue with Russia in order to avoid escalation and a new Cold War.
Before Stoltenberg's comments, U.S. President Donald Trump noted that relations between the U.S. and Russia had even reached a dangerously bad level.
Trump called for thanks for the bad relations between the two countries to Congress, which last week passed new sanctions against Russia.
Vladimir Klitshko quits - rematch against Anthony Joshua will not take place
Longtime world heavyweight champion Vladimir Klitshko of professional boxing is ending his career.
Klitshko, 41, from Ukraine, announced his decision on Thursday morning.
Klitshko, who won gold at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, fought 69 times as a professional, winning 64 of them.
He held various World Cup titles in 2000-02 and 2006-15.
Klitshko lost the last two matches of his career.
He was beaten on points by Tyson Fury in November 2015.
In April this year, Klitshko faced Anthony Joshua at Wembley Stadium and lost by knockout in the 11th round after a wild match.
Joshua and Klitshko were expected to face off in a rematch in November in Las Vegas.
However, Klitshko did not find motivation for the match.
I deliberately spent a few weeks making a decision to get enough distance for the Wembley game," Klitshko said in a statement.
As an amateur and professional boxer, I achieved everything I dreamed of, and now I want to start my second career after sports.
I could never have imagined having such a long and incredibly successful boxing career.
I am very grateful for that.
Watch Klitshko's reasoning for his decision in the video.
Klitshko's manager Bernd Bönte said in a statement that the decision to quit was difficult for Klitshko.
However, he has always emphasized that he wants to quit if he no longer has enough motivation.
Therefore, this is definitely the right decision," Bönte said.
Klitshko has been dating American actress Hayden Panettiere since 2009.
The couple has one child, daughter Kaya, born in 2014.
Klitshko's older brother Vitaly is also a former world heavyweight champion.
In 2008-12, the brothers dominated the World Cup titles of different federations at the same time.
Finland's weatherbreaker bewitches circumstances: "Takes away the vibe"
Pole vaulter Minna Nikkanen has suffered from conditions during the outdoor iron season this summer.
Minna Nikkanen has had problems with the circumstances.
The wind and cold have deprived the woman of her mood.
Even the World Cup in London is unstable.
Minna Nikkanen talks about the weather.
The conditions have been against pole vaulter Minna Nikkas this summer.
I don't want to blame the track, but it was unbelievable that I couldn't even get the small poles moving properly," Nikkanen said after the Innsbruck race.
I have competed and trained here for the umpteenth time and I have never experienced such a fluctuating wind in this place, Nikkanen told Paavo Nurmin Games.
This season, standardizing the jump has been really difficult, as there have been such unstable winds in training, Nikkanen said at the Kaleva Games.
The weather was also a hot topic in London on Thursday.
It has been quite challenging to get the technology together - is it cold jamming or what.
It's been cold and windy, and it's taken away the vibe.
It makes no sense to expend energy in bad conditions.
Thanks to his hall jump 455, he qualified for the World Championships.
Gone outside is 445.
Conditions are not the same for everyone in London.
You have to be calm and expect better winds.
The goal is to exceed 460 in Friday's qualifying.
Why don't you move to train abroad?
It is not necessary.
Last summer I was in Italy and Germany early in the season.
I managed to get the jump together and the technique standardized.
I probably should have done the same now.
Normally I have been able to practice in the hall, now the hall has been closed.
What would the ideal weather be like to race?
25 degrees warm.
Even a little wind will do, as long as it is constant.
An experienced ex-official blasted politicians at Yle: "We have no room for distribution now or for many years"
Despite the positive economic climate, Juha Sipilä's Government must keep ice in its hat and be careful not to inflate the state budget with debt money, warns Erkki Virtanen, who has been preparing budgets at the Ministry of Finance for decades.
According to him, there is no room for manoeuvre.
Yle interviewed Virtanen, who retired in 2015, on Wednesday's Ykkösaamu.
The construction of next year's state budget is just beginning.
Virtanen considers the proposals of politicians that have recently surfaced, such as raising the guarantee pension, lowering the car tax and subsidising e-bikes, to be election speeches.
They merely indicate that elections are approaching because, when ten per cent of the state budget is financed by additional debt, we will have no room for distribution now and for many years to come.
I think it's even a deception to talk about margin when debt is taken," Virtanen told Yle.
Virtanen emphasized that all debt is owed to children.
Virtanen has extensive experience in preparing state budgets: in 1978, he started at the Ministry of Finance as Budget Secretary and then worked as Deputy Head of the Budget Department and Budget Director.
Most recently, before retiring, he served as Permanent Secretary at the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment.
In an interview with Yle, Virtanen pointed out that the three per cent economic growth now forecast is likely to be temporary.
All forecasters estimate that this will be a spike that will start to go downhill as early as next year, and Finland is expecting a growth of one per cent for decades.
Washington changes permanent residence permit rules
According to media reports, President Donald Trump announced that the rules of the permanent residence permit, or Green Card, would be changed by a new immigration plan.
The aim is to reduce the number of legal immigrants to 50 000 per year, tighten the requirements for temporary work permits and limit family visas.
The new rules have been proposed by Republicans, and the president supports them.
The bill is scheduled to be debated in two chambers of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars of taxpayer money by changing the way permanent residency permits are issued to citizens of other countries.
It will also reduce chain immigration and replace the current programme.
The new application process will benefit applicants who speak English and are able to support themselves and who have skills that benefit our economy," Trump said, according to media reports.
The Queen of Denmark's consort does not want to be buried in the same place as the Queen
Prince Henry does not want to be buried with Queen Margaret.
Prince Henry and Queen Margaret pictured in April.
Queen Margaret of Denmark, 77, and her husband Prince Henry, 83, will not be buried next to each other, according to the Danish court.
Traditionally, monarch couples in Denmark are buried in the same place.
The Royal House has today announced that Prince Henry does not wish to be buried in Roskilde Cathedral, the court said in a statement on Thursday.
According to BT magazine, the reason for this is the prince's dissatisfaction with his role in the royal family.
It's no secret that the prince has been unhappy with his role and title in the Danish monarchy," Lene Belleby, the court's communications chief, told the newspaper.
For the prince, the decision not to be buried alongside the Queen is a natural consequence of not being treated as an equal to his spouse.
According to the court, the Queen has long been aware of her husband's wish for a burial site and understands the decision.
Moment of terror on the road: The car had to come on the highway
Tommi had a partner and two small children on board.
They were not injured in the accident, but will not receive money from the insurance if the other party cannot be reached.
The accident took place at Keimolanportti in Vantaa.
Archive photo from the Ring Road III construction site.
Tommi from Vantaa says his family miraculously survived a car accident on Tuesday.
Tommi, his partner Riina and the couple's two small children drove on the motorway near Keimolanportti in Vantaa in the direction of Hämeenlinna.
From the junction of Ring Road III to Hämeenlinnanväylä, a white car drove along the acceleration lane and drove into the side of the family's car," Tommi says.
According to Tommi, without the evasive manoeuvre, the car would have come on.
I braked and turned the car at the same time, and it got out of hand," Tommi says.
The family's car collided with a railing at high speed.
The parents and the two young children in the back seat were not injured.
One of the children is just under 3 years old, the other is less than one year old.
Apparently we were pretty lucky when nothing happened to us.
No one passing by even drove towards us, even though there was heavy traffic.
The accident occurred around 5:20 p.m.
According to Tommi, no one stopped by them, and the family called the emergency services.
They were able to get out of the car on their own.
Ambulance and rescue personnel arrived at the scene, and the family's condition was checked.
The car went into redemption condition.
Tommi says that he and his partner have a low income, and they received a subsidy from the family to buy a car a couple of years ago.
According to Tommi, without the details of the other car, the family will not receive any money from the insurance.
Therefore, the family hopes for eyewitness observations of the car that caused the family to drive into the railing.
We need a car every day.
It's hard to take children to a shelter and go to work without it," Tommi says.
Tommi saw that the car was a white, rather old car.
It was probably from the late 1990s or early 2000s.
In his opinion, the beginning of the registration number of the car was SIG.
If the culprit is not caught, I do not know how we will manage financially, we will still have to count every penny today.
Tommi hopes that those who have seen the incident or know something about it will contact the police.
The Eastern Uusimaa Police Department and Central Uusimaa Rescue Department confirm that they had a mission at the scene of the accident on Tuesday evening.
Headline and story corrected at 9:15 p.m.: Contrary to what was originally reported in the story, according to Tommi, the other car did not enter the oncoming lane, but was driving from the acceleration lane into the side of the family's car.
Directed by Lotta Jäppinen, the show deals with relationships through humour - Self-revealing will be seen at the Which? theatre on Friday and Saturday
Lotta Jäppinen from Kouvola brings her directorial debut to the What? theatre.
Self-Revealer is a musical theatre performance about relationships gone wrong and inadequacy.
According to director Lotta Jäppinen, it still leaves a good feeling.
The subject is dealt with through humour.
You won't dwell on bad feelings, he says.
According to Jäppinen, the touring summer theatre performance has been carried out with a small budget and a big, young heart.
The title of the performance challenges you to think about what a person reveals about themselves when they get to know a new person.
Is he perhaps pulling one role or approaching another with his jacket open?
Plotless presentation mixes fact and fiction
Jäppinen has both directed and dramatised the performance.
He is also responsible for the lights.
The presentation consists of texts from the working group and has no plot.
The director believes that although the performance draws on the ideas of young people, it speaks to people of all ages.
Jäppinen emphasizes that Self-Revealer does not directly tell about his own or the team's relationships.
Fact and fiction are mixed.
My own values are certainly conveyed in the presentation.
I don't think relationships are bad, but I also don't think that relationships, especially relationships, are a prerequisite for happiness.
Many learn from divorced parents
Jäppinen believes that Self-Revealer paints a topical picture of young adults living in hundred-year-old Finland.
According to him, many have learned a lot about relationships from their parents, many of whom are divorced.
At least that you have to listen to yourself.
You don't have to stay in a bad relationship.
The show stars Minea Lång, Niklas Rautén and Otto Rokka.
The working group also includes costume designer Ella Snellman.
The music is arranged by Jäppinen and Rokan.
Love for theatre ignited in Kouvola
Lotta Jäppinen, 26, from Kouvola, is studying to become a director of theatre expression at the Turku University of Applied Sciences Art Academy.
It's been two years and it's another one in front.
Jäppinen's enthusiasm for theatre began during his years in Kouvola.
The music class graduate has worked as an assistant at the Kouvola Theatre and acted at the Student Theatre in Helsinki and most recently at the Castle Theatre in Turku.
Directing has become more and more interesting.
Self-revealing premiered last week in Helsinki on the stage of the Fool.
The 45-minute performance is likely to be seen in the future, at least in Jäppinen's student city of Turku.
Self-revealer at Kouvola's What? Theatre 4.8. at 7pm and 5.8. at 2pm and 7pm.
Finnish Olympic champion recovered for a year from horrific motocross accident - broken cervical spine
Few athletes in Finland are as unstoppable a force of nature as Janne Lahtela.
The mogul skiing ace toured the world hundreds of days a year for twenty years, chasing his dream of Olympic gold.
The dream came true in 2002, but Lahtela's business continued.
He was not only a tireless trainee, but also an experimenter of new sports.
There are probably not many forms of exercise on earth that a Kemijärvi resident has not tried at least once.
It has inspired me to practice.
There is always something new, Lahtela says.
In the end, one hobby was to stop Lahtela completely.
In 2014, Lahtela was involved in a motocross accident.
As a result, his cervical spine and both arms were broken.
I wasn't working anywhere.
I licked wounds at home for a year," Lahtela says.
Lahtela had bad luck.
He also admits that age may have played a part in the accident.
Riding a bike can sound wild.
But I didn't look for boundaries with it.
It's just such a tough sport that a forty like this shouldn't do too much!
After the accident, Lahtela found himself in a special situation.
His busy life stopped like a wall.
He had a long career as head coach of the Japanese national freestyle team.
Lahtela started in the position immediately after his career ended in 2006.
For the first time since I was 15, I had to be still.
I didn't really do much at all," Lahtela says.
Even during his coaching days, Lahtela often challenged his protégé on the slopes and in physical tests.
Surprisingly, stopping was a good experience.
I was so physically and mentally tired that even my own thoughts didn't seem reasonable.
Not even with the sport.
It was good to be in place.
I actually enjoyed it because I really just got to be there for once.
The mandatory break inspired Lahtela to become Finland's head coach.
Without stopping, he fears he would be burned out.
It's easier to find places in your body that have broken than intact!
Without the accident, I wouldn't have realized I needed rest so much.
Lahtela started as the coach of the Finnish national freestyle team about a year ago.
Around the same time, he found a safer hobby to replace speed sports.
I switched from motocross to disc golf!
It went right out of the mitten.
At worst, I spent seven hours a day throwing.
Although Lahtela has always been a super enthusiastic trainer himself, he does not demand that his trainees be like him.
I don't force everyone into the same mold.
In our sports culture, there is room to be unique and ways to become the best in the world.
Freestyle is a free style, and the mentality has always been in line with that," Lahtela says.
Sex robots are coming and we should be concerned
It's here: a report on technological advances in the sex robot industry – just when it felt like 2017 couldn't get any weirder.
Yes, you can.
Sex robots are a big deal now.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots over the next 5-10 years.
"We need to start taking the rise of sex robots seriously," says Noel Sharkey, co-founder and professor emeritus of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield.
Customers can choose the robot's eye color, nipple shape, and fingernail type.
"There is a lot of buzz about sex robots, but they're already selling quite a lot, and we're going to see more of them," Sharkey said at the report's launch.
Sex dolls have evolved from inflatable dolls to robots with warm-feeling silicone skin and AI-created features that resemble human behavior.
The user can also customize the robot to their own preferences, from eye color to nipple shape and fingernail type and color.
All the more troubling is that robots have a "personality" that makes Stepford women look like progressive freedom fighters.
Sex dolls have evolved into robots with silicone skin.
For example, the character traits of the RealBotix robot can be adapted to the user's preferences, for example to be shy.
Roxxxy Gold robots from True Companion have pre-programmed personalities: Frigid Farrah seems shy, Wild Wendy is adventurous, and so on.
"Roxxxy Gold's personality adapts as fully as possible to the personality of the user," the company's website advertises.
In other words, the robot likes the same things as the user.
It also has different moods:
For example, it can be tired, in the mood for a chat, or "in that mood".
There are many worrying features of the proliferation of sex robots. They replace real relationships, but even more dangerous is the subjugation of women and outright rape fantasies when the user approaches, for example, a robot programmed to be shy and resistive.
True Companion compares Roxxxy robot to vibrator on its website:
"Women have a vibrator. Why shouldn't men have a sex robot?"
However, sex robots are not just a fetish or a new kind of sex toy.
Their proliferation and development speaks of something darker and deeper in our culture: a decline from gender equality towards sexual intercourse, where subjugation is one option among others.
Of course, most men don't buy a sex robot, and their popularity is still marginal, even though the FRR report pointed to their growing popularity.
However, marginal phenomena say a lot about the spirit of the times.
And many people only start behaving strangely or offensively when the market allows them to.
It's no coincidence that sex robots are becoming more common at a time when women's rights are under threat around the world and there is a president sitting in the White House who has bragged about harassing women.
What's not most troubling about the television series The Handmaid's Tale is its strong imagery, such as images of hanged bodies and exhumed eyes. The most disturbing thing is how realistic the world of the series feels.
The Republic of Gilead is far from our reality, but right now it seems to be surprisingly short away.
Attempts are being made to make sex robots as much like real women (by pornstar proportions) as is technically possible.
Robot developers want their skin to feel real and their movements to mimic human movements as much as possible.
However, their "personalities" are far from reality.
The robot will not be able to leave the relationship or situation.
They have no will or history of their own—nothing suggestive of independence or breaking the fantasy of total submission.
They are pleasant servants.
Slave maids.
Police suspect: Two terrorist acts planned in Australia, group led by ISIS chief
The head of the extremist group ISIS led a group of Australian men suspected of planning to take a bomb onto an Etihad Airways plane.
According to the Sydney Morning Herald, one of the leading figures of ISIS had also sent bomb building blocks to Sydney.
It was suspected that the bomb was supposed to be taken to the plane on July 15, but the attempt was interrupted before security checked.
Police will not elaborate on why the attempt was interrupted.
Another plan of the suspected terrorists was to build a device to emit toxic colourless gas and take it to a crowded public place, such as public transport.
Australian Deputy Commissioner for Federal Affairs Michael Phelan says the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
Four men were apprehended in police raids on Saturday because of suspected terrorist plans.
One of the men has been released, but his questioning is also continuing.
The good things about Trump?
Makes Mitt Romney look like a paragon of common sense
During the Trump era, it has already been repeated ad nauseam that the strong division of voters has also broken families apart on an everyday level.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, counseling columns in American newspapers provided guidance on how to deal with relatives who voted for Trump.
They all want us to burst our information bubble.
Less attention has been paid to Trump's ability to unite families.
I'm telling you about this because my cousin visited me in New York this week. He is a Chicago-based left-wing poet who has long been at odds with the Republicans in our family.
He reminded us that a common enemy can have a powerful unifying effect.
Now that Trump is in the White House, all of my cousin's acquaintances—including the pro-Republican sibling with whom he has argued politics for decades—are suddenly and unexpectedly on the same side.
At the dinner table, that's a good thing, but in a broader sense, it involves significant risks.
Trump has given the left a new lease of life, but the distorting influence of his presidency may actually take us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and "normalization," we're talking about the frightening possibility that one day we'll no longer be horrified by his antics.
In the long run, there is an even more dire possibility that Trump will normalize the extreme Republicans on the right, who suddenly seem reasonable compared to Trump.
I remember wistfully Mitt Romney's low-key version of madness: a dog on the roof of a car, a 14% income tax (and at least we've seen his tax returns). Compared to Trump, they seem like very minor violations.
When Trump's term is over, the next Republican presidential candidate will only need to be clear-headed, and that immediately feels like a noticeable improvement.
When my cousin was visiting me, we took our children to the Central Park carousel. It's the largest carousel in New York's parks department and the best you can get in New York for three dollars without caffeine.
The horses on the carousel are huge, the characters in the middle – grotesque clowns and animals looking back in terror – are ominous, and the screaming music in the background is strangely fascinating.
Over time, many of New York's hallmarks fade into disappointment: the views of tall buildings become boring, the city's skyline becomes all too familiar, and the reality of the city does not correspond to dreams.
And yet, after 35 years, I still haven't completely gotten over the fact that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss cottage after all, but a big roundabout in north London. Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is a Swiss-inspired pub, but that doesn't count.
The Central Park carousel, on the other hand, is still a strangely magical experience – so much so that two two-year-olds, one eleven-year-old, and two women in their forties enjoy it immensely.
I would have given the carousel full marks if someone had asked for my review, but luckily no one came to ask.
Instead, I was asked this week at a department store to rate my "payment experience" on a scale of one to five stars before putting my credit card into the reader.
It's the same thing in a café in my neighbourhood, but there, I'm also given the opportunity to combine a 15 percent service fee with an estimate when I go to get a coffee at the counter myself.
This slows down everyday interaction and puts pressure on the customer service representative to put their personality on the line in a situation where it is not needed.
The department store saleswoman smiled apologetically as I tiredly gave my credit card experience five stars.
Shefki Kuqi sacked from Inter - "There was no management confidence"
FC Inter have today relieved Shefki Kuqi of his duties as coach of the club's representative team.
Fabrizio Piccareta, who previously worked as an assistant coach, will take over the coaching responsibilities.
The rest of the coaching group will continue in their current positions.
Italian Piccareta has previously worked as an assistant coach at English club Sunderland, among others.
The 51-year-old Piccareta, who joined Inter's coaching staff in January, has completed a UEFA Pro licence last year.
Stefan Håkans, Chairman of the Board of FC Inter, apologizes for the incident.
Changing coaches is never an easy or pleasant task.
However, Shefki Kuqi no longer had the trust of the club's management, so there was no other option, Håkans commented in the club's press release.
Piccareta's contract runs until the end of the season.
He, together with the rest of the coaching staff, will already be responsible for tomorrow's home game against HIFK.
According to information in the Ilta-Sanomat, there has been turmoil in the team throughout Thursday.
Kuqi told players Thursday morning that the club's assistant coaches Piccareta and John Allen have been sidelined.
Kuqi and Piccareta clashed strongly in Inter's match against PS Kemi last Saturday.
Linda Lampenius posted a youthful photo from the 80s - would you recognize a serious violin student?
Violinist Linda Lampenius posted a photo of her youth on Instagram.
Several hästägs have been added to the picture, which suggest that the musician is a 16-year-old student of the Sibelius Academy.
Lampenius herself wonders seriously about the young woman looking at the camera.
Long ago, seriously, he signaled.
If you don't see the picture, you can view it here.
Lampenius has previously published pictures from his past and has also spoken about painful topics.
Just over a year ago, she posted a couple of photos of herself on Instagram.
In one picture, she is seen 20 years ago, in the other, she poses now, as a mother of two.
In her caption, Lampenius reflects on her own growth as a person and refers to the eating disorders she suffered from when she was younger.
Exactly 20 years ago and today...
I still look a lot like that 26-year-old girl, but the difference is that I've learned to like myself and how I look.
After the text, she had added the hashtags life, eating disorder, insecure, self-confidence, self-esteem, love yourself, 1996, 2016, aging, girl, woman, getting older is cool.
Lampenius has spoken openly about her eating disorders in previous years.
Already at the age of 14, he was hospitalized for anorexia and orthorexia.
A little later, she also fell ill with bulimia, which was finally revealed only in 2006.
The healing began little by little.
In addition to therapy and peer support, Lampenius was helped by a new love.
Oscar Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital with chest pains
This is the second time Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital.
Last year, he was hospitalized for cuts on his wrist that prison officials said he sustained after falling in a cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after prosecutors appealed the original manslaughter conviction.
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day in 2013 by firing multiple shots through the toilet door at his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed he mistook his girlfriend for a nocturnal intruder hiding in the toilet.
Prosecutors have said they plan to appeal again because they think Pistorius' six-year sentence is too lenient.
The Prosecutor General intends to appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the appeal may be heard as early as this year.
If the appeal is successful, Pistorius' sentence could be extended to 15 years.
The death penalty does not exist in South Africa.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two illegally camped Bulgarians were arrested in Greece, the country's foreign ministry said, according to bTV.
Police arrested a group of people camping without permission in Sithonia on the morning of August 1. Among the campers were two Bulgarians.
They were released the same day, but the investigation into the case continues.
According to the television channel bTV, the Foreign Ministry later announced that it had released the Bulgarians.
The Greek authorities have tightened up the rules on free campsites and are already imposing hefty fines on anyone camping outside designated areas.
The inspections will continue until the end of the period.
The ministry indicated that the court might impose a fine.
Neste's share sinks - already down -7.7%

Red meat, dairy products and chocolate may relieve irritable bowel syndrome
Red meat and chocolate may sound like a digestive system nightmare.
However, a recent study claims the opposite: a diet high in meat protein and dairy products may ease irritable bowel syndrome.
Irritable bowel syndrome is an incurable disease that affects approximately 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 people in the United Kingdom. It causes stomach cramps, bloating, frequent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
People with irritable bowel syndrome are generally advised to avoid meat and dairy products. However, researchers at the University of Washington found that tryptophan, an essential amino acid contained in the protein, helps the body develop immune cells that strengthen intestinal tolerance.
According to study leader Marco Colonna, immune cells guard the gut and ensure that harmful microbes hidden in food do not enter the body.
Cells that cause inflammation are balanced by cells that strengthen tolerance. They protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance drops too close to inflammation, irritable bowel syndrome can result.
The experiments found that immune cells that strengthen tolerance are present in mice that have certain bacteria in their intestines.
This bacterium needs tryptophan for immune cells to appear. Tryptophan is one of the building blocks of proteins.
"We found a link between the bacterium Lactobacillus reuteri and the development of cells that promote tolerance. Lactobacillus reuteri is part of the normal gut microbiome," Professor Colonna says.
"The more tryptophan in the diet of mice, the more such immune cells they had."
If the same works in humans, a combination of Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria and a tryptophan-rich diet can strengthen gut tolerance and reduce susceptibility to inflammation.
In studying immune cells that strengthen tolerance, postdoctoral researcher Luisa Cervantes-Barragan found that although one group of mice had such cells, they did not exist in mice of the same mouse species, which were kept separate from another group.
He suspected that the difference was related to the gut microbiome of mice, that is, the normal community of bacteria, fungi and viruses in the digestive tract.
When the gut DNA of the mice was examined, six species of bacteria were found that were present in mice with immune cells but not in other mice.
When Lactobacillus reuteri was administered to mice that grew up in a sterile environment and did not have a gut microbiome and did not develop immune cells, immune cells began to appear.
The researchers wanted to find out how bacteria affect the immune system. They grew Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria in a liquid and transplanted small amounts of fluid – without bacteria – into immature immune cells isolated from mice.
Immune cells evolved into cells that strengthen tolerance.
When the active ingredient was purified from the liquid, it turned out to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism, known as indole-3 lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the diet of mice, the number of cells that strengthen tolerance increased by about 50 percent. When the amount of tryptophan was halved, the number of cells fell by half.
According to Cervantes-Barragan, humans have the same resilience-boosting cells as mice, and most of us have Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria in our digestive tract.
It is not yet known whether tryptophan by-products from Lactobacillus reuteri cause cells to develop in humans in the same way as in mice. However, genetic defects associated with tryptophan have been found in people with irritable bowel syndrome.
"We probably want to promote the development of these cells because they regulate inflammation on the inner surfaces of the intestines," says Cervantes-Barragan.
"High levels of tryptophan combined with Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria may contribute to their generalization."
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United got a "genius" after signing Nemanja Matic
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United got a "genius" in their ranks after signing Nemanja Matic. The midfielder made his debut for Manchester United in the match against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.
Matic, who moved from Chelsea for £40m, started with a 2-1 win in Dublin, United's last pre-season match before the UEFA Super Cup match against Real Madrid on Tuesday. He impressed as a defensive midfielder against stars such as Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira.
However, Matic was not yet in the best form as he was not involved in the blueshirts' Asian tour before the start of the season. He only managed 45 minutes on the pitch – that needs to change before the start of the Premier League season, according to Mourinho.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence and mindset make him a genius – he has a natural football mindset," Mourinho said.
"We'll help him be ready sooner rather than later."
In addition to Matic, newcomers Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku were also starting the game at Aviva Stadium when Mourinho began fine-tuning his starting eleven for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wants three more players, although the club have already done a "brilliant job" by signing three of his four prioritised players.
"Three out of four – we have to thank the club for that," he added.
"I'll be happier if I get all four, but they did an excellent job."
Volleyball women bullied Germany for two sets
The Finnish women's national volleyball team lost its fourth match of the World Cup qualifying tournament to Germany in straight sets 0-3 (23-25, 23-25, 14-25).
Germany's routine level of play is high.
Their game was even in every sector," said Finland's head coach Tapio Kangasniemi.
In the first two sets, Finland kept its opponents in a tight spot, but in the third set, Germany was clearly stronger.
Germany leads the group.
When we played patiently and aggressively enough in certain places, we were able to swing along," Kangasniemi said.
Finland's most effective was Piia Korhonen, who scored 14 points.
Finland, which has lost three games out of four, will still face Slovenia on Sunday.
Reuters: Grand Jury Already Subpoenaed Over Trump Jr.'s Russia Meeting
In the United States, a grand jury has sent subpoenas in connection with the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.
A grand jury convened by special prosecutor Robert Mueller has already sent subpoenas in connection with the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, known for her Kremlin ties.
According to Reuters, it also confirms information revealed by the Wall Street Journal earlier on Thursday that a grand jury will be convened.
According to Reuters, a grand jury has sent subpoenas in connection with a meeting between Trump Jr. and Veselnitskaya, known for her Kremlin ties, which took place in the middle of the US presidential election in June 2016.
Also in attendance were Paul Manafort, then Donald Trump Sr.'s campaign manager, and his son-in-law, current White House adviser Jared Kushner.
According to Reuters sources, the fact that special prosecutor Robert Mueller has convened a grand jury in Washington signals an intensification of the pace of the Russia investigation.
Sources add that Mueller wanted a grand jury to assist in the investigation, which seeks to determine Russian interference in the U.S. presidential election and whether the Trump campaign or his entourage cooperated with Russia on the matter.
The grand jury expands Mueller's rights to gather evidence, submit subpoenas and force people to testify under oath.
A large jury is a group of ordinary citizens who work behind closed doors.
A grand jury will weigh the evidence presented by the prosecution in the investigation and decide whether charges should be brought in the case.
A British inventor microchipped himself to get to his home and car with a wave of his hand
The British inventor is the first in the country to microchip himself so he can open the front door of his home, get to his office and start his car with a wave of his hand.
The microchip is between 33-year-old Steven Northam's thumb and forefinger. Now he offers a service to companies and individuals who want to make their lives easier with technology from Northam's BioTeq company.
Northam is working with Geoff Watson, consultant anaesthetist at Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Hants, Winchester, to ensure that the microchip installation meets medical requirements.
The microchip uses a similar technology to microchips in cats and dogs and takes only 30 seconds to install.
Northam's company also makes house and car locks compatible with the microchip. It costs £300 to process one lock.
Northam is married and has one child. He has installed microchip technology both in his home and in his BMW Z4, which starts when he puts his hand on the steering wheel.
White House exhibit cost thousands of dollars to taxpayers
The White House's decision last month to fly a naval helicopter to the White House's South Turf for an event showcasing American production cost taxpayers $24,000. This information appears from military documents obtained by TIME magazine.
The green-and-white Sikorsky VH-3D helicopter is referred to as Marine One when the President is on board. It was the main attraction of an event held at the White House on 17/07/2017 to showcase American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and a group of White House officials reviewed the products from all 50 states.
In addition to the Connecticut-made helicopter, a sailboat from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi were on display.
The White House military office had requested a helicopter on the scene by mission-specific order just about 36 hours before it landed on a southern turf for the "extraordinary" event. This is evident from the documents of the HMX-1 helicopter squadron of the Navy.
"I just wanted to make sure you were aware because this is an exceptional event that gets a lot of visibility," the HMX-1 unit commander wrote the day before the incident in an email to his superior, who is Deputy Commandant of Naval Air Command.
The message stated that the helicopter would arrive at the southern grass field on 17.7. at seven in the morning and the event would start at three in the afternoon. The helicopter would only leave the scene after the grass field was cleared between six and nine o'clock in the evening.
In addition, the message mentioned that if the helicopter's departure from the White House was delayed, another crew would be needed due to service time constraints.
The original crew was in the helicopter for the duration of the incident, and unit security personnel were at the helicopter while it was on the ground.
Documents obtained by TIME magazine do not indicate whether another crew was ultimately needed.
The Hatch Act in the United States prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
According to the documents, HMX-1 inquired whether the incident violated the law.
"One of our questions was whether this violated the Hatch Act. We were told not to break," the commander wrote.
"It sounds like you can contribute," the deputy commandant replied.
Made in America was an official White House event, so it was not covered by the Hatch Act.
But even official events have political overtones.
At the event, the president spoke in favor of health care reform being considered by the Senate at the time, as well as looser state regulation.
The use of the Marine One helicopter and Air Force One for political purposes is not a new phenomenon.
Presidents must wear them on their travels,
But using them only for photos is unusual.
Trump's actions attracted attention in February when Air Force One rolled into the background of a presidential campaign event in Melbourne, Florida. Trump has strongly criticized the use of his predecessor's presidential plane on Twitter.
"The White House is very pleased with Made in America, which showcased products made from American materials by American employees from all 50 states," said White House Press Secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 unit crews regularly conduct training flights in the Washington area and practice on a southern turf field to bring the president to the White House with centimeter accuracy.
While Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 made 58 practice landings at the White House.
According to one official, flights to Made in America were part of the crew's monthly training quota.
The unit's helicopters also flew for 11 hours that day on "non-presidential support missions."
According to the White House, the incident did not incur any other costs for taxpayers.
A spokesman for Sikorsky said the company was not involved in organizing a demonstration of the helicopter on the White House South Lawn.
HMX-1 has no records of flights related to presidential duties, and it is difficult to accurately estimate the cost of the event.
According to the Department of Defense's 2017 hourly rates, the compensation level for a VH-3D helicopter is $24,380 per flight hour.
According to HMX-1 documents, flights from the Quantico base in Virginia to the White House and back took a total of one hour.
According to the White House, the operating costs of the helicopter are significantly lower.
"Calculating the cost to taxpayers according to the level of compensation is misleading," Walters says.
"The estimated level of compensation includes staffing, maintenance and many other so-called embedded costs, which are taken into account in the annual allocations."
According to a 2015 study by RAND, compensation levels do not include personnel costs, but take into account fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
At the time of the incident, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of a helicopter at the event.
"The idea is to showcase American production," Spicer said.
"I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud to be involved in ensuring national security, employing probably hundreds or thousands of people.
And I think that, like most Americans, we are proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that many Americans have worked so hard for.
It's perfectly appropriate to bring that up."
It's not clear if Trump was in the helicopter during the incident, but at least he sat in the driver's seat of the fire truck.
At the White House, Trump joked to the press about his own Sikorsky squadron.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the president said. "I have three."
Lightning strikes Vaasa railway line - trains have to be replaced by buses
Passenger train traffic between Seinäjoki and Vaasa has been interrupted due to a technical fault, the Finnish Rail Transport Centre announces.

The Rail Transport Centre did not yet have an estimate of the duration of the repair this morning.
Venezuelan state prosecutor demands court to block the appointment of the country's new representative body
Venezuela's state prosecutor has applied for a court ruling that would prevent the appointment of the country's new representative body.
Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has announced that the representative council elected in last Sunday's vote is due to be appointed on Friday.
In a controversial vote, a representative council was elected for the country, which can, among other things, amend the country's constitution.
According to Chief Prosecutor Luisa Ortega, the blocking decision has been requested due to suspicions of election fraud.
Ortega has also opened an election fraud investigation into the vote.
He appointed two judges after a British company that held the Representative Council vote said the results had been manipulated.
According to the company, the number of voters reported by Venezuelan authorities was about one million higher than the number of actual voters.
Only Maduro's allies were candidates, and the elected 545-member council includes Maduro's son and wife.
In addition to amending the constitution, the Council of Representatives can dissolve the opposition-led Congress and amend laws.
Maduro described as dictator
Maduro's actions have been widely condemned.
The opposition sees the constitutional amendment as a way for Maduro to strengthen his position.
The United States has sanctioned Maduro and called him a dictator.
The European Union, Britain, Mexico, Colombia and Argentina have announced that they will not recognise the new Representative Council.
Maduro argues that the new representative council is the solution to the country's political and economic crisis.
In Venezuela, unrest has been going on for months.
Numerous people have been wounded and more than a hundred have died.
Venezuela plunged into an economic crisis when oil prices fell.
Now many people cannot afford food or medicine.
The opposition is also expected to demonstrate on Friday, when the new Representative Council is due to start.
Russian man extradited by Finland sentenced to 4 years in prison in the United States
A Minneapolis court on Thursday sentenced 41-year-old Maksim Senah to nearly four years in prison for involvement in a global computer scam.
Senah was arrested in Finland in August 2015 following a demand from the United States.
According to the Russian newspaper Fontanka, Senah had been on holiday in Finland.
Finnish border authorities arrested him as he was returning home.
Finland handed Senah over to US judicial authorities in February 2016 despite Russian protests, AFP reported.
In March this year, he was found guilty of computer fraud that had yielded millions of dollars in profit.
Senah received 46 months in prison.
According to the U.S. Department of Justice, Senah will be deported from the country after serving his prison sentence.
The Russian Foreign Ministry harshly rebuked Finland after his arrest and said that the man must not be extradited to the United States.
In the statement, Finland and the United States were criticized for the fact that the arrest was made in Finland without Russia knowing beforehand.
According to the prosecutor, Senah had used a computer virus called Ebury that infected tens of thousands of computers around the world.
The virus was used to phishing for usernames and passwords.
The scammers then used the information to redirect internet traffic, which was used to create clickbait scams and spread spam.
Acting Director of the Criminal Department of the Ministry of Justice According to director Kenneth Blanco, the case shows that the United States is capable of chasing cybercriminals operating in others.
We have the ability and desire to identify, find and bring them to justice," Blanco said in a statement.

Narcos season three trailer: Pablo Escobar is out of the picture, so the Cali cartel takes center stage in Netflix's hit series
While Pablo Escobar's killer was revealed in the second season of Narcos, Netflix's series is definitely not over.
The streaming service has already confirmed that there will be a third and fourth seasons of the series. The trailer for season three has been announced, showcasing the new villains in the series.
In the third season, the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has turned its attention to the Cali Cartel, the world's richest drug trafficking organization.
The organization, run by four godfathers, operates "like a Fortune 500 company," except that there is a little more bribery and violence from the authorities.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) runs the cartel, and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is its brain. Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) handles connections to Mexico, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) operates in New York.
In a recently released trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, who recruits U.S. and Colombian police officers for the war on drugs.
New faces include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos begins on September 1.
Kari Kola creates an exceptional light artwork for Paris
Joensuu-based light artist Kari Kola (kuavssa) will create an exceptional light artwork in Paris next year on 16 May to celebrate the first Day of Light set by the UN.
Kola creates a light artwork called Day and Night in Paris.
The themes of the work are light and darkness - day and night - sun and moon.
The work illuminates the UNESCO headquarters Fontenoy building and the Globe monument in front of it.
With my work, I want to emphasize not only light but also darkness.
Today, light pollution in megacities is a major problem that affects the well-being of us all.
With the help of my art, I can make things that I consider important to be concretely visible, says light artist Kari Kola about his work.
I am very honoured by the invitation to participate in the first International Day of Light and to make light art part of the theme day, Kola continues.
Kari Kola participated in the opening ceremony of the Year of Light in 2015, when he illuminated UNESCO's headquarters in honour of the anniversary.
I feel very privileged to be able to recreate my art at UNESCO Headquarters, says Kari Kola.
The work may yet expand very significantly.
We will announce this later this autumn, Kola continues.
The aim of the International Day of Light is to highlight the importance of light for humanity and to increase people's awareness of the fields of science, art, culture and sustainable development.
The first Day of Light will be celebrated at UNESCO's headquarters in central Paris on 16 May.
Two men fight in a shopping centre parking garage in Espoo
Two men got into an argument in the parking garage of the Iso Omena shopping centre in Espoo on Wednesday morning.
According to the parties, the dispute arose when one of the parties accidentally drove in a prohibited direction.
A verbal argument arose between the drivers.
A driver driving in a prohibited direction flailed at the driver of another car, causing his car to take off, colliding with the hitman's car.
He then slammed the hood of the car that still crashed.
In the preliminary interview, the man admitted to causing the damage and doing wrong.
Timo Soini's post titled with a question mark: "After that came the deluge"
On Thursday, Minister for Foreign Affairs Timo Soini published a blog post titled with a question mark.
The writing is short, only two sentences long.
In my time, the party grew from zero to a governing party of thirty-seven MPs.
After that came the deluge, now everything is floating, Soini writes.
Soini's text contains references to France in the 1700s.
King Louis XV or his mistress Madame de Pompadour is known to have used the metaphor of the Flood.
Depending on the interpretation, the phrases "after us the flood" or "after me the flood" have remained in the history books.
According to the UN, democracy in Afghanistan depends on the political role of women
Elections will only be representative if all members of society, including women, can vote, the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, interim head of the UN aid mission, said there were hundreds of women running for provincial council elections, three women running for vice president and more than 30% of newly registered voters were women.
"The role of women cannot be overemphasized," Haysom said in a statement Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women are fully involved and involved in all aspects of the electoral process.
The Provincial Council and Presidential elections of Afghanistan will be held on 5.4.2017.
The Taliban have been making electoral threats at a time when international forces are moving into a consultative role.
This year's elections are the first time that power has been transferred peacefully from one democratically elected government to another.
Haysom said women's contribution strengthens democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Afghan Independent Electoral Commission, 1.2 million of the 3.6 million registered voters are women.

The influx of certain types of tourists poses a threat to the culture of the region
The authorities are considering limiting the number of tourists in Venice.
The locals' rage is particularly directed at the form of tourism represented by cruise ships.
Italy's Minister of Culture calls it "eat and flee" tourism: you only spend a few hours at the destination and rush through the sights in large numbers.
Venice is suffocated by tourists making quick day trips to the city.
The narrow streets are difficult to navigate, and the fine squares are so crowded with visitors that the inhabitants of Venice can no longer fit in.
They have been forced to move further and further away from the historic centre, while their homes have been replaced by hotels.
The problems caused by tourism in Venice are reported by The New York Times and The Guardian.
The authorities are considering restrictions on the number of tourists.
They call the current phenomenon low-quality tourism.
When arriving on a large cruise ship, time is given two to three hours.
You follow the flag-bearing guide from Piazzale Roma to the Rialto Bridge and St. Mark's Square and turn back," says Dario Franceschini, Italy's Minister of Culture, describing the current and problematic tourism.
The beauty of Italian cities lies not only in architecture, but also in the activities of the place, shops and workshops.
We must preserve this part of urban identity.
St. Mark's Square is also one of the most popular places to visit in Venice's historic centre.
On the edge of the square is St. Mark's Church.
The anger of the locals is also mainly directed at cruise ships.
Only 50,000 locals live in Venice's historic centre.
In 1951, the population was about 175,000.
In July, an estimated 2,000 Venetians demonstrated against mass tourism.
According to them, tourism has reduced their quality of life, destroys the environment and drives residents away.
About 2,000 residents leave every year.
If this continues, then in a few years there will be nothing but tourists in Venice.
It would be a social, anthropological and historical catastrophe," says Carlo Belframe, one of the organisers of the demonstration.
The equation is difficult, as ships bring much-needed income to Venice and create a need for numerous jobs in various sectors.
In addition to limiting the number of tourists, the proposed solution is for cruise ships to travel further away from the historical centre.
Luciano Bortot, who lives in Venice, believes that the situation would certainly change if the administrative region of Veneto, where Venice is located, were given more power to decide its own affairs - if not full autonomy.
About 20-30 million tourists visit Venice every year.
Are you driving towards Kuopio?
Serious traffic jams on the motorway for miles
On the motorway between Kuopio and Siilinjärvi, there have been kilometres of congestion on the northbound lane from work on Thursday afternoon during the return traffic.
Motorway resurfacing work is being carried out in the area, which slows down traffic, Savon Sanomat reports.
For road works, there is a speed limit of 50 km/h instead of the usual speed of 120 km/h.
Even in the 50-kilometre restricted area, however, traffic had proceeded at a practically walking pace in some places on Thursday afternoon.
Road works progressed on Thursday afternoon on the Siilinjärvi side at the Annunciation statue, or golden deer.
I can do well without that kind of attention
The 23-year-old runner has had to notice the curses of publicity.
Amalie Iuel has posted stunning photos of herself in the Grand Canyon, among other places.
Danish-Norwegian Amalie Iuel has become a popular athlete in her current home country of Norway, not least because she broke the 26-year-old Norwegian record in the 400m in March by lapping the course in a time of 51.81.
A month later, he improved the Norwegian record in the 400 metres hurdles to 55.38.
A frequent user of social media, Iuel discovered soon after his records that fame and publicity have their downsides.
Men from all over the world began sending Iuel pictures of his genitals, apparently in the hope that the young runner would become interested in them.
Iuel was forced to close his Snapchat account to outsiders.
I got a lot of "smut photos" from people I didn't know, so I had to change my account to private," Iuel told VG magazine.
In an interview with VG, Iuel did not want to specify exactly what kind of pictures he received.
You can probably guess," Iuel chuckled.
It's nice to get feedback after a run, but I can do well without that kind of attention.
Iuel was born in Denmark in 1994.
His mother is Danish, his father Danish-Norwegian.
Iuel's family moved to Norway when Amalie was 2 years old.
When Amalie was 12 years old, the family moved first to Namibia, then to Pakistan because of her father's work.
It was followed by Dubai, Thailand and the United States.
Iuel spent four years as a college athlete at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, before returning to Norway.
In June 2015, he changed his Danish citizenship to Norwegian citizenship.
In Norway, Iuel trains with three coaches: Leif Olav Alnes, Karsten Warholm and Elisabeth Slettum.
Norway is much more open to discussion than the United States.
In the United States, coaches don't ask anything, they only give orders.
In Norway, the coach has much more time to interact personally with the athlete," Iuel told VG.
Amalie Iuel holds Norwegian records in the 400m and 400m hurdles.
A leg injury put snowboarder Janne Korpi's entire career on the line - now participating in the World Championships: "It's nice not to hurt anything"
Now it's been nice to count when nothing has happened!
Janne Korpi, 31, one of Finland's most successful snowboarders, has been able to really enjoy his beloved sport again this season.
As recently as last summer, the continuation of his career was at stake.
A metatarsal strain injury had forced Korpi onto the operating table in January, and the leg did not want to heal in any way.
The hand had also taken a hit on the race slope.
In the summer, I had no idea what I was going to do, whether snowboarding would continue or not.
Sponsorship deals were interrupted and many things were open, Korpi says.
But that's how they say things tend to work out.
The leg healed, the sponsor extended the contract for two years, and blood again began to draw on the slope.
After that, the decision to proceed was easy.
I knew it at the latest when I first went on the snow.
I was like, damn, yes this again is so much fun, let's drag on for a couple more seasons.
Korpi was only able to ski properly in September-October, but after a long break from skiing, just training painlessly has been a big deal.
Korpi has only toured a few competitions.
That's okay.
Competitions have never been the most important aspect of snowboarding for Korve.
I've never counted for one race.
I think it's frustrating to aim for four years in one race, and then you're in a fever for that week.
I don't have the energy to think like that, Korpi says.
Today, Korpi competes in the halfpipe of the World Championships in Sierra Nevada, Spain.
Even though individual races don't keep him from snowboarding, he always gets fired up by competing in tough company.
According to Korpi, the appreciation of the competitions organised by the International Ski Federation has increased in recent years, even though some snowboarders chose the Norwegian X-Games, which are held at the same time.
Yes these are important races, visibility is big.
However, in my opinion, appreciation always depends on what kind of conditions and level the competition has.
Korpi is the oldest athlete in Finland's 12-member team in Sierra Nevada.
The team's youngsters, 17-year-olds Rene Rinnekangas and Emmi Parkkisenniemi, are 14 years younger than Korpe.
It's nice to watch the younger guys go.
I remember when I was at that point where everything was new and I was so sickly excited about everything.
It also brings new energy to me, Korpi thinks.
On the slopes I still somehow keep up, but otherwise I don't, that's how much energy the guys have!
In the background of his snowboarding career, Janne Korpi has also built a different kind of sports career.
The son of legendary rider Pekka Korpi is addicted to harness racing: the snowboarder has his own trotting horses, for which he makes training programs.
When I'm on the road all the time, I don't have time to be in the mess room any more.
But every day I look at at least the trotting results and usually some starts," Korpi says.
According to Korpi, trotting and trotting coaching are a potential career plan when the snowboarding career comes to an end.
I can't be bothered to plan that far, but it's at least a likely option.
I experience it as a bit like studying it here along with snowboarding.
I try to keep up with the times and develop, maybe even some starts in the summer.
If it's my future profession, it's not hard to start when you're already in the sport.
Trotting events also include the Elitloppet trotting cruise with presenter Jaajo Linnonmaa.
The duo has chartered a cruise ship that will head to Stockholm at the end of May for the Elitloppet trotting competition.
Korpi and Linnonmaa decided to revive the old tradition.
The cruise has sold well and people have been excited.
We are now at the point where at least there will be no bankruptcy.
There are still a few months to go, let's hope that we can fill the ship, Korpi says excitedly.
Attendo's nursing home project for Kitee has surprised everyone
Attendo Esteri is the name of a new, 41-bed nursing home for the elderly to be built in Kitee.
The building of just over 1,700 square metres of floor area is expected to be completed next summer on the other side of Terveystie, next door to the health centre.
At Kitee, a common cause for wonder is where the new care unit will have enough customers, as many private nursing homes are currently suffering from a shortage of clients during Siun sote.
Anne Flink, Regional Director of Care Services at Attendo, comments that Kitee will have more demand not only for alternatives but also for enhanced assisted living in the future.
All kinds of services are needed, and when there are alternatives, freedom of choice works better," Flink says.
Last year, Attendo acquired the private nursing homes Kanervikkola and Eerikka from Kitee.
The deal was about business, but there is reportedly a five-year lease on the properties.
Flink says there is no acute need for Attendo to move operations out of these spaces.
More on that later.
GMB is concerned about the continued operation of the McVitie's brand plant in Scotland
The union is seeking confirmation from McVitie's biscuit maker executives of a long-term commitment to production at the Glasgow plant.
According to the Scottish branch of the GMB, the UK's general trade union, the company has not disclosed any plans for the future of the Tollcross plant.
The factory, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits and other products, has more than 500 employees.
Pladis, the company that owns the McVitie's brand, said it had invested more than five million pounds in the plant in recent years.
The company added that workers and union representatives "will certainly be the first to be informed" if there are any changes to the operation.
In a letter to the plant manager, GMB urges the company to "address concerns about the lack of funding for modernization of production lines."
Drew Duffy of the GMB union finds it very worrying that the plant manager does not provide clear information about Tollcross's business needs and future investment plans.
"Families have worked here for generations, with a strong concentration in the local community and the Glasgow metropolitan area. The factory is a significant employer in an area with high unemployment and low income.
In terms of jobs, wages and livelihoods, as well as Brexit, the rising cost of living and continued downsizing of production, East Glasgow desperately needs a thriving McVitie's production."
According to a Pladis spokesperson, the plant manager had only received the union letter the day before and the company responds directly to the letter because it values constant interaction with workers and union representatives.
"We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross two months ago where we openly discussed a number of issues.
Among other things, we discussed with employees that, like other companies operating in highly competitive and uncertain markets, we continuously evaluate all our businesses and locations to remain competitive."
According to a spokesperson, the company has invested more than £5 million in the Tollcross plant in recent years, particularly in its production lines and operational improvements.
"We are aware of Tollcross's long history as a manufacturing facility and will certainly be the first to inform workers and trade unionists if we are going to make changes to how the plant operates."
Did PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar's transfer three years ago?
LaLiga may regret its interest in Marco Verrattin
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up pursuing Neymar after paying a transfer fee of £189m to terminate his contract. But did PSG warn Barcelona about a record-breaking transfer three years ago?
The sensational move is the most talked about case of the summer. The French Ligue 1 football league team is ready to break the world record for transfer sums. The previous record was less than half as low: it came about when Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United for a transfer fee of £89 million.
After the transfer, Neymar will become the most expensive footballer in the world and also the highest-paid professional athlete in the world, with PSG offering him a weekly salary of more than £500,000 after tax.
Barcelona are known to be furious with PSG's actions and the way Neymar has forcibly left the club. A source close to Barcelona says the club have taken very good care of Neymar since he arrived at Santos in 2013.
Did the PSG chairman warn the football world about this move three years ago?
When Manchester City announced their interest in Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned clubs aiming for PSG's best players.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they want our players, we will be their opponent and we will contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they go after our players, they will face the consequences."
Barcelona appear to have been guilty of just that: they expressed interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verrattti earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the Italian to leave under any circumstances. It could well be that Barcelona will lose their star player Neymar as a result.
Neste slowed down the rise of the stock exchange - Pörssiuutiset - Ilta-Sanomat
Metsä Board, the day's other major earnings announcer, declined more slightly.
The broad European general index Stoxx 600 had risen 0.1 per cent at the close of Helsinki.

NOW: Trump's hyped phone calls were fabricated - White House spokesman: 'I wouldn't say it was a lie'
The White House admits that the two calls mentioned by US President Donald Trump never happened, according to the New York Times.
Trump's praised phone calls with both Mexico's president and the leader of the Boy Scout organization have turned out to be fabricated.
White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed that there had been no phone calls.
However, he said Trump wasn't lying.
According to Sanders, many of the scouts' leaders spoke to Trump in person, and Trump had spoken with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto at the G20 summit in Hamburg.
I wouldn't say it was a lie, it's a pretty tough accusation.
Those conversations happened, they didn't just happen on the phone, they happened face-to-face," Sanders reasoned.
The speech to the scouts aroused outrage
Trump said Monday that the Mexican president called him and praised Trump's success in stamping out illegal immigration.
According to Trump, Pena Nieto said that few people come across Mexico's southern border anymore because they know the trip will stop at the U.S. border anyway.
On Wednesday, the Mexican government released a statement saying that the call in question had not taken place.
On Tuesday, Politico released a full version of Trump's interview with The Wall Street Journal.
In it, Trump touted his speech at a major rally of the National Scout Association in West Virginia.
I got a call from the leader of the Boy Scouts, he said it was the finest speech ever given to them.
They were very grateful," Trump said.
On Wednesday, the Boy Scout organization said it was not aware of any of its leaders' phone calls to Trump.
According to the release, an earlier statement by the organization's director, Michael Surbaugh, who had apologized to the scouts for Trump's speech, speaks for itself.
Trump's speech at the Boy Scout meeting caused a lot of astonishment, as it was exceptionally political considering the nature of the event.
Among other things, he praised the results of last autumn's presidential election.
