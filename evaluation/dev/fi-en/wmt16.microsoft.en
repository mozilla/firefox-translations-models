9-year-old boy found on the run in Tampere
The police have been on a search mission due to the escape of a 9-year-old boy in Tampere on Tuesday evening.
A missing news report concerning a boy who left West Tampere with a friend has gone viral on social media.
According to the police situation centre, the boy has been contacted and is not in danger of life or health.
The boy's father told Ilta-Sanomat around midnight that the boy had been found.
He's fine and now we're starting the aftermath.
The boy was found near his home, the father said.
Ronaldo back in a frenzy - tearing goal difference to Messi
Cristiano Ronaldo scored five goals in the Spanish league at the weekend and continued to produce in the Champions League as well.
The battle between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo for the Champions League goal king, at least for a while, turned in the latter's favour.
Real Madrid's Ronaldo single-handedly moved to the top of the all-time goalscoring charts when he fired two shots from penalties and one into the net of visitors Shakhtar Donetsk.
Ronaldo increased his goal tally to 80, while Barcelona's Messi, who was tied with him before Tuesday, has 77 hits.
Real won the match 4-0.
Juventus have stumbled in the Italian football league Serie A since the start of the season, but in Group D of the Champions League they started strongly with a 2-1 away win over Manchester City.
The winning goal was scored just over ten minutes before the end by Juventus' Alvaro Morata.
City's attack was dulled by the absence of Sergei Aguero, who has a knee problem.
Aguero, injured in the weekend's Premier League game, did not enter the pitch until the final ten minutes.
Manchester's other club, United, were also hit hard in Holland against PSV Endhoven after suffering a 1-2 defeat.
ManU's 20-year-old full-back Luke Shaw's away match lasted just a quarter of an hour.
PSV's Hector Moreno's dangerous-looking sliding tackle hit the Man U kit on goal so badly that Shaw likely suffered a broken tibia.
Shaw lay on the grass of Eindhoven's home stadium for about ten minutes before medical personnel left to transport him to hospital for treatment.
Memphis Depay gave the visitors a 1-0 lead in the 41st minute, but ManU's joy lasted only a few minutes.
Moreno equalised before the break in extra time.
PSV's winning goal was scored in the second half by Luciano Narsingh.
The scoring season in the Champions League was started by Paris Saint-Germain in Group A.
It was Argentinian Angel Di Maria, who changed his Manchester United shirt to a PSG suit.
Di Maria broke through from the right and lifted the ball into the back corner past Malmö goalkeeper Johan Wiland.
Edinson Cavani scored in the second half for PSG 2-0.
PSG have been predicted to be among the season's top performers.
The assumption is not wrong, but Malmö, one of the league's smaller clubs, is not the best possible comparison.
PSG's star striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic faced his starting professional club Malmö FF for the first time.
Ibrahimovic started his career in Malmö in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played 90 minutes as his team CSKA Moscow lost 0-1 to Wolfsburg in their Group B match in Germany.
The opposition party immediately demanded his resignation - the president made the wrong speech
The President of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, made the same speech he had made a month ago.
Zimbabwe's President, Robert Mugabe, has made another speech in the Zimbabwean Parliament that he made at the end of last month.
During his 25-minute speech, Mugabe apparently did not realise that the speech was the same.
The speech raised doubts as to whether the 91-year-old Mugabe is in full spirit.
The main opposition party, the MDC, called for Mugabe to resign because he is too old to govern.
Mugabe's aides hastened to say that the confusion had occurred only within Mugabe's staff and that the president had done nothing wrong.
Mugabe's speech was earlier and now about China's influence on the country's economy.
Germany and Austria want extraordinary summit on refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have called for an extraordinary summit of EU leaders next week over the refugee crisis.
Donald Tusk, President of the European Council, who chairs the summits, assessed the request.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said heads of state should discuss cooperation with countries of origin and how to register those coming to Europe more effectively.
According to Merkel, negotiations on quotas for asylum seekers belong at the table of interior ministers.
Teacher admits shooting girlfriend during emergency call
Voice only slightly shaking University teacher Shannon Lamb tells police during an emergency call that he shot his girlfriend and that officers need to come to their house.
Lamb emphasized that his "golden dog" is alive and probably upset, and said that the contact information of the deceased woman's next of kin can be found on her phone.
Inside the house, officers found Amy Prentiss's body and a handwritten note on the side of the notebook: "I'm so sorry, I wish I could cancel this, I loved Amy and she's the only woman who has ever loved me," said the letter, which experts say was signed by Lamb.
There was nothing to suggest that Lamb, who taught two online courses at Delta State University in Cleveland in Minnesota, had already traveled nearly 500 miles to the school's campus, where police believe he shot and killed a well-liked history teacher, Ethan Schmidt, at the door of his office.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said university officials heard about the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He said Lamb made the fatal emergency call some time after.
By the end of the day, the death toll rose by one more: Lamb committed suicide while the police were besieging Änttä.
Authorities were still trying to determine Lambi's motive a day after students and staff were forced to hide behind locked doors in a school shooting.
Investigators on both sides of the state have released information that students and staff described Lamb as a talented teacher who, however, may have had problems.
Students said they were waiting for his classes.
Police in Prentiss's place of death, Gautier, say Lamb had no violent past or criminal record.
Schmidt himself had included Lamb in a book he had written in which he thanked the "great people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History, which has a total of 17 staff members, and many of the students attended both men's courses.
On the other hand, there were some signs of problems.
A student named Brandon Beavers praised Lamb, but said he also seemed nervous and restless, "as if something was wrong."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamb told him he was under a lot of stress at the end of the 2014-15 school year.
Lamb had previously requested sick leave from Delta State University, saying he had some sort of health problem.
This year, he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the university's salary policy meant that although Lamb had worked hard for his doctorate, it did not guarantee him automatic career advancement and an assistant professorship.
University president William LaForge said there was no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt to his knowledge, but that "clearly there was something on Lamb's mind."
These are the questions Lamb can no longer answer.
After Lamb fled campus, police were able to track him down as he moved back to Mississippi from the state of Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb shot himself with a .38-caliber pistol in the backyard of a house about a mile and a half south of his parents' house in the Greenville suburb of Mississippi, said Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson.
Lamb's car was still running in the driveway.
It wasn't immediately clear why Lamb went to this particular house, although Johnson said he believed Lamb knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb started working at the university in 2009, teaching geography and education. The university has 3500 students and is located in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants.
Lamb completed her doctoral degree in education in the spring.
One of Lamb's old friends described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
Hairston and his friends were in high school, and Lamb was a funny, older guy who tried for many years to teach Hairston to play guitar.
He was quite a charmer in those days.
All the girls were molten wax when she was there, said Hairston, now 40, who lives in the Jackson suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss had apparently been dating for a while.
In an emergency call, Lamb said he killed his wife, but there is no evidence of their marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in a riverside brick house in Gautier.
Police said the dog was fine.
Prentiss's ex-husband, Shawn O'Steen, said they divorced 15 years ago but remained friends. They now have a 19-year-old daughter.
"She's really upset," O'Steen said of her daughter.
She was her mother's best friend.
O'Steen said he hadn't met Lamb, but had heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when Lamb and Abigail were both performing at a summer market three years ago.
Later, they played a few gigs together.
O'Steen shared that her daughter makes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for several different online businesses.
Mike Shaffer, bartender and occasional entertainment organizer at The Julep Room, a shady bar near Gautier, says he last saw Lamb and Prentiss on the night of September 5, after Lamb had finished his guitar and harmonica shows to a sparse audience.
Nothing seemed wrong.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We fooled around and threw quips at each other.
So they were both pretty clever.
Schmidt, a deceased teacher, led a seminary program for first-year students and specialized in Native Americans and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English teacher at the school.
Schmidt was married and had three young children.
He attended Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his fraternity and student government.
On Tuesday night, a candlelight devotional was held on the Delta State campus in Cleveland, attended by about 900 people, including teaching and non-teaching staff, students and community members.
Schmidt's wife, Liz, and brother, Jeff Schmidt, also attended Mass, during which the university choir sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
Teaching continues on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students to come back," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
Now is the time for recovery.
Amy and Rogelio Solis report from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press writer Emily Wagster Pettus of Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana of New Orleans contributed to the report.
The story has been corrected to reflect that police now say Lamb made an emergency call after Schmidt's shooting, and that although Lamb referred to Prentiss as his wife during the call, there is no evidence that they were married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for holiday season
Toys R Us says it won't hire as many employees for the holiday season as it did last year, but the toy and baby products retailer says current regulars and seasonal workers will be given the opportunity to work more hours.
The company says it plans to hire 40,000 people to work in stores and distribution centers across the country, up from 45,000 during the 2014 holiday season.
Most of the jobs are part-time.
The company said interviews with applicants will begin this month, with staff numbers increasing from October to December.
Although the holiday season is months away, the holiday shopping season is approaching, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to help staff stores and sell, ship and deliver products.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his "date" with Princess Diana
The premiere of Back to the Future was a hugely important moment for Michael J. Fox professionally.
It was also noteworthy for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theater waiting for the royals to arrive, and I realized that the seat next to me was empty, and then I realized that Princess Diana's place was next to me," he said in the trailer for the upcoming documentary film Back in Time.
The movie begins and it occurs to me that I'm just a fake yawn and a stretch of my arm away from a date with the Princess of Wales.
Back in Time is a documentary about Back to the Future that featured interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and production director Steven Spielberg.
Back to the Future premiered 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, "For me, it's arguably the greatest time travel movie ever."
Back in Time will be available on demand, DVD and in some cinemas in October.
UN chief says there will be no military solution to the situation in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's response to Russia's increased military support for Syria is that this nearly five-year conflict will "not be resolved by arms," and additional weapons will only exacerbate the violence and suffering of millions of people.
The UN chief reiterated his call on all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support non-discriminatory negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban told a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet with the foreign ministers of five permanent member states — the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France — on the sidelines of the General Assembly's ministerial week later this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted that the divisions between the Council, the Syrian people and regional powers "have made the situation impossible to resolve."
Ban called on the five permanent member states to show the solidarity and unity they showed in agreeing on Iran's nuclear programme in dealing with the Syrian crisis.
8 poll results that show Donald Trump is serious
Some have tried to label him a weather vane.
Others consider him just a joke.
Some are waiting for collapse.
While some Republicans have tried to yank Donald Trump out of the top spot in support polls, it hasn't (yet) been successful.
In ten of the most recent 11 national polls, Donald Trump has been leading by double digits, and some are beginning to seriously consider what this means for the real estate king's nomination chances.
Of course, the parliamentary term is still in its early stages.
These results do not yet mean that Trump is likely to become the Republican nominee.
Commentators point out that at this point in 2011, Rick Perry was losing the lead to the rising Herman Cain, neither of whom got behind any states in the nomination process.
There are also many reasons why he would have problems in general elections.
However, outside groups such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the conservative financial organization Club for Growth have noted Trump's persistence and have begun using their funds to topple him.
The following recent support poll results suggest that the real estate king is not just a passing phase:
Trump's popularity ratings have done an about-face.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, Monmouth University polls showed that only two out of ten Republicans were positive about the real estate king.
By mid-July, the figure was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, the figure was 52 percent.
Currently, six out of ten Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they have a negative attitude.
These numbers are also true in the first primary states.
In a poll conducted by Quinnipiac University in Iowa last week, 60 percent of Republicans said they were sympathetic to Trump.
Two-thirds of Republican voters would be happy if Trump became the nominee.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either "excited" or "satisfied" if Trump were the nominee.
Only two in ten said they would be "shocked" if he became a candidate.
Only Ben Carson generates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent "enthusiastic" vs. Trump's 40 percent).
The next most exciting?
Marco Rubio with only 21%.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters would be "dissatisfied" or "shocked" if Jeb Bush, the establishment's favorite, were to become the nominee.
Trump's fiery nature is not a problem for most Republicans.
While Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his pompous rhetoric and insults, according to Monday's ABC News/Washington Post poll, 52 percent of Republican-leaning voters at the national level think the real estate king has a character befitting a president.
According to a Quinnipiac poll last week, in the state of Iowa, which is holding its first party convention, the figure is the same: 52 percent of Republicans think Trump has the right temperament for a leader.
However, according to an ABC/Post poll, 44 percent think his character is not suitable for being president, and nearly six in ten think his character does not belong in the White House.
Republican voters are getting used to the idea.
When Republican voters think like commentators, they think Trump is the real option.
According to a CNN/ORC poll, four out of ten said Trump was the most likely choice when asked who is most likely to be nominated as the Republican nominee.
As recently as the end of July, four out of ten supported Jeb Bush.
Disclosure: Republican Party voters haven't always had access to the brightest crystal ball possible.
At this time in the last legislature, four out of ten Republicans thought Rick Perry would be nominated, with only 28 percent supporting the final nominee, Mitt Romney.
In any case, this shows that the majority of Republican Party voters find Trump's campaign credible.
Even if Republicans aligned themselves with the other candidate, Trump would still win nearly every one.
Some commentators have pointed out that the fragmented field has likely contributed to Trump's leadership, as anti-Trump support is split among numerous other candidates.
However, a poll conducted by Monmouth University in early September showed that in a hypothetical bilateral race between Trump and nearly all other Republican candidates, Trump gets majority support in almost all cases.
She leads Carly Fiorina with 13 points, Marco Rubio with 14 points, Walker with 15 points, Jeb Bush with 19 points, and Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie with 33 points each.
He is tied on points with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to beat Trump?
If they were pitted against each other, Ben Carson would beat businessman Trump by a large margin of 18 points.
Barely a majority of Donald Trump's supporters have said they have made the decision.
A new CBS/NYT poll from Tuesday shows that just over half of pro-Trump voters have decided who their vote goes to.
Of course, the situation can change, and no one can say with absolute certainty that they will never change their mind.
46 percent said they could potentially change candidates.
In any case, Trump's biggest rival right now is another unlikely winner, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who said they made a decision are twice as likely to side with Trump.
Six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Ever since Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants "rapists" two months ago in his campaign launch speech, immigration has been at the center of the 2016 debate.
Some worry that Trump's bombast will drive Latino voters away from the Republican Party and hurt rebranding efforts.
According to a new ABC/Post poll released Monday, six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So it seems that as long as immigration is at the center of things, so will Donald Trump.
Frustration with the government has reached a new height.
Support for Donald Trump and Ben Carson now accounts for about half of Republican voters, largely due to their position outside politics.
Six out of ten Republicans said in Monday's ABC/Post poll that they would rather choose someone outside politics than one with government experience.
They are also angry with the federal government.
A Des Moines Register/Bloomberg poll from Iowa two weeks ago showed that three out of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated with Republicans in Congress: 54 percent are "dissatisfied" and 21 percent are "really angry."
Jeremy Corbyn's first appearance at Prime Minister's Question Time
Corbyn's first appearance at Question Time has been eagerly awaited since his election
The new leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, faces David Cameron for the first time during Prime Minister's Question Time.
Corbyn rises to ask the first of his six questions shortly after noon, and it is likely that both the media and Labour MPs will be watching his performance closely.
Corbyn has called for "less theatre and more facts" for this weekly show.
He has also said that he could leave some of the events to his colleagues.
This encounter will be the first parliamentary test for Corbyn's leadership since he was appointed to the shadow cabinet and spoke at the annual meeting of the Confederation of Trade Unions on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader's decision to stand silent during the national anthem at Tuesday's memorial service, which took place on the 75th anniversary of the Battle for Britain air war, has sparked criticism from Conservative MPs and appeared in several front-page stories.
Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention
A spokesman for Corbyn said he "stood respectfully silent" and that he acknowledged "the bravery of the Royal Air Force in the British air war."
Owen Smith, a member of Corbyn's shadow government, told BBC Two's Newsnight that he would have urged the Labour leader to sing the national anthem despite his belief that the Royal House should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers have refused to be part of Corbyn's inner circle, citing differences over economic, defence and foreign affairs. Initially, less than a sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as leader.
BBC politics correspondent Robin Brant says policy differences over the party's status in the European Union and the government's subsidy cap have also "piled up" within the Labour Party since Corbyn's appointment.
Corbyn said at a meeting of the Confederation of Trade Unions that Labour would propose an amendment that would remove the entire roof.
Hours later, Mr Smith, the shadow government's secretary for work and pensions, said the party was "quite clear" that they were only opposed to the government's plans to lower the ceiling from £26,000 to £23,0000.
Corbyn becomes the fifth Labour leader David Cameron has faced in the last decade he has been leader of the Conservative Party.
The Labour leader has promised a new approach to politics and now says he has "crowdsourced" ideas into questions for the Prime Minister and received more than 30,000 proposals.
Islington North MP Corbyn has said the nature of the Prime Minister's Question Time is too confrontational and that he will refrain from both witty rhetoric and banter, promising instead to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges faced by young people.
Corbyn has said Angela Eagle, the shadow government's finance secretary, will deputise for him during Question Time when Corbyn is not attending - for example, when Cameron is abroad.
Mr Corbyn has also suggested that other colleagues could sometimes be allowed to speak, and he has said that he has approached the Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, about the matter.
When Cameron took over in 2005, he said he wanted to move away from the kind of political theatre often associated with Prime Minister's Question Time, but he later had to admit that he had failed.
Since they began to be televised in 1990, Question Time with the Prime Minister has been an important measure of the leader's judgment, his control of the House of Commons, and his position among other MPs, although critics have criticised Question Time as nothing more than a caricature requiring far-reaching reforms.
Filmed in Joburg: Homeless youth trained as photographers
Downtown Johannesburg is a tricky place to be homeless.
However, a group of former street children has found a way to learn skills and make a living.
'I was shot in Joburg' is a nonprofit studio where homeless youth are taught how to take photos of their neighborhood and make a profit from it.
BBC News met one of the first young people to graduate from the project.

Pound sterling rises as UK wage growth accelerates
The value of the pound jumped upwards after the numbers showed an upward trend in UK wage growth, while the FTSE 100 index rose along with bidding target SABMiller.
Between May and July, UK wages, excluding bonuses, rose by 2.9 per cent compared to the same period last year.
The growth rate was the fastest since 2009 and was considered to bring with it estimates of price increases.
The pound rose more than one percent against the dollar to $1.5505, and 0.84 percent against the euro to 1.3730 euros.
The FTSE 100 index closed up 1.49% at 6229.21.
SABMiller was the most distinctive stock on the market, gaining 20 percent after being approached by rival AB InBev with an offer.
The agreement would bring together two of the world's largest breweries and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry's stock rose 0.9 percent after encouraging news emerged from rival luxury goods group Richmont.
Richemont's latest sales figures were not only better than expected, but also showed that sales in China - a key market for Burberry - had started to grow again.
Glencore's shares rose 5% after the mining giant said it had raised $2.5 billion by issuing shares as part of its debt-cutting strategy.
Shares of packaging and paper group Mondi were the biggest decliners in the index at 4.3% after Goldman Sachs changed its recommendation for the company to "sell."
JD Sports rose 3.1 per cent after the sportswear company announced its half-year pre-tax revenue: an 83 per cent increase to £46.6 million.
According to the head of JD Sports, higher salaries could hurt expansion
Peter Cowgill, chief executive of JD Sports, says if the minimum wage for workers is raised in the UK, it could mean "more purchasing power for potential consumers".
However, this purchasing power is unlikely to outweigh the higher labor costs incurred by the company, Cowgill notes.
The costs could fall on the company's expansion plans, he added, which would mean fewer additional jobs.
Metcash launches grassroots campaign against Aldi's intrusion
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA trades from Aldi's invasion in South and Western Australia.
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a grassroots campaign to defend IGA traders' market share in South and Western Australia ahead of Aldi's $700 million attack.
Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centres and a first store early next year in South and Western Australia, with up to 120 stores to come. Meanwhile, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening their relationships with local food retailers and building the IGA brand through mainstream and social media marketing, as well as events like the Adelaide show.
IGA retailers and suppliers have jumped in, with brands like Dunsborough-based ice cream maker Simmo's offering tastings in IGA stores, and shop owners selling discounted tickets to Australian football matches to their regular customers.
Metcash is expected to reveal more details about its defensive strategy on September 29 when this food, alcohol and hardware wholesaler hosts its annual investor strategy day.
There's a lot at stake, as South and Western Australia together account for nearly 30% of Metcash's IGA trading area, with higher profit margins than Metcash's IGA network in the eastern states.
Shopping visitors in South and Western Australia are notoriously parochial, and IGA retailers have a much larger market share than New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland: more than 30 per cent in the South and 24 per cent in the West, compared to 14 per cent in the East.
However, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe Aldi will grab about 5 percent of the food market in the two states within 12 months of opening its first stores. Turnover comes from all operators, but mainly from independent retailers.
In a report this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimated that IGA dealers could lose $360 million annually in sales and Metcash could lose $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in the south and 30 stores in the west next year, generating revenues of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in these areas, respectively.
The loss of food and food sales and quantities at Metcash's high fixed cost base could cost Metcash about $13 million in pre-interest and tax losses in operating profits, Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly to Aldi and Coles, although a recent study by Roy Morgan found that IGA's customers were the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley expects Metcash's food and food sales to decline 3.8 percent in 2016; 4,1 % in 2017 and 2,1 % in 2018, reducing its market share from 14 % in 2015 to 10,3 % in 2020.
Last week, Hamish Douglass, manager of a leading investment fund and founder of Magellan Financial Group, said at a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash could "very possibly disappear in a decade".
Metcash has declined to respond publicly to Douglass' comments.
However, it is understood that Douglass was contacted by a member of Metcash's board of directors last week.
IGA's market share has decreased from 18% in 2010 to 14%, and revenues from Metcash's food and beverage business, which supplies approximately 1200 IGA retailers, have fallen by 43% since 2012. This indicates a reduction in debt financing for operations as sales and margins are under pressure.
However, the wholesaler stands its ground and has invested more than $150 million annually in lowering prices for hundreds of products weekly to the same level as Coles and Woolworths, helping IGA retailers renovate stores by adding faster growing fresh food, and bringing to market a better selection of private-label products.
Metcash CEO Ian Morrice says lowering prices and improving stores have increased traction, and he hopes the wholesaler will return to the path of revenue growth in 2017, the first time in four years.
Australian Tennis Federation president Steve Healy backs Thanasi Kokkinakis
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves credit rather than criticism for his behavior
Thanasi Kokkinakis has suffered as a bystander in a recent storm that has raged around her friend Nick Kyrgios. He deserves credit rather than criticism for his own behaviour," said Australian Tennis Association president Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, a younger member of the talented duo known as "Special Ks", unwittingly went public for an incident in which Kyrgios annoyed Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
Shortly thereafter, in a fiery qualifying match in Cincinnati, the head referee had to fire Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison twice when Harrison declared, "Wawrinka should have beaten Kyrgios, and I should beat that brat."
While Kokkinakis was last seen breaking his racket after a cramp ruined his eventual win over Richard Gasquet at the US Open, Healy has been a staunch defender for Kokkinakis.
Right now, the youngster is in Glasgow competing with Sam Groth for second place in singles matches with Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against Great Britain.
"I feel pretty strongly that Thanasi has just been dragged into the brawl," Healy said.
He broke his racket when he lost to a cramp at the US Open, but he's not the first player to break his racket when frustrated, and I know Thanas well enough to know he's not proud of it.
But he has behaved very well, including in quite provocative situations at the US Open with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves praise.
He's got a great team around him, he's got a great family around him and I think he's been treated a little harshly.
He is very mature for 19, he works hard, he fits into the team and so on, and he has never had problems with other players. He is respected in the dressing room, he trains hard, he is in good shape and he is a very calm and mature young man, and I think he should be judged on his merits.
Healy has also supported the decision not to include Kyrgios in important games starting on Friday, describing this "joint decision" as a good decision for everyone, but still supporting the Canberra's return to the team's regular lineup.
"We want the team to be fully focused on the games and not all the controversy around [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
And Nick has risen really fast, as Federer and Murray, for example, have pointed out, and he's growing up in the public eye, and he's made some horrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets. But we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of what he's done, and I think it's best for both the team and him if he spends some time out of the public eye thinking about those consequences.
European migration crisis: Hungary declares state of emergency, closes borders, arrests migrants
Hungary declared a state of emergency and closed its southern border with Serbia, arresting those who tried to enter the country illegally. The aim is to stem the flow of migrants entering the country.
Chaos ensued at the border as hundreds of migrants gathered in a neutral area, and the Serbian authorities reacted with dismay.
People who fled violence in their own countries have now pitched their tents and settled for an indefinite period on a stretch of road between checkpoints in two countries.
However, frustration grew.
As the police helicopter stayed above them, the migrants chanted "Open the border!" and shouted insults at the Hungarian riot police.
Some refused food and water in protest.
Serbia's foreign minister declared it "unacceptable" to return migrants from Hungary as more and more migrants arrive from Macedonia and Greece.
"(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not cause harm to civilians.
Discussions must take place in the coming days with other countries and with Brussels," Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The chaos on the border between Hungary and Serbia arose after a bloc of 28 nationalities failed to establish a common immigration policy at a contentious meeting in Brussels.
Ministers agreed on burden-sharing for the 40 000 asylum seekers who have now invaded Italy and Greece. Ministers spoke with optimism about reaching a final agreement - next month or by the end of next year - on which EU countries will take in an additional 120,000 refugees, including part of Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday called for an extraordinary EU summit next week to discuss the continent's migration crisis.
Hungary, however, is not pinning its hopes on its neighbours or Brussels acting anytime soon.
Tuesday's state of emergency in two southern regions gave authorities greater powers to intervene in the crisis and allowed roads to be closed and asylum cases speeded up.
At the same time, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that now that the fence along the Serbian border is ready, the country will also erect a barbed wire fence along part of its border with Romania to stop the influx of migrants through the country.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners had been recruited to finish the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become the biggest bottleneck and entry point into the European Union for refugees, many of whom are fleeing war in Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has argued that the majority of arrivals are economic refugees in search of a better life, not refugees fleeing war who are entitled to protection – a view that is strongly at odds with other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which went into effect at midnight in Hungary, now define as a criminal offence an attempt to cross or damage a 4-meter (13-foot) barbed wire fence built by the government along the southern border with Serbia, as well as include longer prison sentences for convicted traffickers.
"Due to the situation caused by mass immigration, the Hungarian government is declaring a state of emergency," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We are very clear: crossing a border illegally is a crime.
Parliament still has to formally approve the military deployment expected for next week, but Associated Press reporters at the border have been seeing heavily armed military personnel with vehicles and dogs for days.
Orban's homeland security adviser, Gyorgy Bakondi, said authorities had detained 45 people trying to cross the border, as well as 15 people who had already reached further afield.
They got over by damaging the fence, are now in police custody and are charged with offences defined in the new laws.
The authorities will quickly repair the fence.
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven crossings at the border with Serbia on Tuesday morning after sending a train wagon covered with barbed wire to close one of those places.
The main border crossing near Roszke in Hungary was shrouded in chaos as Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container to handle people and crowds tried to crowd inside.
About 20 got in, but thousands stayed outside.
One group of migrants blocked the main highway between Serbia and Hungary, saying they would refuse food and drink until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
2016 election: National poll shows Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernie Sanders has narrowed by half
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold double-digit leads in the Democratic nomination race, but Senator Bernie Sanders is catching up.
Clinton is now supported by 47 percent of Democratic voters (down from 58 percent), and Sanders, who is in second place, is supported by 27 percent (up from 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden has not yet announced whether he will enter the presidential race, but he is supported by 15 percent of Democratic voters.
More than five months before the primaries begin, a majority of Democratic voters say it's still too early to say they've decided who they vote for.
Clinton's supporters, however, stand by their own choice more firmly than their supporters of other candidates.
Clinton's popularity has plummeted among several demographics since last month's CBS News Poll, while Sanders has risen somewhat.
Clinton has a strong lead among women and moderates, but her lead has narrowed.
His popularity among men has dropped considerably, with Sanders only 5 percentage points behind.
Clinton's lead among Democratic voters under 50 has disappeared, and she is now level with Sanders.
Clinton, however, is clearly leading among older voters.
Last month, Clinton led Sanders by a double-digit number among the Liberals, but now Sanders leads that group by five percentage points.
About half of the nation's Democratic voters say they will support Clinton enthusiastically if she becomes the party's nominee.
A quarter say they support him with some reservations, and 15% would support him just because he is a candidate.
Six percent would not support him at all.
Not surprisingly, Clinton's current supporters are very likely eager to support her.
Opinions are more mixed among those who do not currently support Clinton — only a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48 percent of Democratic voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, fewer Republican voters (35 percent) say the same about Republican number one Donald Trump.
When Clinton supporters were asked in an open-ended question why they wanted her to run, the most popular answer was that she had appropriate experience (16 percent). After that, the most popular responses were that now is the right time for a female president (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for the position (10 percent).
Clinton's supporters also cited her connection to Bill Clinton (9 percent).
The same opinions and the possibility of being elected were also mentioned.
Because the vice president is influencing a possible presidential nomination, 57 percent of Democratic voters would like to see him already in the race — though a third disagree.
When asked who they would pick as the second party nominee, Biden is the most popular choice.
Among Clinton supporters, more than half say they would choose Biden, who is far more popular than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hilary Clinton's lead over Sanders will grow. If Biden goes along, the lead will be 20 percentage points, but if he drops, it will be 30.
55 percent of Democratic voters believe Clinton has the best chance of winning the presidential election, but that number is down from 78 percent last month.
By that standard, Biden falls far behind, but the proportion of those who consider him the most vocal has increased.
However, when asked what is most important about a candidate, Democratic voters put opinions before voting.
Also last month, no Democratic candidate or potential candidate was considered an impossible candidate for these voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates do well on certain key issues among their party's voters.
The majority consider Clinton, Sanders, and Biden to be honest, trustworthy, and strong leaders.
Biden does best of the trio in honesty, while Clinton's strength is leadership.
30 percent of Democratic voters say they don't think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, which is twice as many as Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent say they don't have an opinion about Sanders.
Democratic voters also generally believe Clinton, Sanders and Biden ideologically agree.
Looking at all of these points, about a quarter of Democratic voters say they have no opinion about Sanders.
While questions remain about Hillary Clinton's use of her personal email address and server when she was secretary of state, most Democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation of the issue and say it did not affect their public opinion of her.
But it's different when you look at America as a whole.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with his explanation, and only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion was divided in March, shortly after the issue came to light.
A majority of Americans say the email controversy did not affect their overall opinion of Clinton, although 36 percent say their opinion of her has worsened.
More than six out of ten Republicans say their opinion of Clinton has changed for the worse.
Although voters in Clinton's own party consider her honest and trustworthy, this is still a problem for her among all registered voters. Only 32% consider him honest and trustworthy, a figure down 8 percentage points since last month and 15 percentage points since May.
62 percent of registered voters say they don't think Clinton is honest and trustworthy.
Meanwhile, 55 percent of registered voters nationwide also don't think Trump is honest and trustworthy.
However, both Clinton and Trump are considered good leaders.
Of the six candidates included in the study, Biden, Carson, and Bush are considered the most honest.
Sanders is generally considered honest, but many people don't have an opinion about him, just like Carson.
The margin of error in the survey, which included 351 Democratic voters, is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson approaches Donald Trump in national poll
Ben Carson comes close to Donald Trump in latest CBS News/New York Times poll
The two candidates garnered half of all votes in the new poll, leaving others fighting for a foothold.
Republican voters across the country remain strongly in favor of Trump, whose support has risen from 23 percent in a previous CBS poll conducted before last month's Fox News election debate to 27 percent in a poll released Tuesday.
However, Carson soared from six percent to 23 percent over the same period.
The poll also found that Carson is doing well across demographics and is on the verge of ousting Trump among college-educated Republican voters.
The rest of the field has lagged behind, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich. Support for Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker has fallen the most: from 10 percent last month to 2 percent today.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are tied for third place at 6%.
The margin of error in this latest poll, conducted in September, among a sample of 376 Republican voters, is +/- 6 percent.
The latest CNN/ORC poll released last week showed Carson on the rise in polls: he has 19 percent support among Republicans, and Trump is ahead of him with 32 percent.
Also, according to the latest ABC News/Washington Post poll, Trump was significantly ahead of Carson.
As Carson's popularity soared last week, Trump criticized the retired neurosurgeon to no avail, even as Carso apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday during a campaign visit to Iowa.
Five members of the fraternity are charged in the death of a first-year student at Baruch College
Nearly two years after a student died at a fraternity ceremony in Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains district, five people have been charged with murder.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood at Baruch College in New York City brutally assaulted Chun "Michael" Deng during a rite of membership in September 2013, and then delayed taking him to the hospital, contributing to his death, police said.
Authorities say Deng was blindfolded and loaded with a 13-pound backpack full of sand on his back, after which he was repeatedly tackled to the ground as he tried to walk across an icy field toward the goal.
In the end, Deng complained that his head hurts, after which he lost consciousness.
Members of the fraternity did not call emergency services after Deng fainted, but allegedly waited an hour before bringing him to the hospital, police said.
However, they had time to change Deng's clothes, search online for information about his symptoms, and contact Andy Meng, the fraternity's national president, for advice, police chief Chris Wagner told a news conference.
"At this point, members began hiding their ritual equipment, effectively putting the welfare of the Brotherhood before Michael Deng," Police Chief Wagner said.
Dang could not be revived and died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng received repeated blunt object blows to the head, torso and thighs.
"Too many families have been affected by fraternal shelling when at least one student a year has died as a result since 1970," Doug Fierberg, an attorney representing the Deng family, said in a statement.
Fraternities and their members must be held accountable, and this step by the authorities is important.
A Monroe County grand jury favored that the first five members be charged with third-degree murder
32 other members of the Brotherhood, including Meng, are also charged with violent scribbling and criminal intrigue.
"We don't just want to hold individuals accountable. If there is an organization behind what happened, either formally or informally, they must also be held accountable," Wagner said at Tuesday's press conference.
Baruch College banned the Brotherhood and the National Brotherhood dissolved its affiliation with the local chapter.
This is what happens when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates
Interest rates will rise, and markets with rising rates will crash, bond yields will rise, and the economy will fall into recession.
This is what we know.
What we don't know is how long all this will take or how long it will take.
The past does not help much in terms of timing, especially when it comes to the economy.
The recession has sometimes lasted only 11 months since the first drawdown, sometimes as long as 86 months.
The Federal Reserve's aggressiveness in raising interest rates has often, though not always, been a determining factor in how the economy and financial assets react.
That is why Federal Reserve officials have so vigorously stressed that investors should not focus on when interest rates will start to rise, but rather on the trajectory of the time it takes for the situation to normalize.
Indeed, there are several variables in the equation.
Eventually, however, market participants may discover that all the fuss surrounding the rate hike has been excessive.
"The central bank's first hike since the global economic crisis will inevitably be interpreted in some circles as the end of the era of 'cheap money,'" said Julian Jessop, chief economic adviser on global affairs at Capital Economics, in a message to clients.
What we do not expect, however, is that the gradual return of US interest rates to normal, albeit still low, levels will be the kind of cataclysmic shock that many seem to fear.
However, this does not mean that it does not have an impact.
Below is a look at how some parts of the economy will react based on past developments:
As the market has seen over the past month or so, waiting for an interest rate hike can make the situation volatile.
When the increase becomes a fact, the effect is not quite so dramatic.
"It appears that return on capital tends to stop for 12 to 24 months after the first hike, which again potentially reflects a lag in monetary policy," analysts at Deutsche Bank said in a recent study of what happens after the central bank hike.
More specifically, over the past 35 years or so, the market is generally on a strong upward trajectory of about 14 percent as we approach a hike, 250 days after that the situation is fairly flat (average increase of 2.6 percent), and normality has been reached after 500 days with an average return of 14.4 percent in the last six cycles, according to a recent analysis by Bob Doll, chief equity strategist at Nuveen Asset Management.  which was published in Barron's magazine.
According to Deutche Bank, the impact on equities tends to be more pronounced later in the upward cycle, when yields begin to fall.
Recessions are part of economic life, but interest rate hikes often contribute to their coming.
In the current situation, the central bank is facing certain challenges that have not existed in the past and that could accelerate a recession.
This is particularly the case for gross domestic product, which will be closest to its all-time low before the central bank's interest rate hike.
According to Deutsche Bank, in 118 withdrawals since 1950, nominal annual GDP has only twice been below 4.5%.
While the figure was 3.6 percent in the second quarter of 2015, few believe it will hold up after the third quarter has advanced by 1.5 percent, according to the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank.
Raising interest rates in such a fragile economic setting can be risky and raises the question of "whether this time will be different", Deutsche Bank said.
Market participants have been preparing for a central bank hike throughout the year, and everyone is looking forward to this week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which ends Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe the committee can approve a raise at this meeting, futures trading only anticipates a 25% probability.
"Our study shows that since 1950, all mark-up cycles have so far occurred in increasing leverage supercycles, where GDP has passed its pre-recession peaks very quickly after stimulus has begun," the report says.
On the other hand, there has now been an exceptionally slow recovery from the recession, which has been the worst of the observation period.
In the current cycle, the central bank has waited by far the longest for the last recession to end: the record has been 35 months and it is now in its 74th month.
Fixed yields have also been volatile as markets wait for an interest rate hike, and the pattern is somewhat reminiscent of capital observations.
The main difference is that when a central bank changes course, its effects are more quickly reflected in bonds than in equities.
The direction of bond yields appears to change immediately at the first increase/cut of the cycle.
At the end of the increase cycle, bond yields will fall immediately," Deutche Bank said.
Charles Schwab strategists believe that raising interest rates will cause yields on longer- and shorter-term bonds to converge, thereby flattening the yield curve.
High-yield bonds often perform better in such a situation, although "we are still cautious about looking for returns," said Kathy Jones, a fixed yield analyst at Schwab, in an analysis.
Surprisingly, Jones believes markets have already adjusted to the central bank's policy expectations.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and falling inflation expectations, there are several signs that markets have adjusted to the outlook for tighter monetary policy," he wrote.
Short-term interest rates are high, the yield curve is flatter, credit margins have increased and volatility has increased - all these are characteristic of markets at a time when the central bank has tightened its policy.
In general, companies with predominantly U.S. businesses win when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinationals with high levels of debt perform worse when the rise in the value of the dollar makes their products more expensive on the world market and their debt becomes more expensive than they have financed.
"History shows that 'quality' stocks tend to be more profitable in the three months after the first rate hike," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report to clients.
Enterprises with strong turnover overtook enterprises with weak turnover after increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004 by an average of five percentage points.
Companies with high returns on capital and low volatility stocks performed better than lower-quality firms. The average for the former was 4 (percentage points) and for the latter 3 (percentage points).
Debt becomes a big problem.
Those companies with a lot of variable rate debt are losing the most, Goldman said.
Outside of stock market speculation, consumers also have the opportunity to benefit from the rise in the value of the dollar.
Savers can also make a profit with higher returns, although experts disagree on how quickly the effect will be felt.
BBC Radio is a copy of Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham accuses the channel of 'popularisation'
He argues that it will become increasingly difficult to distinguish it from a commercial competitor
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, saying they just mimicked the Brit Awards
Fellow MP Damien Collins criticised The Voice, saying it's not original either
BBC Radio 3 is "transforming" into Classic FM, claims a leading MP, increasing pressure on the production company to prove that it is doing something that commercial production companies are not doing.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC leaders that the public service radio station appeared to be "popularising" its content and that it was becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish it from a commercial competitor.
"It seems that Radio 3 — I wouldn't want to use the term 'popularising' — is turning into Classic FM," he said.
He also set his sights on the BBC Music Awards, which were launched last December.
"The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, just seem like a Brit Awards under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something different, here are two examples that I remember directly when you're actually just copying something that's already on the market," Bingham said.
The BBC Director-General denied the charges, claiming that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rival when it comes to live music and disseminating information to the public.
Radio 3 teaches me things about classical music that I can't learn anywhere else.
Its commitment to live music and music making is actually first class.
"Also, I think it's really important that Radio 3 is committed to discovering new music and commissioning new works," he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 chief, Alan Davey, argued that the channel needed to do more work than before to reach audiences because Britons know less about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only part of the BBC's offering that was criticised for stepping on the toes of commercial competitors during the hearing before the Special Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
Conservative Tory MP Damien Collins criticised The Voice, a music contest bought by the BBC from Dutch production company Talpa Media for an estimated £22 million.
Do you understand why this programme is often discussed, because it is not original and is in no way original?
Lord Hall claimed that this BBC1 programme, with Paloma Faith and Boy George as star judges, was produced "quite BBC style".
He added that he wants the production company to "find success in-house" the next time it launches an entertainment series.
However, he refused to prevent future seasons of The Voice from being produced, or to order that license payers' money be used for other entertainment formats.
Online sales rose the least so far in August, Black Friday may be the reason
Online sales increased by 7% in the first three months of 2015
Last month had a rise that was the lowest since statistics began in 2000
Three years ago, online sales were boosted by the use of mobile devices for shopping
Experts believe that Black Friday in November may curb consumption
Virtual shopping has soared for over a decade, turning many of Britain's shopping streets into ghost towns.
However, experts say there are now signs of online sales leveling off, with the latest figures showing only a 7% increase for the first quarter of 2015.
Total consumption in August grew by the smallest since the statistics began in 2000: an increase of only five per cent from last year.
Experts say there are signs of online sales leveling off, with the latest figures showing just a 7% increase for the first quarter of 2015.
"If you look at growth levels in previous years and go back to 2000, it was clear that the situation would make sense over time," Andy Mulcahy, editor of the JMRG Sales Index, told the Guardian.
He explained that three years ago, online sales strengthened when shoppers started using their mobile phones to shop.
This meant that more people shopped online and could be done in different environments, such as on the couch.
But now it's leveling off, and (growth) can go down.
The Black Friday phenomenon imported from America has been considered one of the reasons behind the slowing trades.
Experts believe consumers will discourage shopping ahead of the event on the last Friday in November.
Last year, five times more shoppers flocked to their computers to grab deals, crashing many merchants' websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, which caused shoppers to argue over bargains, could curb shopping
A study published by the British Retail Consortium found that only about one in five pounds was spent online.
For certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of purchases are now made online.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of using fashion chains on shopping streets.
Muslims bury those killed in crane crash in Mecca, sanctions for Bin Laden's family
Muslims carried the bodies of 29 dead through the streets during the first funerals in Mecca
Saudi Arabia has partly blamed construction giant Saudi Binladin Group for the collapse
The Ministry of Health said a total of 394 people were also injured when the crane collapsed
The 29 dead were carried through the air through the streets as hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury them. The victims died when a crane collapsed in the Grand Mosque of Mecca.
Mourners, dressed mainly in white, filled the route to honor the first of the dead who made their final journey to Al-Moaissem Cemetery.
A sad procession passed the holy place, where just a few days ago a crane fell through the roof of a mosque and toppled worshippers.
The bodies were released for burial after the King of Saudi Arabia confirmed the Bin Laden family's construction group responsible for the disaster, which also injured 394 people.
In the Grand Mosque in Mecca, the bodies of 29 worshippers killed by a fallen crane were carried through the streets
Among the dead was Qasim Akram, a father of four from Bolton in the Manchester area. He was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Akram had been in the Grand Mosque with his parents before the annual hajj pilgrimage began.
Saudi officials have already vowed that the hajj to Mecca will continue as thousands continue to arrive in the city.
Today, King Salman stated that Binladin Group should not have left the crane arm up when it was not in use.
The Arabic version of the ruling, published by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, said Binladin Group was partly to blame for the collapse.
The English-language service of the news agency did not mention this detail, but it said that the company's directors are prohibited from traveling abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to investigate what caused the crane to fall in the courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were gathered ahead of the hajj pilgrimage later this month.
Binladin Group has not released any announcements about the collapse of the crane, and its representatives have not been reached for comment.
The royal decision also accused the consortium of failing to use up-to-date safeguards and failing to cooperate with meteorological authorities.
Around the Grand Mosque in Mecca are dozens of cranes that are part of a huge construction project run by the Binladin Group.
The Binladin family has been close to the Saudi royal family for decades and leads major construction projects.
The late leader of al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was a rebel boy who was banned by his family in the 1990s.
The collapse occurred in windy and rainy weather just days before millions arrive in the Kingdom for a pilgrimage that every capable Muslim must make at least once in his life.
Authorities say 158 people are still in hospital.
The authorities ordered one million rials (£174,000) to be paid to the families of the dead as well as the permanently injured.
Other injured people receive half of this amount.
B&Q boss says cheap workers in Eastern Europe are behind the popularity
The British are increasingly using the services of assistants, says Veronique Laury
The number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe is on the rise
As a result, 200 more Screwfix shops for professionals will be opened
Meanwhile, Kingfisher is closing 60 B&Q stores across the country
Written by Rupert Steiner, the city's chief correspondent for the Daily Mail
The British are said to give up their hammers and paint brushes and prefer to hire skilled Eastern European workers to do housekeeping
It seems that if you are dexterous with a hammer or haka at painting walls, you are in the minority today.
Britons are hiring more and more helpers to do DIY work in their homes, says the boss of the company behind B&Q.
Veronique Lauri, the new CEO of Kingfisher, which owns a chain of home renovation stores, said the reason for the popularity is the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe and the fact that they offer their services at bargain prices.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open 200 new Screwfix stores for workers and close 60 B&Q stores.
Laury said she wants more women to work in B&Q stores because eight out of ten purchase decisions made in stores are made by the fairer sex.
Today, most of the staff are men.
She said that changes in the population must be taken into account: today there are more single-woman households with more renovation work than before.
Laury said, "Most of the staff in our stores are still men.
We need to find a better balance.
However, half of our customers are women, and 80% of product purchasing decisions are made by women.
Women play a big role in the decision-making process."
Laury is one of only five women to lead the UK's FTSE100 Index. She has restructured her management team so that it has an equal number of male and female managers.
Kingfisher is almost the only company with exactly 50 percent women in the group, including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer.
Laury said: "This was a conscious decision - diversity is important here.
It hasn't been difficult to find good women to join the management team."
Kingfisher reported declines in both six-month revenue and sales after the group took on the cost of closing stores.
As a result of the trend, Kingfisher, which owns Screwfix and B&Q stores, is opening 200 new stores
The government of the Three Aces decided to resort to coercive legislation to save the country's economy.
Visible effects were achieved quite quickly.
The sharp end of the SAK and other trade unions began to be forced right away, and as a result, the country stands still on Friday due to a large workers' protest.
For quite a few people, reason also stands there.
People ask whether it is worth going on strike when things are going badly anyway.
A resistance movement has even been set up.
More than 50,000 people have already gone online to announce that they will not take part in the demonstration but will go to work.
In the good old days of consensus, this would have been impossible.
Of course, there was no internet to protest on, but openly declaring yourself an offender would have been the political suicide of a small person.
The protest of a few tens of thousands of trade unions with millions of members does not give much thought, but it does give food for thought.
The position of the trade union movement is no longer as self-evident as it was twenty years ago.
Not everyone feels ownership of the movement's goals, values have changed
From the point of view of the attractiveness of the trade union movement's activities, the government's drastic decisions can also be seen as a direct gift from heaven.
After years of things seeming to take their course, now the unions are finally getting down to business, i.e. defending workers' rights, visibly and properly.
In this way, the government may want to strengthen the role of the trade union movement, as membership in a trade union is perhaps seen as more necessary than before.
Whatever one thinks of the actions of the organisations, it is nonsense that Friday's demonstration would somehow stop Finland.
Yes, Finland has stopped a long time ago.
For example, industrial production has fallen for 31 months in a row.
Gross domestic product continues to fall, and unemployment rises.
You would think that these things would force everyone's head.
University of Lappeenranta embarks on a tough austerity policy: Aiming for savings of EUR 8.5 million, personnel reduction of 130
Lappeenranta University of Technology is launching a savings programme with the aim of cutting costs by a total of EUR 8.5 million.
As part of the savings, the university will start co-operation negotiations concerning the entire personnel, with an annual savings target of EUR 6.5 million.
In practice, this means a reduction of about 130 employees.
An additional two million euros will be saved from other activities.
The co-determination negotiations are based on the 2016 budget, which anticipates a deficit of EUR 8.5 million in actual operations.
It is also affected by the government's budget cuts.
During this financial year, the university will make a deficit of approximately EUR 2.6 million.
The costs will increase slightly for next year, but at the same time the funding received from the ministry will decrease by EUR 2 million and other funding by EUR 3.2 million.
The total budget of the university is approximately EUR 85 million, so the savings target is ten per cent of the total budget.
The combined effect of the massive cuts in teaching and research and the reduction in corporate funding on our university is very significant, says Rector Anneli Pauli in the university's press release.
Before the summer, the effects of the cuts seemed even more moderate, but now the decrease in supplementary funding is showing new proportions.
Negotiations with shop stewards will begin on Tuesday next week and will last for the six weeks prescribed by law.
Yle: Onnibus wants Finnish railways
British Sir Brian Souter, owner of the low-cost bus company Onnibus, tells Yle that the company is also aiming for rail transport in Finland.
I am very interested in getting involved in Finnish rail transport.
My Stagecoach company is one of the largest rail companies in the UK," says Souter.
Rail transport is to be opened up to competition gradually.
Commuter traffic in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area will be the first to operate in 2017–2018.
After commuter traffic, long-distance traffic will follow.
Souter says he has already approached the Department of Transportation.
According to Yle, the Ministry of Transport welcomes Onnibus' plans.
Of the other international companies, interest in rail transport has been expressed at least by Transdev (formerly Veolia), which also operates bus services in Finland and rail services elsewhere in Europe.
The Federal Reserve must make decisions on interest rates
The rest of the world will stand by as the Federal Reserve meets for two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a critical decision on whether to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
In a Reuters poll of 80 economists, just over half of those who believed last week that the central bank would raise interest rates now believe the situation will not be resolved yet and interest rates will be kept at the current level of 0-0.25%.
This is a historic event, as it is seven years since the Central Bank cut interest rates to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a key central bank has the opportunity to exit zero and start normalising interest rates," said Angel Ubide, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy has performed relatively well, and the recovery has brought trillions of dollars to balance sheets and created little inflation.
However, the central bank cannot ignore the less rosy global outlook.
It has warned markets that they should be ready for a hike, but signs also indicate that they believe the odds are against a hike.
The decision will be announced on Thursday at 20:00 (CET).
Delta State University shooter left apology note
After shooting his girlfriend in Mississippi Monday morning — before shooting a colleague later that day — Shannon Lamb wrote a message saying she was "sorry" for the first murder and hoped "she could cancel it," authorities said Tuesday.
Gautier police in Mississippi said Lamb, a geography and social studies teacher at Delta State University, called emergency services around ten a.m
Monday and reported that he has shot and killed someone.
Lamb told the defendant that police must send constables to his home.
He said he "killed his wife last night" and also mentioned that there is an "adorable dog" in the house who "doesn't bother anyone" but is probably upset.
The police asked the caller his name, but he did not say so.
Lamb gave no explanation for the shooting.
When police arrived, the body of 41-year-old Amy Prentiss was found, along with a handwritten note from 45-year-old Lamb that read: "I'm so sorry, I wish I could cancel it.
I loved Amy and she was the only person who has ever loved me."
After writing the message, Lamb drove nearly 500 miles to Delta State, where he killed history teacher Ethan Schmidt, before finally killing himself late Monday as police surrounded him.
University president William LaForge said there was no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt to his knowledge, but that "clearly there was something on Lamb's mind."
Authorities said Tuesday that despite allegations released Monday that Lamb believed Prentiss was in a relationship with Schmidt, there was "no information or evidence" of any kind of "triangle drama."
Shawn O'Steen said he had been married to Prentiss for about seven years and described him as a "good person."
The couple divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss had a 19-year-old daughter who is "devastated."
O'Steen said Prentiss and her daughter were "absolutely best friends."
According to Linsday Knowles, Prentiss worked online from his home. According to the Sun Herald, Knowles was a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said Prentiss, who had a dog named Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
"He always wanted to help other people," Knowles said.
Police said Lamb called relatives at some point Monday to tell them "he's not going to jail."
When officers caught up with Lamb on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped his car on the side of the road, left it there, and ran into the woods, where he shot himself.
Lamb defended her doctoral dissertation in education at Delta State in spring 2015, according to a curriculum vitae available on the university's website.
Stars that lost their charm
The actor (left), pictured with his son Redmond (right), has had a tough time in recent years.
In 2001, he suffered from leukemia, and in 2009, his longtime partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
Rumor has it that he also had drug problems, and in 2008 he was arrested for drug possession.
All of this really takes its toll.
Manchester United's Luke Shaw will be out for months with a double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture to his right leg during Manchester United's loss to PSV Eindhoven in a Champions League match.
Although the defender was left in tears and will be out for at least six months, Louis van Gaal hopes Shaw can still play this season.
The injury was caused by a reckless tackle by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after 20-year-old Shaw had crashed into PSV territory.
He was treated for 9 minutes on the field and had to be given oxygen before being taken to hospital.
Van Gaal said: "He has a double fracture in his leg and is now in hospital."
He will be transferred tomorrow, or maybe a day after, and then operated on in Manchester.
This is horrible. The boy comes to Manchester United at the age of 18, suffers from difficulties and then plays brilliantly, and now this is what is happening.
When I was in the locker room, he was wearing an oxygen mask.
She cried.
I'm not a doctor, but a double fracture will take at least six months and he won't play in the group stage.
I hope he gets to play this season.
Moreno seemed lucky to receive only a red card and a penalty shot.
Referee Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican player.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian official was mistaken.
You can judge it yourself when I say it was a penalty shot and a red card.
It was a really bad two-foot tackle.
Shaw tweeted, "Thank you all for your messages, words are not enough to express how disappointed I am, my recovery starts now, I come back stronger."

The English defender will have an additional incentive to recover from next June's European Championships in France.
PSV coach Phillip Cocu said: "It's a really bad injury."
If any player gets out because of such an injury, everyone is very sad.
It is never the intention of our players to offend an opponent.
Moreno suffered a broken leg while playing for Mexico against Van Gaal's Netherlands at the 2014 World Cup.
"Moreno takes this hard because the intention is not to hurt the opponent, and when you hear that the injury is really bad, that's bad," Cocu said.
I didn't see it in that situation.
The only thing I saw was a ball going in a different direction, so it looked like he [Moreno] was touching it, but I didn't see Luke's tackle.
Moreno told SBS6, "I know how it feels, I know how tricky something like this can be.
I feel horrible about this, I'm so sorry."
PSV's Andrés Guardado was also taken to hospital after being challenged by Chris Smalling.
I guess David Cameron knows the Lorax better than this?
Every parent soon learns one thing: if your child loves a book, it won't be long before they learn it almost by heart.
Unless you're David Cameron.
When a holiday childcare service asked the prime minister about his favourite children's book, he chose Dr Seuss's The Lorax, an environmental protection story published in 1971.
It was a tricky choice, Cameron writes in a post on SuperCamps' website, adding: "Funny, moving, creative and carries a strong message. I enjoy reading this book to my children because it always seems to have a picture or message that we haven't seen before."
All of this is true, but the next paragraph, in which Cameron supposedly describes the plot of the book, is a summary of the 2012 film version, in which new characters and details were added to fill the rather short original text.
"In the walled city of Tarville, where all nature has disappeared and even air is a commodity, the boy Ted hopes to win the heart of the girl of his dreams by fulfilling Audrey's wish to see the right tree," the text says, describing a love story not written by Dr Seuss, real name Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991.
If that's not suspicious enough, Cameron's text sounds in places like it was taken from the plot synopsis of the movie Lorax found on the Internet Movie Database website, which begins as follows: "In the walled city of Tarville, where everything is artificial and even air is a commodity, Ted the boy hopes to win the heart of the Audrey girl of his dreams."
Given that Cameron is a publicly active parent, it seems unlikely that he would be so unfamiliar with the plot of the book. In it, a young, nameless boy learns how local nature has been destroyed by the greedy, tree-chopping and weaving Kerskanen, ignoring the short, mustachioed creature that gave the story its name, the Lorax, who "speaks for the trees."
Such a relatively invisible PR task is probably outsourced to an assistant who, apparently, has never read a book 20 times in a row to a child.
A spokesman for the prime minister said the text may have come from Cameron's constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was received from Cameron's staff, but did not comment further at the time.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of being sidelined from the England team, but it was still a tough place
Playing against Pakistan in the UAE is a tough task, but when you see what kind of team England have chosen for the tour, I don't think a repeat of last 3-0 series loss is likely.
I wouldn't rule out an away win either.
Alastair Cook's side may be less experienced than the team from three years ago, but it has some good twist hitters and a strong team mindset: they have no scars from 2012, just youthful positivity.
Moeen Ali is improving in his spiral passes and Adil Rashid is an attacking option, although he is an unknown player at this level.
Related: Adam Lyth dropped from England cricket team, replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to leave Adam Lyth is understandably difficult to analyse for me as I am his head coach in Yorkshire.
His seven games have been against good strikers in challenging conditions and the simple but harsh truth is that cricketers are judged on their results.
There was no uncertainty about Joe Root's selection, for example, before the announcement because, as I've said before, players are the best pickers.
About a hundred points more, and Lyth's tenure with the team could have continued, but he himself was responsible for his own fate.
Hopefully if he gets more runs for Yorkshire, another chance will come along.
England head coach Trevor Bayliss praised Lyth's attitude even when he didn't perform quite as well as he could have and that doesn't surprise me. Lyth is first and foremost a team player.
It is tricky to answer the question of how long a batsman gets to leave a mark.
Lyth was selected seven times for the national team, like Sam Robson before him, while Nick Compton was selected nine times.
Only Compton got the opportunity to play both home and away.
The only complaint is that England first chose Jonathan Trot for the Caribbean when Lyth was in top form, but that missed opportunity is now a thing of the past.
Alex Hales comes along, and there's a batsman I respect.
There's something about him as a cricketer that we saw in Yorkshire early this season when he scored 236 points against us at Trent Bridge.
He needs to be given at least the same chance as everyone else before him, but of course this depends on the composition of the team in the UAE.
The idea of Moeen in the batting opener next to Cook has been floated around to get an extra pitcher on the field but keep four fast ones, and I'm not against that.
I don't see why a batsman can't bat there, and this left-hander has already shown himself to be quite a cricketer.
Moeen may not have done his job in his county of Worcestershire, but he is a triplet for them and there is little difference in that.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 games when the lattice dropped before moving on to the opener in 2001.
He immediately scored three hundred points and did not recall the past.
Zafar Ansari comes in as a reserve pitcher and, from what I've been in contact with him, he feels like a very impressive young man.
People can look at his unvarnished stats — hitting an average of 31, batting with a ball of 35 — and think it's a gamble, but there aren't too many pitchers available and the selectors picked youngsters.
He learns a lot on this tour.
Outside the squad, England seem to have a few tough additions to the coaching side.
Appointing Sri Lankan batsman Mahela Jayawardene as a game consultant could prove to be a stroke of genius.
He's one of the nicest guys in the game, and he brings a huge amount of experience because he's done everything in all situations and against all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes into the white-ball game, bringing with him both energy and a relentless flair.
I've always thought he was born to be involved in international cricket, whether it's playing or coaching, and he has the same kind of exploitable flair as Mahela.
Sometimes new sounds in the dressing room can refresh a team, even if their message is the same as before.
Colly's team-mate from Durham, Ben Stokes, is rested in the one-day, Root was given a similar break against Australia and I certainly have no problem with this.
Although not everyone agrees, coaches and choosers do not make schedules.
And you have to remember that just like players, their work depends on results.
Such decisions are never taken lightly.
Those in favour of the UK leaving the EU (Brexit) could win if the economy is in trouble in 2017
David Cameron's half-baked renegotiation strategies to keep Britain in the EU are getting into bigger and bigger problems every day, even taking into account the words of the heartfelt Jeremy "Is it yes or no?" Corbyn's election as leader of the Labour Party or the trade unions' anger at Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their own Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A fellow European diplomat recently explained that because the EU is so deeply embroiled in various crises, not all of which are its own fault, some member states are fed up with Britain's egocentric agenda, full of divisive concessions and disruptive treaty changes that these countries for the most part do not want.
At its annual meeting in Brighton, the trade union confederation decided that it did not want them either, if they were eroding social protection.
We could call it Dave and George's selfie agenda.
The prime minister and finance minister are late for summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a picture of themselves in front of a famous local monument, with or without a local eye-catcher, and then come home saying they will win supporters of reform.
It's all about me.
A European friend of mine who wants an outward-looking Britain inside the EU tent - 'do not leave us alone with France', as they say from Berlin - is proposing that the most short-sighted ministers and officials in certain capitals are now at a point where they do not care if we stay then we leave.
Germany's cautious and moderate Chancellor, Angela Merkel, is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave office before it is ruined, as happened to Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16), who have stayed too long.
France's François Hollande faces re-election or replacement in 2017.
He, too, is a fading force.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain a left-wing one.
It is hard to see these countries sacrificing themselves for the selfie Britons when their energy should be directed more towards preventing Scotland from leaving the UK - they do not want that either because of similar separatist tendencies of their own.
So, my friend suggests, some of such ministers may even deliberately plan to make useless remarks in the style of the Scottish National Party during the UK's 2017 referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process.
"The renegotiation was an arranged thing" and "The renegotiation had no meaning for Britain."
Europeans have experienced bitterly how greedy the newspapers in Fleet Street can be and how EU-sceptic the autocrats of the press are, which they were not at the time of the Tony Benn-inspired referendum of 1975, when our membership, which began in 1973, was confirmed by a ratio of 2:1.
They may vaguely remember Boris Johnson, the greatest Euro-opportunist, who made a name for himself by writing about 'straight bananas in the EU' when he was Brussels correspondent in the early 90s.
Ed Miliband may have been a fool, but at least he knew who his enemies were.
They included a motley group of tax-evading rogues, foreigners hacking phones, and people nominally based elsewhere who own most of our big newspapers.
Tony Blair actually thought exactly the same about them, but realised that if you're in a cage with a lustful gorilla, you have to give up bananas for the sake of a smokescreen, unless you want to be on that gorilla's lunch menu and later dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more Blair than Blair himself when it came to opposing Cameron's renegotiation trick. After all, Bair had acquiesced to the principle behind the rejected EU constitution, which was rejected by the French and Dutch electorate in 2005, thereby giving Mr Blair a way out.
The press never forgave him for that either.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who kindly patted me on the back at Westminster Parliament House on Monday (I told him he had no more time to waste on me), seemed to be in danger of readopting Neil Kinnock's '80s boycott Murdoch strategy, which was a mistake both then and now.
Although it may take time, he is forced to develop a consistent strategy for communicating with the media. Not to me, but undoubtedly to Andrew Marr, from whose BBC sofa Corbyn left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position in Europe is, to put it nicely, evolving.
He says he would like us to stay in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside of Ukip's war goal zeal and the Conservative Party's fiercest nationalists can certainly rally behind that opinion.
Hilary "Benn, but not a Benn fan" Benn said this on both radio and TV this week, when his inner scout would have liked to admit that Corbyn's choice to appoint the rugged John McDonnell as shadow finance minister was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the '70s when his grandfather struggled on TV, trying to be disloyal to his Labour government colleagues without going so far as to lose his cabinet seat.
Hilary's struggles were more appealing.
But fighting to keep up with "any situation" — Benn's phrase — wasn't what McDonnell said, nor, by all accounts, what Corbyn told the parishiers and MPs in a private meeting on Monday night.
Whatever the non-hierarchical, emotional and personal image that Corbyn wants to convey (remember, he even touched me), communication discipline is important in the age of round-the-clock TV, and especially in the whirlwind of social media, which is a breeding ground for paranoia and deception.
As Mr McDonnell has said, it is only fair not to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe by allowing him to take Labour's support for the referendum campaign for granted.
At least Simon Jenkins thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's basic prevarication about EU membership (and aligned with their Benn-inspired regulated economy and anti-capitalist past) is no longer just an abstruse debate among left-wing dissidents for whom the narcissism of small differences is a central dogma in doctrinal squabbles.
As for his ambivalence over NATO (Tom Watson is convinced Corby is not campaigning to give up), foreign diplomats just have to try to explain it to their superiors.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital (they too have distrustful voters) on concessions to Britain when it may be completely pointless?
The United States is already somewhat disappointed by the poor British military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost-cutting Conservative government in power, as I was reminded at the start of Monday's British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticise Public Health England's e-cigarette review
Researchers have said that the government-funded agency's claim that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than traditional cigarettes originated from a meeting of 12 people, some of whom had connections to the tobacco industry.
Experts writing for the British Medical Journal (BMJ) agreed with the Lancet, criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in its report on e-cigarettes.
PHE released this "milestone" report last month, describing it as a "comprehensive review of the evidence."
However, several researchers have questioned the sustainability of the data, pointing to links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
Last month, the medical journal The Lancet published an editorial attacking the "exceptionally shaky foundation" of PHE's main conclusion.
Two other researchers who have written in the BMJ have wondered whether the claims are "built on rock or sand."
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, say: "The main principle of public health is that policies should be based on proven effectiveness."
They say the public expects PHE's claim that "according to the current best estimate, e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than conventional cigarettes" is based on a detailed evaluation and modelling of the evidence.
In fact, it comes from one meeting of 12 people where a multi-criteria decision analysis model (MCDA) was developed to synthesize their opinion on the harms associated with various nicotine-containing products, and the results of this meeting were summarized in research.
McKee and Capewell say one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose chief executive reportedly previously received funding from Bristish American Tobacco for an independent study.
He also supported the BAT's public health mandate in the sustainability report, they say.
One of the 12 people at the meeting said they had received funding from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but not the funding he reportedly received in the past from tobacco company Philip Morris International, they added.
The selection criteria for the panel members are not disclosed, but the panel includes several well-known e-cigarette advocates, some of whom also say in the study that they have received funding from the field.
Others present are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by PHE's Director of Tobacco.
The study produced by the group "eloquently admits" that there is a lack of "irrefutable evidence regarding harm in most products and most criteria," McKee and Capewell write.
However, none of these links or limitations are mentioned in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell say PHE's claims that "so far there is no evidence that e-cigarettes serve as a route to smoking in children or non-smokers" are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and wellbeing at PHE, says claims made in the BMJ have been answered before.
He says, "E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking."
Half of those who burn their lifespan die of addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by e-cigarettes are comparatively small, but we must continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what evidence shows and what it does not show, especially when there is so much public uncertainty about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die each year from smoking-related illness and smoking costs the NHS £2 billion a year.
By explaining the current evidence - that is, although e-cigarettes are not risk-free, their harm is only a fraction of that of conventional tobacco - we are fulfilling our national responsibility.
BBC should give up EastEnders, says former Channel 4 executive
Former Channel 4 chairman Luke Johnson has said that the BBC should stop broadcasting programmes such as EastEnders or The Voice, and that commercial competitors would "give anything" for hits such as this soap opera set in Albert Square.
Johnson said licence fees should only be used to make programmes that other British broadcasters do not.
He criticised the BBC for putting public service programmes, which are likely to have a smaller audience, in awkward airtimes against competitors' most-watched programmes and on channels such as BBC4.
After BBC Director-General Tony Hall said the company wanted to work more closely with other organisations, Johnson said he tried to build a relationship with the BBC for six years at Channel 4, to no avail.
"I don't understand the idea that the BBC should produce and broadcast programmes that would suit clearly unsubsidised competitors," Johnson told the House of Lords Communications Committee as part of its inquiry into the BBC's future.
If the licence fee is maintained - and I am not sure that it would be a good idea for this medium or in the long term - it should at least limit its production to programmes that others do not make and produce.
The Voice is broadcast at key airtime to gather as much support as possible for its future.
The idea that no one else would show the show is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's clearly nonsense.
Johnson said: "I don't see why a regressive tax should fund programs that could also be funded without government subsidies.
The Voice is one of those and EastEnders is another, admittedly done in-house.
Frankly, other channels would give any of it.
I do not understand how this is about public service broadcasting.
I don't think it would weaken the BBC at all."
Johnson, a serial entrepreneur who ran Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said the BBC was guilty of hunting for viewership "because of the goals of the people who work there, and because they believe it's the best way to achieve long-term support."
His comments on the BBC's most popular series are reminiscent of those of former Sky boss Tony Ball. He used his 2003 MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh to suggest that the BBC sell such series as EastEnders.
Johnson said the BBC's public service programmes for a smaller audience "go to BBC4, where often you can't measure viewership, but the BBC is fulfilling its remit and then, defending £4 billion in licence fee revenue, can hypocritically say, 'Of course, we're doing all these unknown programmes that nobody watches.'"
They put them on a mission site where no one ever comes to see them.
On the licence fee, Johnson told the committee: "I challenge you to find a more regressive system in terms of who gets the most value for it.
Of course you all think, we all think that GBP 150 a year is good value, but I do not know if that is true for people for whom GBP 150 is big money because they do not use the BBC much.
Former Sky and Channel 5 chief David Elstein, who also testified before the committee on Tuesday, said the BBC should reassess its mission under Reith to "inform, educate and entertain".
He said that only a small proportion of the BBC's production is now classified as education - he said the figures are 1% of TV production and 0.1% of radio production - and that it should take inspiration from Australian and Canadian broadcasters and change its mission to "inform, educate and entertain".
On partnership issues, Elstein said the BBC should focus more on events such as the Proms, which he says are only shown on television, and form alliances with commercial companies so that they can all be watched online.
"Sound genetics" allows brain cells to be controlled by sound waves
The video shows how nematodes change direction as soon as a sound impulse hits them.
Scientists have bred worms with genetically engineered nervous systems so that they can be controlled by sound wave bursts.
Tiny nematodes change direction as soon as they are hit by a sound impulse that is too high for human ears to hear.
The impulses work by switching on genetically engineered motor neurons with membrane channels that respond to ultrasonic waves.
Related: Scientists read and write brain activity with light
The researchers said the worms show that a new method called sound genetics works. In it, ultrasound can be used to activate certain brain, heart and muscle cells from outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told The Guardian that the method could one day replace deep brain stimulation. It is an invasive procedure in which electrical impulses are introduced into people's brains to treat Parkinson's disease.
Nematodes do not normally respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that when surrounded by a liquid with microscopic bubbles, the situation changed.
He noticed that the bubbles amplified ultrasonic waves, which then pass inside the worms.
Amplified ultrasonic waves act on TRP-4 ion channels, structures found in the cell membranes of some worms.
Sound waves cause these ion channels to open and activate the cells attached to them, according to a report published in the journal Nature Communications.
To make ultrasonically controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motor neurons have TRP-4 ion channels.
When Chalasani applied ultrasound to the modified worms, the microbubbles amplified the sound waves and transmitted them to the worms, where they turn on the modified motor neurons.
The method shares some features with optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that allows scientists to turn neurons on and off using light impulses.
However, Chalasani says that the use of sonogenetics may have some advantages over optogenetics.
Unlike light, which must be sent via optical fiber to a desired location inside the brain, low-frequency ultrasound waves can pass through the tissue unhindered, so they can be sent to the brain from the top of the skull.
"We believe that using gene therapy and a therapeutic virus, it may be possible to make targeted human neurons momentarily respond to an ultrasound signal in certain neurological treatments in a clinical setting," Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
Illegal torture equipment - delivered to your home!
Ads shame Britain's arms trade
Watch Amnesty International's anti-gun show video.
Terrifying killer machines!
Ankle-crushing leg irons!
Cluster bombs!
As well as electric stun traps that cause excruciating pain but leave no traces!
The cheerful voice and imagery of the comics leave no doubt that this advertisement for the world's largest arms fair is a sharp parody produced by Amnesty International to highlight the British government's willingness to peddle arms to repressive regimes at a party at Defence and Security Equipment International's ExCeL Centre in London's shipyard district.

As a result of a separate campaign, many posters appeared at bus stops and metro trains that required closer study.
"Important announcement, Will you be travelling on the DLR route from September 15 to 18?" one asks using the font and brand of the London Underground, with the DLR's track changing to an image of a tank.
This September, a horde of arms dealers will arrive on the DLR route... Customers are asked to help stop the gun show.
These 300 posters were created by artists whose work was exhibited at Banksy's Dismaland Museum of Cruel Designs.
A collective called Special Patrol Group helped distribute the posters across London using "Ad Space Hack Packs". It's a six-pound pack of Allen keys, which, according to the collective, "give access to one-third of the advertising space at bus stops on the planet."
Transport for London is not amused by this unauthorised 'poster vandalism'.
One of the parody commercials produced by the Special Patrol Group collective.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists are increasingly questioning and want to take political work to audiences outside galleries.
A lot of artists have started working with activists on resistance fronts when they realized they had to go outside if they wanted their art to make a difference in society.
Another anti-gun poster greets commuters on the subway.
Amnesty's video has been viewed more than 100,000 times on Facebook in the last 24 hours. It was created for free by the advertising agency VCCP, and the graphic designer and background commentator also worked for free.
VCCP's creative director Matt Leverin noticed that the gun show was not advertised at all - and ExCeL also had a blank spot on his calendar at the time - and thought: "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They toyed with the idea of a more realistic advertisement for a shady corporation, but "it was more arresting to emphasize it with bright colors and animation."
"They have done a fantastic job in helping us raise questions about illegal torture equipment sold at trade fairs," Amnesty International's Tom Davies said.
Now the British Government must take action to ensure that instruments of torture are not sold illegally near our own homes.
Perhaps the most creative art associated with the gun fair comes from inside ExCeL, as exhibitors sell fantastically embellished products.
Saab revealed in a press release that it had received an order from the US military for a "shoulder-launched AT4CS RS".
This includes "a unique tube-charge warhead that exerts excellent effects behind armor inside the target."
Whatever it does, it is not pleasant.
Eight golden rules for living in a student dormitory
It has been 11 years since I moved into a student dormitory at the uninformed age of 19. Back then, I still believed in berets and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the forced smiles of the people I annoyed—and the numerous, long complaints about others.
Much of what I have learned can be summed up in eight simple rules.
Moving into a dorm can be anything from nerve-wracking to completely scary.
It's tempting to chatter: tell us where you're from, whether you took a gap year and where, what you think of Corbyn, and why "I seriously don't love or hate Marmite because really it's just yeast extract HAHAHA to find me in my room".
Take a breath.
And also help others take a breath - ask questions and show interest.
It guides the conversation and helps you find the people you like, not the ones you don't want to talk to, even if your eyelashes are on fire and they're handing out fire extinguishers.
Give people space.
People's rooms often turn into cocktail parties, movie nights, and general hangouts, but they're also the places where people dress and fix their underwear.
Related: Don't even imagine starting college while you're in a relationship
University is a tough place for introverts.
Your room should be a resting place, but many dorms develop a culture of wandering from room to room that is friendly, social, and causes lifelong friendships.
It could mean hell for someone trying to rest.
Nothing in this culture gives you permission to say "I like you and want to be friends with you, but you have to leave now so that I can regain the energy I spent in conversation with you".
Try to sense when a fellow student is tired of socializing - and maybe text instead of knocking on the door.
From knocking when the talk came: knock.
One guy in my student dorm thought that if the door wasn't locked, he had been invited in.
He saw quite a few things.
Make friends through baking.
Since you're starting college at the peak of the baking trend, knocking on people's doors with a plate of chocolates and introducing yourself seems somewhat less weird, less "welcome to the neighborhood, I baked something for you, now smile when I ask you personal questions" from a '50s.
Serving homemade treats is a great way to make friends.
Your roommates feel obligated to talk, and they may associate your face with a tasty surprise in the future.
Of course, this depends on whether you know how to bake.
Poorly mixed blobs of flour-sugar-fat are likely to make people just pretend to sleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student dormitories.
Understandably, taking someone's chicken is stealing, but what if you just take a drop of milk into your tea?
Ask and check with the owner of the milk.
It's quite possible that they'll give you permission, even if they're boiling internally.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying and you'll get my sympathy — but try to treat it more adultly than my dorm buddy who mixed his milk with detergent to punish those who stole it.
He is now in prison.
You shouldn't make noise so that people can't sleep or study.
Not just to be a decent person, but because you're like that proverbial cauldron blaming the kettle.
A girl in my hallway asked her neighbor if they could play their drum and bass music quieter because it was three o'clock in the morning and she had an exam in the morning.
The answer was to increase the volume.
When they finally fell silent at five in the morning, the girl kindly let them sleep for two hours before turning on her own music, locking her door, and leaving for a three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse happened to move into the same dorm as you?
Or, conversely, wouldn't it be incredibly embarrassing if you considered your dorm partner your future spouse, teamed up, broke up, and then saw him every day and possibly lost all your mutual friends to him.
Sure, the heart wants what it wants, but if your hot dorm partner isn't really your future spouse, you could at least try to talk sense into your lower head.
In that exhilarating moment when you realize that someone has left their keys in their unlocked room, the line between pranks and bullying is thinner than it seems.
A good prank is funny, but can be reversed in no time.
You can give a useful and fun lesson in safety by hiding something — but never clutter someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock their doors and drop the keys into a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer — but don't stick their belongings to the ceiling more than twice at most.
Racist attack on foreign students' accommodation in Kitee - A house planned as a reception centre was defaced in Salo
A racist attack was carried out on the accommodation of foreign students in Kitee, North Karelia, in the early hours of Saturday.
Contrary to what the police previously stated, this is not accommodation for underage asylum seekers, but sleeping facilities for foreign students who have been in Finland for a long time," says Heidi Luukkainen, teacher at Kitee Evangelical Folk High School.
The windows and walls of the folk high school's accommodation facilities were defaced with racist signs, such as swastikas, and a metal object had been thrown through the window of one of the accommodations, according to the Eastern Finland Police.
According to Luukkainen, who is the teacher in charge of the youth social guarantee training at the folk high school, there were approximately ten people in the vandalised building at the time of the attack.
"It was a weekend and adults are free to move, so some may have been elsewhere," Luukkainen says.
The folk high school accommodates people from 12 different nationalities.
They are students who have been in Finland for some time and recently arrived underage asylum seekers.
Everyone in the messed up building has A-status.
Some are studying in adult comprehensive school, some are in vocational studies and some are studying Finnish," Luukkainen says.
Status A is a so-called continuous residence permit, which can be granted to a foreigner who has been in Finland for some time at a time for four years at a time.
The Eastern Finland Police are investigating the attack as damage to property and a breach of domestic peace.
According to Luukkainen, a briefing on the incident was held for the students on Monday, where the necessary interpreters were also present.
There is no panic here, and no one has wanted to leave.
We have had foreign students for over a decade, and this is the first time something like this has happened', Luukkainen says.
According to Luukkainen, the mess has already been cleaned from the walls.
The perpetrators are suspected to have been at least three men and they had been travelling in a light-coloured passenger car.
I think this is the whim of a weekend evening for young people, as this topic has now surfaced.
Nothing more serious," Luukkainen says.
A hospital has also been defaced in Salo, where a reception centre is planned.
The incident took place last week.
The announcement was made by MTV on its website on Tuesday evening.
A swastika was drawn on the wall of the hospital and "You are not welcome" written in English.
The matter has been reported to the police.
Clarification 15.9. at 16.02 Corrected incorrect information given by the police about the age and status of people who lived in the target building.
State abolishes Y-train to Karis - passengers upset, 'absolutely idiotic'
The Y train from Helsinki to Karis in Raseborg will stop running in March.
The news angered passengers boarding the early evening service of the train in question at Helsinki Central Station.
The shutdown will particularly hit the people of Siuntio, said Torbjörn Bengtström, who lives in the municipality.
Absolutely idiotic, because the number of inhabitants is growing all the time and working people need a fast and smooth connection to Helsinki.
This cannot depend on anything other than political will - or lack thereof.
Bengtström says in an interview video with HSTV that he will even come to the capital by tractor.
Train changes are also taking place elsewhere in Uusimaa.
The H and R trains running on the main line will be merged into the new R line.
Purola station in Järvenpää and Nuppulinna in Tuusula will be decommissioned.
On Tuesday, the Ministry of Transport and Communications and VR published information on the routes on which the Ministry will purchase train services during the next agreement period.
The agreement period changes at the turn of the year and there are routes to be discontinued throughout the country.
The new four-year agreement, which will be finalised in the autumn, will later be approved by the Monetary Affairs Committee.
Bengtström from Siuntio believes that the state's train cutter is short-sighted.
Let's make the same mistakes that have been made in the past and repeat them in a very systematic way.
Then comes remorse.
The Y-train is also used not only by Raseborg and Siuntio residents, as it is fast and bypasses several stations.
Annina Pöyry from Espoo was saddened by the fate of those travelling further than the urban area by train.
"It's miserable for those who have to replan their trip," he said as he climbed onto the Y-train.
A little relief is in store.
There will probably be a new train connection to the coastal railway, which will replace the Y train in the Helsinki Region Transport (HSL) area, i.e. take you all the way to Kirkkonummi.
This will increase costs for HSL, i.e. in practice the municipalities in the area and their taxpayers.
"We are now starting to investigate different options and their impact on service levels and ticket prices," said HSL's CEO Suvi Rihtniemi.
It is still impossible to estimate the costs precisely.
Rihtniemi says that based on the number of passengers, HSL has paid approximately one million a year for the Y-train, although the ministry has paid much more than this.
The R line on the main line will miss two stations.
In Ainola and Saunakallio, on the other hand, the number of train services will double.
A total of 28 small stations and numerous routes will cease to exist throughout the country.
The Ministry will no longer purchase train services on the Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuruu and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Seinäjoki routes.
The Pieksämäki-Joensuu route will be shortened to Pieksämäki-Varkaus.
The number of train services will decrease on the routes Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karis, Port of Kouvola-Kotka and Kajaani-Oulu.
More than half a million journeys a year will be made on the services to be discontinued, while the total number of trips in the transport purchased by the Ministry is around nine million.
The new agreement is intended to bring annual savings of EUR 12.3 million to the state.
The value of the contract is approximately EUR 27.5 million per year.
Sixten Korkman wrote a chapter in the book The Topicality of Capital: "Marx is worth getting to know"
The crises of the world economy have brought to the surface Karl Marx (1818-1883) and his main work Capital, published between 1867 and 1894, writes Yrjö Hakanen, known as the former chairman of the Communist Party of Finland, in Marx's book The Topicality of Capital, which is published today.
"He is being taken more seriously now than it has been for a long time," Hakanen writes in his foreword.
Marx's assessments of the development, internationalization and penetration of the capitalist economy into all spheres of life, the concentration of capital, and the growing role of money capital and imaginary capital have proved to be strikingly far-sighted.
Based on the Capital seminars organised by Hakanen, the list of authors also includes Aalto University professor and respected financial expert Sixten Korkman.
In the book, Korkman writes that Marx is topical "now and forever".
Surely the former Managing Director of the Research Institute of the Finnish Economy and the Finnish Business Delegation is not a Marxist?
Not at all.
Korkman says over the phone that he does not consider Marx to be a topical economic thinker, but rather an interesting social theorist.
Today, the social sciences are differentiated and specialized, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitator, and literary connoisseur.
"The usual belief is that ideological history is about the wrong opinions of dead men," Korkman begins.
It is true that Marx's predictions went terribly wrong.
Although Marx understood the nature and significance of the Industrial Revolution, he drew too far-reaching conclusions from the early days of capitalism, Korkman reflects.
But Korkman sees value in Marx's radical attitude.
"What's more relevant about Marx is that he asked good questions," he says.
Now we are again discussing Marx's interests, such as the distribution of wealth.
"Marx can perhaps provide inspiration for those who want to understand the big picture, the changing world as a result of technological upheaval," Korkman analyses.
But what the government should decide tomorrow is of no help to Marx.
In his view, capitalism was a hopeless case that should just be stopped.
Still, Korkman thinks Marx is worth getting to know.
"In the '70s, Marx couldn't be read," Korkman says.
"Maoists and Trotskyists and other sects all hated capitalism, but even more so each other".
Today, the debate is more diverse, and Marx can also be approached without the ideological and political baggage of the past.
"Every social scientist should be familiar with Marx's way of thinking – just like any other classic," Korkman says.
UN calls for war criminals to be brought to justice in Sri Lanka
The UN is calling for the establishment of a special tribunal to investigate war crimes committed in Sri Lanka's civil war, AFP news agency reported.
A UN report on the civil war between 1983 and 2009 came out on Wednesday after a long postponement.
The report blames both the Sri Lankan armed forces and the rebels known as the Tamil Tigers for war crimes.
It is estimated that at least 100,000 people have died in Sri Lanka's civil war.
The exact number of victims is also unknown.
In particular, a major offensive by the armed forces in the final months of the long war in 2009 should be properly investigated, the UN report insists.
The report accuses Sri Lanka's armed forces of torture, abduction and systematic sexual violence, the victims of which were as likely as men as women.
According to the report, the rebels have been guilty of forcing bystanders and children to become fighters.
Both sides are guilty of murder, according to the report.
Sri Lanka responded Wednesday that it plans to conduct the investigation itself, but will not allow the establishment of a UN tribunal because of foreign judges.
In the English matriculation examination, I was able to weigh up social media
On Wednesday, it was the turn of the autumn matriculation examinations in a long foreign language, most of which was English.
More than 16,000 candidates tested their English skills.
In the experiment, you could write about the subject even from social media.
Based on our own experiences, we had to consider whether social media makes us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, an English essay of 150-250 words could be addressed to the keeper of the advice section of the online magazine.
The title was Dear Agony Aunt.
Agony Aunt corresponds to the Finnish Leelia's lounge chair.
She had to be asked for advice on how to get parents to look at things from the perspective of young people as well.
In total, there were four subjects in the subject, of which one had to be chosen.
"That was the hardest of them," says Mia Lybeck, English lecturer at Porvoo Swedish-speaking upper secondary school.
The third topic contained only a quote from former European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso.
According to Lybeck, the fourth topic was quite nice.
It had to write a firebrand speech about why companies should hire young people to work.
"At least our school has practiced speech writing," Lybeck says, grading the entire exam as "pretty normal."
In Finnish - or Swedish - the English test allowed me to answer questions about texts that discussed, for example, the adaptation of summer flounder to climate change and the processing of large data masses.
Some long Russian (168 students), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27) were also written on Wednesday.
The autumn exams will continue on Friday, when it will be the turn of another Finnish exam, i.e. Swedish or Finnish.
In upper secondary schools, the exam is held normally, which means that it is not affected by the employees' demonstration.
The Matriculation Examination Board advises candidates to find suitable transport connections in time for them to make it to the examination.
You can also get more time if you can prove that the delay was not caused by your own negligence.
A shop was robbed at gunpoint in Oulu
On Wednesday morning, a shop was robbed in Oulu in the Kello district.
According to police, the robber was dressed in dark clothing and a commando hat covering his face.
The man has a normal body and is about 30 years old.
Police said the man had threatened staff with a handgun and caught a small amount of money.
The case is being investigated as aggravated robbery.
Police prepare for tens of thousands of demonstrators arriving in Helsinki – support patrols from other parts of Finland
A demonstration against the government's austerity decisions will block the centre of Helsinki on Friday, the police predict.
According to preliminary information, up to tens of thousands of people may arrive.
Members of the unions of SAK, Akava and STTK will meet at the Railway Square at 11 a.m.
Police officers are also believed to be taking part in the demonstration.
The task of the working police officers, on the other hand, is not only to take care of emergency tasks and other police activities, but also to ensure that the giant demonstration goes smoothly.
The roads leading to the Railway Square will be closed to motor vehicles from approximately 9.30 a.m. to 2 p.m.
Only emergency vehicles are allowed into the area.
From the direction of Hakaniemi, traffic will be cut off at the Kaisaniemi roundabout, starting from Mannerheimintie in the west.
Are there enough people at the Helsinki Police Department, Superintendent Seppo Kujala?
So far, at least, it seems that enough is enough.
I do not comment on industrial action by the police.
According to Kujala, support patrols from other parts of Finland will be coming to Helsinki due to the demonstration.
The police do not give the exact number of patrols.
"There is some more to come, but as a rule, we can manage on our own," Kujala says.
The police advise people to avoid private cars in the centre of Helsinki on Friday.
Kujala estimates that the worst traffic congestion extends from the Hakaniemi level to the city centre.
Standing traffic is expected from morning until early evening.
With demonstrators arriving from other parts of Finland, many charter buses are also coming to Helsinki.
They are not allowed into the Railway Square.
As a rule, buses are quite far away.
The rest of the way you have to walk to the demonstration site," Kujala says.
The demonstration will also bring public transport in Helsinki to a halt.
From the point of view of the police, there is also a positive side to this.
The question of the flow of public transport, which is normally at hand in these large gatherings of people, will now be partly taken care of by itself.
The organisers of the demonstration have informed the police that tens of thousands of opponents of the government's economic policy may come to Helsinki.
The police expect the demonstration to proceed peacefully.
After all, the people are ordinary people who work or are unemployed - ordinary citizens.
Finns are sensible and peaceful people," Kujala says.
Local demonstrations will also be held in different parts of Finland on Friday.
Friday's demonstration is extraordinary in many ways - remember these strikes and demonstrations?
The big demonstration organised by the trade unions on Friday is interesting and exceptional in many ways.
For example, there is no very good comparison for it in Finnish political history," says Martti Siisiainen, Professor Emeritus of Sociology at the University of Jyväskylä.
As such, it is no wonder that the trade union movement is protesting.
If it did not, it would raise its hands in front of the government," Siisiainen says.
A very right-wing government has struck at the core points of the Finnish corporatism tradition – and also at points that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The government's tough grip interferes with contract law.
There are a lot of features here of actually trying to bring the trade union movement to its knees.
At the same time, the trade union movement also has a place to look in the mirror.
The mirror is needed, for example, because the trade union movement does not have the support of all wage earners for Friday's demonstrations.
What is new now is the sharp division that the demonstration will create among the crowd that the trade union movement would like to take part in the demonstration.
Unemployed people from all over Finland demonstrated at Parliament House in November 1993.
If you are looking for a comparison with Friday's demonstration, it could be a giant demonstration of the unemployed, MurrosThursday held in 1993," Siisiainen says.
MurrosThursday, organised in the midst of the deepest recession, brought together 20,000 unemployed people.
The government of Esko Aho (Centre Party) stumbles from one labour market crisis to another.
It was said that relations between the Finnish government and employee organisations had never before been as bad as during Aho's bourgeois government.
Now relations between the government and the trade union movement are perhaps even worse than they were during Transition Thursday.
Besides, Finland's toughest bourgeois government ever is in power," Siisiainen says.
The current government coalition is still interesting in such a way that it is so strictly right-wing despite the speeches of the Finns Party.
There were still certain elements of the old labour movement at the time of the crash.
Several thousand demonstrators are expected to attend on Friday.
The demonstration will also halt public transport and possibly close kindergartens and schools.
Although the demonstration does not receive the undivided support of employees, it could become the largest in years.
In recent years, approximately 300 demonstrations have been held annually in Helsinki.
There is a wide range of them.
Traditionally, Finnish trade union demonstrations have been quite peaceful – even though the operating methods have become tougher in recent years.
Traditionally, Finnish demonstrations avoid conflict and are law-abiding.
The demonstrators try to avoid damaging or destroying property," Siisiainen says.
However, the end of the 1990s brought new winds.
The culture of protest changed.
EU membership made farmers nervous about throwing eggs and the police were prepared to get pig on them.
The firefighters' strike in 1998 lasted three months.
There were also spectacular strikes by pilots and air traffic controllers, among others.
Do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
Metal and electricity strikes of the 1970s
The most significant strikes of the 1970s were the metal strike in 1971 and the power plant and electricity strike in 1977.
70,000 metalworkers took part in the metalworkers' strike.
The strike was interrupted by a proposal by the Conciliation Board after the strike lasted seven weeks.
The metalworkers received a 16 percent pay rise.
The spring 1977 power strike lasted 49 days and caused blackouts across the country.
Groundhog Thursday in 1993
On 4 November 1993, some 20,000 people, many made unemployed by the recession, gathered in front of Parliament House to demonstrate in favour of work.
Firefighters went on strike for three months in 1998
The firefighters' strike was one of the longest, if not the longest, nationwide strike of the 1990s.
Farmers opposed the EU in 1994 and 1999
Police were caught in a rain of eggs when farmers protested against the EU in 1994.
'Siberia teaches, EU stops', was one of the slogans.
For Espa, farmers dumped tons of snow.
The EU summit in Helsinki in 1999 also prompted farmers to protest and burn hay bales in front of the meeting venue.
Nurses went on strike in 1983 and 1995
The nurses went on strike for about a month in 1995.
The last time they had been on strike was in 1983.
The 1995 strike was marked by a few deaths during the strike.
Tehy threatened a strike and mass resignations of nurses in 2007.
The threat of mass resignation eventually spurred the negotiations to a conclusion.
Doctors went on strike in 2001
"Doctors on strike - out of necessity", was the slogan of striking doctors in 2001.
The strike by municipal health centre and hospital doctors lasted about five months and sparked a lively debate on how strikes can endanger patient safety.
After the strike, the public sector raised doctors' salaries.
Students on the move in 2013
Approximately 5,000 students marched for student financial aid in Helsinki from Senate Square to the Parliament House in 2013.
The National Bureau of Investigation is investigating the background of a Finnish truck full of refugees to Austrian police
The Austrian police have asked the National Bureau of Investigation for help in investigating the background of a refugee truck registered in Finland.
On Sunday, Austrian police stopped a truck carrying 42 refugees in Aisterheim, near the German border.
It is not known whether the truck was possibly on its way to Finland.
Those on board the refrigerated truck were all in good condition.
We have had exchanges of information with the Austrian police.
The investigation and the main responsibility lies with the scene in Austria," says Tero Haapala, Chief Superintendent of the National Bureau of Investigation.
At the end of August, other refugees travelling in a lorry in Austria were more fatally affected.
At that time, all 71 passengers on board apparently died by asphyxiation.
According to the Finnish Broadcasting Company, which first reported on cooperation with the Austrian police, the truck belongs to a Finnish limited liability company.
Among other things, the company operates restaurants and its CEO is a 40-year-old man with a foreign background.
Two Iraqi men have been arrested in Austria for human smuggling.
A captain beating refugees, a former drug courier and a fabulously rich businessman - the story of five smugglers
An incredibly rich king of smugglers, a violent boat driver, a style-conscious missionary and a taxi driver who considers himself a good dude.
Such people, for example, are engaged in people smuggling into the European Union.
Andrea Di Nicola, a criminologist at the University of Trento, and Giampaolo Musumeci, a journalist, have met and interviewed dozens of smugglers and their "clients", and their book The Travel Agency of Death will be published in Finnish this week.
In the book, they introduce the tentacles of human smuggling, propose solutions and introduce smugglers from different levels of business.
HS presents five of them.
I will immediately dispel their misconceptions
The Kerkenna Islands off the east coast of Tunisia do not attract foreign tourists, but many Tunisians head there for the summer.
Due to their location, the islands are also ideal for smuggling, as the Italian island of Lampedusa is only 120 km away.
For comparison: the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 kilometers.
There, in the village of El Attaya, lives Emir, a chain-burning captain and father of six children.
The Kerkenna Islands are famous for their shrimp, but it is more lucrative for a fisherman to transport people.
Emir has already done this hundreds of times with his blue, ten-metre wooden boat.
If the boat is fully loaded, it can accommodate 40 people.
For one trip, the Emir earns about 8,000 euros after expenses.
Emir has five assistants who are looking for clients for him all over Tunisia.
Customers arrive from many countries, but during the Arab Spring, a huge number of Tunisians wanted to escape the unrest.
After that, the situation calmed down until the refugee crisis flared up again.
Guests arrive from the mainland to the Kerkenna Islands in small groups.
The Emir accommodates them in empty houses for as long as he sees fit.
Food is given in such a way that customers barely survive.
Accommodation costs around 75 euros per night, and if a customer runs out of money, that's their problem.
The boat is launched at midnight with extinguished lanterns.
The first night you drive away from the islands, then stop, wait for the day and drive the next night to Lampedusa.
Sometimes the sea is rough, and in waves 20 meters high, passengers cry and vomit.
At the destination, the human cargo is unloaded in half an hour and the Emir departs for the return journey.
The emir wants to be feared.
That's why he beats his customers and at least claims to beat them to death.
He says in the book that once the police caught up with him, he threw all his passengers overboard and told them to swim to the nearest island.
"One by one, I grabbed customers by the neck and threw them overboard," Emir says in the book.
The calmest travelers come from the sub-Saharan side.
He is said to have to beat up his compatriots for this.
I will immediately dispel any illusions from them.
They must be shown immediately who is in charge here.
Just an ordinary taxi driver
Goran is an ordinary taxi driver in Bogovaða, Serbia.
His taxi is not very good - the starter engine is pulling its last and has seen its best days anyway.
However, the most important thing for Goran's customers is that the taxi moves at all, and that it moves towards the Hungarian border.
Bogovaða is a small village of 500 inhabitants, about 60 kilometers southwest of Belgrade.
Next to the village there is a centre for asylum seekers, where mainly families are admitted.
In the forests surrounding the city centre, men travelling without their families are staying in tents, lean-tos and abandoned cars, which is what everyone has managed to find or build.
The forest is also home to families who, for one reason or another, have not submitted an asylum application to Serbia.
Some also stay in private residences, but that is an open secret.
Among the forest dwellers, Goran finds most of his customers.
These are often exhausted - through the Balkans, the route requires a large number of border crossings and weeks of walking in rough terrain, often in mountainous areas and in the dark.
When they finally arrive in the Bogovaða region, a major hub for human smuggling, people are deathly tired.
Goran's passengers are mainly Syrians, Afghans, Pakistanis, Iraqis and Kurds.
The best customers are Syrians, he says in the book.
"They say it once and that's enough," Goran praises.
According to him, Africans are trying to haggle.
Goran doesn't like that.
Goofy fool fool all the way.
First, they agree on a price of, say, 300 euros, then they reduce it to 200 and finally offer 150.
Goran emphasizes that he is a nice and kind-hearted man.
I am not interested in money.
I just do my job and help people," he says in the book.
Goran says he works cheaper than others and charges only 50 euros per person for the ride to the Hungarian border.
The distance is about three hundred kilometers, most of it comfortably on the motorway.
Colleagues are reportedly asking for three or four times the price.
Goran earns around €50,000 per year.
It is not a large sum for a smuggler, but in Serbia a very comfortable annual income.
Serbia has ordered taxis not to transport migrants closer than 12 kilometres to the Hungarian border.
Goran doesn't care: he knows the roads and shortcuts and takes his rider a kilometre from the border.
Then he shows his customers the right direction and hurries away.
In the work of mercy
The 35-year-old Congolese man is called a Missionary, and it's not just a nickname.
Indeed, he has a Protestant church in Kampala, the capital of Uganda, attended by many believers who have fled Congo, and a small centre to help Congolese child refugees.
In addition to preaching, the Missionary runs a smuggling business where people are moved from Congo to Europe.
He considers himself to be doing a work of mercy.
It is important for a missionary to look good.
She polishes her shoes several times a day and makes sure that the elastic band of her white calves peeks out elegantly from under the low waist of her jeans.
The missionary is proud of his new Mercedes, SUV and three motorcycles.
When not preaching, the Missionary organizes people from Congo to Uganda and on to Europe.
First, the customer calls one of the Missionary's five phone numbers.
He advises arriving at the border in the morning, hiding the money carefully and slipping into the crowd of peddlers crossing the border.
In order to obtain asylum seeker or refugee status, Ugandan authorities must be told that they come from, for example, war zones in North Kivu and that they have been forced to flee their homes from violence.
Often this is true, but if not, the missionary arranges a new identity for the client.
The old ID will be destroyed and replaced with another one.
The missionary's contacts with the Ugandan police help with this.
After this, the client is directed to the same place where real asylum seekers go: the asylum application procedure, NGOs, and finally the UN Refugee Agency UNHCR.
The missionary knows the bureaucracy because he himself came to Uganda as a refugee.
He charges separately for each step: submitting an application to the Ugandan police costs about one hundred euros, processing documents for a humanitarian organisation about 150 euros, and moving to a European country, for example, costs 4,500-7,000 euros.
Foil and ice cubes
Tom is a novice smuggler, former drug courier.
An Irishman in his forties is on duty on the French coast in Calais, where his job is to load people onto lorries bound for Britain.
He has the help of an Afghan living in London, a French taxi driver, and dozens of truckers who may not even know they are in the human smuggling business.
At night, Tom and the taxi driver pick up their customers, usually 2-3 people, somewhere near the centre of Calais.
They drive on the A26 motorway and try to evade the police.
If the police stopped the car on the highway, Tom and the driver would go directly to jail for arranging illegal immigration.
That's not what Tom wants, he's been sitting for seven years now because of drugs.
Stopped by a taxi, Tom and his customers run across the motorway to a rest area where the drivers sleep before continuing across the Channel to Britain.
Tom chooses a suitable truck - you have to make sure it's going to England and not, say, Holland - and cuts the safety cable on the tarpaulin.
It must be done quietly so that the drivers do not wake up.
Sometimes the driver is involved in the plot, but then the hustle and bustle is more expensive.
When the route is clear, Tom wraps his customers in aluminum foil, the same kind that is wrapped around a roast or baked potato in the kitchen.
It should prevent the police thermal scanner from spotting the hiding person.
Some use a sleeping bag filled with ice for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his customers in the truck and leaves, hoping that the driver won't catch stowaways, at least not before Britain.
King of smugglers
Muammer Küçük is one of the world's most famous people smugglers.
The ultra-rich Turk has been called a marketing champion and the undisputed king of illegal landings in the Mediterranean, controlling sea routes from Turkey to EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
Küçük has been operating since the 1990s and is constantly developing new smuggling methods.
He also has a competitive advantage over other entrepreneurs: he only demands the money when it arrives.
One of the new methods is the luxury ship scam: yachts are rented from Turkish ports supposedly to take American or European families on nice tourist cruises of a few days.
In reality, the ships are loaded with Syrians, Iraqis, Kurds and Afghans, who are transported for a fee of EUR 5 000 to EUR 7 000, first by land from Istanbul to a port and then by sea to Europe.
Customers are kept in human warehouses, such as old industrial halls, until it is time for them to leave.
People are crammed into minibuses and driven somewhere along the coast.
They are told to hide among the vegetation and wait for a sign.
When it is given, it is necessary to board the ship quickly.
Passengers must remain hidden under deck all the way.
The Coast Guard can only observe how deep the ship is swimming, as there are no other signs of crowding.
Food and drink are given, but the less passengers defecate and vomit, the better.
Küçük receives approximately €53,000 for one luxury boat trip after expenses.
He doesn't take care of the practicalities himself, but hires captains, recruiters, security guards, hosts and other smaller workers to do the work for him.
During the summer season, at least hundreds of shipments are arranged and Küçük earns millions.
Through front companies, he is believed to have bought land, a pharmaceutical company and more than a hundred apartments that he rents.
In 2011, Muammer Küçük was arrested at the same time as a member of parliament from the Turkish Democratic Party and a pharmaceutical entrepreneur.
Since then, he has apparently disappeared.
Correction 16.9.2015 at 15.10: The book Travel Agency of Death will be published this week, not next week.
In her book, the American Olympic runner talks about her illness and becoming a prostitute
A new book by 1,500-meter runner Suzy Favor Hamilton, who competed three times at the Olympics, has attracted attention in the United States.
In her book, Fast Girl, Favor Hamilton talks about quitting her career and becoming a prostitute.
Sports Illustrated magazine published excerpts from the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton ended his career at the Sydney Olympics.
He came into the races in top form and ran the second best time in qualifying.
However, in the final, he panicked.
He stormed to the front right at the start and defended his lead with a manic run.
However, 150 meters before the finish, his strength was depleted.
He collapsed on the surface of the track, and other competitors passed him one after another.
I felt like an idiot and thought I would never run again.
But I forced myself over the finish line," Favor Hamilton says in his book.
It was later revealed that Favor Hamilton suffered from bipolar disorder.
His brother Dan had committed suicide a year before the Sydney Games, and he himself felt enormous pressure to succeed.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when she became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
The couple had no financial problems, but she was intrigued by the idea of getting money for having sex with strange men.
She also talked her husband into accepting his actions.
Favor Hamilton's rate was 450 euros per hour.
He says he spent the money on a life of luxury.
One of Favor Hamilton's explanations for becoming a prostitute was that she craved the same kind of adrenaline rush she had received when competing in athletics.
Favor Hamilton later found out he had bipolar disorder.
The former star runner's double life came to light in late 2012 when Smoking Gun magazine published an article about him.
Favor-Hamilton participated in the Olympic Games in Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney.
In 2000, he was world leader in the 1500 metres with a time of 3:57.40, but finished last in the Olympic final in Sydney.
World champion rejoiced when federation clamps down on Norwegian ski: "Upright"
Norway's skiing king, Petter Northug, has exceeded the bounds of propriety in the opinion of at least one of his colleagues.
Northug and the Norwegian Ski Association have been wrangling over an athlete contract all summer and autumn, just like last year.
Although the federation has offered Northug a better contract than other athletes, it hasn't been good enough for the multiple world champion and Olympic champion either.
As a result of a contract dispute, the Norwegian Ski Association decided to exclude Northug from next season's World Cup.
The decision received praise from two-time world champion Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was glad the federation clamped down on the ski rooster.
"Thank you for showing backbone," Jacobsen wrote on his Facebook profile.
"We cannot allow one active athlete to avoid working for a sponsor of the federation."
The dispute between the Norwegian Ski Association and Northug is about money.
Northug would obviously like to be part of the season with the national team so he can promote his own sponsor.
Jacobsen said he is happy to represent a federation that also cares for future generations and does not allow one athlete to go solo.
At the same time, he pointed out that the union has given Northug both financial and other privileges for several years.
I know that because I've been part of the system.
Jacobseb does not accept that one athlete has completely different rules than just because he is the best.
Northug released his own statement on Tuesday in which he assured that he wants to play sports in Norwegian colours next season at the World Cup as well as after that at the World Cup and Olympics.
Astrid Jacobsen won a total of six World Championship medals in her career, two of them gold.
He was part of the relay gold medal winning team in Falun last winter.
Frying Translators' Shield Day is also celebrated in Ostrobothnia
On Shield Day 25.9., events will be organised in various restaurants and shops that have been awarded the Frying Translators' Shield.
The aim of the day is to highlight Finland's high-level expertise in the food industry, lower the threshold for going to a restaurant and raise awareness of the significance of the shield as part of high quality.
At the same time, we would like to point out that not all high-quality restaurants are concentrated in the Helsinki metropolitan area, but top restaurants inspected and classified by an impartial operator can be found all over Finland.
The international attention the event has received is an indication of the significance of the event as part of increasing the awareness of the café restaurants and the organisation.
In Ostrobothnia, the day will be held in Vaasa at Restaurant Fondis and Kantarellis.
In Kokkola, the Shield Day is attended by the Old Town restaurant.
The event has also received significant international attention.
The decision has been made to make the event one of the organisation's most significant international events, which will be held on the same day in different parts of the world.
Finland will continue to host the event.
Kauhajoki magazine: Complaint lodged with the Chancellor of Justice concerning the establishment of the Kauhava reception centre
The Finnish Immigration Service and the Finnish Red Cross are collaborating to establish a refugee reception centre in the premises of the former Kauhava garrison currently owned by LSK Business Park Oy.
According to the complaint, critical infrastructure during the crisis is still permanently located in the area, which is used by the Finnish Defence Forces and its partner, Suomen Erillisverkot Oy.
According to a private person, locating the reception centre in the same building complex would pose a significant safety risk, which has not been taken into account in the preparation of the matter.
According to the complainant, the Finnish Defence Forces may have interests in the area of the former Air Force Academy and the airport, the impact of which has also not been investigated during the preparation of the reception centre.
The article states that for the past two years, negotiations have been taking place at Kauhava Airport regarding the organisation of flight training and the arrival of a potential foreign operator at the airport.
The matter has been discussed with, among others, Minister of Defence Jussi Niinistö (PS) and Permanent Secretary Arto Rädy from the Ministry of Defence.
A private person states to the Chancellor of Justice that the complaint is not about objecting in principle to the reception centre, but about the fact that the planned location in the former garrison area is wrong.
The Kauhava City Board discussed the reception centre issue last Monday.
Niinistö: The situation in Syria is reflected in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region
Management means that those arriving in the country and those here have the necessary conditions," Niinistö told reporters in the evening after meeting the chairmen of all parliamentary parties at his official residence in Mäntyniemi.
According to the president, concerns about managing the refugee situation united all participants.
He considers it valuable that the government and opposition parties in Finland are able to discuss fundamental issues confidentially.
Especially in these times when we have great challenges ahead of us
According to Niinistö, the situation in Syria and the actions of Russia and the United States in the region may also have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and thus in the Baltic Sea region.
Niinistö is hopeful that the dialogue will develop.
If the situation develops in a positive direction, i.e. the United States and Russia are able, it will have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and further tension on the situation in the Baltic Sea.
According to Niinistö, the NATO issue was also touched upon in the discussions.
The President did not comment on the labour market situation.
Finnair cancels 16 domestic flights on Friday, Alkot closed for a couple of hours
One flight will be cancelled already on Thursday and 15 on Friday.
A list of cancelled flights can be found on Finnair's website.
Finavia says that the aim is to take care of airport operations during the work stoppage with supervisors.
However, congestion and delays can be expected at security checks and other service points.
Demonstration closes streets in central Helsinki
The demonstration to be held on Friday will close the streets of Helsinki city centre.
According to the police, the streets leading to the Railway Square will be closed to cars between approximately 9.30 a.m. and 2 p.m.
From the direction of Mannerheimintie, cars are not allowed on Kaivokatu, Postikatu or Töölönlahdenkatu in the direction of the railway station.
From Unioninkatu in the direction of Hakaniemi, traffic will be directed to Unioninkatu at the Kaisaniemi roundabout.
According to the police, the closure period depends on the number of people participating in the demonstration.
Only emergency vehicles are allowed into the area.
Metro and tram drivers at the entire Friday demonstration
Metro and tram drivers will take part in Friday's demonstration from the beginning of morning traffic to the end of night traffic.
The Association of Tram and Metro Staff informed STT in the evening.
Most Alko stores will be closed for two hours, including post offices
Friday's demonstration will also cause disruptions to Posti's services.
Significant delays can be expected, for example, in the delivery of daily mail.
Most of Posti's service points are closed.
The blood transports of the Finnish Red Cross will be carried out despite the strike.
Efforts are also made to take care of meal deliveries, hospital deliveries and laboratory samples.
Situational information about the services is available on Posti's website.
Most of Finland's Alkos will close their doors for two hours on Friday.
Service Union PAM has instructed its employees to suspend work between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m.
Pam has also urged grocery workers to take part in the union protest.
Representatives of SOK and Kesko tell Helsingin Sanomat that supervisors will try to keep the stores open if necessary.
According to Kesko, there is no information yet on the possible closure of individual stores.
Daycare centres in Helsinki partially closed
Helsinki's daycare centres will not operate to their full extent on Friday, the Helsinki Department of Early Childhood Education and Care announces.
Due to a demonstration by trade unions, daycare may be centralised in certain daycare centres, and club activities in daycare centres and playgrounds will not be organised.
Round-the-clock daycare centres and groups for children with intellectual disabilities and multiple disabilities will remain open.
In addition, afternoon activities for mentally disabled and autistic schoolchildren will be organised normally.
The Agency for Early Childhood Education promises to provide more information on the changes in operations tomorrow.
Media researcher: Sipilä takes a big risk
According to Sipilä, diverse channels are needed in communications, and the Prime Minister's television and radio speeches are one channel among others.
Such a channel of direct speech will also be needed in the future.
This will not be the last time," Sipilä told reporters in Parliament.
Sipilä did not yet want to estimate how often the Prime Minister's television and radio speeches will become.
According to Sipilä, speeches may not always be broadcast on Yle's channels in the future.
If other channels sign up as a channel, then let's see.
This channel will now be used tonight, Sipilä said.
According to Sipilä, the state of the Finnish economy is serious to such an extent that it requires television and radio speeches to citizens.
The issue we are talking about here is quite complex and requires a longer justification.
That's why we chose this channel, Sipilä explained.
The speech will be broadcast from 21.05 to 21.20 on both TV1 and Radio Suomi.
It can also be watched on Yle Areena.
Sipilä takes a big risk
The media researcher hopes that Sipilä's televised speech does not indicate a more general introversion of the government.
Is there an attempt to take the right to define public debate more firmly into one's own hands and refuse to raise questions in public debate? ponders Professor Anu Koivunen from Stockholm University.
I am reminded of Foreign Minister (Timo) Soini's recent comment that he does not follow the media's agenda and does not let it define him.
In the interests of democratic debate and publicity, I hope that these issues are not linked.
Koivunen understands that the commercial media is indignant about Sipilä's announcement.
It would be strange if the media field did not react.
The communication styles of political decision-makers are not matters of revelation in a democracy.
By definition, the task of media representatives is to try not to take politicians' agendas as given.
According to Koivunen, televised speech is a big risk for Sipilä.
In his speech, Sipilä should bring something new and special to the table in order to meet the exceptionally high expectations set for the speech.
Is there more of what we have already heard today?
Or will they be able to speak in a different tone, in a different way, with different words, or say something new?
Koivunen says that if there will only be more of the same old stuff, one has to wonder why such a grand gesture was made and Yle gave it exceptional time.
Yle also takes a risk here in the sense that it is not a special situation but a routine speech among others.
There is a risk that Yle will be labelled as the media of politicians or Parliament and the government, which is certainly not in line with Yle's interests or general policy.
A clever bet from Sipilä
In Sipilä's upcoming speech, it is also important what the Prime Minister leaves unsaid, the media researcher emphasises.
In the evening, we need to look carefully at what Sipilä is missing and what is not," says Heikki Kuutti, Research Coordinator at the University of Jyväskylä.
According to Kuutti, a TV speech is a clever move for Sipilä, because it allows him to express his own point of view without dissenting voices.
This allows the message to reach a large audience without a journalistic filter, unlike at a press conference, where journalists can ask critical questions.
Sipilä bypasses the media and speaks directly to the people.
However, there is a risk that the media will misinterpret something from the speech, because clarifying questions cannot be asked.
According to Kuutti, it is very important how Sipilä appears on TV - whether sweat flows, whether hands tremble.
He compares Sipilä to a father figure who now tells the people what to do.
If Sipilä can present his case well, it can work.
The situation is different than if the government were to inform about something, because here it is as if a person is talking directly to another person.
This is what (US President Barack) Obama and co. do regularly.
Truly exceptional
Political scientist Erkka Railo considers the Prime Minister's speech to citizens truly exceptional.
According to him, it has not happened in decades that the prime minister speaks directly to the people.
Exceptional times require exceptional measures, Railo says.
The researcher thinks that the Prime Minister wants to make Finns sympathetic to the impending blackmail.
On Friday, employee organisations will hold a demonstration and strikes against the government's actions.
Paavo Arhinmäki, chairman of the Left Alliance, says on Twitter that Sipilä could deliver his State of the Nation address in Parliament as an announcement by the Prime Minister, in which case the speech could also be discussed.
Social Democratic Party chairman Antti Rinne (Social Democratic Party), on the other hand, announces that he will challenge Sipilä to dialogue.
Now is no time for monologues.
Almost six months after the election.
You can't hide indefinitely," Rinne wrote on Twitter.
9-year-old boy on the run has been found in Tampere
The boy was fine at the time of discovery.
THE BOY HAS BEEN FOUND AND IS FINE, the boy's father updated his Facebook page.
The Inner Finland Police Department also confirms the matter to Iltalehti.
The boy went out to play around four o'clock in the afternoon.
Later in the evening, he could not be contacted again.
Dad thanks everyone who helped him in the search.
Thank you for the dozens of contacts and observations during these hours.
The update was shared close to 15,000 times, which is an incredible balance in such a short time
Finnish UFC star disappointed by violent youth craze: You create hatred
Kurdish MMA fighter Makwan Amirkhani posted a video on Facebook appealing especially to young people with an immigrant background.
Makwan Amirkhani made a weighty speech against street fights among young people.
Born in Iran and arriving in Finland with his family at the age of five, Amirkhani has so far won both of his professional fights in MMA's most prestigious UFC series.
Amirkhani says she received a message asking her to look at an Instagram account.
The account has been uploaded with videos of young people fighting with extreme violence.
Amirkhani says he is disappointed with the youth craze.
The 26-year-old Amirkhani has more than 62,000 followers on Facebook.
Guys kick those on the ground, sit on top of someone else and hit blindly without thinking about the consequences of making videos like this.
Hard to excuse anymore
Some of the young people shown in the videos have an immigrant background.
According to Helsinki Police Chief Superintendent Jarmo Heinonen, both immigrants and native Finnish youths have uploaded fight videos to social media.
It is precisely the fact that you are fighting in the street at all.
You make life more difficult for so many other immigrants here in Finland, says Amirkhani from Turku.
Amirkhani points out that there are websites in Finland that look for crimes committed by immigrants.
There have been an outrageous number of these individual cases.
A little difficult, boys, to excuse you anymore.
You should remember that you are still in a foreign land and will be strangers here for quite a long time.
It's a little different way to say thank you for being here," Amirkhani says.
Amirkhani urges young people to remember their loved ones.
If they ever fall victim to racism, you have yourself to blame for it.
Now think a couple of times before you get involved in something like that, guys.
Amirkhani says violent action is a stakes for racism.
You create hatred in me that I don't like either.
Things are pretty bad for you anyway and you won't improve them at all, Amirkhani concludes.
SAK pledges its position on the savings package - Lyly: decisions on Monday
SAK President Lauri Lyly says on Twitter that the employees' organisation will consider its position on the alternative savings list proposed by STTK on Monday.
Lauri Lyly commented on STTK's proposal on Twitter.
Earlier on Wednesday, the Confederation of Salaried Employees STTK announced that it would present its own proposal to the Government to achieve the five per cent productivity leap demanded by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre Party).
Sture Fjäder, Chairman of Akava, believes that the Board of Directors will approve the proposal if SAK, STTK and Akava all support the proposal.
However, it would require that the largest employee organisation SAK soften its previous position.
SAK President Lauri Lyly, on the other hand, commented tersely on Twitter.
Lyly writes that the SAK bureau will discuss the matter on Monday.
According to Lyly, SAK is looking for solutions to "open the labour market lock", and that instead of coercive laws, agreements made by active parties are needed.
Lyly points out that Prime Minister Sipilä's Government's proposal for a social contract was not acceptable to SAK.
Sipilä previously broke off negotiations on a social contract when SAK refused to commit to the goal of a five per cent productivity leap.
Comment: A large demonstration threatens to collapse - "It feels a bit funny to shake your fist"
It feels a bit funny to shake your fist if you already have a settlement paper in your pocket, writes Pekka Tiinanen.
The mood in the wage-earner camp varies from one side to the other.
Is it to shout out the government or agree with it?
On Monday, the union leaders of the SAK vented holy hatred against the government of the republic.
The whole of Finland was threatened with closure.
The threat spread to the Akavalais as well.
The teachers' trade union OAJ threatened to close schools and daycare centres.
On Tuesday, OAJ cancelled: no schools or daycare centres will be completely closed.
On Wednesday, Antti Palola (Social Democratic Party), chairman of the Finnish Confederation of Salaried Employees STTK, made a conciliatory appearance.
He said that he had kept in touch with the Government and was drafting an alternative proposal for a five per cent productivity leap called for by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre Party).
Akava's chairman Sture Fjäder (Conservative Party) immediately hastened to announce that his settlement paper is already ready.
At first, there was not a single sound from the SAK office.
Chairman Lauri Lyly (Social Democratic Party) is finding it difficult to reach an agreement, as union leaders just on Monday ordered the country to stand still on Friday.
In the end, however, Lyly announced that the SAK Executive Committee would meet next Monday to discuss the situation and that SAK would look for solutions to "unlock the labour market lock".
In order for the employees to come up with a joint proposal, the SAK would have to be inclined to accept a five per cent productivity leap as a target.
It is no wonder that Palola STTK has good relations with Sipilä's Board.
Palola's right-hand man, STTK's Director of Social Engagement Jukka Ihanus, previously served as Special Adviser to Centre Party Prime Ministers Matti Vanhanen and Mari Kiviniemi.
Palola said that the Government's trade union competence has continuously improved.
Coincidence or not, but Palola's exit took some momentum away from Finland's standstillers, whose figurehead is Marko Piirainen (Social Democratic Party) from AKT.
After all, it feels a bit funny to shake your fist if you already have a settlement paper in your pocket.
Edited at 6:00 p.m.: Added information about Lyly's comments.
Russia accused Finland of being a bad host: "This must not happen again"
Sergei Naryshkin, Speaker of the Russian Duma, criticised the OSCE meeting in Helsinki.
According to Sergei Naryshkin, Speaker of the Russian Duma, Mongolia is a better OSCE host than Finland.
The autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly has begun in Mongolia's capital Ulan Bator, where Naryshkin gave extensive comments on the July anniversary meeting in Helsinki.
At that time, Finland did not allow Russian politicians on the European Union's sanctions list, such as Naryshkin, to attend the meeting - something that the President had time to remind journalists about.
In our view, this was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and the principles of open dialogue.
This must not happen again," Naryshkin said, according to the Interfax news agency.
Naryshkin's criticism was directed not only at Finland and the EU, but also at the United States, where he was also barred.
The sanctions are political suicide on the part of the EU, Naryshkin declared.
The Russian delegation was able to get to Mongolia without a hitch, so Naryshkin continued to praise Finland by praising and thanking Mongolia for its "excellent organization".
I am sure that the Parliamentary Assembly will proceed constructively and with positive results, unlike the meeting held in Helsinki in July.
The Mongolian leadership understands that there should be no obstacles to parliamentary dialogue.
Naryshkin has met Ilkka Kanerva (Conservative Party), who is chairing the meeting in Ulan Bator, and according to Russian media, has already spoken with the Russian delegation.
Lock faces a real playoff troll: "Goals tight"
Tappara and Lukko continue their bull days in Hakametsä today, as both are on fire for the second consecutive day.
Janne Lahti anticipates that there will be no actual goal celebrations in Hakametsä today.
Tappara went to Kuopio yesterday to drill a 3-2 overtime win over KalPa.
The rise was manly, as last season's silver group was at its worst from a two-goal deficit.
Lukko's Tuesday was more minor.
The spoils of the Rauma side at the Blues, who started sluggishly, were round zero points, and the deficit was also 2-3.
A tough game, goals tight, if at all they play the same kind of game as last year, Lukko striker Janne Lahti predicts the set-up on the club's website.
Tappara has become quite a playoff nightmare for Rauma residents.
In the previous two seasons, Tappara has eliminated Lukko from the finals series in the semi-finals.
Both times, a decisive seventh match has been required to be decided.
Last season, Lukko took the series to a break already in the fourth game, but Tappara rose to chest and past in the next three.
There are no major changes in the composition of the groups, except for the goalkeepers.
The cashiers who rejected both yesterday will be given a flute turn today.
With Tappara's goal, Mika Noronen makes room for Tomi Karhunen, and between the Lock posts, Rasmus Rinne replaces Ryan Zapolski.
Viewpoint: Aces has a lousy play going on
Sports Director Toivola wrote an unsuitable sequel for head coach Rautakallio, writes Santtu Silvennoinen from Tampere.
It's a classic.
In 1976, Sylvester Stallone wrote the screenplay for the film Rocky, in which he himself played the main role.
The underdog sensationally put up a fight against world heavyweight champion Apollo Creed.
Rocky gained great sympathy, although he eventually lost the title match.
Thirty years after the premiere of Rocky, Mika Toivola wrote a restless Cinderella story for Pori.
To everyone's astonishment, the nameless and wooden-handed cauldron advanced to the Finnish Championship finals in 2006.
The team was full of nameless but persistent underdogs like Rocky.
There were White Indians, Porin Matti and Pele Peltonen.
In the playoffs, players dyed their heads red and cut off the Iroquois.
Toivola became blonde.
The excellent TV commentator JP Jalo called the coach Neumann.
The Aces took the won silver.
Toivola was one of the heroes.
Screenwriter Toivola believes that this season's new work will work in the same way as it did ten years ago.
The man who works as the sports director of the Aces has built a cauldron on the bad guys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have been beating guys on the ice like Rocky pig carcasses at the slaughterhouse.
The merits of Masi Marjamäki, Mikko Viitanen, Juha Kiilholma and Matti Kuparinen lie in something other than playing hockey.
Toivola has forgotten that the main role in Rocky VI is played by Pekka Rautakallio.
Karri Kivi has christened Rautakallio Sean Connery.
In Rocky, written by Toivola, Rautakallio is as clumsy as Connery would have been in the 1976 original.
There is no Rocky in Rautakallio other than a nickname.
Rautakallio's game philosophy does not include rushing and piggybacking.
He appreciates the tough game, but it's one thing to play hard like a pig.
Last season, Garret Stafford of the Aces tackled Tappara's Jere Karjalainen in the head.
He got 2+10 minutes from the judges, but Rautakallio put him in the shower.
He didn't deserve a minute!
Only those who deserve play with us.
I don't approve of a game like that, and it doesn't belong in ace hockey," the heated Rautakallio gushed to the Satakunnan Kansa after the game.
The Aces' squad this season is strangely built.
There are juntas, veterans, police officers and uplifters.
There are practically no key men of prime playing age.
No wonder the head coach has lamented the skill shortage.
How much influence have you had on player acquisitions, Pekka Rautakallio?
The events of last season affect procurement, and unfortunately the situation in the market was quite limited, Rautakallio replied diplomatically.
Beneath the surface is smouldering.
Model year 1953 Rautakallio is reportedly interested in taking Toivola's place as sports boss.
Men's contracts expire in the spring.
The balance of the Aces in the three league matches of the season is equal to many defeats with a goal difference of 1-6.
Toivola should not have written the script for the sequel.
Olga Temonen plays Sipe Santapuk's mother
Olga Temonen reveals that if she had met her husband Tuukka as a teenager, they would have had nothing in common.
Olga Temonen is acting for the first time under the guidance of her husband.
Yes, I play the mother of a friend of my husband in the film.
In a way, it feels crazy, actress and producer Olga Temonen laughs.
She has been married to Apulanna ex-bassist and director Tuukka Temonen since 2008.
The couple has worked together a lot before, but this is Olga's first time acting under Tuukka's direction.
Olga's role in the film You made us beautiful about the early years of Apalanta is drummer Sipe Santapuk's mother Sirkka.
Sirkka cheers and supports her son, even though his father Risto (played by Lorenz Backmann) tries to be the voice of reason.
The more I get to know my real role model Sirkka, the easier it seems to get to play the role.
He's a great guy and I'm grateful to Tuukka for trusting me with the role.
Olga had already met Sirkka before the film project, but since then the two have grown much closer.
They have met, talked on the phone and texted.
Sirkka has helped a lot.
We have gone through a lot of different angles of their history.
Fortunately, Sirkka also understands that drama is drama and the truth may need to be coloured a little.
Olga emphasizes that Sirkka was almost the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that Apulanna would become the biggest band in Finland.
There was a recession in the 90's and it was really bleak.
There was quite a small probability that someone would actually succeed, but Sirkka had some intuition, and she was right.
Olga says that she had heard a lot from Tuukka about his youth even before planning a movie.
However, the parents' stories have sometimes been a bit different.
So, if you're a 15-year-old teenager, how much do parents really know what you're up to?
Olga reveals that her own youth was completely different from Tuukka, known as Heinola's notorious skater.
Olga was everyday and a kind girl who would have had nothing to do with Tuukka in the film.
At most, he could have secretly fallen in love.
According to Olga, she has collaborated so much with Tuukka over the past 10 years that she is not afraid of a big joint project.
Everything has always gone super well.
Now the entire production team will go to Heinola for a month's filming.
However, the couple living in Iitti often plans to drive home for the night due to their small children, because the distance is not too long.
We will occupy the whole of Heinola for a month.
They have welcomed us very warmly, just asking which streets and when to empty.
Iron Sky 2 became Finland's most expensive drama film
The budget of Iron Sky: The Coming Race, directed by Timo Vuorensola, is EUR 17 million.
Filming begins in October in Belgium.
Director Timo Vuorensola will start filming Iron Sky 2 in Belgium in October.
The sequel to the sci-fi film Iron Sky, Iron Sky: The Coming Race, becomes Finland's most expensive drama film of all time with a budget of 17 million euros.
Previously, the title of Finland's most expensive film has been Jalmari Helander's Big Game.
Once completed, the upcoming Angry Birds animation will also surpass Iron Sky 2, as the film has a budget of over 100 million euros.
Directed by Timo Vuorensola and produced by Tero Kaukomaa, filming will begin in October at AED Studios near Antwerp and will last for eight weeks.
Director Timo Vuorensola will leave for Belgium already next week.
A giant budget is not scary.
I've been so sickly relaxed!
I have such a relaxed feeling about the script because I know exactly what the movie should be like.
Everyone in the working group seems to realize that something unprecedented is being done.
It's great to go to Belgium.
Although time is tight, there is no fear in the ass.
I'm more excited and can't wait to show this film to the audience," he tells Iltalehti.
Originally, the budget of the film was planned to be 8-10 million, but as the script developed, the budget also increased.
The budget is big, but it's big too.
However, you could cram 100 million into a film because every angle and effect is so expensive.
Now everything is twisted so tight that there is not a single slack.
The film's production company, Iron Sky Universe, launched a crowdfunding campaign and bond with an annual interest rate of 4-8% on Wednesday.
The final interest rate will be determined by supply and demand during the promotion period.
After two years at the latest, the company will repay the loan.
The action film stars Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov.
Junt or cool?
Big logos return to shirts
Trendsetters' fronts have recently been adorned with large logos.
Not so long ago, fashion-conscious dressers avoided clear and big logos like Crocs.
Advertising a hoodie or t-shirt brand was seen as something of a rampage.
But times change.
Sportiness has become a true fashion megatrend, and so have old, well-known sports fashion brands such as Adidas and Nike risen to the crest of coolness.
And as so often before, the line between funny and trendy is blurred: if something is already really stupid, it starts to become ironic and cool.
First came the norm core trend, i.e. ordinary fashion, where trendsetters surprised by favoring basic clothes that were as boring as possible, as a way to stand out from the crowd.
Now, instead of a basic grey sweatshirt, the sweatshirt buried in the bottom of the closet with the manufacturer's logo on the front is put on.
The bigger and more traditional, the better.
In addition to logos, the recognisable striped sweatpants from Adidas, jerseys of the favorite team and New York Yankees caps have also made a comeback in streetwear.
The Calvin Klein logos on the undershirts that start to peek at the edge of the jeans are now a cool detail.
The trend seems to be shifting from sports brands to luxury brands as well.
For example, the front of Versace's autumn blouses makes it clear which brand of clothing it is.

A Russian politician published proof: I didn't get stuck in the tank door for hours!
According to allegations, the bizarre incident took place in Nizhni Tagil, where the Russia Arms Expo 2015, which showcases products of the Russian military industry, was held.
In recent days, colourful claims have circulated in Russian media that the Russian Ministry of Emergencies had to remove a large Zotov from the tank door for five hours.
Zotov has since done everything possible to deny the information.
He even posted a picture on his own public Facebook page in which he appears to peek through the hatch of an armoured vehicle in a very good mood and, at least judging by those pictures, there is no question of getting stuck or angry.
Complete nonsense.
Let's start with the fact that I did not enter the battle tank, but it was an assault tank BMP-3.
I myself am a former soldier, a lieutenant colonel, I have served in the Urals.
I went inside, looked around and came out peacefully," Zotov told Komosomolskaya Pravda.
I didn't get stuck and I certainly didn't spend five hours in that position," he said.
Zotov explained to the Russian military TV channel that he admired Russia's new technology at the show, as he himself is a former professional soldier.
That's why I was interested in what's inside the carriages, I admired our technology.
And I came out through the tailgate," he said.
I went to all the tanks.
And at the next exhibition, I will definitely visit all tanks and all assault tanks," Zotov promised.
Zotov also slammed the journalist who wrote about the matter as a fool.
One fool wrote and everyone else repeated.
There was nothing like that.
I went inside, and I came out.
I'm tall and sturdy, but nothing like being stuck in a tank somewhere happened," he told Russkaya sluzhba novostei radio.
Zotov's words are supported by the fact that not a single photograph of the alleged jamming has been published, although a total of 50,000 people visited the weapons show in a few days.
The claim that Zotov was stuck originally started with a story on Bloknot.ru, where Zotov reportedly struggled to get out of the tank door while trying and eventually threatened to shoot everyone around him if he couldn't get out of his way.
Later, the Bloknot website published a follow-up story in which the organizers of the exhibition gave their own view of what happened.
Everyone is just used to the fact that soldiers quickly jump out of armored vehicles.
But MP Zotov, due to his bulky size, simply lingered when he came out.
But he definitely didn't sit there for five hours," exhibition coordinator Aleksandr Pisarevsky told Bloknot.
Here's a favorite item for interior bloggers
The 1962 Lassen candelabra by the architect brothers Mogens (1901-87) and Flemming (1902-84) looks as if it was designed today.

The architect brothers are known to have honed the shape of the candelabra for a long time and with mathematical precision.
It was initially presented only to distinguished dinner guests of the gentlemen.
Kubus candelabras are manufactured by the family-owned company By Lassen, which maintains the design heritage of the renowned brothers.

A leak has occurred at the Kittilä mine of the Canadian-owned mining company Agnico Eagle Finland.
Purified process water from the gold mine has leaked from the so-called tailings pond into the ditch.
According to the company, measures to repair the leak have been initiated.
The pool contains neutralized tailings from the flotation process and purified process water.
Usually, the water is either pumped for reuse as process water or discharged into the environment via a surface runoff field in accordance with the permit.
The leak was estimated to be around 300 cubic metres per hour when it was detected.
According to the company, the quality of the leaked water meets the current permit conditions.
No other material spilled into the environment.
The leak was discovered during an inspection round on Monday morning.
The leak has not been found to have caused structural damage to the dam structures of the basin.
The company says it is working closely with authorities to monitor and rectify the situation.
The mine employs about six hundred permanent employees.
Danske's Kuoppamäki: IMF warns against cutting too much
Finland's country report published today by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) largely follows the views of the Government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organisation urged Finland to carry out comprehensive structural reforms in order to cope with economic problems.
According to the IMF, reducing overtime pay and paid holidays would support Finland's competitiveness.
Reforms would be needed to the entire agreement system and unemployment security.
According to Pasi Kuoppamäki, Chief Economist at Danske Bank, there is agreement on structural reforms, but there are also small differences.
The IMF's assessment contains a lot of messages sympathetic to the government's actions, but on the other hand, there are also words of warning about what should not be cut too much.
These include, for example, infrastructure investments," Kuoppamäki tells Taloussanomat.
The IMF also believes that growth projects should be implemented as quickly as possible in order to support weak economic growth.
The IMF forecasts economic growth of 0.4 per cent for Finland this year, which will accelerate to 0.9 per cent next year.
In its new business cycle forecast today, Danske forecasts that growth will be zero this year.
The IMF is a little more optimistic this year.
They may have been based on the latest observations.
This morning, Statistics Finland reported that total output had grown slightly in the summer," Kuoppamäki says.
On the other hand, less attention may have been paid to weaker industrial confidence or other so-called softer indicators.
However, the differences are only a few decimal places of one per cent.
Nintendo, recovering from death, appoints new director
Tatsumi Kimishima, who worked under Satoru Iwata, who died of cancer in July, will start working on Wednesday, Nintendo said Monday.
Iwata ran Nintendo since 2002 and was a popular and charismatic face in the gaming industry.
Iwata, for example, was responsible for launching the successful Wii console.
The choice of 65-year-old Kimisha is not a big surprise.
He was one of the names raised as possible successors to Iwata.
Kimishima is a safe choice to follow in Iwata's footsteps, Hideki Yasuda, an analyst at Ace Research, told Reuters.
Kimishima's task is seen as bringing Nintendo heavily involved in mobile games, but in a way that doesn't eat the company's bread on the traditional gaming console side.
More and more underage asylum seekers arrive in Finland alone
As early as February 2015, the Swedish Immigration Service recognised that hundreds of children who have entered the country disappear every year.
This has been reported by SVT.se and Dagens Nyheter, among others, on their websites: According to the Swedish Immigration Service, hundreds of underage applicants disappear in the country every year.
Juha Kannelmaa, Senior Officer at the Finnish Immigration Service, explains the situation in Finland and how it has changed.
Is the situation the same in Finland?
How many applicants disappear "underground" per year?- In 2013, a total of 156 asylum applications for unaccompanied minors were made in Finland.
9 of them disappeared.
In 2014, 196 similar applications were made, and 11 of them disappeared," Kannelmaa says.
The reason for the disappearance may be that the case reveals that the applicant has already been registered in another country applying the Dublin Regulation and may have been found to have reached the age of majority there.
In this case, it may be more tempting for the applicant to disappear than to continue processing the case in Finland and be returned to the country responsible for processing the application.
Correspondingly, some missing persons are also found later when they apply for asylum in another member state.
In 2014, there were a total of 3651 asylum seekers in Finland, of whom 134 applications were voided because the applicant had probably moved away from Finland, so 123 adult asylum seekers disappeared during the past year," he says.
Is the number increasing?
As of 6.9. this year, we have received a total of 586 asylum applications from unaccompanied minors.
Overall statistics on the number of underage asylum seekers who disappeared this year are not yet available, but the number of underage applicants is known and has clearly increased, which is likely to have an impact on the number of missing asylum seekers, he emphasises.
What will happen to those who have received a deportation decision?
Will they also disappear into the 'black market', for example?
This is difficult for the Finnish Immigration Service to assess, as the police are responsible for enforcing deportation decisions," Kannelmaa emphasises.
Minister of the Interior Petteri Orpo (Conservative Party) has been concerned about the growing number of unregistered immigrants to the country.
He has taken action on the matter.
On Monday, Orpo, who discussed refugee issues at a meeting of EU interior ministers, told about practical measures to control the flow of asylum seekers via Sweden to Northern Finland.
Nina Mikkonen sells Timo T.A.'s studio online - see pictures of the equipment
The equipment used by media pioneer Timo T.A. Mikkonen, who lost his ability to work due to seizures, for TV and radio productions is now for sale.
Mikkonen's spouse Nina Mikkonen sells devices on Huuto.net, which were once the most advanced professional tools in their field.
The online advertisement was first reported by the online magazine Iltamakasiini.
Today, a large number of devices have been overtaken by technological developments.
In the digital media world, television shows are no longer filmed on Betacam tapes.
Still, Nina Mikkonen is confident that there will be interested parties.
Of course, the equipment is no longer up-to-date in that way, but these will also be needed as long as there is old-generation material that needs to be digitalized.
On the other hand, there are also a lot of enthusiasts – collectors and people building their own studios, Nina Mikkonen tells IS.
The reason for the sale is that the Mikkonens are trying to move out of their current Myrskylä home.
There is no way we can take all the goods with us.
Little by little, I have started to take inventory and see what items are given up.
This is where I started," says Nina Mikkonen.
There is no longer any own use for TV and radio equipment.
After recent strokes, it is clear that a man with a long career will no longer return to working life.
Nina Mikkonen points out that only goods and equipment are now sold.
Timo T.A. Mikkonen's actual life's work was archived already in the summer at the National Audiovisual Institute, whose representatives went to pick up boxes of films and other material from Myrskylä.
Traffic threatens to stagnate worse than expected: Metro and trams may stop for the whole of Friday
Metro and tram drivers will decide today whether to extend the crackdown on Friday's protest.
The original plan was to halt metro and tram services only for the duration of the demonstration on Friday.
During the afternoon, it will be decided whether the traffic will stop for the whole day.
Chief shop steward Pekka Hirvonen says that there is a lot of uproar in the field.
Cuts in night and shift allowances are hitting drivers hard, so there is opposition to the government's plans to cut them.
Hirvonen thinks that stopping traffic for the whole day is, however, a kind of dilemma.
If the metro and trams stop on Friday, public transport in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area will be almost completely stopped.
According to VR's information, trains do not run between six in the morning and six in the evening on Friday.
There will be no commuter or long-distance traffic on Friday.
Trains departing before six in the morning are driven to the destination stations.
According to HSL's information, most buses will remain at the depot.
ACP members are absent from work from three o'clock in the morning on Friday until three o'clock on Saturday morning.
It is likely that a small number of buses can be driven, they will be driven by supervisors," says HSL Communications Officer Pirkko Repo.
Repo says that HSL cannot say exactly which bus services will run on Friday.
Employee organisations will organise a large demonstration at Helsinki Railway Square on Friday from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m.
Aftonbladet: Hungarian police use tear gas against refugees
Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tear gas.
The incident took place on the border between Hungary and Serbia, where many refugees are trying to make their way to Europe, according to the AP news agency.
According to Sky News, refugees have tried to break through the border fence.
The refugees, many of whom were women and children, fled in panic.
According to local media, the Hungarian police also used water cannons against people.
Muslim boy arrested at school in Texas - teacher mistook improvised watch for bomb
In Texas, USA, 14-year-old Ahmed Mohamed has been arrested after a teacher thought an improvised watch he brought to school was a bomb.
Mohamed told the Dallas Morning News that he just wanted to show off the proceeds of his electronics hobby.
However, one of the teachers thought the clock looked like a bomb.
The police were called, and the situation eventually ended with the boy being handcuffed to a juvenile detention cell.
Mohamed has never been found to have claimed anything other than that he had made the watch.
Still, it is still possible that the boy is accused of making a fake bomb.
Mohamed said police had determined that the watch looked like a "movie bomb".
The watch is in police custody, but it reportedly consisted of a circuit board and a digital display with wires between them.
The incident took place last Monday and Mohamed was punished with three days of forced leave from school.
His father is outraged by the incident and the country's American-Islamic Council is wondering if the incident is yet another demonstration of Islamophobia in the United States.
Britain is buzzing - Labour leader refuses to sing national anthem
In the song, God is asked to protect the queen, but Corbyn is an opponent of the monarchy.
The criticism voiced by the right-leaning press has also been echoed by MPs from Corbyn's own Labour Party.
This has hurt the people," Labour MP Kate Green said in a BBC radio interview.
Green thinks Corbyn should have joined in the song.
Yesterday's commemoration commemorated the fight of British Air Force pilots against the German Luftwaffe in 1940.
In an official statement, Labour defended Corbyn and stressed that he paid tribute to the pilots by attending the event.
We are all immensely indebted to the heroism of the Royal Air Force pilots.
He (Corbyn) stood respectfully silent during the national anthem," the statement stressed.
Corbyn's election as party leader has divided Labour.
There are those among MPs in particular who fear that he will drive away moderate voters with his radical views.
Corbyn is in favour of unilateral disarmament, an end to austerity measures and an increase in public spending.
Corbyn is due to appear in Parliament today for the first time as party leader during Prime Minister's Question Time.
Corbyn has asked the public for suggestions on what to ask Prime Minister David Cameron.
Over the weekend, Cameron took to Twitter to blast Corbyn's election as party leader.
Labour is threatening our national security, our economic security and the security of our families," the prime minister tweeted in his own account.
The cause of the Minnesota family killing still unclear - the father of the family was facing a lawsuit
South Lake Minnetonka police have been investigating a family killing in Greenwood, Minnesota, for nearly a week.
The family of five was found dead in their home on September 10, and a couple of days later, police confirmed that the shooter was the father of the family, Brian Scott Short, 45.
After shooting his wife and three children with a shotgun, Brian Short killed himself in the garage of the house.
Dead for days
The family was found after the school became concerned about the absence of the children.
Based on this report, officers went to the house for an inspection and found Short's family dead in various parts of the huge house.
According to StarTribune, it's possible the victims had been dead for days.
A million-dollar house and a successful company
The investigation into the case of South Lake Minnetonka Police Chief Michael Siitari is still ongoing.
The motive for the massacres remains unclear.
The shooter, Brian Short, was a successful entrepreneur and had made his fortune on a social media site for nurses AllNurses.com.
In a 2014 interview with StarTribune, Short said the site had four million different visitors weekly.
I have received 50 takeover bids for the company in the last ten years.
I have rejected all of them.
However, I still have a lot of ideas that I want to implement.
Maybe at some point I'll sell the company, but not yet.
The success was reflected in the fact that the Short family bought a lavish house in Greenwood for two million dollars in 2011.
The house is advertised on the real estate website Zillow as a car collector's dream: the house has not only 12 rooms, but also a garage sufficient for eight cars.
Lawsuit pending
However, according to StarTribune, a lawsuit awaited the father of the family.
Achieve Test Prep, which offers various preparation courses, had sued him over comments on the AllNurses.com website.
According to Achieve Test Prep, no defamatory comments about prep courses had been removed from Short's site, and as a result, they had lost customers to their competitors.
However, according to StarTribune, it is very unclear whether the trial would have had any significant impact on Short's business operations.
Vesku Loiri served coffee with cake
In addition, the trio of owners were awarded the Finnish Hippos Horse Owner of the Month award at the trotting event.
This is great, Loiri comments cheerfully on her honour board.
The celebrated Fabrice Duo won the Derby on the first Saturday of September and earned €100,000 for their victory.
Artist legend Loiri was still baffled by Fabrice Duo's success in a major competition.
I still do not believe that it has happened.
According to Loir, Korpi, the trainer of a successful horse, gets complete peace of mind when working with the horse.
Pekka orders and decides where the horse will be taken to compete.
And I'll keep my shut," Loiri groaned.
Stunning gesture from NHL star - "The biggest donation ever made by an athlete"
Montreal Canadiens superstar P.K. Subban has donated ten million dollars (approximately 6.7 million euros) to Montreal Children's Hospital.
According to a press release from the hospital, this is the largest single donation ever made by an athlete to a charity in Canada.
In addition, the 26-year-old Subban is committed to helping the hospital with other fundraising efforts for the next seven years.
Subban signed an eight-year, $72 million contract with the Canadiens a year ago.
Subban's donation amount is therefore significantly higher than his annual earnings of nine million dollars.
As a reward for his donation, Subban will receive a lobby area bearing his name from the hospital.
Canadiens players have helped local hospitals significantly in the past.
Long-time captain Jean Beliveau, who passed away a year ago, raised millions of dollars for the same children's hospital, among others, and Saku Koivu raised a huge sum of money for another major hospital in the city, which was used to provide the hospital with the PET scanner needed for cancer research.
In the Japanese café you can order your wife for the evening - serving the food wearing only a bikini and apron
Themed cafes are a big deal in Japan.
The market already has a goat café, a rabbit café, a vampire café, a cuddle café and now a wife café.
It hits the lonely, the sick and the hungry.
This was reported by Metro.
At the Ore no Yome café in Tokyo, you can order a wife or husband for the evening.
It is a waiter who pretends to be the client's spouse.
The "spouse" is selected from the menu before entering the café and prepares and serves the food.
The wife is greeted wearing only an apron and bikini, while the husband is wearing tight cycling shorts.
The website provides all the information about prospective wives, from height and weight to what kind of mattress they prefer to sleep on.
Soon, 150 million vehicles will be connected: Preparations for attacks on car security began
The Automotive Security Review Board (ASRB) also supports technological development and innovation in the industry, Intel said in a statement.
The Board consists of top security experts from around the world.
ASRB researchers will conduct ongoing security tests and audits to standardize best practices and design recommendations for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products.
At the same time, Intel announced the first version of cybersecurity best practices.
In the future, the company will update the report based on the results of ASRB's research.
Gartner, an international ICT research and consulting company, estimates that by 2020 approximately 150 million vehicles on the road will be connected to the grid.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road.
According to the same estimate, between 60% and 75% of these vehicles are capable of consuming, creating and sharing web-based data.
We can and must improve automotive cybersecurity," said Chris Young, president of Intel Security.
ASRB enables Intel to consolidate safety best practices and support the view that cybersecurity is an important ingredient in the design of every connected vehicle.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road, which makes the ASRB board the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world's leading innovators in computing.
Ford Focus RS costs around 52,000 euros in Finland!
Ford's Focus RS has been waiting for years like a moonrise.
Finally, the car is also starting to be on the horizon in Finland.
Ford has announced RS data now that the automotive world is all eyes on the Frankfurt Motor Show.
Thanks to its 2.3-litre, 350-horsepower engine, Ford's new all-wheel drive RS accelerates from zero to a hundred in 4.7 seconds and has a top speed of 266 kilometers per hour.
From a Finnish perspective, the price is also interesting, tentatively said to be 52,000 euros.
The car is now available for order, although when the first cars will arrive in Finland, Ford does not say in a statement.
Favorite brand Kia presented two novelties at the Frankfurt Motor Show - such is the new Sportage and Optima
From a Finnish perspective, the more important of the two novelties is certainly the new fourth-generation Sportage, with which Kia intends to grab a larger slice of the ever-growing SUV market.
Created under the leadership of new European Design Director Gregory Guillaume, the Sportage is rounder than before.
The wheelbase and external dimensions have become one centimetre here and there, and the car splits the air more efficiently.
The engine range is largely unchanged, but with the addition of a 1.6-litre turbo with 177 horsepower.
More about the Kia Sportage and its performance and consumption will be announced closer to launch.
We will have to wait a bit longer, because the new Sportage will arrive to us in spring 2016.
Even before the end of the year, the new Kia Optimas arrived in Finland.
Suddenly, the novelty doesn't seem to have changed, but it's a brand new car.
Kia plans to win the hearts of upper-middle-class buyers with even better driving characteristics, lower noise levels and higher level of equipment.
Optimises with a 1.7-litre turbodiesel and a 2.0-litre petrol engine get started.
Next summer, the pace will pick up when they are joined by the Optima GT with a 2.0-litre turbo engine.
Around the same time as it arrives, sales of the Optima station wagon begin.
Chisu returned to the stage - flaunted in a bold jumpsuit
Singer Chisu will participate in the Life for a Child concert with other Finnish stars.
The electric blue pantsuit has an eye-catching, open neckline.
The outfit beautifully showcases the singer star's graceful waist.
The ensemble is crowned with a gold metal belt and red lipstick.
During a three-year break, the singer, who became a mother, has shed the pregnancy kilos with light exercise and yoga.
Chisu's daughter will soon be a year old.
The singer released her first single from the new album in August.
Getting back on stage and getting up in front of a large audience after a long break doesn't really make me nervous.
I've missed everything related to music, the singer says.
In a couple of weeks, Chisu will release their new and fourth album called Polaris.
A new life situation has inspired me to make new songs.
At this point, I'm wondering if people will find my new album, Chisu wonders.
Kim Kardashian's maternity style amazes again - now shows breast
Reality TV beauty Kim Kardashian gives talking points one after another.
She generously shows off her pregnancy belly and bust in sexy clothes, most recently last night at one o'clock American time, when she and her sister Kourtney Kardashian left husband Kanye West's gig.
The black maternity dress is transparent at the breasts.
It reveals the skin-colored bra under the dress with flashing flashes.
The last time Kardashian wore an Amazonian maternity outfit was when she visited a friend at a dinner party in New York just a couple of days ago.
The accessory was accentuated by black over-the-knee boots.
The third special maternity outfit is as fresh as Friday last week, when it was the turn of the pregnancy belly.
The hard laws of the modeling world: No home, you're lonely, competition is terrible
Top model Manon Leloup wanted to straighten out the notion that the modeling world was pure glamour and champagne parties.
She made her own documentary film Speaking Dolls, in which Leloup and her colleagues speak out about the modeling business.
Harpeer's Bazaar magazine compiled Leloup's six hard truths from behind the scenes.
Every season starts from scratch.
Even if in the previous season you posed in outfits from top designers, the new season starts again with castings.
And every season, new, fresh faces enter the industry and compete for jobs with veterans.
Models rarely have a place to call home.
The work is a constant journey and it can take up to a year to stay in a hotel room or apartment where fashion houses house their models.
If you are very young and your mother cannot travel with you, loneliness can be unbearably difficult.
New York and Paris are desirable jobs, but they are the most stressful.
There is not just one kind of thinness.
An agent in New York might ask you to lose pounds, but in Paris they say you're too skinny.
Getting a job is a risky game all the time.
During Fashion Week, models and designers are together all the time, and at the same time act as a support network.
When fashion weeks end, the difference is wistful.
Models want to enter this industry because of the opportunities it offers, but they are gnawing at the fact that everyone thinks that work is just showing off clothes.
Models also want to be their own personalities.
The work makes the models feel like they are actors with some role.
But in the work of a model can also express oneself.
Models yesterday at the Tory Burch show.
New York is currently hosting Fashion Week, where designers will reveal their collections for next year.
Roope Salminen, who has changed his style, plays the most unknown Apulanta musician in the film
Based on the early years of the band Apulanta, Roope Salminen plays founding member Antti Lautala.
Lautala founded Apalanta in 1991 with Toni Wirtanen, but left the band in 1994.
After all, this is quite a big challenge for me, because I am a rapper who is about to turn 26, and in this film I play a 16-year-old guitarist, Salminen laughs.
I haven't wanted to meet the real Antti before filming because I want to make my own interpretation of him.
Antti is clearly the most unknown of the group, so I think it's okay that I only learn his playing style from video.
I don't want to imitate a person.
The man leading the band Roope Salminen ja Koira does not go into the role completely out of nowhere.
Punk mannerisms, according to the man, come naturally.
In the punk episode of Stars, Stars, I'm sure many people got a taste of it, as well as if they've ever been to our gigs.
Our performance has never been pretty, but we always go all out.
The main actors of the film You made us beautiful, directed by Tuukka Temonen, who played bass in Apulanna from 1993 to 2004, were announced today.
The core group of the band, which has become familiar to the audience, is played by young actors who are still relatively unknown to the general public.
Drummer Sipe Santapukki is played by Teppo Manner, vocalist Toni Wirta is played by Tatu Sinisalo and bassist Tuukka Temo by Iiro Panula.
Roope Salminen gave a tip about his future position already last night, when he mysteriously said on Snapchat that he was preparing for the most important day of his career.
Roope already posted a picture on Instagram yesterday of his new look, which he has had to create for the film.
Roope, previously seen in a mustache and chin beard, has shaved his face smoothly and dyed his brown hair black.
Psychologist advises: How to tell children about refugees
In recent days, many parents have had to think about how to tell their children about the situation of refugees trying to reach Europe.
Or is it worth telling about it at all?
There is no need to force the matter up, advises psychologist Ferdinand Garoff, a member of the crisis team of the Finnish Red Cross.
Smaller children should be protected and not, for example, let them watch the news alone.
Young children are not always able to understand what they see, and it can remain in their minds and cause anxiety, she says.
However, if a child has come across television news pictures of refugees or heard about it elsewhere, it is worth bringing it up.
It is good to have a discussion based on the child's starting point and listen carefully to what he or she is asking.
A child's fears may be surprising.
They are not necessarily the ones the parent thinks they are afraid of.
You should not frighten your child unnecessarily, even if you feel anxious and afraid.
A smaller child closely monitors the behavior of his parents.
If the parents themselves remain calm during the conversation, the child will also feel safe.
Older children are likely to encounter discussions about refugees at school, with friends or online.
It is a good idea for parents to discuss the matter with them if the child is concerned about the matter.
The fact is that not all people in the world are doing well.
Together with the children, parents can think about how our family responds to this.
After all, do we think the world is a safe or unsafe place?
Parents may also have different parenting perspectives – some may want to protect their children from anxiety where possible.
On the other hand: If difficult things are also discussed in the family, the child will get a model of how to deal with difficulties in life.
This may be useful to him in the future.

Vermo's Ball Flash Hard to Control
Perttu Pohjola was able to hone Apila's Pallosalama into a fierce strike in the middle of summer.
It only trotted wins and runners-up until the collapse of the Tampere Trotters at the end of July.
Since the stallion froze completely, the trainer suspected something was wrong and made an appointment with the vet for his protégé.
The explanation for the extinction was revealed during endoscopy.
The horse had laryngitis.
The disease was not the mildest, but it required two courses of medication to overcome it.
Since Clover's Ball Flash had to be on light exercise, Pohjola says he was positively surprised by the horse's last run.
She was the second SE mare after Taruntuuli in her record time in Turku.
Clover's Ball Flash was under a lot of pressure after the break, as it had only been able to be driven normally for a few weeks.
Considering those things, a slight bend at the end was understandable, Pohjola says.
The trainer assumes that a decent race made the stallion sharp.
The horse's tone certainly went from there, and hopefully it would have evened out as well.
Clover's Ball Flash has been one of the so-called humour horses.
When you didn't feel like it, you could throw it fat without getting sick.
On a good day, on the other hand, the stallion has lost such a lightning bolt that the opponents have been amazed.
In short-distance speed, your fellow competitors are no match for Ball Lightning, which even takes warm-blooded rides.
Pohjola hopes to run pees in Vermo.
However, it is a different matter how Clover's Ball Flash agrees to it.
It's quite difficult at the time of departure and you might even slip under the boom of the starting car and things like that.
Hopefully, the stallion would already be calmer than when he left Turku.
When fit, Clover's Ball Flash can also come from the front, and we will ride it for victory, the coach promises.
Because of this, you cannot get rid of useless iPhone apps
Apple CEO Tim Cook.
At least some of the apps that come with Apple's iPhones may be uninstalled at some point in the future — but not all of them.
Apple plans to remove some of its own apps from iPhones in the future, CEO Tim Cook said in an interview with Buzzfeed.
Apple's iPhone has a number of apps that relatively few people use: FaceTime calls, Newsstand, Health, Stocks, Podcasts, and Tips come to mind, for example.
The latest addition to these programs is the Apple Watch, which came as a must-have update for iPhones, although it is only necessary for owners of Apple's smartwatch.
According to Cook, uninstalling Apple apps is more complicated than it seems.
Some apps are linked to something else on your iPhone.
If they are removed, it could cause problems somewhere else on the phone," Cook told Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which of Apple's iPhone apps work closely with other apps.
There are other programs that do not work like this.
So with time, I think we can develop a way to let the user remove them," Cook added.
According to Cook, Apple is investigating the issue because the company doesn't want to waste memory space on users' iPhones.
Euro area inflation slowed down to 0.1 per cent in August
Euro area consumer prices rose only marginally in August, by 0.1 per cent year-on-year, Eurostat, the EU's statistical authority, said today.
The rise in prices was dragged down by fallen prices of energy.
Eurostat thus revised its preliminary estimate of 0.2 per cent a couple of weeks ago slightly downwards.
In July, the inflation rate stood at 0.2 per cent.
Core inflation fell to 0.9% in August from 1.0% in July.
Eurostat's preliminary estimate for core inflation was 1.0 per cent.
Energy in the euro area was 7.2% cheaper last month than a year ago.
In the EU-28 as a whole, average inflation was zero in August.
In July, the rise amounted to 0.1 per cent.
Among euro area countries, consumer prices rose most, or by 1.4 per cent, in Malta in August.
In Cyprus, inflation was lowest, with prices falling by 1.9%.
In Finland, inflation was 0.2 per cent negative according to the EU's Harmonised Price Index.
Euro area inflation is still stubbornly far from the European Central Bank's (ECB) target of price growth of around two per cent over the medium term.
The ECB forecasts an average inflation rate of 0.1% for the euro area this year.
Next year, the rise will pick up to 1.1 per cent, the central bank predicts in its new inflation forecasts published at the beginning of September.
The US Fed will next try to tighten monetary policy
The next recession in the United States will begin at its fastest in less than a year, but more likely within three years after the Fed, the country's central bank, starts raising interest rates again after a long time.
And in the financial markets, the downturn will begin before the next recession.
The Fed has hinted that it may begin raising interest rates as early as this week and at the latest by the end of the year.
As a result, the next recession may weigh on at its fastest by next autumn and the financial markets will fluctuate before that.
Or at least that's what will happen if the world's largest economy and financial markets act the way they used to—and if they react to the Fed's tightening of the money taps as they have done in the past.
These are the conclusions reached by Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker, strategists at Deutsche Bank's London Market Research at German bank Deutsche Bank, in their extensive study of long-term market and economic cycles.
The bank distributed a more than 60-page Long-Term Asset Return Study report to major international customers last week.
The strategists who produced the study and the report do not pretend to know exactly when the Fed will start raising interest rates or what will happen in the economy and markets after that.
Instead, they use cool facts from economic statistics and their calculations to show how the economy and markets have behaved in the past during and after the Fed's rate hikes.
In addition to historical observations, they look at which key variables in the economy and financial markets are now in the same or different pattern as they were during previous rate hikes – and what the possible consequences might be.
It becomes clear that both the economy and financial markets are now in a more shaky condition to withstand rising interest rates than at any time since the 1950s.
Maybe not even a year before the start of the recession
Throughout last summer and early fall, the Fed's monetary policy and its current stance leaders have hinted that the time is ripe to raise interest rates.
The first rate hike in more than nine years could come as early as this week.
The matter will be resolved on Wednesday and Thursday when the Fed's board of directors' so-called open market committee meets to decide on the matter for its two-day meeting.
The last time the Fed raised its key interest rate was in June 2006.
That marked the end of a two-year series of relatively regular, but small 0.25 percentage point rate hikes at a time, with which the Fed raised its interest rate from 1.25% to 5.25%.
The financial market turmoil began in 2007 with the difficulties of the riskiest housing financing in the United States, and a year later the financial crisis erupted into a global doomsday nightmare.
The Great Recession came in 2009.
Last time, severe setbacks in the financial markets and the real economy started more slowly than has typically happened after previous Fed rate hikes.
Correspondingly, the trials were tougher and harsher than at any time since the depression of the 1930s.
Deutsche's strategists have screened the ups and downs of the world's largest economies and financial market turnarounds since the 1950s and in some places since the early 1800s.
They report on the Fed's interest rate hikes and their economic and financial impact since the 1950s.
At its fastest, less than a year has passed since the first interest rate hike began, usually less than three years and an average of less than three and a half years.
The rise in financial markets has ended within a year or two of the start of the Fed's rate hikes.
Since the early 1950s, the Fed has alternately raised and lowered its key interest rate by a dozen cycles of varying lengths.
Each time has differed in some respects from the other, and the number of times examined is relatively sparse, so it is hardly possible to conclude anything definite about the effects of the next interest rate hikes.
The strategists remind us that many things are different this time.
And not just better.
Interest rates too low for too long
The decisive causes of the financial crisis, let alone the culprits, may not be unquestionably unclear, even after decades of research.
But three things about the reasons that led to the crisis and increased its destructive power are more or less undeniable:
1) In the 2000s, the Fed, the euro area ECB and other major central banks in the world kept their key interest rates too low for too long.
They patched up traces of the tech bubble, and at the same time increased the next one.
2) The already excessive amount of debt accumulated over the decades in different parts of the financial and real economy grew even larger as a result of the overly loose monetary policy of central banks.
The largest debt bubble in economic history up to that point was created.
3) In particular, the crazy cheap debt financing, which was almost unrestrained in the financial economy, inflated most sectors of the financial markets with the largest price bubbles in economic history up to that point, from equities to real estate, bonds and commodities.
Nor is there likely to be a very harsh dispute that financial markets, which have risen to heights on increasingly complex leverage, were in an unusually dangerous and volatile state when the Fed and other central banks last pushed interest rates up.
Financial structures tuned on leverage, let alone valuation bubbles, only lasted for a long time after interest rate hikes had begun and the cost of debt financing had started to rise.
The risks materialised in the form of the financial crisis, followed by the Great Recession.
Bigger bubble and more debt
Deutsche's strategists don't speculate on what will happen next, but give some food for thought by mentioning things like:
1) The Fed and other major central banks have now kept their monetary policy stance even more accommodative for even longer than before the financial crisis.
If interest rates were too low for too long before the crisis, they have now been even lower for even longer.
2) For a long time, debt has not been madly cheap as it was ten years ago, but now debt money is literally cheaper than free at its cheapest.
As a result, the debt load of the financial and real economy has not eased, but there is now a much heavier debt load in different parts of the economy than before or ever before the financial crisis.
3) Liquidity from central banks has largely remained in the financial markets, pushing key asset and asset classes to their highest levels since the peak before the financial crisis or at any time.
Not only are strategists dampening sentiment with financial market warning signs, but they also point out that even the U.S. economy has not yet recovered from the financial crisis and the heaviest recession in decades as it has done in the past.
The euro area economy has barely recovered at all.
In other words, the real economy is in an unusually weak state, but correspondingly, the pressures and risks in the financial markets are incomparably greater than before the financial crisis, when the Fed next starts tightening its money taps.
Perhaps the future picture of Albert Edwards, strategist at the French bank Societe Generale, is not as strange as it might seem.
For some time now, he has been coaching the bank's international investor clients for the Fed's next U-turns:
First the Fed raises interest rates, then the financial bubbles burst - and soon it's time for the Fed to rush to extinguish the financial fires with even bigger QE injections.
Computer and printer maker Hewlett-Packard (HP) plans to cut up to 33,000 jobs.
The majority of the reductions will be on HP's business services side, the company says.
In November, HP will split into Hewlett Packard Enterprise, which focuses on corporate sales, and HP Inc., which focuses on consumer PCs and printers.
HP reached its peak headcount in 2011 with 350,000 employees.
In October last year, the number of staff had been reduced to 302,000.
The company will book non-recurring expenses of USD 2.7 billion (approximately EUR 2.4 billion) from the arrangements.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be reduced by 25,000-30,000 employees.
On the consumer side, deductions will remain at 3300 within three years.
HP plans to move operations to low-cost countries so that 60% of its employees will be in low-cost countries in 2018.
The company says it has already balanced its business so that none of its customers are responsible for more than ten percent of its operating profit anymore.
As recently as the year before last, its three most significant customers accounted for 65 per cent of operating profit.
iOS 9: how to get the new OS on iPhone after Apple's update release
To request a new operating system, go to the Settings app, click on "General" and then select "Software Update".
If the update is complete, your phone will give you the option to download and then install it.
Some have had problems after this installation when a "Software update failed" error message has appeared on the screen.
To bypass this, it is recommended that users either wait for the worst congestion to pass or attempt an update through the iTunes program.
The phone guides the user through the final process.
This may include uninstalling apps to get space, but Apple has reduced the possibility of this by reducing the size of the update and also made the process easier with a new tool that suggests apps to remove and then reinstalls them when the update is complete.
It's a good idea to make sure your phone is charged or near the charger during the update so you don't run out of battery.
If the charge level is too low, Apple won't let the update proceed, because running out of battery could cause the update to fail.

Yle: Minister Berner has served on the board of a tax haven company
According to Yle, Minister of Transport and Communications Anne Berner (Centre Party) has served as a member of the board of a tax haven company.
According to Yle, the company's operations involve so-called tax planning.
The company in question is Saltri II LuxCo from Luxembourg, where Berner was appointed as a member of the Board of Directors in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg business register, Berner is still officially a member of the Board of Directors.
Berner herself says she submitted her resignation in May this year.
I checked and it is enough that I have submitted a notice of resignation.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that registration chains take place within the agreed schedule," Berner says in an interview with Yle.
Membership after the merger
Through the Luxembourg-based company, the holdings of the Swedish company Kährs are managed.
Kährs is a parquet manufacturer that merged with the Finnish parquet manufacturer Karelia-Upofloor in 2012.
Berner served on the Board of Directors of Karelia-Upofloor from 2010 to 2013 and, after the merger, on the Board of Directors of Kährs and the Luxembourg-based company.
According to Yle, Kährs' holdings in Luxembourg go through a multi-tiered ownership structure.
Berner tells Yle that he accepted board membership in a Luxembourg company at the request of Kährs' second largest owner.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I have been a member of the Board of Directors of Karelia-Upofloor, owned by Hartwall Capital.
The company was looking for a partner that could be found in Sweden.
This company was owned by a private equity investor with a company in Luxembourg.
I felt that it was my job to ensure that the interests of the capital of a Finnish family business were realised.
It is important that we ensure that the return on capital of our Finnish companies is taxed in Finland, and that starting point was secured in this context," Berner says.
Berner tells Yle that Hartwall Capital's holdings in the company do not involve tax planning.
According to Berner, the complex ownership structure set up in the tax haven is due to the fact that Kährs' largest owner, the private equity fund Triton, already had a Luxembourg holding company ready for its holdings.
A reception centre run by a company opens in Espoo
In Otaniemi, Espoo, the first reception centre for adult asylum seekers maintained by the company opens.
The reception centre is ready to take in the first hundred residents already today, starting at six o'clock in the evening.
The number of seats can increase to a maximum of 300-400 people within a week.
The Finnish Immigration Service will establish a reception centre in the property of the former Emergency Services College.
The operations are maintained by Luona Oy, which specialises in the production of health care and medical care services.
The City of Espoo, the Finnish Immigration Service and Luona Oy jointly agreed on the security arrangements of the centre, among other things.
STTK is preparing an alternative blackmail package for working life
STTK will start preparing an alternative package for the Government's tightening of working life.
The organisation also hopes that other employee confederations will join in.
According to Chairman Antti Palola, the focus at the moment is on Friday's demonstration.
We will then return to alternative ways of reducing the price of labour.
Everyone understands that life goes on after Friday," Palola told reporters during a break in the organization's administration meeting.
Palola estimates that the Confederation of Finnish Industries (EK), on the other hand, is not prepared for discussions.
STTK's economists have calculated that the change security included in the Government's competitiveness package will cost employers an estimated EUR 30 million, while the other half of the package is EUR 2,700 million.
I do not know whether there is an awful lot of enthusiasm on the part of the party to have a debate if there is a ratio of one to a hundred on the receiving side.
Palola: The negotiation has been constructive
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre Party) has hoped for alternative proposals by Wednesday, because then the Government is due to submit a communication on its own package to Parliament and start preparing reforms.
Palola did not comment on whether the schedule is realistic.
According to Palola, there is a dialogue with the board, and she thinks it has been constructive all along.
According to Palola, the cut in Sunday supplements, in particular, is a sore spot for the field of the Finnish Confederation of Salaried Employees STTK.
The organization demands that the government back down from mandatory legislation that would implement some of the blackmail.
According to Palola, STTK does not warm up to the idea of preparing an alternative package with the Social Democratic Party, which raised the issue.
Wage earners will gather in Helsinki on Friday to oppose the tightening of working life package presented by the Government last week.
As part of the package, pay for first sick days will be cut, overtime pay will be halved, Sunday pay will be reduced to 75% and holidays will be shortened.
STTK emphasises that the central organisations have invited wage earners to a demonstration, and the intention has not been to organise a strike.
Akava's Fjäder praises
Sture Fjäder, Chairman of Akava, praises STTK's announcement to prepare an alternative package.
According to Fjäder, STTK is now in line with Akava, as Akava has been outlining an alternative model to the government's proposals for a long time.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also be included in the alternative package, because without SAK the package will not be comprehensive enough.
Sture Fjäder, Chairman of Akava, hopes that SAK, led by Lauri Lyly, will participate in preparing a proposal as an alternative to cuts.
Antti Palola's STTK announced earlier on Wednesday that it was preparing new proposals.
We want change security and working time banks.
Akava announced on Wednesday that it has been preparing its own proposal for a long time, with which it is ready to negotiate the five per cent competitiveness jump sought by the Finnish government as an alternative to cuts.
Akava has always been ready to negotiate, and we have been writing an alternative model to the Government's proposals for a long time.
We are prepared to look at the conditions of employment as part of the agreement.
In return, we want change security and working time banks," says Chairman Sture Fjäder.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also join Akava's lines, as STTK did earlier on Wednesday.
Without the SAK, the package will not be strong enough.
Together, we are now preparing a model that will work for the government and employers," says Fjäder.
Akava's Executive Committee will meet on Thursday at 3 p.m. to make a decision on the possible content of the agreement.
"Same boat, shared coal, volunteers" - play bingo while Sipilä speaks in the evening
Green Left at the University of Tampere
Tampere University's Green Left Viva's bingo voucher for the evening.
Prime ministers have previously made exceptional speeches during the Mäntsälä rebellion and wars.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä will speak very exceptionally to the nation about the state of the Finnish economy on Yle channels on Wednesday evening at 9.05 p.m.
When looking for a similar speech by the Prime Minister, one has to go back to 1932, when Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was Prime Minister when he gave the famous radio speech that marked the beginning of the end of the Mäntsälä Rebellion.
After that, the President and ministers gave several radio speeches during the Winter War and the Continuation War.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho gave a New Year's speech instead of President Mauno Koivisto, but it was more of a ceremony.
In autumn 1976, President Urho Kekkonen ended the train workers' strike with a televised speech.
Monologue, monarchist stuff
Throughout the day, Sipilä's speech has provoked criticism and speculation about what is to come.
Paavo Arhinmäki, chairman of the Left Alliance, stated on Twitter that "Sipilä could deliver his State of the Nation address in Parliament as an announcement by the Prime Minister, in which case the speech could also be discussed".
According to Ville Niinistö of the Greens, "we have already seen monologues.
Leadership involves dialogue, listening to people.
Erkki Tuomioja of the Social Democratic Party condemned on Facebook that "monarchist stuff: the prime minister tells the people what is best for them".
Social Democratic Party chairman Antti Rinne challenged Sipilä to dialogue: "Almost six months after the elections.
Not a single appearance from the Prime Minister in the media with the opposition.
Tried is.
What is @juhasipila afraid of?
Public service
According to the Prime Minister's Office, Sipilä's speech has been pre-recorded and lasts about 15 minutes.
According to SAK, it was commented on live by SAK Chairman Lauri Lyly and EK CEO Jyri Häkämies.
Yle has been criticised for presenting Sipilä's speech.
We considered the matter and concluded that it is part of the public service task to promote publicity throughout Finland, says Ismo Silvo, Director of Publications at Yle.
Like us in the time of the Oaks
The speech has also provoked ridicule.
When evening comes, dinner is enjoyed well in advance, the children are combed and dressed in their best.
Mom puts on the prettiest kolt and dad fits the tie around his neck.
At nine o'clock we quiet down in front of the TV like we used to in the old days of Me Tammelos," writes blogger Saku Timonen.
"In his speech, will Prime Minister Sipilä also explain why there are millionaires in the Finnish government hiding their capital in tax havens who draft amnesty laws for their fellow tax evaders and at the same time tell the people that they have to cut back when the state has run out of money?" asks Pia Lohikoski.
From what Sipilä says, one guess is made by Viva, the Green Left at the University of Tampere.
It has published the following bingo on Facebook.
In the evening, will we hear about the same boat, the common coal, living on debt and team spirit?
Coupons and pens ready, at 21.05 it starts and the channels are TV1, Radio Suomi and Yle Areena.
Ahtisaari in the Guardian: Western countries reject Russia's proposal to oust al-Assad
More than three years ago, Western countries rejected Russia's offer to persuade Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to step down, President Martti Ahtisaari told the Guardian.
According to Ahtisaari, Russia's ambassador to the UN proposed a plan by which al-Assad would have stepped down elegantly after a while.
However, the West did not take up the proposal, believing that al-Assad would fall in a matter of weeks anyway.
Ahtisaari discussed the Syrian crisis in 2012 with the five permanent members of the UN Security Council.
According to Ahtisaari, Russian Ambassador Vitaly Thurkin listed a three-point plan for him in a bilateral conversation: the opposition was not to be armed, there was to be immediate communication between the opposition and al-Assad, and al-Assad's relinquishment of power had to be carried out discreetly.
I know Tshurkin.
We may not agree on everything, but we are able to discuss openly.
I told him what I was doing there and he said sit down, Martti, and I'll tell him what we need to do," Ahtisaari recalls in an interview with the Guardian.
Diplomats do not comment
Ahtisaari says he conveyed Tshurkin's message to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
Tshurkin did not confirm the content of the conversation to the newspaper, but according to Ahtisaari, there are no two words about it.
UN diplomats also declined to comment on Ahtisaari's claims, but said al-Assad's forces had already committed several massacres at that time and key opposition groups refused any deal that would have allowed him to remain in power.
Sir John Jenkins, former head of the Middle East department at the British Foreign Office, is hesitant about Ahtisaari's remarks because, in his experience, Russia was never ready to discuss al-Assad's fate.
Officially, Russia has supported al-Assad throughout the war.
The weakest point in Ahtisaari's claim is that Churkin spoke with Moscow's authorization.
If he had told me about Thurkin's speeches, I would have replied that I wanted to hear the same from President Vladimir Putin so that I could take it seriously.
According to Jenkins, even then he would have suspected that it was Putin's trick to keep power with some al-Assad supporter.
The influx of refugees our own actions
During Ahtisaari's negotiations, approximately 7,500 people had died in the Syrian crisis.
The UN estimates that the death toll exceeded 220 000 at the beginning of this year.
More than 11 million people have been forced to flee their homes as a result of the war.
We should have prevented this catastrophe.
The influx of refugees into Europe is our own doing.
I see no alternative but to take good care of these poor people.
We are now paying the bill that we caused ourselves," Ahtisaari says.
Asylum seeker hotspot to be built in Tornio
The asylum seeker hotspot planned by the Government in Northern Finland is likely to be established in Tornio.
The centre would be established in the empty Tornio Joint Lyceum building in the city centre.
The Ministry of the Interior has been looking for a suitable location to better control the flow of refugees from the Swedish border.
Helsingin Sanomat reported on Tuesday that the council had already decided to propose the school building as a spatial solution to the ministry.
According to Sauli Hyöppinen (left), Deputy Chairman of the Tornio City Council, this is not true.
When the whole council was not together and some of the group wanted an official decision, we decided to call a council meeting next Monday to decide on the matter," he explains to STT.
36 out of 43 councillors were present at the discussion.
The hotspot was opposed by 13 councillors.
Based on this, one would expect the decision to be positive, Hyöppinen says.
According to Mayor Timo Nousiainen, the city was contacted about the matter on Monday, and the matter was reacted to quickly.
The joint lyceum could accommodate an estimated 500 asylum seekers at a time.
An expert has checked that it could be suitable for such use.
The location is a couple of hundred meters from the border, so it would be functional in that sense as well, Nousiainen says.
Sipilä still hopes that the labour market will be an alternative to blackmail
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre Party), halving holiday bonuses, which has been publicised, would only take care of part of the reduction in the price of labour sought by the Government.
According to him, the Government will, however, be happy to accept an alternative package if the labour market organisations succeed in agreeing on one.
Sipilä told reporters in Parliament that he has not been in contact with labour market organisations.
He also did not know how seriously the organisations were looking for compensatory measures for the government's announced blackmail of working life.
If such an agreement is reached, we will certainly welcome it as part of an overall package.
In Sipilä's opinion, halving holiday bonuses would be a viable method, as it would target almost all wage earners, unlike, for example, the cut in Sunday bonuses planned by the Government.
Labour market organisations could agree among themselves on a cut in holiday bonuses, as they are written into collective agreements instead of legislation.
On Wednesday next week, the Government is expected to report to Parliament on the tightening of working life in the form of a government communication.
According to Sipilä, the organisations' proposals should be known before this.
Again, this is not the final deadline.
The legislative work then gets under way, which means that the train is moving and it is getting harder and harder.
There is plenty of time now.
In matters like this, it doesn't take long if you have the will, Sipilä said.
The list published by the Government last week includes, among other things, changing Epiphany and Ascension Day into unpaid holidays without reducing annual working hours.
In addition, pay for first sick days will be cut, overtime pay will be halved, Sunday pay will be reduced to 75% and holidays will be shortened.
The reforms will take the form of mandatory legislation over the trade unions, which has attracted strong criticism.
Confederations of wage earners will hold a large demonstration on Friday because of the measures, and several trade unions have declared political strikes.
Tohmajärvi council approves the expansion of the sap hall storage
The Tohmajärvi council unanimously but with some grumbling approved the expansion of Nordic Koivu Oy's hall, i.e. the sap hall warehouse.
The criticism was that the project is bigger and more expensive than originally discussed.
Also a busy schedule nasty.
It was even more surprising that the need for space was not known a year ago when the decision was made on the previous expansion.
At this stage, the expansion of the warehouse by 400-450 square meters was approved for the investment program, but the money will be decided later in connection with the interim report.
An investment of EUR 150,000–200,000 was still on the agenda, but Technical Director Erkki Ikonen said at the meeting that the price would be approximately EUR 300,000.
The investment was supported on the grounds that it would bring jobs and tax revenue to the community.
The municipality has no risk, as the company pays the investment as rent, Vesa Väistö (ps.) explained.
There is also room for the Karelian language in Joensuu
The City Board relaxed its previous tough stance on bringing street name signs in Karelian to the centre of Joensuu.
The new decision is important and right in terms of preserving the Karelian tradition throughout the region.
Joensuu does not declare itself the capital of the Karelian language, because there is no historical basis for it and the Karelian language is not an inherent part of the region's identity.
The language spoken in the Joensuu region has been more part of the Eastern Savonian dialects.
Even after the new decision, there will be no street name signs in Karelian in the city centre.
However, on a case-by-case basis, the City of Joensuu is also prepared to use the Karelian language, for example, in information boards and tourism marketing.
The City recommends the same attitude to all other operators.
Although Joensuu is officially a monolingual municipality, the use of the Karelian language should also be approached open-mindedly now that multiculturalism is alive and changing strongly in North Karelia as well.
The Karelian language is still a special feature of the region, as is the image of Joensuu as the forest capital of all of Finland.
Both of them can easily be utilised in a wide range of marketing activities in the region.
Closures of train connections cut the vitality of the region
Cuts in train connections will hit the vitality of the region hard.
Transport connections have a direct impact on the region's business life and competitiveness.
And that affects whether people can live and work here at all, Joensuu Mayor Kari Karjalainen wonders.
He also mentions air transport, the continuation of which has also been under consideration several times.
It is important for the entire county that our chances of succeeding are not reduced by government measures, as is currently happening.
We should look at the effects of the closure of these transport connections on employment, for example," Karjalainen emphasises.
The deterioration of transport connections poses an additional challenge to the University of Eastern Finland in terms of attractiveness.
Of course, the better the services here, such as transport connections and the housing situation, the easier it is to get students and employees, says Jukka Mönkkönen, Rector of the University of Eastern Finland.
He points out that poor transport connections also affect the research community, which is very mobile and travels a lot for research.
Recruitment Manager Marko Junkkarinen says that marketing the university towards Western Finland is already difficult, because the transport connections are poor in the transverse direction.
Currently, about half of the students at the University of Eastern Finland come from outside Eastern Finland.
About 10–20 per cent of them are from Uusimaa, which is partly explained by a direct train connection.
There was one gravel sound from Joensuu for Siun sote
The Joensuu City Board's view of the provincial Siun sote project is seemingly unanimous, but there is also one gravel voice.
City Board member Pentti Keskisalo (Social Democratic Party, pictured) proposed at Monday's board meeting that the entire project be abandoned, but his proposal lapsed as unprofitable.
The Board approved Mayor Kari Karjalainen's proposal for a decision, which will be revised at the beginning of October before the City Council meeting, which will issue a final statement on the project at the same time as all other municipalities.
One train service from Kotka to Kouvola will end next year
Passenger train services from Kotka to Kouvola will remain in the future, although one pair of trains will be less frequent.
There will be changes to passenger train services between Kotka and Kouvola next March.
One pair of train services will be discontinued, but you can still get from Kotka to Kouvola five times a day and vice versa.
The reductions are due to government austerity measures.
The Ministry of Transport and Communications' purchase appropriations for rail transport will decrease by EUR 12.3 million for the next four-year period.
The quietest routes will be discontinued altogether.
VR will draw up new timetables by the end of the year.
They will enter into force on 27.3.2016.
The boys climbed onto the roof, one couldn't get down, the guys slipped away
The rescue department released a 12-year-old who had climbed onto the roof and was unable to get down from the roof on his own.
The situation arose in Tornionmäki on Ketotie at half past six on Tuesday evening.
There is an old two-storey wooden house with no ladder leading to the roof.
That did not stop the group of boys, who decided to climb onto the roof of the house along the mast of radio amateurs next to it.
The other boys made it down the same route, but one did not.
As a result, others slipped away from the scene and passers-by alerted the rescue department to help the last person left on the roof safely back to the ground with a pull ladder.
FedEx operating profit mixed, lowers outlook for fiscal year 2016
FedEx reported depressing results for its latest quarter, and the delivery giant cut its full-year profit forecast due to weaker demand for cargo services and higher costs for its ground services.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
Meanwhile, last year, FedEx announced it was hiring 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
Its stock fell about 2.5 percent in the opening auction 45 minutes before Wednesday's opening bell.
FedEx Corp. says it expects earnings of $10.40 to $10.90 for the tax year ending next May, which is 20 cents lower than its previous forecast.
Analysts were expecting $10.84, according to a FactSet poll.
The smaller outlook came despite the average price increases of 4.9% that will take effect on January 4 and despite higher surcharges for ground transportation of heavy or large parcels that began in November.
The company said it expects operating profit to continue to grow from the previous year as they have cut costs, revenue has increased and e-commerce is on the rise.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company was "performing solidly considering weaker-than-expected economic conditions, especially in production and global trade."
Plans to hire for the holiday were announced a day after rival UPS said it plans to hire 90 to 95,000 extra workers, about the same number it hired last year.
In the quarter ended August 31, FedEx posted earnings of $692 million, up 6 percent from last year.
Profit per share came in at $2.42, falling short of the average forecast of $2.44. The survey of 12 analysts was conducted by Zacks Investment Research.
Revenue rose 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
In the Zacks poll, six analysts were expecting $12.23 billion.
FedEx has suffered from a decline in international priority transportation in recent years, which has halted the development of revenue for its Express unit.
However, the rise of e-commerce has improved FedEx Ground's bottom line.
In the latest quarter, the net sales of the country unit increased by 29 percent, but the revenue from operations was basically the same due to the expensive costs of larger packages and own insurance.
Express revenues were better due to higher basic charges, while operating profit in freight was reduced by higher labor costs.
In the opening auction about an hour before the opening bell, FedEx shares fell $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
FedEx closed Tuesday down 11 percent for this year and 17 percent below the June 11 record.
Federal Reserve policymakers will sit around a huge mahogany table for two days this week in a long-awaited meeting to decide whether the time has come to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
At one end of the central bank's ornate, two-story meeting room is a mural from the United States.
The map is a reminder that Federal Reserve Chairman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues must put the nation's economic interests above all else.
Congress has placed a dual responsibility on the central bank: to maximize U.S. employment and keep prices stable.
Since the Great Depression, however, central bank governors have accepted that there is also a third, unwritten mandate: economic stability.
It is this third requirement that could be the decisive factor in the decision to be announced on Thursday, which will be so strict that it cannot even be predicted. A decision on whether the U.S. economy is ready to wean itself off the record-breaking stimulus provided by short-term interest rates that have remained close to zero since late 2008.
While most of the data points to steady economic growth, the recent turmoil in global financial markets may have made already wary central bank officials even more frightened when it comes to increasing volatility. There are fears about what would happen if the federal funds rate reference value were raised by even a quarter of a percentage point.
"Understandably, the labor market and inflation are the first and most important issues to monitor," says Lindsey M. Piegza, chief financial adviser at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus &; Co.
"However, I believe that if they are looking for justification for leaving interest rates unchanged, the increased uncertainty in global markets is a valid enough reason to wait," he says.
There is no consensus on the Central Bank's decision, which in itself creates nervousness in the economy.
According to a recent Bloomberg survey, about half of economic experts predict that interest rates will rise this week.
Financial markets, on the other hand, expect the central bank to delay the hike, as a key indicator indicates that the potential for growth is only about 30 per cent.
This suggests a fall in the stock market if the central bank raises the level, unless policymakers manage to soften the blow by promising that the next hike will not happen anytime soon.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 228.89 points, or 1.4 percent, to a new figure of 16,599.85.
The recovery came with the expectation that the central bank will keep levels unchanged this week, according to John Lonski, chief economic adviser at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It's surprising if the central bank is raising interest rates right now," he says.
If policymakers raise interest rates, "they will have to go to great lengths to support financial markets so they don't panic."
Other experts argue that the elevated level would calm financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about when the central bank will act.
Just a month ago, it appeared that the central bank was about to raise interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point this month, thus taking the first small step towards a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would ensure the stability of the US recovery.
Yellen has stated in the spring and early summer that she expects the level to rise this year, despite Liberals calling for more economic development in their complaints.
Although job creation slowed in August, labour market growth has been steady this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest figure in seven years and close to what the central bank considers the threshold for full employment.
Wage growth has shown signs of recovery.
Although inflation is still below the central bank's 2% annual target, central bank policymakers say the main reason for this is the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "can cope with higher interest rates and needs them given the tight conditions of the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economic adviser at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, financial markets around the world were shaken last week when China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell as much as 16 percent from its May record as investors feared China's slowing economy would also slow global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, and the Dow is now nearly 10 percent below its May high.
For central bank policymakers, market turmoil is an additional factor in the complex equation of when interest rates should be raised.
"Without these financial market events and recent weeks' coverage of China's economic weakness, policymakers would tighten levels at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, a senior investigator at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former central bank official.
Now, he predicts policymakers will wait at least a month to get a better understanding of the impact.
"The potential impact on the U.S. economy is still very unclear, and they don't have much data at their disposal regarding the consequences of what happened in China," Oliner said.
The well-being of the international economy is not one of the main concerns of the Central Bank, therefore, in principle, it should not influence decision-making.
However, in practice, the Federal Central Bank has become the world's monetary authority.
In recent years, the influence of the Central Bank has been enormous.
In 2013, the hint by then-chairman Ben S. Bernanke that the central bank could "narrow" the increase in the money supply caused upheaval in markets around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, central bank officials are expected not only to monitor developments elsewhere, but also to consult other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
The central bank's decision-making process is "more of an art than a science," said Zachary Karabell, head of global strategy at asset management firm Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank in Richmond, Virginia, noted this month that "the central bank has overreacted in the past to financial market movements that appear to be disconnected from economic fundamentals."
The Federal Open Market Committee, which makes decisions, has called for an interest rate increase, and Lacker, a voting member of the committee, cites the 1998-99 decisions as an example.
The Asian financial crisis caused the central bank to cut its reference value by 0.75 percentage points over three meetings "despite its limited, identifiable effects on U.S. economic growth," Lacker said.
A year later, the central bank reversed these cuts.
The central bank should only prioritise financial stability during a major crisis, such as when the markets crashed in 2008, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England's interest rate setting committee.
The latest turmoil is nowhere near that level, Posen says.
"No one wants to be in a situation where they are afraid of raising interest rates because the markets are upset," said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains a dual requirement and makes no mention of financial stability. As long as this is the case, I do not think they should anticipate it.

The Brazilian Pediatric Organization in Rio Grande promotes a healthy diet for breastfeeding
The Brazilian Pediatric Organization (SPRS) has come up with a shocking way to try to make women understand the importance of good nutrition during breastfeeding by posting pictures of babies sucking breasts painted with descriptions of unhealthy food.
Breast milk consists of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, which provide babies with all the necessary nutrients for the development of a strong immune system.
Pregnant women and new mothers need extra energy, so they are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories.
However, a new study suggests that increasing calorie intake isn't the only dietary change mothers should make.
A recent study led by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, revealed that a healthy diet for pregnant women actually affects the genetic expression of their babies and protects them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet was found to negatively affect the child's immune system.
Seven's Sunrise show is a favorite in terms of viewership, despite Nine's attempts to cover the executive reveal on the Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson's rush to Canberra to cover the aftermath of the Liberal Party leader revelation failed to boost Today's viewership.
Nine's morning show was broadcast from the nation's capital after Malcolm Turnbull overthrew Tony Abbott.
Rival show Sunrise, hosted by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was stuck in London as part of its week-long series of international broadcasts that also cover Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
The weight of distance didn't seem to bother Australian TV viewers, as Sunrise's average viewership in five state capitals was 397,000, compared to 339,000 today.
Today's average increased slightly compared to Monday's (317,000) and last Tuesday's (283,000) figures, but it was still lower than last Thursday's (343,000).
Today has been catching up with Sunrise over the past few months.
In August, Today's average was 318,000 and Sunrise's was 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference varied between 40,000 and 50,000 viewers.
So far in September, Sunrise's average is 349,000 viewers, compared to 314,000 for Today.
This is the most interesting event of the whole morning.
The winds of change are blowing this morning not only in Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are doing well, thanks for asking!

The big news for Seven was the amazing premiere of 800 Words, featuring former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
The new drama series, which garnered quite an impressive average of 1,219 million viewers, tells the story of a recently widowed father who decides to move to the coast of New Zealand with his two children.
Critics have wondered if Thomson will be the driving force behind the popular series alone without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's results gave this real certainty.
Seven's show The X Factor was a strong favourite with 1.136 million viewers, easily winning The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
The Seven channel had a double fate on the second night of The Chase Australia.
The first half-hour (17-17.30) of the new quiz show hosted by Andrew O'Keefe attracted an average of 446,000 viewers.
The second half-hour (5:30-6 p.m.) soared to 623,000 spectators — enough for a small win over Eddie McGuire's Hot Seat program (613,000).
On Monday night, The Chase Australia averaged 520,000 viewers for the first half-hour, and a whopping 720,000 for the second half-hour.
The average for a Hot Seat was 620,000.
The drop in viewership on The Chase Australia's second night average gives Nine confidence that Hot Seat will eventually become the most popular show at 5.30pm.
The Chase Australia replaced Million Dollar Minute, which failed to reduce viewership of McGuire's show.

The finals trio agree dad Sam Wood is the perfect guy — but who will he choose?
The secret has been revealed? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay, and Snezana Markoski may have accidentally revealed who would win The Bachelor.
The identity of the woman Sam Wood ends up with on The Bachelor has been kept extremely secret.
The three remaining girls don't really slip who got the last rose.
However, when we spoke with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before the three became two, they may have unwittingly hinted at the identity of the winner.
Sam Wood's lips are sealed ahead of Thursday's final
All three women threw themselves into poetry as they explained how Wood is the perfect man, citing his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positivity as reasons why they would want to be his partner.
However, when asked "If Wood's Last Rose isn't for you, who should it go to?", their answers may have offered a revelation about who won the bachelor's heart.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski were quick to cite Mackay as the best option for Wood after themselves.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood's relationship has been straightforward since day one.
"From the moment I walked into the house, (Sarah's) energies and Sam's energies felt quite compatible, and that thought was on my mind throughout the series," Jeavons-Fellows said.
"Sarah is really down to earth, it's fun to be around her," Markoski added.
I've seen them together and there's chemistry between them.
They seem to be having a nice and relaxed time together.
Sarah Mackay believes she and Sam Wood would be a good match.
Mackay said last week's home visit meetings made him realize Wood could be "the one."
"When I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this is clearly not just a game — I'm now wholeheartedly involved in this," she said.
When asked who Wood should choose, if not him, Mackay was enigmatic.
"I don't know if I can say," he said.
I like the remaining girls just as much, so it's a draw between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be broadcast on Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. on the Ten channel.

Jarryd Hayne has many options where to start his NFL career
Detroit and Seattle were both quite interested after he moved to the United States, and many other teams have been asking about him since his impressive open practice day late last year.
However, Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers team and coach Jim Tomsula, and this seems to have been a wise decision.
Some coaches would have left Hayne on the bench for the rest of the game after the Australian rugby league convert dropped the ball in his first aerial kick return in the team's 20-3 win over Minnesota on Tuesday.
But Tomsula trusted her husband and allowed Hayne to return the next fly kick, as well as including him in the running game after Reggie Bush's injury.
Tomsula's true nature was also evident in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of barking at his newcomers as a baton shark in front of the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne in the post-game press conference.
49ers special reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by special teams coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget the dropped ball and worry about the next game.
Jarryd Hayne dropped a fly kick that the Minnesota Vikings grabbed in the first quarter of play
This certainly wasn't the start that Hayne and his numerous Australian fans were hoping for his NFL debut.
Hayne was seen swearing on his way off the field after being knocked off, and later told Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM on frequency 104.1 that he couldn't have imagined a worse start to his NFL career.
"That was just one of those things, you just have to think about the next game and that's it," Hayne said.
Hayne compared his fumbling to his 2007 Origin debut when a pass in his own goal area led to a Queensland goal.
Overall, it was still an awesome experience for this 27-year-old.
After the game, Hayne posed for a photo posted on his Instagram account with fans holding the Australian flag.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Russia's richest man, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested at gunpoint on a Siberian runway.
Khodorkovsky had openly questioned President Vladimir Putin, so he was convicted, his oil company Yukos confiscated, and his efforts to support democracy were curtailed.
4 killed when police fired rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, died in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets into a crowd protesting against the country's new draft constitution, an official said Wednesday.
The violence took place Tuesday night in the Rupandeh district, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, a senior official in the area, said more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside the police station, some of whom were throwing stones and incendiary bombs.
Dhakal said police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resorting to rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, known to have killed but traditionally used as a less dangerous alternative, appeared to have caused so many deaths.
The clash was the latest in weeks of violent protests across Nepal's southern plains, where members of an ethnic group called Madhesi say the new provinces established under the proposed new constitution will weaken their political influence.
There have also been protests in western Nepal as the Haarus group demands its own state.
Since 10 August, violent clashes have killed at least 40 people, including 11 police officers.
At that time, the four main parties signed an agreement dividing the country into provinces - a big step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has had a central government for centuries.
A new constitution has been planned since 2008, but lawmakers accelerated the process after April's devastating earthquake killed thousands of people.
Lawmakers have voted this week on clauses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu, and officials have said the new charter could be adopted by Sunday.
The U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) says there's a 60 percent chance of a hurricane south of Cape Verde
The broad low-pressure front, located about 560 km south of the southernmost point of the Cape Verde archipelago, has a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said Tuesday.
Another well-defined low-pressure front, located halfway between the Cape Verde archipelago and the Lesser Antilles, also has a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical cyclone over the next two days, the Miami-based weather forecasting center added.
Google launches donation campaign to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGLE. O) launched a donation campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations helping thousands of refugees in Europe flee war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google had an exceptionally personal perspective when it launched the donation campaign on its blog.
Instead of the announcement being made by the manager, Google employee Rita Masoud, who fled Kabul with her family at the age of seven, wrote about her own personal experience.
"Our journey included numerous dark train and bus journeys, as well as hunger, thirst, cold, and darkness," he wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and migration crisis in Europe has grown, people like my family are desperate to help.
Donations go to four non-profit organizations that help refugees and migrants: Médecins Sans Frontières, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said it will match every donation made globally google.com/refugeerelief-sivustolla up to $5.5 million, bringing the total goal to $11 million.
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War, mainly due to four years of civil war in Syria, which has driven more than 4 million people from their homes this year.
Many are also fleeing war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Bariatric surgery can help mildly obese diabetics
According to a new study, the benefits of bariatric surgery for mildly obese type 2 diabetics can last at least five years.
However, it is still too early to say whether these mildly obese diabetics will live longer after bariatric surgery than those treated with other methods than surgery.
"It takes a long time to get mortality data," Dr. Robin Blackstone notes. She is a bariatric surgery expert who wrote an editorial for a new study in the journal JAMA Surgery.
Bariatric surgery uses different methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce the feeling of hunger and limit the absorption of food.
Over the years, bariatric surgeries have been found to be effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but most of the people in the study have been morbidly obese, with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or more.
BMI, or the ratio of weight to height, is considered normal when it is between 18.5 and 24.9.
If the BMI is above 25, it indicates that someone is overweight, and if the person's BMI is over 30, they are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For this new study, researchers at Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used data collected since 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery, gastric bypass surgery and gastric reduction, with medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were mildly obese.
The study showed that the average BMI of people undergoing surgery dropped from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year.
At the same time, the BMI of people treated with means other than surgery remained roughly the same at 29.
In 36% of the operated individuals, diabetes was completely cured and 28% partially cured.
In comparison, in the medically treated group, diabetes was completely cured by only 1 percent and partially by about 2 percent.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides, as well as the "bad" LDL cholestor "were generally better in the surgical group," the authors noted.
The researchers also tracked patients' blood hemoglobin A1c levels, which mirror blood sugar levels over time.
Hemoglobin A1c should remain below 7 percent, the researchers write.
Postoperative hemoglobin A1c levels dropped from about 9% to about 6%.
However, in the drug treatment group, it remained stable at around 8%.
However, this improved "glycemic control," as described by improved hemoglobin A1c levels, did not reduce mortality over five years, said lead investigator Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues.
The research team also compared average results between two different types of surgery.
At year five, when compared with the gastric reduction group, the gastric bypass group had lost more weight (18.7 and 14.2 kg, respectively), decreased their BMI more (7.4 and 5.1), decreased their haemoglobin A1c levels more (3.1 percent and 2.1 percent, respectively), and was more likely to achieve complete diabetes remission (46.9 percent and 16.7 percent, respectively).
Blackstone of the University of Arizona's College of Medicine-Phoenix says that while the study shows no survival or surgery after five years, there are research findings from Sweden where surgery resulted in longer lives in heavier people.
A Swedish study found that obese people who underwent bariatric surgery were 29 percent less likely to die over a 15-year period when compared to a group that had tried more traditional treatments.
While the new study shows no improvement in survival among patients undergoing surgery, Blackstone says the results are nonetheless encouraging for individuals with BMI below 35 who are interested in surgery.
"The results of the study are crucial precisely because they show that surgery is safe for the lower BMI group," and is not associated with an increased risk of death or kidney disease, he says.
Blackstone adds that both patients and their doctors should take weight very seriously when the patient's BMI is between 27 and 30.
"I think we're waiting too long before we take this seriously," he says.
I believe that once a person has accumulated these genetic changes that permanently prepare his body for obesity and diabetes, it will be very difficult to reverse the situation.
"Not everyone can come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
The Dalai Lama has said that Europe cannot accept all refugees, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The leader of Tibetan Buddhism has called for an end to violence in the refugees' homelands.
The Dalai Lama addressed the ongoing refugee crisis in a speech he gave at the opening ceremony of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford at the start of his ten-day visit to Britain. The center is dedicated to the study of ethics.
The Dalai Lama argued that in the current situation, the needs of all mankind should take precedence over individual nations or even continents.
He also stressed that while the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admirable, it is also inadequate.
"Not everyone can come to Europe," he said in his speech.
While praising the actions of Germany and Austria in the crisis, the Dalai Lama stressed that this was only a temporary solution.
"It is wonderful to take care of several thousand refugees, but in the meantime we have to think about long-term solutions: how to bring real peace and real development to these Muslim countries, mainly through education.
The bottom line is to think about how we can reduce killing in their countries.
We must reduce the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
Addressing the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, arguing that the violent response of the United States caused a chain of violent events.
"After 9/11, I sent a letter expressing my condolences to President Bush and telling him that the solution to this problem lies in nonviolence.
I know his motives were good, but he used force and it created unexpected consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
In the last four years, children's swallowing of hand sanitizer has increased fourfold
Poison control centers across the U.S. have reported a nearly 400 percent increase in ingestion of highly alcoholic hand sanitizer in children under the age of 12 since 2010, according to the Georgia Poison Information Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Information Center, cases of disinfectant ingestion reported to poison control centers in children under the age of 12 rose from 3266 in 2010 to 16117 in 2014.
"Children are more interested in these products and, unfortunately, a certain percentage of them end up in the emergency room," Lopez told CNN.
She said some kids drink disinfectant on purpose, while some want to impress their friends or take up a challenge on social media.
There are videos on YouTube of teenagers drinking disinfectant to get a cheap hop.
According to reports, teens have mixed disinfectant with alcoholic mouthwash to get a stronger drink.
Pleasant smells of disinfectant can attract younger children.
"The kid doesn't think this is bad for him," Lopez said.
Many of the more interesting (hand sanitizers) are ones with added fragrance.
There are strawberry, grape and orange scented disinfectants that are very attractive to children.
Hand sanitizer can contain anything between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in young children, alcohol poisoning requires only a few injections.
"It's really concentrated alcohol," Dr. Stephen Thornton, director of nursing at the University of Kansas Hospital's Poison Information Center, told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
So don't leave a shot of whiskey lying on the table, but leave hand sanitizer in plain sight, and if kids are interested in it, it's a quick way to drink a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell is a six-year-old girl who recently swallowed just four injections of strawberry-scented hand sanitizer at school and was taken to the emergency room for treatment.
Her blood alcohol level was .179, which is twice as high as the limit for adult drunk driving, said Chris Ritchey, an emergency room physician who treated the girl at Gwinnet Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah became mossy as he spoke and was unable to walk when he arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight at a separate children's hospital for possible brain injury symptoms, as alcohol caused the girl to fall and hit her head, Ritchey said.
"It was really scary," Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, told CNN.
The situation could have been deadly for my child.
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products or disinfectant wipes and move the disinfectant out of the reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants have been linked to deaths.
In 2013, two Ontario women died after ingesting hand sanitizer containing a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Health officials assume the product contained methanol, a deadly substance, and not ethyl alcohol, which was declared as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-graders in upstate New York planned to poison their "nasty" teacher by spreading a bactericide in a classroom, according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to hand sanitizer and banned it from her class.
Police consider the preventive plan an "idle nonsense" and leave disciplinary action to the school district.
Rumour mill: No controversy at Celtic
Griffiths downplays talk of Celtic's controversy, and Deila admits Hoops are in a tight spot, but she makes it turn
Hearts are battling the Scottish Football Association over Neilson's charges, and Warburton is wary of January signings that could disrupt team unity
Dons extended lead over Celtic to five points
Adam Rooney's first-half penalty took Aberdeen to a narrow win over Hamilton at the Pittodrie Stadium and allowed the team to increase the gap to Celtic to five points.
Griffiths downplays talk of contradictions
There have been rumours of internal conflicts at Celtic, but Griffiths immediately ignored them. He claims that he and his teammates have absolutely no sense of working under closer scrutiny as the team prepares to face the Dutch league leader.
I don't think we're under pressure, I think the players are waiting for the encounter.
Lack of Scottish championship bores Dutch - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Netherlands international Ronald de Boer has said Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic as they have no title competition with Rangers.
De Boer, the current Ajax ambassador, said: "Holland no longer shows highlights of Celtic games and why?"
Because the Rangers are not involved.
People here can't just talk about the return of Rangers.
They talk about Old Firm teams.
They talk about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
There is a lot of tension in the games of these teams and it is also non-Scots who want to watch those games.
Deila vows to turn the situation around
Ronny Deila has admitted that Celtic are in trouble, but the Norwegian boss has vowed to turn the situation around.
The defeat to Malmö and the consequent relegation from the Champions League were quickly followed by a defeat to Aberdeen, who played with ten men, who are now at the top of the table with a five-point gap to the next.
However, Deila said: "Celtic have had bad periods in the past and we will rise again."
Now we just want to get out of this situation as quickly as possible.
I know this is frustrating and that a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what's going on.
So are we, but we must continue.
We really need supporters because it improves the performance of the players.
Now it's important to stick together.
Warburton wary of January transfers
Although Rangers boss Mark Warburton just a few weeks ago commented on potential January transfer targets, he is wary of a recruitment frenzy, insisting he doesn't want to mess with the consensus of the squad.
The former Brentford boss said: "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
For players coming in the summer, the adjustment period is the entire pre-season period, which is reflected in our team this season.
The team is doing really well.
Sometimes adding unnecessary players can do more harm.
Celtic interest Michu hints at retirement
Swansea striker Michu, whose name has been linked to Celtic in the transfer window, has hinted that he may retire after his contract with Swans expires.
The 29-year-old has been suffering from ankle problems for two years and failed to find a new club outside Wales over the summer.
Hearts are ready to fight the Scottish Football Association over Neilson's comments
The Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was removed from the field, and the team then lost 3-2. The defender's red card was later overturned, and this was the third red card awarded by Collum in the last eight months to be overturned.
Neilson stands by what he said, arguing, "I didn't question honesty, I didn't comment on performance."
Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle
A loyal Hibernian player was reprimanded after admitting to singing an offensive song about former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place in a pub in Roseburn, Edinburgh, before the Edinburgh derby at Tynecastle Stadium in March 2014.
"It was a derby and it was a spur of the moment," the striker said, adding: "I think it's safe to say I won't be returning to Tynecastle unless I move on to play for Celtic."
Tannadice's board believes in Dundee United management - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly insists Dundee United's board still has faith in the management team's ability to turn things around, but admits the player decline must stop.
"I think Stephen Thompson has confidence in us.
We're going to get the boys back in shape," Donnelly says.
McInnes delighted with 'ugly victory' in Hamilton game
Derek McInnes admits his side, Aberdeen, were desperately hanging on to the game against Hamilton Accies but, thanks to Adam Rooney's first-half penalty, managed to seal their seventh consecutive league win that lifted them to the top of the table, five points ahead of Celtic.
McInnes says, "There's no team that has won anything, whether it's a trophy or a league, that hasn't also won games that way."
Unemployment among Scots remains the same as UK total increases
UNEMPLOYMENT in Scotland remained at 164,000 people between May and July, while unemployment in the UK as a whole rose by 10,000 to a total of 1.82 million.
Scotland's unemployment figure of 5.9 per cent is higher than the UK's 5.5 per cent, figures from the National Bureau of Statistics (ONS) say.
At the same time, unemployment in Scotland fell by 12 000 people over a three-month period and the number of people in work now stands at 2 612 000.
Scotland's employment rate fell to 74% during the quarter, higher than the UK average of 73.5%.
Commenting on these latest figures, Scotland Secretary of State David Mundell said: "The government's long-term plan is to build the foundations for a stronger economy."
Almost exactly a year has passed since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of Great Britain.
During these 12 months, Scotland's labour market has improved, employment has risen and unemployment has fallen.
Why am I witnessing an execution in Oklahoma
If there is no judicial intervention, later today I will watch the man be executed.
If that happens, and I hope not, I will sit in the spectators' gallery at Oklahoma State Penitentiary and watch Richard Glossip be executed by lethal injection.
He has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
I received the request in January through her best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
I've started to dread this day as it approaches.
So why did I agree?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story of the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
Of course, journalists do have the opportunity to follow executions in America, and since there are often more applications than available seats, participants are selected through a horrific lottery.
Oklahoma has reduced media seats from twelve to five.
Whoever is chosen will watch the event coolly.
I cannot do that.
I will be sitting next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I have also made my own connection with him through months of phone calls and one two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I like the man.
We often laugh when we talk.
The prison authorities say that I cannot be both a witness and a journalist, so I am not allowed to carry a notebook and pen with me to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
An Oklahoma journalist accused me on Twitter of compromising my impartiality.
Here is the lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story the way they want and you can participate.
I complained to the editor.
Hanan admitted that he "could have positioned his words better" but still thinks what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip has disagreed with some of the things I have said and written.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do it even if he did.
I have told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants an international journalist to write about it.
If Glossip dies, he believes publicity will help the anti-death penalty movement.
Huffington Post reporter Kim Bellware is by my side.
If you want to know more about the story, you can listen to a series of podcasts I've made.
I will not go into all the details here.
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Trees would in any case make him guilty of aiding and abetting.
But I believe there is a very strong chance that he is not guilty of murder.
I certainly believe that there was not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I believe that executing him is wrong.
And that's the point of view from which I watch him die.
I cannot claim to be completely neutral.
There will be other journalists present who will take care of it.
You will get a description from me of what it feels like to watch a man I like die unnecessarily.
Man lured away from Canning River after watery police chase
The Canning Vale constable remained dry as he lured the man away from the Canning River.
An attempt by a man from Perth to distract police went awry when he found himself in shallow, muddy water just metres away from a policeman trying to "gently lure him back to shore".
Canning Vale police were called to Beckenham on Tuesday for trespassing.
When they spotted the suspect, he tried to distract them by heading for the Canning River.
However, he did not get very far.
"He was standing in the water saying, 'I'm not coming out, come get me,'" said senior sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec didn't want his uniform to get wet, so he used a safer tactic: a "proper police negotiation."
"Sometimes people do funny things when they try to escape," said senior sergeant Castledine.
Champion footballer Ben Cousins is a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins abandoned his car to avoid being blown away and attempted to swim across the Swan River.
He was unsuccessful, but inspired locals to start designing the playful Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody claims officials tried to spy on him and threatens to quit competing
Peter Moody has claimed that Racing Victoria officials attempted to infiltrate his teams last year and is threatening to stop racing immediately.
He accuses officials and Racing Victoria's integrity division, claiming they have a personal campaign going on against him. On Wednesday, Lady Tatai's late disqualification due to a medical procedure on race day was the final straw.
Moody told Fairfax Media that his goal has always been to do what's best for the race and that he's found himself in a tricky situation after Lidar's inexplicably positive cobalt sample.
He has kept his tongue in check on the spy allegations for a year and a half, and didn't want "it to look like jealousy."
"I wasn't going to say anything about this, and I've been silent about it for a long time, but sometimes you get so frustrated that everything unravels all at once," Moody said.
They knew the situation was continuing.
Sometimes you just have to react and live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I've said.
I'm going home today and sleeping well.
I want to walk with my head held high and I want the owners to think that I am doing my best for them.
When they start to think differently, then I shouldn't continue as a coach.
Then I would have to consider what to do with my license.
Earlier, Moody dropped a bombshell in an interview with racing.com, where he said the integrity department had tried to spy on his team.
"A year and a half ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown, and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man — I'll name him when asked — and offered him a job in my stables if he passed on information about what I was doing there.
They clearly think I'm a scammer.
If that is the case, then surely they should dismiss their lawyers, because they have failed to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former chairman of Racing Victoria, David Moodie, current chairman of Racing Victoria, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of Racing Victoria, were all clear about it then and are aware of it today.
Should I start thinking that this is becoming personal?
Has Victoria Racing finally decided to manoeuvre and perhaps shift responsibility beyond coaches for what's going on in the industry?
Am I harmful to the industry?
Am I so harmful to the industry?
Perhaps people think so.
Maybe they'll have to take away my license and push me aside, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying now might make them think about that.
But I'm at the point now that I don't care anymore, and that saddens me.
It really saddens me.
I will put pressure on them to make a decision that is their responsibility.
I have the support of my family, and I can turn my back on this.
The coach's frustration has grown with long-running research on Lidar's cobalt, and a late disqualification led him to state that he could "throw his license over the table."
Moody, best known for coaching undefeated champion Black Caviar, has called the rule on race-day grooming "ridiculous" after a mud or clay bath has been put at the horse's feet, which is irregular.
"It's against the rules of competition.
I have to take full responsibility for that," he said.
One of my employees mistakenly put mud on its leg.
It could have had a bath last night.
It could have had it yesterday, as it did.
It had it on race day.
Moody could face a three-month ban due to the poultice treatment on race day, which officials started an investigation into.
It's a joke.
People who draw up these rules know nothing about the horse.
"We all understand that rules are needed, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
Driver found guilty of hit-and-run in Cobram arrested
Police have arrested a man who was found guilty of hitting a cyclist after colliding with a cyclist in Cobram over the weekend.
The cyclist was airlifted to Royal Melbourne Hospital after suffering serious injuries when a car collided with him on Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
Police said the driver drove away and did not stop to help the injured cyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia reported himself to police in Shepparton.
He will be charged with failure to stop in an accident, failure to assist and abetting and other traffic violations.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, is still in hospital and his condition is stable.
Melbourne Storm team coach Craig Bellamy attacks rivals in wrestling allegations
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has criticised claims by two NRL rugby league champion favourites that his team's tackles are part of the "alignment".
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said referees allowed the Storm to "wrestle" on their own side when they surprisingly won the final qualifier in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett barely had time to hide his reference to the Storm after their win over the North Queensland Cowboys in Saturday night's finals qualifier. Bennett called the game a "showcase" for rugby league and said the two Queensland teams were "not very enthusiastic" about wrestling.
Bellamy defended his team's tackles and said they just focus on "contact" when tackling.
Bellamy added that his confidence was boosted by criticism of the Storm by the two leading coaches, as it means they fear losing to the team.
"This always comes up - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talk about wrestling when we lost 24-2 to them," Bellamy said Wednesday.
I can guarantee we haven't changed anything in our defense systems or technologies all year. In the last six weeks we have only emphasized contact in tackles and that has made us successful.
Trent has been with the team for three years and obviously has a great team to coach, so he's probably not used to losing, so this was a bit of a shock to him.
It's funny how this always comes up at this time of year.
Bellamy challenged Bennett's idea of "exciting rugby" by reminding his mentor that the Bennett-coached St George Illawarra Dragons won the championship in 2010 by playing "boringly".
Wayne talks about exciting rugby.
He thought it was important to compare his game on Saturday night to ours on Friday night and show how exciting their game was," Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010 how St George was often criticised for being a boring team, and Wayne said he couldn't care less.
But now he has a team that can play the kind of rugby that we find exciting, especially when he has fast young guys.
That's the kind of game you want to play when you have those types of players.
He brought that side out in 2010, now he wants everyone to play his style of rugby - not every team has guys like Anthony Milford or Ben Hunt to play like that.
I get more confident when they say things like that because they're a little worried about playing against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us as an opponent to important games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game between the Storm and the Roosters was more high-scoring than the one between the Broncos and the Cowboys.
The Broncos game was certainly a good game, I haven't watched it yet, but how did it end? 16-12?
Our game was 20-18, so we had two more goals, but is it exciting rugby?
Or does breaking the defensive line and not scoring make it exciting?
For me, this is a question of guidelines.
If they mention us, it means that at some point we can play against them.
The Storm have time off this weekend as they have already won the right to a home game against either the North Queensland Cowboys or Cronulla Sharks for next Saturday night's pre-final at AAMI Park. Tickets go on sale next Tuesday morning.
Serb man given $200,000 bail on drug charge
A man facing a possible life sentence for attempting to possess 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled into Queensland has been released on bail of $200,000.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, is one of five men arrested last month after federal police tracked down 100 pounds of the drug on the Solay yacht, which entered South America via Vanuatu and docked in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was seen meeting the other defendants at the marina throughout the morning, and then met them at the Coomera Roadhouse café, where police found 40 pounds of the drug in a Toyota Echo.
Although Maksimovic faces a possible life sentence for attempting to possess a quantity of cocaine intended for business, his lawyer argued that there was no evidence that Maksimovic was trying to possess the entire amount and that he may have been in the café for completely innocent reasons.
Supreme Court Justice Peter Flanagan was concerned that Maksimovic was trying to escape.
"He has close links with Serbia.
He travels to Serbia often," he told the court on Wednesday.
In the criminal court case, Maksimovic lied to the police about the place where he lived.
Maksimovic's mother and stepfather had jointly offered a bail of $200,000 to secure his release.
"After reading the affidavits of both individuals, it is clear that putting a bail of $200,000 is a real financial burden on them," Judge Flanagan said.
But that alone wasn't enough to stop him from appearing in court, he warned.
Maksimovic was granted bail on condition that he surrender both his Australian and Serbian passports, report to the police daily and maintain his curfew between six in the evening and six in the morning.
Stevan Hogg used the girl's phone to lure paedophiles into sending pictures
A paedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to request pictures of child abuse.
While the girl was sleeping, Stevan Hogg picked up her phone and then logged into an online messaging service, where Hogg received numerous obscene images of children sent to her by another user.
The girl woke up later, found the phone missing, and found it in the sleeping Hogg's hand.
The girl searched her phone and found the shocking messages, after which she immediately told her mother.
When they arrived, police saw five pictures, searched the computers at the scene and found "troubling" web searches for keywords used to search for obscene images of children.
Hogg then claimed to police that he had done this to "lure pedophiles" on the internet before "pretending to be a police officer to scare them."
Fiscal depute Eilidh Robertson told Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it's an addiction - that he's addicted to scaring people.
He admitted that he had carried out the searches on a computer, but said that they were only done because he wanted to pretend to be a police officer in order to scare paedophiles.
He was asked about conversations with an unknown person who sent him the photos, as well as when Hogg asked the person to send additional photos.
Hogg said he only did this for bait purposes.
He said that after drinking he is sick in his head and wants to look at pictures of rapes and murders.
Robertson added: "When the girl found the pictures on her phone, she was screaming at her mother, shaking and crying.
The mother saw the obscene pictures on the phone and then confronted the accused.
The girl was interviewed, and she said that the defendant had used a computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked younger than her.
Hogg, 23, who lives in Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to being charged with making or taking pictures of indecent children on June 14 last year. He breached his bail on 25 January this year and failed to appear before the court on 24 March this year.
Defense attorney Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not be entered on the sex offender register because it could be argued that his crime did not include a "significant sexual element".
Sheriff Alistair Carmicheal postponed sentencing until October to give social services time to prepare background reports.
Hogg was granted bail in this case, but in other ongoing cases he is in custody before trial.
He was added to the sex offender register before sentencing day.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe made the wrong speech to Parliament
Earlier this year, Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell on the stairs leading to the podium.
He was not injured, but the video of the fall went viral on social media.
The opening of Parliament was also marred by allegations by opposition lawmakers that anonymous death threats had been sent to them, warning them not to boo Mugabe during his speech.
Last month they booed and interrupted him with heckling while he was delivering the State of the Country address to Parliament - a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
Innocent Gonosese, a group discipline supervisor for the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), said seven opposition politicians had received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to interfere with Mugabe's speech.
"The number from which the message was sent does not respond, but the message is titled 'death,'" Gonese told reporters after Mugabe's speech.
The message warned the Members concerned that immunity would end in Parliament and when they stepped out, parliamentary immunity would not apply.
The group discipline supervisor said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, was "concerned" about threats against its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard to cut up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is prepared to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of its restructuring and cost-cutting efforts in the business services business.
Later this year, HP will split into two publicly traded companies, separating its PC and printer businesses from the fast-growing enterprise hardware and services business.
The expected job cuts will bring with them costs of about $2.7 billion starting in the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
"These restructuring efforts will enable a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, HP Chairman and CEO, who will lead the unit after the split.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than today's HP, and we will have a breadth and a deep portfolio of services to help companies transition to new types of business," Whitman said.
As a standalone company, our ability to meet the evolving needs of our customers around the world is better than ever.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have annual revenue of more than $50 billion and will "focus on delivering unparalleled integrated technology solutions" to enterprises, the company said in a statement.
The split breaks down the company founded in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to manufacture electrical accessories. The company operated in a garage in Palo Alto, dubbed the "birthplace of Silicon Valley."
HP has gone through a huge overhaul to cope with the transition from traditional PCs to mobile devices.
HP is the world's second-largest computer manufacturer and one of the largest technology companies in the U.S., and its split is the latest in an industry based on the belief that niche companies perform better.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says team-mates must support injured Jack Wilshere ahead of draw at Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger has also stressed to Wilshire that it is only September and, assuming his rehabilitation goes according to plan, there is no reason why he should not be playing again by Christmas.
Even in this best-case scenario, Wilshire will miss at least the next four England games and, given his background, it is uncertain whether he will participate in next summer's European Championship.
The biggest shame in this latest problem is that Wilshere's end to last season was strong after a single ankle injury, and he recalled his old sharpness before the season began.
"An injury like this doesn't threaten your career," Wenger said.
It's a bone that didn't heal properly.
It's nothing strange.
It was just an accident.
It has nothing to do with his ankles or previous injuries he's had.
This may be true from a medical point of view, but, as Wenger also acknowledged, when a player tries to come back mid-season, there is always a risk of further injury.
There is also an uncomfortable pattern in formation.
Research by Premier Injuries Ltd shows that Wilshere has had 23 different injuries since he debuted six years ago.
In addition, he has played in just 65 of Arsenal's 157 league games in the last five seasons.
Looking at the bigger picture of Arsenal since 2007-08, in six of eight seasons they have been one of the two Premier League teams to lose the most days due to injury.
Wenger admits there is the possibility of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believe their improvement in injury statistics from last season will continue.
"Sometimes when you recover from an injury, there can be a prone season where you have to strengthen your body and get competition," Wenger said.
Jack is young enough to get over it.
I hope his body stabilizes, I'm sure it will, and that he can make the career he deserves.
Wenger will be preparing to rotate his squad when Arsenal begin their Champions League game on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb, then play Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, meaning Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to be on the wayside.
Wenger could also put Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud in place of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I try to maintain balance and give respite to the players who need it," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal are clear favourites to continue Group F, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the scariest in Europe.
Dinamo have also not lost in 41 games since they produced their own "Undefeated" campaign last season.
The stadium was shaken Tuesday night by an earthquake with a magnitude of 3.2 on the Richter scale.
It was tenth in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes Arsenal have learned from last season's Champions League capitulation against Monaco and is still motivated by the distant dream of leading them to their first Europa Cup victory.
"That motivation is huge," Wenger said.
Arsenal have never achieved that.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand, I can be realistic.
We are ambitious, but not dreamy.
FriendsFest: comedy series that taught us serious things about friendship between men
It's striking how similar depictions don't exist on sets, especially considering that men's need to open up is more desperate than ever, and young men's suicide rates are higher than they have been in fifteen years.
In 2013, suicide was the leading cause of death among men aged 20-45 in Britain, and is three times more common in men than women.
In an effort to tackle the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced 2015 as Men's Year. The goal was to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of facing this challenge.
A recent study included more than 2,000 middle and high school students who showed depressive symptoms. According to the study, a person's chance of recovery doubled if a high enough percentage of their friends were in a "healthy mood."
Similarly, those who were not depressed were less likely to develop possible mental health problems in half if they had mentally healthy friends.
But for friendship to work, it must first be available.
In this age of communication through social media, style takes precedence over content, and the immediacy of the response is often more important than meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, joyful and successful, when in reality isolation reigns.
This superficial success is dominated by values that psychologists call external: money, image, social status. All of this comes at the expense of inner values – inner longing for personal growth and friendship – that have a deeper impact on our mental health.
And as the billionaire video game developer explained recently, money really doesn't get you greater happiness.
The beauty of Friends was that it turned this focus on its head.
None of the characters were defined by their work, but rather by their personalities, which clearly stood out when interacting as friends.
Joey and Chandler's numerous hugs, moments in comfortable chairs watching football, Ross missing Rachel - their humor came from knowing that yes, men can relate to all of this, although they often hesitate to fully explore their feelings.
As a Samaritans volunteer explained to me: ..."listening to people who are depressed and suicidal has really made me understand how even the smallest interaction with a friend can make you feel better."
Often men who contact us feel that they cannot talk to friends.
The old idea of "overcoming" is strong, as is the feeling that if you open up about problems, you are seen as weak.
Friends is one of those series that comes to mind when I try to offer more long-term coping mechanisms.
It highlighted the small moments of friendship between men.
While my impartial, outside position on the other end of the phone helps people in moments of despair, long-term support comes from a close, personal network of family and friends.
And if you're attending Comedy Central's FriendsFest this weekend, and all the locations have been redesigned to celebrate the occasion, why not take your friends for coffee at Central Perk.
Or, better yet, if you see someone lonely at Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You never know how much your friendship can mean.
Friends is broadcast on Comedy Central from start to finish, all 236 episodes, participate in #FriendsFest
Di Maria scores and helps PSG slap Malmö aside
Angel Di Maria celebrates goals against Malmö with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani.
Angel Di Maria scored on his Champions League debut, helping PSG outrun Swedish side Malmö on Tuesday.
Below is the match report and reactions to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on the right line as Paris Saint-Germain finally started their Champions League game with a comfortable 2-0 win against Malmö at the Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored on his Champions League debut in less than four minutes to show the French leaguers the way, but they missed several chances before finally extending their lead when Cavani scored in the 61st minute.
Paris, who are in the same Group A as Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, needed a strong start against the Swedish league champions, as not only an extra place was at stake, but also an improvement in their games leading up to the quarter-finals in the last three rounds
But even though PSG took the points, it was not a classic game, as Laurent Blanc's Zlatan Ibrahimovic missed a spot in front of goal and was later substituted off the pitch. Malmö is his old hometown team and the team where he started his brilliant career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win home or away in the Champions League, so a 2-0 win creates problems for the opposition and looks good in terms of statistics, and it's a good start, although there are things we need to hone this season," Blanc said.
This bodes well.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret that we didn't manage to score one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned to the Parisian side after injury in one of the three changes made after they were held to a 2-2 draw in Ligue 1's home game against Bordeaux at the weekend, but he was overshadowed by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
When he moved from Manchester United last month, the Argentine winger was named as the man who will take PSG to a new level in Europe and he proved why when he ran Marco Verratti's pass behind the Malmö defensive line and then struck a beautiful finish past Johan Wiland into the back corner of the net.
However, if anyone expected an easy and big win from PSG, they were disappointed.
Malmö was a stuffy opponent. They beat Celtic in the deciding match to reach this level, with nine international players and a five-man defence in their opening field, as well as two players deep in midfield.
But on the offensive side, the team offered little more than Nikola Djurdjic's shot in the 34th minute, which narrowly missed Kevin Trapp's goalpost.
Instead, PSG sometimes got in trouble due to wasted passes and poor finishing, especially from Ibrahimovic, who failed a total of five attempts in the first half alone and then disappointed when Cavani put the ball in from Ibrahimovic's touch right at the start of the second half.
However, he was much more effective in setting the stage for his colleagues and it was from Ibrahimovic's pass that Di Maria sent off a spiral kick that tilted around Wiland's goalpost at the 52nd minute mark.
The second goal finally came an hour into the game thanks to Uruguayan Cavani, who scored his sixth goal of the season, after Ibrahimovic had tapped forward Maxwell's cross-pass from the left.
That was the end of Malmö's hopes of getting back into the game and only Wiland's brilliant save from David Luiz's direct kick kept the final numbers down before substitute Ezequiel Lavezzi's goal was disallowed at the very end of the game.
Malmö coach Age Hareide later admitted that PSG were one level higher than his team. The Norwegian said: "Our last Champions League game was in December last year."
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, which is not of the same level.
Qualifying matches are not enough.
I take my hat off to Paris.
This was a great game from them.
Glencore raises $2.5 billion through stock sales
Switzerland-based mining giant Glencore, which suffered a commodity price crash, raised $2.5 billion on Wednesday by selling shares as part of its sweeping debt cutting plan.
Glencore, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange, said in a statement that it had sold new shares worth around £1.6 billion to repay its debt.
The company, which lost 57% of its market value this year, is struggling with plummeting commodity prices as China's economic slowdown weighs on demand and wreaks havoc on all markets.
The rights issue pushed the value of Glencore's shares to the top of the London Stock Exchange in Wednesday's morning trading.
Shares rose 2.77 per cent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69 per cent higher.
Glencore had unveiled a $2.5 billion stock deal the previous week as part of a broader plan to cut its $30 billion debt burden by about a third.
The company sold new equity for 125p a share, representing a 2.4% discount on Tuesday's closing price.
The company sold 1.3 billion shares, which together accounted for 9.99 percent of the group.
Concerns about a prolonged halt in China's growth have cut iron ore prices by about half, while coal, copper and other commodity prices have fallen by 20 to 40 percent.
White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the United States at the end of the month, a White House statement released Tuesday confirmed.
Xi's first official visit to Washington will take place on September 25 and is a response to President Barack Obama's visit to Beijing last November, the statement said.
The President of the United States and Michelle Obama, the President's spouse, will host a dinner for Xi and his spouse Peng Liyuan after the leaders hold bilateral talks.
"Preident Xi's visit will provide an opportunity to expand U.S.-China cooperation on a wide range of global, regional, and bilateral issues of mutual interest, while at the same time allowing President Obama and President Xi to engage constructively on issues of disagreement," it added.
During the visit, which was first announced in February, Xi is also expected to make a stop in Seattle on his trip to Washington to meet with numerous U.S. technology leaders before heading to New York City and the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to discuss a number of controversial topics, including Washington's concerns over China's alleged cyber espionage and the country's increased absolutism in the disputed waters of the South China Sea.
Matt Damon downplays diversity in filmmaking
Matt Damon clashed with African-American filmmaker Effie Brown as they discussed the difference, which Damon says is not needed behind the scenes.
On Sunday night's episode of HBO's Project Greenlight, the veteran actor interrupted Brown as he emphasized the need for different perspectives on the dark-skinned protagonist of the script chosen for the project.
"When we talk about diversity, it's taken into account when choosing actors for a movie, not a series," Damon argued.
A shocked Brown reacted with hurtful disbelief, commenting, "Oops! Wow. Okay," while the comments from The Martian actor were left hanging in the air.
Co-producers Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers joined Damon and Brown to discuss the show's finalists.
"I want to encourage people to think, whoever the director is, how they treat Harmony's character," Brown said at the beginning.
The only dark figure is a whore beaten by her white pimp.
The producer of The Dear White People claimed the rights to direct the film for finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio; Damon bluntly replied that their guidance "could end up giving us something we don't want."
After the conversation was posted, social media exploded into outrage at Damon's comments.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed his anger at the film clip, writing, "Matt Damon talking over the only black person in the room and explaining to him the difference is SO WHITE it hurts."
The tweet garnered over 5000 retweets and 4000 likes since its release.
Damon's comments come at a time when accurate racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social debate.
After teenager Michael Brown was killed by white police in 2014, The Black Lives Matter movement spread nationwide, calling on lawmakers and authorities to end discriminatory practices against people of color.
In February, singer Prince alluded to the movement when presenting the nominees for Album of the Year for the Grammy Award.
"Albums still matter," he said.
Like books and Black lives, albums still matter.
Leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement recently released a statement in response to a question from Fox News television face Elisabeth Hasselbeck about whether the group should be considered a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter Network is a love group," executives said.
It was recently reported that Damon will be among the entertainers, producers and media moguls invited to visit the Pope to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is unclear whether he has accepted the invitation or already met with the Pope.
First American Ninja Warrior Champion Crowned
Professional rock climber and dish collector Isaac Caldiero on Monday became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior competition, receiving a million-dollar grand prize as a reward.
The competition show, which has just finished its seventh season, has never had a competitor who has survived all sections of the show's obstacle course.
In the final episode of the series, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, made it to the final round.
The last task involved climbing a rope of about 23 meters in 30 seconds.
Britten climbed first and cleared the challenge on time, making him the first athlete ever to complete the grueling 4th leg of American Ninja Warrior. However, Caldiero cleared the challenge three seconds faster, making him the winner.
Caldiero gave an interview to E! After the hard-won win for the News and was still in shock at winning the million-dollar grand prize.
"So it's amazing to think about this when I've never made or lived on more than $10,000 a year," Isaac told E! after his big raise.
So all of a sudden... So I can't even imagine what this is going to be like... The future is unknown.
Production director Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to talk about fiinal and why Britten isn't getting more paid despite being the first racer ever to make it through the track.
According to the rules, money goes to the fastest person.
"If more people pass, the money goes to whoever has the fastest time," Weed said.
Although money is a great reward and life-changing, he still gets a great sense of satisfaction.
I don't think he feels a grudge for that.
He's just so happy that he's been able to do what he did.
His fans have praised him.
He's a great guy and a good family man.
He is the hero of his children and wife.
Geoff told me, "If someone had to beat me, I'm happy it was Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have thought the same way if it had gone the other way around.
American Ninja Warrior returns for an eighth season, which will begin filming in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers sneak past Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- The second half of the season hasn't been much fun for the Detroit Tigers.
The Tigers were once one of the best baseball teams, but are now last in the American League Central division.
The Tigers played their spoiler role perfectly on Tuesday with a 5-4 win over the Minnesota Twins at Target Field.
The Twins missed an opportunity to move within half of the game over the Houston Astros in the race for another American League wild card spot.
For Detroit, for at least one night, the game was a return to the six-letter H-word, which had been so elusive for most of the second half of the season.
"All wins are fun, no matter how you get them," said Tigers team manager Brad Ausmus.
Tigers pitcher Alfredo Simon continued his early offensive support as Detroit scored three runs in the first two innings, followed by once in the sixth and once again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) pitched 6 1/3 in the inning and allowed three runs.
This was only his third quality start in the last nine games.
"I just want a strong ending for this year," Simon said.
It's hard to pass to a substitute every game, and that's why I want to go deep into the game.
Tigers substitute hitter Victor Martinez hit three times and allowed two runs, his first batted runs since mid-August.
This was Martinez's first three-stroke night since hitting four times against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He swung the racket well," Ausmus said.
He looked good (in batting practice), looked significantly better in batting practice and continued to do so in the game.
The Twins were three runs behind in the second half of the seventh inning, and it was their best chance to get back into the game.
Center Byron Buxton started the inning by hitting twice out on the left field line.
Right-back Aaron Hicks homered with a one-base tap, and Simon was able to directly burn second base player Brian Dozier before Simon was replaced by left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy walked Mauer, the only player to line up against, ahead of rookie substitute batsman Miguel Sano, who yanked a two-base run left of right-hander Drew VerHagen.
With two runners in the field and an equalizing runner on second base, VerHagen got third base Trevor Plouffe to hit a home shot leading to a double.
It was a major league record: the 27th time this season that Plouffe had recorded a double.
After Detroit scored a backup run in the ninth inning, Mauer yanked two batted runs against Tigers shutout Bruce Rondon, and the score was 5-4.
However, the right-handed player burned Sano on three passes in his fifth save.
Detroit took advantage of the rusty Phil Hughes in the beginning.
The Tigers scored three runs in the first two innings against a veteran right-handed player who got off the injured list before the game after being off for more than a month with a lower back infection.
"Obviously, I didn't want that start," Hughes said, "but as the game went on, I felt more comfortable, and I felt like I was able to make some nice pitches in the third inning."
After Hughes grabbed the starting batsman for first base, he allowed second-base player Ian Kinsler to advance one inning.
A walk by right-back J.D. Martinez in a two-run situation brought in Victor Martinez, who took himself to first base with a midfield strike and scored the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez broke his 0-21 streak with runners in good running positions.
Third base player Nick Castellanos went on to hit the right and cause another run, but the threatening situation ended when Victor Martinez was disallowed as he attempted to advance to third base.
The Tigers continued in the second inning, getting one run, a two-run run from catcher James McCann and a two-hit, one-run situation from center Anthony Gose to make it 3-0.
"It was an important punch," Twins team manager Paul Molitor said.
He didn't hit very well, but it flew to the right spot.
Hughes began serving and pitched a runless third inning, then was replaced by right-handed taker A.J. Achter.
Hughes counted three runs on six batters as well as a walk on four wickets.
NOTES: Tigers right-handed pitcher Anibal Sanchez was sent off due to a throwing arm shoulder strain.
He is being examined by Dr. James Andrews, who operated on Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez has been on the injured list since mid-August due to a shoulder strain, but was due to return on Wednesday.
With Sanchez out, left-handed pitcher Daniel Norris comes off the injured list to start against the Twins.
Norris' record for the Tigers is 1-1 in four starts since left-handed pitcher David Price was traded for him on July 30.
Norris has been out since Aug. 20 due to a strain in his right oblique abs.
The Tigers and Twins' three-game series comes to an end Wednesday at Target Field.
Norris (2-2-, 4.43 ERA) will line up against Minnesota's right-handed pitcher Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi calls for wider global opening of the economy
The economy must open up more to the outside world to boost growth, President Xi Jinping told a group tasked with guiding the reform on Tuesday.
"China should commit to attracting foreign funding and expertise and developing a policy of transparency," he said, speaking at the 16th meeting of the group leading the deepening of the overall reform.
Supporting openness while advancing reforms will increase new movement and vitality, and create new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The steering group adopted a series of guidelines, including a negative list restricting market access, a relaxation of border control principles, an invitation to private capital for state-owned enterprises, and a review of the resident registration system.
According to the opinion, a negative list will be created naming the sectors and companies in which investment is not allowed.
The system will be gradually tested and improved through pilot programmes.
The change is significant as it gives the market a greater role in resource allocation, ensures a legal business environment and makes the market more transparent, the statement said.
The government is also loosening its control over the power it distributes to companies, thus ensuring that companies decide for themselves how to run their businesses.
The statement also said that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for developing regional growth.
In order to open up state-controlled sectors, more sectors will open up to private financiers.
"The government will not change its policy on foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and provide them with better services," the statement said.
In addition, the application process for foreign permanent resident permits, or "green cards", will be facilitated by optimising the requirements and streamlining the application process.
The meeting also discussed guaranteeing the professional rights of lawyers and supporting professional judges and prosecutors.
The meeting was also attended by Premier Li Keqiang, as well as senior leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, a statement released after the meeting said.
