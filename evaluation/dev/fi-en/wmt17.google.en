A 28-year-old chef was found dead in a shopping mall in San Francisco
A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in a stairwell at a local mall this week.
However, the victim&#39;s brother says that he doesn&#39;t know anyone who wanted to hurt him, and states: &quot;His affairs finally turned out well.&quot;
A body found at the Westfield Mall Wednesday morning has been identified as 28-year-old San Francisco man Frank Galicia, the San Francisco coroner&#39;s office said.
The San Francisco Police Department said the death was ruled a homicide and that an investigation is ongoing.
The victim&#39;s brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC&#39;s KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously worked as a line cook in Boston, had landed his dream job as a line cook at San Francisco&#39;s Sons &amp; Daughters restaurant six months ago.
A representative for Sons &amp; Daughters said they are &quot;appalled and shocked&quot; by her death.
&quot;We have a small team that works like a close family, and he will be greatly missed,&quot; the representative said.
We send our thoughts and condolences to Frank&#39;s family and friends during this difficult time.
Louis Galicia said that Frank stayed in hostels at first, but that recently &quot;things were finally going well for him&quot;.
&quot;He found an apartment and met a girl,&quot; Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he doesn&#39;t know anyone who wanted to hurt his younger brother.
He was kind and had a big heart.
His way of feeling connected with the family was to cook for us, to make dinner,” Louis Galicia said.
He never wanted to be involved in any kind of controversies.
He was a brother who drifted with the flow.
&quot;In a world where so many things are wrong, he was a diamond in the rough that shone brighter every day,&quot; he said.
Anyone with information is asked to call the San Francisco Police Department&#39;s tip line at 415-575-4444.
Medical trainees on strike: Demands for new industrial action measures
Representatives of medical trainees have asked their union to accept new industrial action in their dispute over a new contract.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) is calling on the full council to support new industrial action measures from early September.
The JDC says ministers have failed to address concerns about the deal.
Trainees and medical students voted in July to reject the contract agreed with the BMA.
58 percent of voting members rejected it.
In a letter to members released via Twitter on Thursday evening, JDC chair Ellen McCourt said the board had remained &quot;stubbornly silent&quot; on the issues she said led to the rejection of the deal.
He said: &quot;In light of this, the JDC board has voted to reject the proposed new contract in its entirety and to demand a formal renegotiation of all your concerns.&quot;
In response to the Government&#39;s silence, the JDC Board has today made a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to authorize a gradually progressing and expanding program of industrial action beginning in early September.
The dispute has seen trainee doctors take part in six strikes this year, including the first full stoppage in the history of the NHS.
The BMA&#39;s head of trainee doctors, Dr Johann Malawana, resigned after a vote rejected the negotiated terms of the contract, recommended by the BMA.
He had told BMA members at meetings before the vote of 54,000 medical trainees and students that the deal was good and should be accepted.
After the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the contract would be imposed on doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: a coalition of outsiders?
A gesture that ended in crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and declare an eight-month war of words and economic sanctions officially over.
But when Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I got the clear impression that Ankara wants more of this reconciliation.
Yes, we shook hands at the event.
But Putin&#39;s smile looked forced, and he didn&#39;t exactly exude warmth, even by his own subdued standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, kept talking about his &quot;dear friend&quot; Putin - five times, according to one report.
I messed up the bills.
He also vowed that relations with Russia would not only return to the pre-crisis level, but even better.
The next day, newspapers here described Erdogan as behaving as if nothing bad had ever happened.
In my opinion, his enthusiasm was quite the opposite.
But the coolness radiating from Putin showed that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening remarks: when Turkey shot down a Russian warplane on the Syrian border.
Moscow&#39;s reaction at the time was furious.
Putin attacked, accusing Ankara of stabbing Moscow in the back.
The insult was even worse when it came from a supposed friend.
Rebuilding real trust will be difficult, perhaps impossible.
The opinion of the general Russian public has also changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media led a stunning, all-out attack on Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed that the Turks were to blame for everything.
The most serious were accusations by senior officials that Erdogan&#39;s own family has benefited from the illegal oil trade from ISIS-controlled areas of Syria.
He has emphatically denied this.
But the official message in St. Petersburg was that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting only happened because Putin got the apology he demanded from President Erdogan.
Russia achieved some sort of victory.
The benefits of agreeing to a ceasefire for Ankara are clear.
First, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was nearly ousted from power in a failed coup last month.
The ongoing terrorist attacks in Turkey have also clearly shaken him.
In addition, there is a financial motive.
Russia&#39;s economic sanctions have been heavy, especially the ban on chartered flights, which usually carry several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The number has decreased by almost 90 percent.
As for Russia, local tour operators and charter airlines will certainly be relieved when flights finally resume.
They are hoping for a late season rush to the Mediterranean.
And already this week, state TV has predicted cheaper fruit and vegetables after the import of agricultural products from Turkey is allowed again.
&quot;Tourists there, tomatoes back here,&quot; as the Vedemosti newspaper&#39;s report put it.
But the visit also had added political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West for what is seen as a weak response to the attempted coup.
Add to that a long-standing grudge against EU membership negotiations that progressed at a snail&#39;s pace, and Putin emerges, eager to take advantage of the coolness and erode Turkey&#39;s ties to the West.
The Russian leader was guaranteed to get points from Ankara, where he called after the attempted revolution to support the appointed authorities.
Of course, this is a solution for Moscow, which has its own deep-rooted fear of a change of power.
So this meeting in a lavish seaside palace allowed Russia and Turkey to introduce the “alignment of outsiders,” as one analyst described the situation to me: two countries that feel they have been abandoned and mistreated by the West, joining forces.
However, despite the public reconciliation, the two have major differences.
The key issue is Syria, where Moscow has recently adapted itself to the role of peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
It may be telling that after nearly three hours of preliminary discussions, the presidents told the press that they had not even discussed the issue.
The Turkish president deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin chose to highlight them.
There is no clear consensus on where they can look for common ground on Syria.
After months of open hostility, and given the possibility of a full-blown disaster if NATO member Turkey shoots down a Russian fighter jet, it is surely better that the two leaders are even on speaking terms again.
Royal Bank of Scotland is disappearing from customers outside of Scotland
According to the bank&#39;s CEO, the RBS brand will be reduced to a back office role.
Royal Bank of Scotland is disappearing from customers outside of Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank&#39;s international ambitions.
Since the bank nearly collapsed and had to be bailed out eight years ago, it has abandoned those goals.
The bank&#39;s strategists have currently used the &#39;RBS&#39; brand to protect other consumer finance brands.
It was backed by millions of pounds spent on international sports sponsorship, from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now it has been deemed right to let the more national brands come to the fore.
Royal Bank of Scotland is in use with Scottish customers but will not be restarted from scratch.
In England and Wales, all RBS references, except for head office and stock market listings, will be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use by customers in Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller private banking brands that are getting more exposure: Coutts, Adam &amp; Co, Drummond and Holt&#39;s Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed on a tour of customers and staff in Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland: &quot;The RBS brand will become our investor brand and our employees&#39; employer because we will now become much more of a bank of brands.&quot;
As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
So I say we no longer have global goals, we have local goals.
Each of these brands means something very different in their communities, and our staff work with clients under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue sponsoring the Six Nations and has raised the profile of various brands in its sports sponsorship.
&quot;Now it&#39;s time for us to move in the direction of a bank of brands, because basically (we&#39;ve been asking) it&#39;s about how we can focus on making this a better bank for customers,&quot; the CEO said.
Three years ago I would have been very cynical if we had said we were going to be a great bank for customers and offered these brands.
But with the work we&#39;ve done focusing on the customers&#39; needs, not our own, I think you&#39;ll see a lot of changes.
We can bring those brands back, so I think the time is right.
Frankie Dettori wins at Newmarket with Predilection to reach 3000 wins
Dettori sprays champagne after winning a double win totaling 3000
Racehorse Frankie Dettori secured his 3000th British win at Newmarket on Friday.
He achieved the milestone with his second win of the night on his home track, racing the John Gosden-trained Predilection.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach this milestone in horse racing.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
Three-time champion jockey Dettori, who previously won on Ghayyar, said: “This is special.”
I&#39;m very emotional because my family is here too.
I am very pleased that this happened in Newmarket because this is where I started 30 years ago.
It&#39;s not a big event, this isn&#39;t Royal Ascot, just a normal Friday night and 20,000 people.
I am relieved and very humbled.
Dettori soaks up the cheers when he brings Predilection out after the win.
Two jockeys have achieved this milestone in steeplechase - champion jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had more than 4,300 wins in a record-breaking career.
Lester Piggot, 9 times Derby winner, 4493 wins
Frankie is one of the best racehorses of the current era and it is no surprise that he has achieved this milestone that few have achieved before him.
He&#39;s stylish and strong, but it&#39;s his tactical acumen that sets him apart in the weight room.
He is a wonderful ambassador for competitions, his enthusiasm and charisma have drawn fans to the sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he would have ridden 6,000 winners if he wasn&#39;t just a weekend and big race jockey!
In all seriousness, Frankie has been riding winners in the UK for the better part of 30 years, which is great to see.
He&#39;s a lively person, which is good for British racing, but beyond that he&#39;s an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with his trademark glider landing from the saddle.
From aerial finishes to aerial landings, Frankie Dettori has been the face of British horse racing for two decades.
This has been a rollercoaster ride.
Scores of wins at the big races, including his famous &#39;Magnificent Seven&#39; victory at Ascot in 1996, but he also survived a plane crash and served a drugs ban.
Three years ago, he had a rough start when he returned from a six-month suspension, but he showed remarkable fortitude in defying the doubters and returning to his best form.
And he may continue for a long time - Dettori has previously said that he would like to continue competing until at least the age of 50.
Russia&#39;s Putin fires Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly fired Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin&#39;s trusted inner circle for many years.
The 63-year-old has now been appointed special representative for environment and transport issues.
A Kremlin statement said Putin had &quot;ordered Ivanov to step down from the post of head of Russia&#39;s presidential administration,&quot; but did not give a reason.
Ivanov&#39;s assistant manager since 2012, Anton Vaino, has been named as his successor.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
He was born in Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, in 2012, graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the embassy in Tokyo.
He later headed the protocol and government staff of the president, the Kremlin website says (in Russian).
When he was appointed, he told Putin: &quot;Thank you for your trust.&quot;
In my opinion, the administration&#39;s most important task is to support your activities as head of state, in terms of drafting laws and managing the implementation of your instructions.
Putin told a Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his seat and recommended that Vaino be appointed in his place.
Are smiles convincing?
This is a move that has confused Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin&#39;s closest allies and, like Putin, served in the KGB, the Soviet security service.
As chief of staff, he was one of the most influential men in the country.
In a meeting with President Putin shown on state television, both men claimed the chief of staff stepped aside at his own request.
But despite smiling for the cameras, few here are convinced - especially now, just before the general election.
So is this just the aftermath of some kind of power struggle?
Nobody knows yet.
But the official claim that a man who was once touted as a potential presidential candidate suddenly wants to lead Russia&#39;s environmental policy has been met with real skepticism.
In his comments to Putin quoted on the Kremlin&#39;s website, Ivanov said &quot;it is true that early in 2012 I asked you in a conversation to give me responsibility for this very complicated, one might even say laborious, task for four years.
Well, now I&#39;ve been chief of staff for four years and eight months.&quot;
Ivanov accepted the position in December 2011.
He previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the state security service KGB, as is Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was head of the FSB, the state security service that replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed as his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted the most.
It was once thought that Ivanov could become Russian President Putin after his second term, as Putin&#39;s third term would have been unconstitutional.
However, this task went to another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister before returning to the presidency just three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson got booted after punching producer
Last month, Gibson was involved in a physical altercation on the set of the series in Los Angeles.
The producers of the series, ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, announced his dismissal in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, issued an apology Thursday before his firing was announced.
There were creative differences and a fight on the set.
I regret that it happened,” he said in a statement.
According to a statement from ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, details on how Gibson&#39;s character will be removed from the series about a team of FBI agents are expected at a later date.
The 54-year-old, who previously starred in the sitcom Dharma &amp; Greg, has been with the series since its first season in 2005.
&quot;I love Criminal Minds and have given it my all for the past twelve years,&quot; Gibson said in a statement released Friday.
I had hoped to be there until the end, but that is not possible now.
I just want to thank the writers, producers, actors, our incredible crew, and most of all, the best fans the show can have.
The beginning of the twelfth production season of the series is planned for September 28.
The mystery fish ended up in a garden in Banff
A Banff man is asking for help identifying fish that have appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes the 75 fish could be windfish left behind by the eddy.
Bain, who lives 500 meters from the ocean, posted footage of the apparition on Periscope in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two-inch fish.
Queensferry Crossing: The bridge now spans Fife
The £1.35 billion project is now expected to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the north deck of the Queensferry crossing with the viaduct, meaning the bridge now spans Fife.
It is the first of four brackets between the &quot;deck fans&quot; that are now being completed around each of the bridge&#39;s three piers.
The bridge section from Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 strands of rope.
The £1.35 billion project is now expected to be completed by May 2017.
Finance Minister Keith Brown visited the site today and was among the first to walk from the land to the bridge.
He said: “This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry crossing.
We all witness some truly impressive engineering in this project, which has used over 30,000 tonnes of concrete and steel to build this section of the bridge alone.”
Despite the enormous size and weight of the bridge, finishing the bracket between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a demanding operation, where extremely precise dimensions must fit together.
In total, almost 79% of the bridge deck is now in place and the concrete deck for the final section of the deck is being poured today in Rosyth, meaning the entire deck is ready to be lifted into place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, Project Manager for Fort Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: “The first lock on any bridge project is always a significant milestone.
In this fantastic project, this lock represents the cutting edge of construction technology.
After the last section of the road deck was installed and connected to the expanding north pole road deck, we then had to close the remaining section on the north, inland side.
This was done by pulling the viaduct of the northern fairway 700 millimeters in a southerly direction.
This was a huge and at the same time very demanding operation.
Huge, because the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6000 tons and had to be pulled on a slope of about 3%.
Challenging because the tolerances the team worked to were tiny, just a few millimeters in either direction.
Fortunately, everything went well.
Rescue at Moelfre Bay: Three men &#39;lucky to be alive&#39;
Three men are &#39;lucky to be alive&#39; after falling from their fishing boat off Anglesey.
Moelfre RNLI Lifeboat Station raised the alarm at 1.20pm (BST) on Friday after crews saw the incident unfold in Moelfre Bay.
The three men desperately tried to swim to safety as their boat continued on its own.
&quot;We saw the boat circling closer to the men and thought the worst,&quot; Moelfre lifeboat coxswain Vince Jones said.
&quot;Luckily the strong wind had blown it away from them by the time we got going,&quot; he added.
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, and the third, a 60-year-old man, was found exhausted hanging from a buoy without life jackets.
The men were taken into a coastal lifeboat and brought back to the lifeboat station.
Jones said: “These three men in the water are lucky to be alive and completely unharmed.
The boat&#39;s engine had a kill switch rope, but it had somehow become detached from the person driving the boat when the boat capsized.
Someone took care of these guys today.
Pokémon Go is a respectable hunt for health and happiness
It&#39;s fascinating to see how the world is changing.
Over the past decade, many have been concerned that teenagers and children are no longer going out to play, but prefer to spend their free time watching screens.
Pokémon Go gets people off the couch and into an activity.
Screen time was initially limited to television, then to video games, and now more recently to smartphones.
So it&#39;s great to see that technology and outdoor activity are not mutually exclusive.
I am of course referring to the craze called Pokémon Go. For an app based on characters originally developed in the 1990s for video games (later spawned a cartoon series, playing cards, and other spin-offs).
Like many pop culture phenomena, its popularity had somewhat faded before the release of this new game in the US, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
After that, the release of the game in other countries was delayed, as the huge popularity overloaded the servers.
In just days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
So how does it work?
Explained in a nutshell, players use their smartphones to search for Pokémon, which are tracked using GPS, and when found, can be &quot;photographed&quot; (using a screenshot on the phone) or &quot;caught&quot;.
The generation that played the game when they were younger has joined the craze and jumped off the couch to join the quest.
In the US, the game has led to a significant increase in the daily steps taken by the &quot;average person&quot;.
Cardiogram, an Apple Watch app that tracks 35,000 users, recently told the Washington Post that within two days of the game&#39;s release, the number of people exercising 30 minutes a day jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent of users tracked by Cardiogram.
The company doesn&#39;t know who&#39;s playing Pokémon Go, it only sees training level information.
Many public health campaigns calling for &quot;get 30&quot;, &quot;get off the couch&quot; and &quot;be active every day&quot; have failed because most public health warnings are boring and delivered by people who look unhappy.
However, the importance of exercise cannot be underestimated.
People who exercise regularly have a lower risk of getting cancer or depression.
Activity helps with weight control, high blood pressure and diabetes. Its benefits are too numerous to list here.
The beauty of Pokémon Go is that it gets people to go out and do something they enjoy.
This covers the three pillars of health: exercise, fresh air and sunshine, and fun.
Some people even make new friends while hunting.
As usual, disapproving pranksters are looking for things to complain about here.
Yes, someone can walk towards the door.
So what?
There has been a breakthrough.
While there have been apps like Fitbit to track activity in the past, they didn&#39;t give you a reason to move the way this game does.
The allure of novelty disappears and use subsides over time.
However, due to the success of Pokémon, other games are coming that combine apps and virtual reality with real-world activity, helping many people who hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.

Simone Biles took gold in the women&#39;s gymnastics all-around
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to it all.
Energetic in jumping.
Smooth on the boom.
Unbelievable with permanence.
Great all around.
And now, finally, an Olympic champion.
A 19-year-old American gymnast claimed the all-around title on Thursday, leaving the gap between herself and the rest of the world exposed in the Olympic spotlight.
Her total score of 62.198 was clearly better than silver medalist and &quot;Final Five&quot; teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
Simone Biles of the United States on the balance beam during the women&#39;s balance beam individual all-around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles became the fourth American woman to win back-to-back all-around titles, and the Fifth American champion overall. At the same time, he cemented his reputation as the best of his generation, and perhaps of all time.
He broke down in tears when his final score was announced, ending his long journey towards this moment.
This achievement puts him in the same category as other top athletes of his generation, such as Michael Phelps, who have taken their sport to a new level:
Biles has dominated her sport for the past three years, winning 15 world championship medals, including 10 golds, with routines whose blend of ambition and precision has been so astounding that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her &quot;the best gymnast I&#39;ve ever seen.&quot;
The final test awaited in Brazil, a competition that wasn&#39;t so much between Biles and the other contestants as between her and the burden of outsized expectations.
Returning to the family home in Spring, Texas without a handful of gold medals would have been a disappointment.
United States&#39; Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman hug after winning the gold and silver medals (respectively) in the women&#39;s balance beam individual all-around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, Aug.
Biles earned her first medal on Tuesday when she headlined the going-away party for retiring national team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
While Biles claimed that she never thought about the future during her long journey to the top, that&#39;s not entirely true.
Part of his permanto routine - the one that includes his trademark volte-skip - is set to Latin American music that would also fit perfectly on the street next to Rio&#39;s Olympic arena.
This is no accident.
Adopted as a toddler by her grandparents and discovered by trainer Aimee Boorman&#39;s mother while she was on a field trip to the gym where Boorman coached, this girl has become a powerhouse.
She hasn&#39;t lost in an all-around match since the summer of 2013, and that streak will continue for as long as Biles wants.
Although Mustafina had a small lead after two laps, it was only an illusion.
The balance beam and beam, where Biles is the reigning world champion, awaited.
He came out on top with a beam score of 15.433 and exceeded them by getting a 15.933 on the floor.
Raisman gave her a good-natured hug as they waited for the final points — a mere formality — and tears welled up in Biles&#39; glittery red, white and blue eyes as the dream she once wrote about in her scrapbook became a reality.
Raisman&#39;s performance was some kind of revenge from four years ago, when she was tied for third place, but lost the bronze to Mustafina in the replay.
This time, the 22-year-old team leader, whom the Americans call &quot;grandmother&quot;, was clearly in the lead.
He blew kisses to the audience after his permanto performance in an emotional frenzy about a comeback that at times seemed doubtful.
As for Biles, the 19-year-old&#39;s widely circulated tweet from earlier this week takes on a whole new meaning:
Police: Three victims in serial killing shot while listening to music in car
The two women and a 12-year-old girl killed in Phoenix&#39;s first serial killer attack in a decade were sitting in a car talking and listening to music when they were shot. This was stated in the police bulletin published on Thursday.
Authorities said Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis&#39; daughter Maleah were shot June 12 in a car parked in the driveway.
The release states that the shooter standing on the passenger side of the car fired a handgun up to eight times and then fled in another vehicle.
According to the police, the triple death does not seem to have been the result of a robbery, as the attacker did not take handbags or the $2,900 from the second adult victim.
Phoenix police spokesman Chief Constable Jonathan Howard said the shooting prompted investigators to look into whether it was connected to four previous attacks.
A total of seven people have been killed and two wounded in nine attacks over four months in two predominantly Hispanic neighborhoods.
&quot;These happen in a residential area in front of a home,&quot; Howard told CBS affiliate KPHO earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have driven several vehicles, including a late 1990s brown Nissan, a late 1990s black BMW, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators have refused to reveal the evidence that led to the conclusion that the attacks are linked and by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized with his injuries, where he later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis&#39; daughter, Maleah, died at the scene.
A witness told police they often sat in a parked car listening to music.
Authorities also released a police statement about the shooting, which happened just half an hour before the triple homicide and targeted an empty open-top van. This is also believed to have been the work of a serial killer.
Investigators found bullet casings, a bullet in the seat and bullet fragments in the engine compartment.
Mother of a 6-year-old with microcephaly: &quot;The situation is getting easier&quot;
Edmund Picciuto, like most other six-year-olds, loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But, unlike many of his peers, Edmund is small-minded. This is the result of a genetic disorder that her mother, Elizabeth Picciuto, was unaware of when she was pregnant.
&quot;When he first came home, my first thought was that I can&#39;t do this.
I can not do this.
I didn&#39;t promise this.
Which is not true at all - of course I promised,&quot; he said.
She and her husband, Vincent, were told that Edmund might never learn to recognize them, and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be institutionalized.
&quot;My first reaction was, &#39;I didn&#39;t know people still did that,&#39;&quot; Picciuto explained.
Edmund walks with the help of a walker.
Edmund didn&#39;t sit or crawl until he was three, and he still doesn&#39;t talk.
But he is slowly reaching some milestones.
He walks with assistance and rides a bicycle.
In addition, he loves to play with his two brothers and sing.
Elizabeth shows how to use the signs invented by Edmund to indicate &quot;will you sing for me&quot;.
&quot;We&#39;re teaching him sign language,&quot; Picciuto told CBS News.
But it&#39;s no ordinary sign language - he says that Edmund has come up with some of his own.
Microcephaly can be caused by a number of different causes: genetic, as in Edmund&#39;s case, or viral infections during pregnancy, such as measles or the Zika virus.
Symptoms and prognosis can vary widely.
It&#39;s too early to tell how it will affect the lives of those infected with Zika.
Picciuto remembers the emotional burden of an uncertain future.
I was just asking what was going to happen.
What is going to happen?
And he still doesn&#39;t really know.
I actually haven&#39;t asked for a forecast in ages because I don&#39;t expect anyone to actually be able to give me one.
But Picciuto has some hopeful advice for mothers whose babies are born with Zika-related birth defects.
The situation is getting easier.
You can believe that the situation will get easier.
You love your child, and your child loves you.
Heavy rain and flooding caused rescue operations in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rain and widespread flooding in Louisiana prompted the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday. More rain was expected in the state on Saturday.
The National Weather Service reports that numerous rivers in southeast Louisiana and southern Mississippi are overflowing their banks and causing widespread flooding due to extremely heavy rains.
Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said state officials are in constant contact with local officials and help is already arriving in counties that need it.
Mike Steele, spokesman for the Governor&#39;s Office of Safety and Emergency Preparedness, said they are getting requests for high-tide vehicles, boats and sandbags.
Steele said Tangipahoa County alone requested tens of thousands of sandbags.
A flood watch is in effect through Saturday for much of southern Louisiana.
Sääpalvelu said in a statement that another three to five centimeters more rain is expected in the area.
A flood watch was in effect for south Alabama Friday as rain continued to fall in the Mobile area.
The Comite River near Baton Rouge and the Amite River near Denham Springs, both located in Louisiana, were forecast to set peak flood records over the weekend.
Forecaster Alek Krautmann said both rivers could flood several homes in suburbs near Baton Rouge.
He also said there is a threat of flooding downriver Ascension County as flooded rivers slowly drain into Lake Maurepas.
Just south of the Mississippi state line in Liverpool, Louisiana, the Tickfaw River was at an all-time high as of 9 a.m. Friday.
Rescuers are still pulling people out of floodwaters in Amite and Wilkinson counties in southwest Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford and his wife and stepson were among those rescued near Gloucester on Friday.
Hansford, 62, says Beaver Creek, normally more than 400 feet from his house, rose rapidly overnight.
He says another stepson who lives nearby warned him.
&quot;We woke up and the water just kept rising,&quot; Hansford said.
It reached up to my waist.
Hansford&#39;s wife told her husband that she has never seen the water in the creek so high in the 48 years she has lived there.
Hansford said that both he and his family members all have disabilities, and that he is the only one who can swim.
Hansford said emergency workers rescued the trio in a large, military-style truck and took them to the Gloucester fire station, where those rescued were staying overnight Friday.
Krautmann says flooding will &quot;spread quickly&quot; as the heavy rains continue, and that officials are planning evacuation orders.
Krautmann says one witness near Livingston reported 13.75 inches of rain between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann said the ground was completely saturated by heavy rain since Wednesday.
Heavy rain and street flooding led to the evacuation of Tangipahoa County residents from their homes and the cancellation of classes in five school districts, officials said.
In Tangipahoa, a city council member said 200 homes were flooded, CBS affiliate WWL reported.
Residents had been evacuated to two churches, but both are now flooded.
County Chairman Robby Miller said authorities rescued 72 people and 7 pets trapped by high tide.
Shelters have been opened in the cities of Amite and Hammond for those who have been evacuated.
&quot;They will be allowed to return to their homes when the water starts to recede,&quot; he said.
In the town of Hammond in Tangipahoa County, twenty streets were closed due to high water, and residents were allowed to pick up sandbags to try to keep the water out of their homes and businesses.
&quot;The last major flood here was in March,&quot; said city administrator Lacy Landrum.
This is becoming a similar case.
In Mississippi, Harrison County Emergency Manager Rupert Lacy said steady rain continued along the Gulf Coast.
He said a handful of houses were reported flooded on Thursday, but so far no flooding has been reported on Friday.
Keith Townson, manager of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.
&quot;I&#39;ve seen water in places I&#39;ve never seen it before,&quot; Townson said, &quot;and it&#39;s still raining.&quot;
Six-year-old Mahaj Brown, who was &quot;full of bullets&quot;, survives the Philadelphia shooting
Police say a six-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, marking the second shooting of a six-year-old in the city this week.
The child&#39;s grandparents told CBS Philadelphia his name is Mahaj Brown.
The grandparents say Brown suffered multiple gunshot wounds to the groin, leg, arm and stomach, but was conscious when taken to the hospital.
&quot;He suffered a lot, his little body was full of bullets,&quot; the boy&#39;s grandmother Delores Melendez tells the station.
I can&#39;t believe it.
At the hospital, the boy&#39;s condition is listed as critical, and several operations have been performed on him.
The family tells the station that he is expected to recover.
The boy was starting first grade at the local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people shot on a Germantown block.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men was reported to be in critical condition; the other two victims were in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot in the front seat of the car along with a 29-year-old in critical condition, the station reported.
The other two victims were not in the car, and police are investigating whether either of the injured men could be the shooter.
Investigators tell CBS Philadelphia that it appears there was a crossfire between multiple shooters.
Assault weapon type casings from various assault weapons littered the scene.
It seems like it was definitely a constant battle.
There were shell casings on both sides of the sidewalk in the street.
&quot;So it appears that there were several armed combatants here, and that they were engaged in an active battle,&quot; Philadelphia Police Chief Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Several houses and vehicles in the area were also hit.
No arrests have been made and according to the information received, the police are examining the surveillance camera tapes.
Another six-year-old, a girl, was hit in the arm by a stray bullet Tuesday while she was playing in front of her home in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
He is recovering and police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
Thus, I call this year&#39;s women&#39;s Olympic gymnastics team, for more reasons than one.
First, I&#39;ve been to every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the USA has never been so dominant.
And second: This team features three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas, and Lauren “Laurie” Hernandez, who have inspired many girls of color.
The composition of this team, complemented by Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocian, makes everyone proud.
This team looks, after all, like America.
It has also established the presence of dark-skinned and Hispanic women at the top of the sport.
For the past four years, the most successful female gymnast has been African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were first and second.
This is awesome.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas surprised as the Olympic champion, and America cheered.
Now the world has witnessed the incredible performances of three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez as they perform unexpected but masterful gymnastics routines.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American woman to win back-to-back individual gold medals in the women&#39;s all-around.
And teammate Aly Raisman got silver.
We see the peak of the sport, but the situation does not look like this in gyms across the country.
Simone, Gabby, and Laurie all followed the same path that Aly and Madison followed in making the Olympic team.
They are the &quot;Final Five&quot; because there will be only four gymnasts on the gymnastics team at the next Olympics, and this is Marta Karoly&#39;s last year as coach.
However, the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport and gymnasts generally train in private gymnastics clubs run by parents who pay for coaching, facilities, travel, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (for coaches and their gymnasts and families) and the list goes on.
Many of these gymnastics clubs are located in affluent suburban neighborhoods that can support the sport.
At these clubs, gymnasts receive all their training, and this is an expensive and long-term commitment for gymnasts&#39; families.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both been coaching their athletes since they first started gymnastics.
We need to bring more affordable and accessible gymnastics training to the communities where the many young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie live.
I founded my gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, we have provided free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem to over 15,000 urban youth (primarily black and Latino) and have coached national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high-level gymnastics to youth who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this remarkable Olympic sport.
Gymnasts develop body strength, flexibility and coordination, as well as mental diligence, discipline and determination.
This combination provides lifelong benefits for good health and success at school and work.
This team&#39;s inspiration is getting thousands of young girls to take up gymnastics, and it&#39;s amazing.
Participating in sports is so important, especially for girls.
We live in exciting times.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for showing some serious &#39;girl power&#39; by winning team gold at the Olympics, and for inspiring so many young girls from all backgrounds to start on the path to healthy, strong and successful young womanhood.
Medical trainees to stage new strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt&#39;s proposal
Ministers had hoped to end the row over the changes by agreeing to an improved contract with British Medical Association officials, but it was rejected by 58 per cent of the 37,000 trainee doctors who took part in the vote.
In July, Hunt revealed plans to force the deal, saying the NHS was on &quot;uncharted territory&quot; and that any further delays would harm staff and patients.
The first medical trainees will be transferred to the new contract, which includes changes to night and weekend working practices to improve care during difficult hours.
Dr Ellen McCourt, chair of the BMA&#39;s trainee doctors committee, said in a statement last night: &quot;Trainees still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, particularly that it will exacerbate an existing workforce crisis and that it does not treat all doctors equally.&quot;
With only eight weeks left before the first group of doctors are transferred to the new contract, progress must be made and time is running out.
BMA&#39;s attempts to resolve the dispute through negotiations have been met with reluctance on the part of the government to participate and at times deep silence.
This is despite Jeremy Hunt&#39;s promise last month that his door will always be open.
“Jeremy Hunt must act now, remove the ban and take the concerns of trainee doctors into account.
If he doesn&#39;t, the medical trainees are prepared to continue industrial action.
The most recent strike at the end of April meant the postponement of nearly 13,000 routine surgeries and 100,000 doctor&#39;s appointments as nurses and consultant doctors were recruited to stand in for doctors on strike.
Ministers had hoped to end the row over the changes by agreeing to an improved contract with British Medical Association officials.
The BMA wants better weekend pay for the 54,000 medical trainees covered by the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, chief executive of NHS Employers, appealed to trainee doctors not to go on strike.
Mortimer said: &quot;Workplace struggles achieve little or nothing but put pressure on already-stretched teams and services, and cause worry, anxiety and disruption for patients, carers and their families.&quot;
Over the past two months, we have been in discussions with the Junior Doctors Committee and, together with the Ministry of Health and others, have responded positively to their concerns regarding the Guardian Role and Whistleblowing.
The employers were hopeful that the continued positive discussion on other important topics - such as development, flexibility of training, additional training for those returning from sabbatical, the costs of training, mutual recognition of the curriculum, study leave and the gender pay gap in medicine - is a sign of how serious employers, the Health Education England training organization and the Ministry of Health are about respecting the agreements reached with the BMA in November, February and May.
A £2-a-day drug could reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are set to benefit from a £2-a-day drug after authorities recommended it be given to people for longer.
The anti-clotting drug, ticagrelor, lowers the risk of recurrent attacks in people with heart disease.
The drug is given as early as 12 months after a heart attack to reduce the risk of a stroke or another attack.
NHS watchdog NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NHS watchdog NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years in order to still reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Around 140,000 people have a heart attack in England every year, and a quarter of these will have a second attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by a build-up of fat in the artery wall, which forms narrowings.
If the stenosis ruptures, it can cause a blood clot that blocks blood flow to the heart, causing a heart attack.
If the clot breaks loose, it can travel with the blood and cut off blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had one seizure have an increased risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by the British company AstraZeneca and sold under the trade name Brilique, lowers this risk by making clots less likely.
NICE draft guidance published today recommends that people be given 90mg of ticagrelor for 12 months, followed by 60mg taken with aspirin twice a day for the next two years.
Professor Carole Longson, head of NICE&#39;s Center for Health Technology Assessment, said: &quot;Despite the availability of effective treatments to prevent progression, up to a quarter of people who have a heart attack will later have another heart attack or stroke, often with devastating consequences.&quot;
The fear of relapse can have a significant negative impact on a person&#39;s quality of life.
The evidence shows that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
By initially recommending ticagrelor, we are pleased to be able to increase the number of treatment options available to the many thousands of people who could potentially benefit from them.
Since the data on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - especially with regard to the risk of bleeding - over periods of more than three years are limited, the draft guideline does not recommend treatment for longer than this period.
The culture of political correctness allows electoral fraud to flourish in Muslim areas
Lutfur Rahman, the former mayor of Tower Hamlets, was removed from office last year for corruption, giving impetus to the government&#39;s report.
A culture of political correctness has led to widespread vote fraud in Muslim communities being ignored, a shocking government report reveals today.
Former government minister Sir Eric Pickles blasts the police, election watchdogs and city councils for ignoring evidence of electoral fraud because of &quot;racial and religious hypersensitivity&quot;.
The former community secretary, now anti-corruption czar, said voter intimidation on religious grounds is so serious that police should be allowed to set up security chains outside polling stations to protect frightened voters.
He recommends that voters should present ID when voting to prove who they are.
Today, the voter only has to say his name and address.
The report even suggests putting indelible ink on the finger of the person voting so that no one could vote twice.
Whistleblowers should be better protected, says Sir Eric.
He demands wider access for the press to council documents and decisions made by informal committees or working groups.
&quot;This would not only protect against electoral fraud, but it would protect local government from the wider culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with electoral fraud,&quot; he said.
The report was commissioned by the government in the wake of the East London Tower Hamlets voting scandal.
Last year, a special election court ruled that the incumbent mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from office following numerous charges of corruption and illegal activities.
The court found that Rahman had &quot;cynically distorted&quot; the religious feelings of his Muslim community and silenced his critics with accusations of racism and fear of Islam.
Rahman is said to have &quot;run his election campaign on the basis that it was the religious duty of faithful Muslims to vote for him&quot;.
Up to 300 votes were questionable or the result of someone voting impersonating someone else.
Sir Eric said there is evidence of fraud all over the country.
He raised particular concerns about electoral fraud in postal voting, where high-ranking members of the Muslim community were said to have pressured people to vote for a candidate of their choice.
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean up the voting system, including proof of identity with ID
He said in his report: “Evidence was presented that vulnerable members of some ethnic minority communities, particularly women and youth, were pressured to vote according to the will of their elders, particularly in those communities with a Pakistani or Bangladeshi background.
&quot;Concerns were raised that...such behavior had been overlooked by state institutions due to &#39;politically correct&#39; racial and religious hypersensitivity.&quot;
Sir Eric came up with 50 suggestions to clean up the system. These included banning political activists from handling mail-in ballots in order to stop &quot;vote harvesting&quot;.
The report, which Theresa May is reviewing, also calls for tougher checks on registrations to prevent the electoral register being used for immigration and benefits fraud.
Check out options for voter ID verification before voting.
Use indelible ink on the voter&#39;s finger so no one can vote twice.
Conduct systematic nationality checks to ensure they are eligible to vote.
Set a three-year limit on requests for automatic voting by mail.
Prevent political activists from handling ready-made mail-in ballots and the envelopes in which the ballots are sent.
Let the police put security chains around the polling places.
Change the law to make it easier to charge people with intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Make photography at polling places illegal.
Insist that only English is used at polling stations (except in Wales).
Reinforce training to ensure staff adhere to the rule that a voter must enter the booth alone.
Sir Eric blasts Greater London&#39;s police force, saying it is &quot;amazing&quot; that no criminal charges have been laid since the Tower Hamlets incident.
&quot;The election court was left behind by Lutfur Rahman and his clerks as a result of numerous corrupt and illegal activities,&quot; he said.
He was found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt based on numerous grounds, according to the threshold of evidence in criminal law.
He also criticized the ineffective &quot;tick the box&quot; checks in the voter registration offices of the city councils.
Sir Eric said: “Last year&#39;s Tower Hamlets verdict was a wake-up call.
Our nation has a glorious heritage as the birth of parliaments, but this disturbing and insidious spread of election fraud and the denial of facts by certain groups threatens this good reputation.&quot;
Crazy about Kate&#39;s cyclist double and other celebrity images at the Rio Olympics
This week, fans at the Rio 2016 Olympics have gone berserk over French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has proven to be the Duchess of Cambridge&#39;s impressive doppelgänger.
But the 24-year-old Olympian certainly isn&#39;t the only athlete fighting for gold this summer to boast a famous doppelgänger of her own - at least according to social media.
So, in honor of the Rio Games and all the famous faces currently gracing our screens, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympic athletes who clearly look like Hollywood celebrities.
The hunter and the wolf: US men&#39;s archery team member Brady Ellison, left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child
In addition to Kate&#39;s doppelgänger found on the cycling track, many people online have been quick to point out how a certain archer could be star Leonardo DiCaprio&#39;s twin.
Brady Ellison, a member of the US men&#39;s archery team, has caused a storm on Twitter after photos surfaced of him looking eerily similar to The Wolf of Wall Street star.
And in fact, after becoming aware of the social media frenzy, the archer admitted that since childhood, he has heard that he looks like a Leo.
&quot;I don&#39;t see much of a resemblance myself, except maybe the beard,&quot; Brady told the Huffington Post.
&quot;He&#39;s a good-looking guy, so I guess this is a compliment.&quot;
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 is sure to come up again this year: the striking resemblance between British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Alya Mustafina, with her big, expressive eyes, has been said to be the double of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Glee star Matthew Morrison for years.
Bigger gear for the eye: This user thinks Nathan is the &quot;athletic version&quot; of the Inception actor
Another long-standing comparison has been between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who both have similar strong eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver medalist Yulia Efimova has more in common with actress Annalynne McCord than tanned skin and blond hair, while Team USA&#39;s Nathan Adrian looks like &quot;an athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt,&quot; according to fans.
Tough women: Soccer star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, share a similar face shape and eyes
Not the only one: One Twitter user was very happy that others saw the similarities too
Presenting a theory: According to this user, there may be a reason between the pair&#39;s similarity
A Twitter user recently took to the site to express her happiness that &quot;the rest of the internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical.&quot;
And indeed, the American football star and the Dexter actress have an incredibly similar face shape and eyes.
Other popular comparisons have included Kerri Walsh-Jennings, with her smile almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney, and gold medal-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas, whose own beautifully wide smile matches that of Bring It On star Gabrielle Union.
CBC Olympics commentator issues apology after calling Chinese swimmer &#39;dead like a pig&#39;
Byron MacDonald&#39;s analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan&#39;s fourth-place finish in the women&#39;s 4x200-meter freestyle relay enraged viewers of CBC&#39;s live Olympics broadcast Wednesday.
The Canadian television company CBC has had to apologize after one of its commentators said during the competition that a 14-year-old Chinese female swimmer &quot;disappeared like a bad smell&quot; and &quot;died like a pig&quot;.
Commentator Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when he began to share some of his own opinions during the women&#39;s 4x200m freestyle relay final.
MacDonald, who joined the CBC commentary team to bring “colour”, was heard saying: “That little 14-year-old from China was slobbering, baby.
Too eager, disappeared like a bad smell, died like a pig.
Thanks for that.&quot;
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second leg of the relay in 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada&#39;s Taylor Ruck, allowing Canada to catch China.
Viewers across Canada were quick to react online after being shocked by the language used and its tone.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: “Did the CBC announcer just say that China&#39;s 14-year-old swimmer &#39;died like a pig&#39;???
The idiot didn&#39;t realize he was still live.&quot;
China&#39;s Ai Yanhan was described in the women&#39;s freestyle 4 x 200m relay final as follows: &quot;That little 14-year-old from China was a mess, baby.&quot;
The backlash against Byron MacDonald on Twitter was fierce and swift, with many challenging him.
Twitter users didn&#39;t hold back when they heard how reckless Byron MacDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: “Wow #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and make us all sound like a bunch of racists. #disgusting.”
Shortly afterwards, Scott Russell, who hosted the CBC broadcast, apologized live for MacDonald&#39;s comment, saying: “We apologize that the comment about the swimming performance made it onto the air.
It was an unfortunate choice of words, we are sorry that this happened.&quot;
The CBC ended up apologizing more than 90 times to people who had tweeted in response to the comment.
Fellow commentator Scott Russell had to apologize on MacDonald&#39;s behalf.
The CBC then copied and pasted an apology to more than 90 Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald&#39;s comments.
The TV company also quickly apologized and released a statement.
We deeply regret that these statements were made and that they were broadcast live.
Last night, we quickly took action and apologized live to our viewers and followers on social media.
To be clear, Byron&#39;s comments were about the swimmer&#39;s performance, not him as a person.
But it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words, and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized live on air and tried to qualify his remark, saying he did not mean it to be interpreted as a personal attack.
&quot;I would like to take this moment to apologize for the comment I made last night after the women&#39;s relay,&quot; she said on CBC&#39;s Olympic broadcast.
&quot;I was referring to the swimmer&#39;s performance, not him as a person.&quot;
&quot;Needless to say, I didn&#39;t mean it disrespectfully, and I&#39;m truly sorry.&quot;
A Primark customer was appalled by a woman who brazenly adjusted underwear in the middle of the store
Customers didn&#39;t know what to look for when a woman undressed in the middle of a Primark store to try on underwear.
It didn&#39;t make matters better that after judging how he looked in the pants, she peeled them off and placed them back on the shelf.
She continued to shop around and finally fitted four pairs of underwear at the shop, which was located in the Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkestone.
A Primark store in Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkestone, where a woman was fitting knickers and then putting them back on the shelf
At the same time, mother-of-two Jenny Davidson, who was in the store, said that after trying on underwear, the mystery woman &quot;put her clothes back on and walked out of the store without buying anything.&quot;
He said, &quot;People couldn&#39;t believe their eyes.&quot;
The woman stood in the middle of the shop floor, took a pair of panties on display, took off her own tights and underwear and put on matching ones.
&quot;He didn&#39;t even try to find an out-of-the-way place for atonement, he just stood there shamelessly.&quot;
&quot;Everyone stared as he took off his panties again and clearly didn&#39;t like them because he put them back on the shelf.&quot;
He did the same for three more pairs before finally deciding he didn&#39;t like anything he saw, getting dressed again and walking out.
&quot;She didn&#39;t seem to care who was watching — or think about the person who would end up buying the panties she was fitting.&quot;
Davidson, 33, who lives in the Kent town, said: &quot;It&#39;s disgusting to think of someone taking home a pair of underwear that someone else has tried on but not cleaned.&quot;
The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added: &quot;I understood that the staff were obviously trying to remove the items from sale after the woman left, which is fine.&quot;
&quot;It would be horrible to go home with new underwear and find that another woman has put them on and taken them off and they haven&#39;t been washed.&quot;
A Primark spokesman said: “Primark is aware of the incident which took place at the Folkestone store on Tuesday 9 August.
All the products in question have been removed from sale.”
This is how you can defend yourself against armed attacks using Krav Maga
The world is dangerous, but this video from Dailymail.com can make it a little safer for you.
We spoke to New York-based Krav Maga Federation Grandmaster Rhon Mizrach to find out how to deal with gun-wielding robbers at close range.
Whether you&#39;re approached from the front or the back, this video shows you how to pay an attacker back in equal measure.
According to Mizrach, if you are approached from behind, the first thing to do is to turn so that you can see your attacker and &quot;clear the line of fire&quot;.
You then grab the weapon between your forearm and shoulder before striking the attacker in the face with your free elbow.
Follow up with a knee to the groin, and when the assailant goes limp in pain, wrest the gun from his hands, hit him in the face with the butt of the gun, and back away, keeping the gun pointed at him.
If an armed person approaches from the front, the technique is similar: remove your body from the line of fire, grab the gun and turn it around so the criminal cannot fire.
At the same time, put weight on the gun and hit the attacker in the chest, then twist the gun out of his grip, step back and point the gun at him.
Does it sound awkward?
Watch the video to see exactly how Mizrachi does this.
But remember, if you&#39;re not a Krav Maga grandmaster, the safest way out of a robbery situation is to give up your money.
Traveler Ian Wright licks the dirtiest places in Europe for a travel guide
A British tourist has given his immune system and gag reflex a serious challenge by licking some of Europe&#39;s dirtiest and most disgusting places.
Suffolk-based presenter and travel writer Ian Wright, 51, would lick a euro note, a railing at Piccadilly Circus, a train toilet flush button and a Russian payphone to prove the strength of his immune system.
Before licking each item, he used a photometer to show himself and us the situation he was about to get into.
However, the experiment, which was made into a film called On the Trail of Inner Power, produced surprising results.
The thought of licking the flush button on a train used by thousands of people may seem completely disgusting, but the kitchen sink actually has more bad bacteria.
On his journey through Europe, Wright constantly spoke to doctors and medical professionals about strengthening gut bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked left a bad taste in his mouth.
Wright became known for testing his intestinal fortitude as he traveled the world eating weird and wonderful things.
From the railings of public railway stations to the toilet flush button, this task really tested his immune system.
In the film he made, he said: &quot;Since I was a child, I&#39;ve been pretty careless about my health, and I&#39;ve put all kinds of things in my mouth, from dirt, worms and dirty water.&quot;
He indeed cemented his reputation during the film.
The only thing he refused was a filthy Russian public toilet.
His sample had a photometer reading of over 4,000 units.
For comparison, freshly washed hands should read less than 60.
But in a Russian public toilet, he refused to lick when the photometer read more than 4,000 units, and his freshly washed hands read less than 60.
Wright has produced the traveler&#39;s film, On the Trail of Inner Strength, together with the Finnish dairy, Valio. The film shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as the bathroom.
In the movie, the bride said: &quot;This is by far the worst thing I&#39;ve ever smelled in a toilet.&quot;
There is nothing dirtier than that!
I&#39;m not going to lick anything because there&#39;s room to sleep here.
In the wake of inner strength, it was produced together with the Finnish dairy, Valio.
The company offered Wright Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D, which help boost people&#39;s gut bacteria and immune system.
Valio&#39;s snacks, juice and new categories manager Niko Vuorenmaa said: &quot;We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that would be fascinating to watch and at the same time explain the benefits of probiotics.
We threw around a lot of crazy ideas and ended up thinking &#39;let&#39;s call Ian&#39;.&quot;
They argue that interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a bigger context: to tell about the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and its connection to the immune system.
The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon, and with the help of this documentary we can tell consumers more about it in an interesting way.
I think the documentary also shows that we have a great sense of humor!
The documentary&#39;s director, Tom Hakala, added: &quot;Let&#39;s put it this way: if Ian had licked some of the things I asked him to do, like the sleeping Russian toilet shown in the film, I would have lost all respect for him.&quot;
Understandably, some of the licks were easier for Ian, while others were quite difficult.
I&#39;m glad we got some of those dirty licks recorded.&quot;
In a survey conducted by Valio in 2015, 84 percent of the respondents linked lactic acid bacteria specifically to the well-being of the stomach and intestines, and 58 percent said that they at least occasionally use products to which lactic acid bacteria have been added.
A family of squatters destroyed a rented house in Saltash, Cornwall, before being evicted
A squatter family caused £50,000 worth of damage to their rented house after they were evicted for terrorizing neighbours.
Tanya Keldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock have been kicked out of their property in Saltash, Cornwall, after numerous complaints about them.
After they had been forcibly removed from the property, shocked housing company officials found the property to be in poor condition.
Gaping holes had been made in the walls, the floorboards had been torn up, waste had been spread on the floor and the walls had been defaced with graffiti.
The family has now moved elsewhere and is believed to be living in private accommodation.
Conna McEvoy, property manager at Cornwall Housing, said she fears the property cannot be repaired.
He said: “This has been a real nightmare for the residents and I don&#39;t think people should have to live like this.
There is a lot to consider here, as this property is likely to be known through Cornwall&#39;s less pleasant groups.
This family is infamous, and their name is infamous.”
The couple had three sons who sometimes lived in the property, and according to the police, the family&#39;s violence included street fights with baseball bats, intimidating nearby residents, drug use, drug sales, and excessive yelling, arguing and swearing.
The 47-year-old Skeldon, whose name was on the lease, received a decision for anti-social behavior in June.
Old waste was found in many rooms of the house under threat of demolition.
The floorboards of the property, from which drugs have been transferred in the past, had been pulled up.
Neighbors said the family was seen fighting in the street, and the police were called regularly.
Cornwall Housing forcibly evicted the woman and her partner from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to voluntarily move out.
Relieved neighbors praised the eviction, saying their lives had become a living hell.
One said, “They didn&#39;t care about anybody.”
We lived as their neighbors for 20 years, and the situation has always been bad.
We&#39;ve seen the police here an incredible number of times.
&quot;This morning we couldn&#39;t sleep.
We got up because it was so quiet here - we&#39;re not used to it!
It&#39;s wonderful now that they&#39;re finally gone.&quot;
Adam Fitzpatrick, neighborhood executive director of Cornwall Housing, said the family was not cooperating with local authorities.
The family has lived in the house for 20 years, and the police were often called to the property
Garbage and old toys have been thrown down on the run-down wall of the rental house.
He added: “It is a shame that the resident did not take any responsibility for his and his family&#39;s behavior as eviction is always the last course of action considered by Cornwall Housing.
This was a very difficult case as the behavior was extreme and their actions must have horrified the neighbours.
I appreciate all the work done by my team, Devon and Cornwall Police and the brave members of the community who gave us information.
I hope this development brings some comfort to the neighbors and sends a message that anti-social behavior will not be tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said the three boys all lived at the property at different times, but they were all in their twenties.
A dirty mattress left on the floor of one bedroom after the eviction
The employees of the housing company now have to clean up the piles of garbage surrounding the house
In 2014, police raided the property and found more than 70g of cannabis, as well as scales, paraphernalia and £1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined after pleading guilty to possessing a Class B drug with intent to distribute.
He claimed the money was for his son Lee Skeldon&#39;s headstone. This one died in a car accident in 2013.
Apparently Tanya and her partner are now living in private accommodation in Plymouth after becoming homeless.
Graffiti had been daubed on the walls of many rooms in the house.
Police say they are looking to evict residents who flout the rules of their leases.
Angela Crow, from Devon and Cornwall Police, said the eviction was a clear warning to other tenants who continue to flout the rules.
&quot;This is a message to those who think their behavior goes unpunished, and to those who suffer from such behavior,&quot; he said.
Devon and Cornwall Police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviour. The police continue to work with their partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal were horrified when a military jet flew low over the beach
Sun worshipers in Aveiro, Portugal got the shock of their lives
A P-3C Orion aircraft of the Portuguese Air Force swept by from very low
The Air Force said it was a training flight and claimed that safety was not compromised
It was at this moment that the terrified tourists began to panic as a low-flying jet swept over the crowded beach.
Dramatic footage shows a military plane coming within touching distance of sun worshipers on a strip of sand in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
The holidaymakers stood up as they understandably became alarmed by the noise coming from the jet, although at first they didn&#39;t see what was coming towards them from behind the clouds.
The incident took place in Costa Nova near Aveiro yesterday afternoon.
One of the many holidaymakers who posted videos of the dramatic flyby on social media was Daniel Fernandes, who said: &quot;It went by twice really low and at one point it looked like it was going to crash.&quot;
Nuno Arroja added: &quot;I was surfing and it really felt like the plane was about to fall on top of me.&quot;
Tourists on the beach in Aveiro were horrified when the plane appeared out of the darkness and flew incredibly low
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on a training flight to identify fishing boats near the coast and had to descend so low because it was the only way to check the boats.
He said the jet had been flying significantly lower than normal due to poor visibility caused by smoke from nearby wildfires, but the Air Force assured that no one&#39;s safety was at risk.
Wildfires have destroyed parts of mainland Portugal this summer, and four people have died in them on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot had to fly low because of conditions that reduced visibility, smoke from wildfires and thick fog.
The aircraft was on a training flight, and as part of the training the pilot was asked to identify fishing boats
Eksoten&#39;s first half result better than expected
The social and health district of South Karelia (Eksote) made a better result than planned by 3.4 million euros in January - June.
Eksoten&#39;s result was a surplus of EUR 4.3 million in the first half of the year.
The result was particularly good in family and social services, where by developing preventive services it has been possible to dismantle institutional care.
The care guarantee was fulfilled in all functions.
This year, Eksote aims to shorten procedure queues.
Eksote covers the previously created deficit with a surplus.
The portion left over will probably be used to shorten queues and buy procedures for patients.
The result for the whole year is expected to be 4.6 million euros better than planned.
Eksoten&#39;s board will discuss the half-year review at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 special border guards took the military oath in Immola
70 conscripts of the Border and Coast Guard School took the military oath on Friday.
The military oath ceremony for the conscripts of the Border and Coast Guard School was organized in Immola on Friday.
The swearing-in ceremony of the tenth special border jaeger course was organized at the garrison&#39;s sports field.
70 conscripts took the military oath.
Special border guards are trained for demanding border security, intelligence and combat tasks.
They serve 347 days.
This year, 310 young people applied to become special border guards.
250 of them were invited to the entrance exams.
Special border guards have been trained in Immola since 2007.
Five veterans of the border forces during the war took part in the veterans meeting organized in connection with the swearing-in ceremony.
The average age of those who participated is now 90 years.
The oldest veterans who participated in the event were born in 1918.
One step ahead of the robber - criminal intelligence helps in solving crimes and reveals serious crime - ESS.fi
Since the beginning of 2014, each of Finland&#39;s 11 police departments has had an RTA, or crime intelligence and analysis unit.
The operation of the unit is invisible to the outside.
In the Häme Police Department, the unit includes a total of four policemen in Lahti and Hämeenlinna.
It is run by a senior constable stationed in Lahti.
The inspector in Lahti acts as the pavement supervisor.
In addition, the strength of the unit includes a civilian dedicated to information technology in Hämeenlinna.
Everyone works in civilian clothes.
The unit has proven its usefulness and necessity, says deputy police chief Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit produces various reports for the rest of the police.
In Häme, it has, among other things, acquired information on asylum seekers.
The latest reform of working methods
The establishment of analysis units is the most recent reform of police working methods.
The goal has been to prevent crimes, that is, that the police would go to the scene less and less often, blowing their whistles, only when they receive an alarm.
With the help of the information collected and analyzed by the unit, daily police activities are targeted where it is most needed.
Along with the reform of the police administration, one criminal intelligence center was established in the country, three national units under it, and each police department has its own criminal intelligence unit.
The PTR center, which operates in Vantaa in connection with the Central Criminal Police, manages operations nationwide.
As the name suggests, PTR units are staffed by people from the Police, Customs and the Border Guard.
RTA units, on the other hand, work in areas divided by police departments, and their task is to provide information to both local police forces and national units.
The inquiry extends beyond one&#39;s own area
Whereas an individual police officer knows what has happened during his 12-hour shift, the role of the RTA unit is to know what is happening in the entire police department.
Intelligence also extends beyond the borders of one&#39;s own institution, because so does crime.
Those working in the RTA unit have better computer skills than the basic police.
With the help of registers, alert task database and observations, the unit aims to draw the police&#39;s attention to new phenomena, prolific criminals or similar crimes.
This is called serialization and is one of the most important tools in criminal investigation.
All people have their own way of doing things.
A handprint can also be seen at work, be it honest or criminal.
Based on the way of doing it, a certain kind of image is formed of the author.
Serialization can be done either on the basis of the act or the person, depending on which one the police have more information about.
Criminals learn from their mistakes
The employees of the RTA unit do not walk around the city with their collars up, but their work is not completely public either.
The methods used by the criminals as well as their own are not disclosed, because it could lead to professional criminals developing their activities and thus trying to prevent the police&#39;s crime prevention efforts.
The police informs the public about the methods if it anticipates that they will cause a threat.
Such a case was, for example, the method of marking vacant apartments used in apartment burglaries, which was reported in the early summer.
In it, the perpetrators put a stick, a pin or a piece of tape in the front door of the apartment, which they used to test whether the residents are really away.
The preliminary investigation material is public at least to the parties involved.
The analysis unit has found that the most professional criminals learn from their mistakes.
The wittiest ones order the minutes of the district court, from which it may appear, for example, that fingerprints have been found at the scene.
Next time, let&#39;s go to the thieves with gloves in hand.
Deputy police chief Tero Seppä from the Häme police, inspector Tuomo Lepola from the Eastern Finland police, crime inspector Sami Joutjärve from the Joensuu police station and crime inspector Arto Tuomela from the central crime police have been interviewed for the case.
The police collects and analyzes information, which is used to plan practical activities.
In the background, the reduction in the amount of labor and funding.
The first steps towards a new operating method were already taken 30 years ago.
The most recent change was the three-phase PORA reform, which ended at the end of 2013.
With national cooperation, information is gathered from outside the own institution and the borders of Finland.
A schoolgirl from London who joined ISIS was killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, is rumored to have died in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said the girl&#39;s family heard she had died in Raqqa, Syria a few weeks ago.
ITV News reported on Thursday that the girl was believed to have died in a Russian airstrike on Raqqa, the organization&#39;s base in the country.
Sultana was 17 and, according to her family, she died just as she was planning to escape the war-torn country and return to Britain.
&quot;One can only hope that the only benefit of the case is that it can serve as a tombstone and a testament to others that there are real risks involved in going to a war zone - that it might dissuade people from making such a decision,&quot; Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other East London schoolgirls flew to Turkey, where they took a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana&#39;s family was told that the girl had married an ISIS fighter in Syria, and that she became a widow after only a few months.
Reid says Clinton would consider Garland a Supreme Court nominee if elected
Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid says he is confident Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton will nominate Justice Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if she is elected president.
Senate Republicans have blocked Garland&#39;s confirmation since President Barack Obama nominated her in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the next president will pick someone to replace the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
Reid said Thursday in a conference call that he predicts with &quot;some degree of certainty&quot; that Clinton will pick Garland.
A representative for Reid later said that he had not spoken to Clinton directly about whether she would nominate Garland and that it was speculation.
He praised Garland and said Clinton&#39;s team would not want to &quot;rock the boat&quot; with another pick.
Garland is the Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Reid said Republicans blocking Garland&#39;s nomination are &quot;minions&quot; and &quot;enablers&quot; of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.
He said Trump is unfit for office.
Treats says the nude calendar is &quot;for women as well as men&quot;
Treats magazine teams up with photographer David Bellemere to release a 2017 calendar inspired by 1970s Pirelli.
But instead of nude celebrities, they&#39;re looking to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Treats chairman Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his nudity-heavy magazine differs from old-school Playboy because &quot;Playboy is for men.&quot;
I do this for women.
Apparently he thinks the calendar is for them too.
&quot;We need to start introducing timeless and classic nudity again where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired by these images of the naked female body,&quot; Shaw said in a press release announcing the calendar.
Women want to be part of this project because it is beautiful art.
Models can submit photos online or in person at open casting events in Los Angeles and New York.
The destination of vinyl: who actually buys records?
Single, middle-aged men love vinyl.
Before you rush to fill the comments section with angry insults written by the moniker NotAllSingleMiddle-Aged Men, note that this statement is based on actual data.
According to YouGov, the much-talked-about new arrival of records is not because more and more people born in this millennium are getting excited about the novelty appeal of physical objects, but because of middle-age angst.
Apparently, those who have recently bought a vinyl record are most likely between 45 and 54 years old.
In fact, the 18-24 age group is the least likely to buy records.
It&#39;s also not just about hobbyist collecting, but it also has an emotional meaning: older vinyl buyers are slightly more likely to keep their feelings to themselves (56% vs 53%) and enjoy being alone (69% vs 66%).
But are YouGov&#39;s results right?
If this blog were a television news report, the camera would follow me as I walk down the middle of a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest gray suit. I would wave briskly before stopping, cupping my hands and saying something authoritative like, &quot;Let&#39;s look into this further.&quot;
Let&#39;s explore it further.
While the charm and grime of Soho is slowly being stripped away - hotels, chain restaurants and shops, and office supply stores now fill the buildings that once housed independent stores - a handful of great specialty record stores still remain.
For the next section, I&#39;d probably ask the camera to stop filming for a while as I stand very close to various men in some of these shops, trying to judge by observing their age and emotional temperament.
Glasgow native Stuart, 55, whom I follow from Sister Ray (count: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (count: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably in his twenties), spends his afternoon in London for a meeting, and wanders the shops to spend a few hours.
I ask if he is a collector.
&quot;I guess I am,&quot; he says.
I have about 3000 or 4000 records.
These boards, shown in the photo above (he emailed the shot, I didn&#39;t follow him home), cover the walls of his living room.
The reason for acquiring such a huge number of records and singles is partly a result of his disposable income: he can now buy records he couldn&#39;t afford when they were originally released, and he can repurchase the ones he sold when he was young and penniless.
&quot;A lot of the material I buy is from the late &#39;60s and early &#39;70s, records that came out when I was 11 or 12, records that I was probably a little too young to get,&quot; he says.
He agrees that record buyers are more likely to be introverts who enjoy their own company, adding: “I don&#39;t smoke and I don&#39;t drink much.
This is my vice.”
25-year-old Wez, who works at Sister Ray, also believes many of the customers he encounters fit the YouGov profile.
However, he has noticed a new wave of people who have been influenced by the media&#39;s enthusiasm. People who have heard that records are back in vogue and have a need to buy back their old records.
Based on the conversations I&#39;ve had, people have gotten rid of their collection usually in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyl to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their records back,” he says.
This may explain the increase in the number of vinyl enthusiasts of a certain age.
But what about the alleged emotional meaning of the records?
At a store like Phonica, it takes a few seconds to realize that record stores offer a comforting community of like-minded types.
According to Wez, some older customers have been particularly hurt by the contactless payment system.
Some vinyl fans may shy away from the digital world and choose to rely on the permanence of familiar album covers; to objects that evoke memories of the happy days of adolescence.
“I think sometimes it can be about filling a void or some kind of comfort that having things creates,” says Wez.
As a collector myself, I agree that this is true, and I believe it is true for many people.
It&#39;s an easy way to fill your thoughts.
&quot;We are like their social workers!&quot; another employee suddenly said from the stack of records.
An April poll conducted by ICM revealed that almost 50% of people who had bought a vinyl record in the previous month had not yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% have a record player that they never use, while 7% of vinyl buyers do not have a record player.
At this point in the news report, I would probably look seriously concerned while browsing through a stack of Bossa nova compilations.
This &quot;reward&quot; aspect of revival is something that Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (count: three middle-aged men), has also noticed.
&quot;Someone came in a while ago and said, &#39;I don&#39;t have a record player, but I want to buy a Radiohead record so we can put it on the shelf,&#39;&quot; he says.
It&#39;s not a large proportion, but it definitely happens.
More product, less music.
We get people who say, &quot;I don&#39;t have a record player.&quot;
So not older people, but younger people, late teenagers, who are just getting excited about it.
At Fopp, where today almost an entire floor is dedicated to vinyls, there is a much more diverse audience when I arrive.
Couples in their seventies, tourists taking photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Although the atmosphere is less relaxed than in the previously mentioned shops - Wild Beast&#39;s freshest synth and sex-filled pop comes from the speakers, and not improvisational jazz - it&#39;s great to see different customers.
None of them seem particularly lonely, but gnawing psychological trauma is hard to prove by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around Fopp for a few minutes, looking at the different records on sale.
He&#39;s window shopping, not spending a lot of money.
He says that Tiena doesn&#39;t make much, so record collecting isn&#39;t really an option.
&quot;It is expensive.
It&#39;s easy to listen to music either on a computer or through something else, but the beauty of vinyl is...” he sighs lovingly.
&quot;I don&#39;t know how to explain it - it&#39;s really unique.&quot;
My last stop is said to have awakened a new generation of vinyl lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While I&#39;m trying to look like I&#39;m researching jean shorts, I spot a group of teenage girls congregating for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and daughter ponder the purchase of a Crosley record player.
To the left is a staircase with a wall covered in records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, essential records for any average collection.
No one looks at them - perhaps because they are only decorations, and some are so high that it would be impossible to touch them.
These are purely &quot;art vinyls&quot;.
But considering that even a little bit of attention these items get can mean more money for the industry and send a few customers to the shacks of Soho for more, there&#39;s not much to complain about here.
It should come as no surprise that the segment of the population that is more likely to have more time and money than others is also the one that spends the most on luxury items like vinyl.
But while my findings suggest that YouGov&#39;s results hold true at least for record stores in Soho, they don&#39;t rule out the large number of female collectors and vinyl lovers that exist in the real world, in record stores and online forums.
These people probably work hard at school or in the office.
They certainly don&#39;t spend their Thursday mornings hanging around Berwick Street record shops, flipping through records and avoiding the gaze of a creepy, 30-year-old fake TV presenter peering over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
The holker is the longest living vertebrate animal - video report
Scientists say the holker has a longer lifespan than any other vertebrate on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studied the shark, says the record is held by a female believed to be between 272 and 512 years old and five meters long.
A French court rejects an application to dismantle shops in the Jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected an application by Calais authorities to demolish dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants from the Jungle camp, which is home to thousands of refugees.
In a court hearing this week, authorities in Calais argued that the state should be able to dismantle a total of 72 makeshift shops where people inside the camp sell things from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts or sell tea for 50 cents (40p), or sell simple food for a few euros in pop-up restaurants.
The office of the prefect of Calais argued that the sites should be demolished because they represent a tax-free parallel economy and because they are a fire and sanitation risk.
Humanitarian groups have told the court that shops and restaurants are vital, saying that free meals provided by the state-backed organization and other groups do not provide enough food for the growing number of people in the camp.
They reasoned that pop-up shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free meals to those who need them.
A court in Lille ruled that there were no legal grounds to evict the 72 people running the makeshift shops, but said the Calais prefect&#39;s concern &quot;was completely understandable&quot;.
Judge Jean-François Molla said grocery stores, cafes and restaurants had a much bigger role than just feeding people &quot;living in extremely precarious conditions&quot;.
He said the facilities provided peaceful meeting places for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places under threat of demolition was the camp&#39;s Jungle Book Kids&#39; Cafe, a non-profit that provides 200 meals a day, English and French lessons and asylum counseling to the camp&#39;s hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect the children&#39;s cafe.
The letter to the Guardian said the closure of the cafe &quot;would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are as young as eight&quot;.
Two charities, Help Refugees and L&#39;Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that the number of people in the Jungle camp had risen to 9,000 - a record high - after arrivals surged over the summer.
Food prices fall clearly faster in Finland than on average in the EU
Food prices are falling sharply in Finland, to the delight of consumers and the chagrin of producers.
The price of food has fallen in Finland by almost five percent in three years, while the average price in EU countries fell by 0.9 percent.
At the same time, food has become one percent more expensive in Germany and Sweden.
In the last three years, the price of food has fallen in Finland, the second most among EU countries with a similar wage level to Finland.
In comparison, only in Britain has the price of food fallen faster than in Finland.
The information appears in an article by Statistics Finland&#39;s development manager Ilkka Lehtinen, which was published in the Tieto &amp; Trends blog.
Lehtinen compared real prices, i.e. prices that are proportional to the general development of consumer prices.
The latest information is from June of this year.
At the beginning of the 2010s, the price of food rose sharply.
In 2013, prices were close to the 1994 price level.
The situation was alarming.
&quot;We were close to losing the price advantage that came with EU membership,&quot; says Lehtinen.
Then there was a turn, after which food has become cheaper year by year.
Now the price is weighed down by food import bans imposed by Russia, which have stifled food exports from Finland to Russia.
Therefore, the supply of milk and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and agricultural producer prices have decreased.
&quot;Putin&#39;s policy has helped the Finnish consumer in the short term,&quot; says Lehtinen.
Intensified price competition in industry and trade has also contributed to the price drop.
The large retail chains S group and Kesko have both lowered their prices.
For the consumer, the price competition has been seen as impressive advertising campaigns.
Finland is still not a hotbed of affordable food, even though the price of food has dropped significantly.
In 2015, food was the fourth most expensive in Finland among EU countries with a similar wage level to Finland.
According to Lehtinen, the price of food sold in Finland is significantly affected by value added tax.
He found that if the comparison countries had the same value added tax rate, the third cheapest food would be sold in Finland among countries with a similar wage level.
Lehtinen compared Finland to Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, Great Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the value added tax rate were seven in the reference countries, only the Germans and the Dutch would sell cheaper food than the Finns.
&quot;If we want to reach the level of the old EU countries in the price of food, we need to halve the value added tax to the average level of the EU countries and continue the price competition,&quot; Lehtinen writes.
Lehtinen points out that the calculations he made with the value added tax percentage are indicative.
The school is no longer the same
Those returning to school may notice that there has been a change in the school during the summer.
A new curriculum has been prepared for the schools, which will be introduced at the beginning of the semester in all elementary schools.
It is an instruction according to which all schools in Finland operate.
The schools themselves decide on the details, but the plan states the official goals.
The new instructions have been prepared for several years, and they differ from the old instructions in many ways.
Among other things, the teaching of calligraphy is given up, and instead schools start practicing coding.
Swedish teaching starts in the sixth grade at the latest, and social studies is read in the fourth grade.
However, the biggest change concerns the role of students.
It used to be thought that the teacher teaches the students, but now everyone has to be active and learn from each other.
In this way, we try to make going to school more interesting.
The world&#39;s longest-lived vertebrate was found - the ice shark can live up to 400 years
Also known as the ice shark, the Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus) reaches sexual maturity only at the age of 150.
It can live for another 250 years after that, reports a new study.
The figures make the species the longest-lived vertebrate in the modern world.
In the fauna, it is surpassed only by the Icelandic mussel, whose oldest known specimen is dated to 507 years old.
Greenland sharks swim along the North Atlantic.
They also hold another record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic.
Females stretch longer than males, they can grow up to more than five meters.
Because the growth rate is slow, according to the observations, only about a centimeter per year, adult individuals have been forced to live for a long time.
But for how long?
Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues found out.
He determined the ages of adult ice sharks from 28 females that had been caught by fishermen.
The age of the fish was revealed by radiocarbon dating of the eye lenses.
The average age of the studied sharks turned out to be at least 272 years.
The two largest fish in the sample, the 493- and 502-centimeter Amazon finfish, turned out to be about 335 and 392 years old.
Since it has been established in previous studies that female ice sharks only reach sexual maturity when they are over four meters long, the researchers calculated that they are around 150 years old at that point.
The study was published by Science.
Almost 300 people were fired from Stockmann - salespeople will not be reduced
Almost 300 employees will be dismissed from the department store company Stockmann.
The joint ventures in the troubled company ended at the beginning of August.
&quot;As a result of the negotiations, approximately 300 jobs will be reduced, the majority of which will be implemented as redundancies,&quot; Stockmann says in his press release.
According to it, the number of salespeople in department stores will not be reduced so that customer service does not suffer.
In addition, around 80 employees of support functions will be offered new jobs as salespeople.
Stockmann&#39;s collective bargaining negotiations concerned approximately 3,000 employees.
When they started, the need to reduce was estimated to be around 380 employees.
By reducing the number of people, annual cost savings of around 20 million euros are aimed at, which are to be realized during the next year.
Stockmann has already started an efficiency program with the aim of achieving savings of 50 million euros this year.
The background is Stockmann&#39;s difficulties in making department store sales profitable.
Although the group&#39;s adjusted operating profit improved to 11.1 million euros in the second quarter, the department store trade is still making a loss.
Stockmann&#39;s acting according to CEO Lauri Veijalainen, sales in department stores have not reached the goals set by the company.
&quot;Unfortunately, staff reductions are necessary in order to ensure Stockmann Retail&#39;s positive operating result in 2018,&quot; Veijalainen states in the press release.
The improvement in earnings in the second quarter was mainly driven by the good success of the clothing chain Lindex.
The chain achieved its best-ever second quarter revenue and profit.
Lindex&#39;s operating profit increased by 9.5 million euros to 28.1 million euros.
At the same time last year, the operating result of the entire Stockmann Group was 4.1 million in loss.
Stockmann estimates that the group&#39;s turnover this year will decrease from last year.
The adjusted operating result is expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday will be the rainiest in the north - the temperature will be below 20 degrees throughout the country
The low pressure center over the northern part of Finland will keep the weather rainy on Friday, says HS meteorologist Ilona Láng.
There will also be showers in the central parts of the country, but further south it will be cloudy.
The temperature is no longer very summery, as the mercury remains below 20 degrees throughout the country.
In the rainy areas of the north, it stays at 10-15 degrees.
The Kenyan athletics team is rocked by a doping scandal - a strange explanation for the coach&#39;s obsession
Kenyan track and field coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Rio Olympics after it emerged that Anzrah appeared as a national team athlete in a doping test.
News agency AP reported that the athlete Anzrah was trying to impersonate is 800m star Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, a member of Kenya&#39;s national team management, said that Anzrah&#39;s identity was revealed after he gave a surprise test as Rotich.
The doping officials went to inform the Anzrah authorities.
According to Soi, Anzrah was sent home because he &quot;committed his crime against the Kenyan national team&quot;.
He posed as an athlete, gave a urine sample and even signed the documents.
We cannot accept this kind of behavior,&quot; Kip Keino, chairman of the Kenyan Olympic Committee, thundered to the news agency Reuters.
Athletics at the Olympics starts on Friday, and Rotich is scheduled to run right then.
It is not yet known whether the runner will face any consequences as a result of the incident.
Rotich finished fourth on the way to the World Championships last year and is a preliminary favorite to win in Rio.
According to Reuters, a source inside the Kenyan track and field team claimed that Anzrah used the athlete&#39;s accreditation card only to get free meals at the competition village.
When anti-doping officials confronted him, they assumed he was an athlete and he was taken for a test.
The coach did not explain the situation to the officials because he was afraid of being exposed,&quot; the source said.
Where is everybody?
Rio&#39;s athletics stadium hums its emptiness
Where exactly is everyone?
At least not in Rio&#39;s Olympic stadium watching athletics.
The fight for athletics medals began in Rio on Friday, but the world&#39;s top individuals got to present their skills to a confusingly empty audience.
The organizers of Rio said on Friday that only 58 percent of the tickets for the first day&#39;s morning games and 65 percent of the tickets for the evening games have been sold.
The other was four years ago in London, where the stadium was full of cheering people.
Tickets for the finals are already sold out even in Rio.
The lack of spectators at the Rio Olympics has attracted attention even before athletics.
For example, thousands of empty benches have been seen in the stands of rugby, rowing and horse riding.
When Brazil&#39;s medal hopefuls Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played beach volleyball in the legendary Copacabana, the stands were only 70 percent full.
After the Brazilian duo, Holland played against Russia, and only about 30 percent of the 12,000-person stand was filled.
The bad performance can be explained at least by the fact that Brazil, which is struggling with economic difficulties, is far away for European and Asian race tourists, and many of the Olympic sports are strange for Brazilians who are used to football.
However, even the first match of the Brazilian football team could not fill the football stadium.
Mario Andrada, the spokesman for the race organizers, said over the weekend that 82 percent of the tickets had been sold at that time, which is clearly a lower number than four years ago.
&quot;There are still 1.1 million left to sell,&quot; Andrada said, according to Reuters.
Of the 8.5 million tickets for the London Olympics, 8.2 million were sold, even though the tickets cost almost half as much as in Rio.
In Rio, ticket prices have varied from around nine euros to over a thousand euros at the opening.
More than half of the tickets cost less than 16 euros.
At the London Olympics, volunteers and military personnel were allowed to sit in empty seats, but this is not yet allowed in Rio because organizers need money and are trying to sell tickets until the last minute.
In Rio, however, the organizers have given 240,000 tickets to schoolchildren for lesser-known sports in the country, such as golf and rugby.
There were enough empty seats in the Rio stadium in the morning.
Even beach volleyball on the Copacaba sand has not interested the public.
Jukka Keskisalo competed in London 2012.
There were enough people in the galleries.
A new way to protect nature - get the right to land
The Helsinki Foundation participates in nature conservation in new ways.
The foundation, founded last year, acquires ecologically significant nature areas.
After that, private individuals, companies and communities can claim ownership rights to the land with money.
The foundation has acquired its first piece of land in Lapland.
The land area is divided virtually into blocks, which those who wish can acquire against payment of the right of ownership.
The holder gets the right of veto over his 187 square meter block, which practically means that approval is not required from every holder if the purpose of use of the land area is to be changed.
Ownership rights can also be acquired for several blocks.
Acquiring management rights is something tangible that can be left as an inheritance or given as a gift.
You don&#39;t need to carry banners or chain yourself somewhere in order to protect nature,&quot; explains Juha Leviäkangas, who acquired the ownership right for his company.
The person who acquired the management right gets exact location information for his block, which makes it possible, for example, to visit the block.
On the foundation&#39;s website, the name information of those who have acquired rights of ownership is displayed on the same map where the block information of the land area can be found.
Leviäkangas only sees the risk of its nature conservation procurement as the fact that the foundation&#39;s operations will change from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation has been established as a non-profit foundation whose purpose is to promote the protection of the environment and nature.
The risk is that the foundation would somehow operate unethically or commercially, but that should not be possible.
The basic idea of the Helsinki Foundation&#39;s Haltija project is the protection of natural areas so that they are allowed to remain untouched and in peace.
The foundation acquires land either by purchase or as a donation.
It finances its operations mainly through the sale of ownership rights, but the foundation received its initial capital from its founders.
The purpose of the foundation is to acquire more protected lands.
It also aims beyond the borders of Finland and plans to acquire land in Australia.
The Helsinki Foundation presents its activities in a pop-up forest at Helsinki&#39;s market square from the 13th to the 19th. August.
Bike thieves torment Turku the worst of the big cities - check the situation in your home municipality
Bicycle thieves torment Turku the worst of Finland&#39;s big cities.
This year, in proportion to the number of inhabitants, more bikes have been stolen there than in the other nine largest cities.
Based on bicycle thefts reported to the police, Helsingin Sanomat found out how many bicycles and their parts were stolen in the ten largest cities between January and August of this year, calculated per thousand inhabitants.
In addition to Turku, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti came out on top.
According to the police, there were four to five bike thefts per thousand inhabitants.
On the other hand, in Espoo and Kouvola, only about two bike thefts per thousand inhabitants were reported to the police.
That&#39;s a big difference.
&quot;In other cities, in proportion to the number of inhabitants, there are twice as many thefts compared to others,&quot; characterizes Tommi Reen, Police Inspector of the National Police Board.
The Turku police are wondering why the city is at the top of the comparison.
It is extremely difficult to say why more bikes have been stolen in Turku than elsewhere.
I don&#39;t have an answer for that.
&quot;The frequency of thefts can be affected by how much people move around on bikes in the city and how many bikes there are in general,&quot; thinks Chief Constable Teemu Äikäs.
Tommi Reen of the Police Board considers it quite expected that Turku, Helsinki and Oulu come out on top in the comparison.
The number of bicycle thefts largely depends on which are the study and cycling cities.
Turku has a dense city center, short distances and a lot of bikes available for thieves.
&quot;Espoo, for example, is a completely different type of city, where the city centers are far from each other and the bicycle is not necessarily the primary means of transportation,&quot; says Reen.
Throughout Finland, slightly fewer bike thefts have come to the attention of the police in January-August than in the same period last year.
There is still no cause for great joy.
Despite the downward trend in recent years, the police come to the attention of slightly more than 20,000 bike thefts every year.
That means 50-60 fillers every day and in Helsinki alone about 4,000 bikes a year.
&quot;They&#39;re big numbers,&quot; says Reen.
In reality, thieves take more bikes, because only some of the victims report the theft to the police.
Reen urges people to report bike theft, even though less than one in ten cases reported to the police are cleared.
A typical resolved bicycle theft is one in which the police are informed of the theft immediately and the thief is caught red-handed.
&quot;Cases are also solved in connection with other investigations, when, for example, stolen bikes can be found in an apartment in a drug case,&quot; says Reen.
In Helsinki, bike thieves are caught weekly in the act or in connection with a police investigation, says senior constable Timo Leppämäki.
According to him, bikes are stolen, for example, from bike racks in shopping centers, courtyards, warehouses and bike cellars, i.e. practically everywhere where they are usually stored.
As in previous years, Jopo is the most stolen of the individual bike models.
The U-lock gives the bike better protection than many other types of locks.
Some thieves take the bike, for example, for their own short-term use, but a large part of the stolen bikes ends up being sold, for example, via the Internet.
They remain on the domestic market.
&quot;At least it hasn&#39;t come to the attention of the police that stolen bikes hardly ever go abroad,&quot; says Reen.
According to the police, the buyers of stolen bikes are ordinary Finns.
Some people probably buy a stolen bike without knowing it.
Some may have doubts about it.
The buyer of a used bike must be careful, as he may be guilty of the crime or violation of concealment.
&quot;Alarm bells should ring if a bike in good condition is sold at a clearly underpriced price,&quot; says Reen.
Special library clerk Severi Hirvi always carries his colorful Nops to the shelter of the Kallio library in Helsinki during his work day.
He has had five bikes, but none of them have been stolen, says Hirvi. &quot;It has never been carried away, a good monk has been there.&quot;
&quot;Perhaps this doesn&#39;t attract thieves that much, it doesn&#39;t necessarily have hipster value either,&quot; thinks Hirvi from Helsinki.
Siiri Valve, who was doing some quick shopping at a kiosk in Kallio, Helsinki, locked his bicycle with a small u-lock.
Now the bike was banging against the stall wall, but usually Valve locks their bike to something solid, like a bike rack.
&quot;You have to think about it a lot, because this bicycle is the most expensive thing I own,&quot; says the student from Helsinki about his white bicycle, whose frame alone cost about five hundred euros.
&quot;You hear from friends all the time that bikes have been taken.&quot;
&quot;Mostly bad bikes, such rämä-Jopos&quot;.
A bike was stolen from Valvee himself from the courtyard of the housing association a year ago.
However, the bike had not been locked, so Valve knew how to wait for it to be stolen.
Under 15 years of age responsible for their crimes?
Helsinki is experimenting with peer jury crews familiar from the United States
In Helsinki, a so-called peer jury is being tried to prevent young people from falling into a cycle of crime.
Initially, the experiment will be applied to children under the age of 15, who will now be exempt from criminal liability.
A peer jury intervenes in the first crime committed by a young person.
The idea is that the peer jury discusses what happened with the perpetrator of the crime and determines the sanction.
A week later, the perpetrator of the crime can himself join the peer jury to make amends.
Other consequences can be, for example, a letter written to the family explaining what has been done and what has been learned from it.
Youth Executive Director Tommi Laitio says that the model is not strict.
We have other mediation models that are used in parallel.
&quot;All of them guide the young person&#39;s activities in a more responsible direction, so that everything doesn&#39;t get ruined by the first mistake,&quot; says Laitio.
The peer jury is modeled after the United States, where it is widely used.
The idea is that after his first crime, the young person will not be brought before an adult panel, but will reflect on what happened with people of roughly the same age.
The model has been tried once.
Iikka Lovio, a service designer at the service design agency Palmu, who followed the experiment, says that it was an assault that was successfully resolved.
Especially the first crimes of children under the age of 15 may not have been dealt with at all before.
&quot;It&#39;s been a message to continue on the path you&#39;ve chosen,&quot; says Lovio.
The peer jury is part of the Immigrant Youth Helsinki project, which is supported by the City of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
Lovio emphasizes that new ways of working are offered to everyone in need, not just immigrant youth.
More than 70 Republican influencers want the party to stop funding Trump&#39;s campaign
More than 70 influential Republicans are said to have signed a letter asking the party to stop funding Donald Trump&#39;s presidential campaign.
The letter was reported by the US newspaper Politico, which had received a draft of it.
According to the newspaper, the open letter is addressed to Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee.
The signatories want the party&#39;s money to be directed to the congressional elections instead of the Trump campaign.
&quot;We believe that the divisiveness Donald Trump has created, his recklessness, incompetence, and record-breaking unpopularity threaten to send a landslide to Democrats in this election,&quot; the letter says, according to Politico.
Only directing all possible funds immediately to the congressional elections can prevent Republicans from drowning with a Trump-decorated anchor around their necks.
According to the letter, the decision should not be difficult, as Trump&#39;s chances of winning the presidential election are decreasing day by day.
Politico writes that the letter is scheduled to be sent next week.
Among the signatories are politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the people who organized the letter is prominent anti-Trump Republican Andrew Weinstein.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said the letter comes from &quot;people who want the party to protect its majorities in Congress&quot; and that it is not an endorsement of anyone.
The letter lists several actions by Donald Trump that are believed to have offended millions of voters.
In addition, he is said to have displayed dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 national security officials announced in an open letter that they do not support Donald Trump for president.
Clinton promises relief for US families with children
In the United States, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton told the details of her economic policy on Thursday evening.
I am running for president so that the American economy will do well for everyone.
&quot;Donald Trump is running for president so that the economy will do well for him and his friends,&quot; Clinton said in her speech.
At the center of Clinton&#39;s plan is a massive, $275 billion, five-year program to improve America&#39;s infrastructure -- roads, bridges and airports.
This would be financed partly by tax increases on the rich, partly by private money.
The construction program is a helping hand for the American Dunas, who are suffering after the factories moved to the countries of cheap labor.
Clinton called the program the largest investment in good-paying jobs since World War II.
We are a nation of builders, we must get back to building!
Clinton said.
On Thursday, Clinton also promised to ease the situation of working families with children.
On Thursday, he sounded like Sanders anyway when he emphasized that the rich should pay their fair share of taxes.
And if a company leaves the United States as a tax refugee, it must pay an exit tax, Clinton said.
Today, he opposes the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he once supported.
&quot;[As president] I will oppose any trade deal that works against workers or against wages,&quot; Clinton vowed.
According to speculations published by The Washington Post before Clinton&#39;s speech, Clinton was going to criticize the economic program announced by Republican Donald Trump on Monday for &quot;only favoring millionaires like this&quot;.
Clinton has previously called Trump&#39;s proposed drastic reduction in corporate taxes &quot;Trump&#39;s loophole&quot;.
On Thursday, Clinton emphasized that she herself is the daughter of a small businessman.
He reminded listeners of the small businessmen whose bills Trump has failed to pay, and of the clothes that Trump himself makes in China and Mexico.
&quot;If he wants to make America great again, he should start by making his own products in America,&quot; Clinton quipped.
These are the viewership figures for Rio: The games haven&#39;t glued Finns to the screens, but the mobile app is interesting
Usually, sports competitions appear in television viewership statistics as sharp mountain peaks.
So far, the Rio Olympics have not reached huge numbers of spectators.
At one time, the games have glued at best 12 percent of the population to the screens: Tuesday night&#39;s swimming was watched by 615,000 viewers on Yle&#39;s Olympic channel TV2 at the same time.
For comparison: a month ago, the EC athletics championships brought almost 800,000 viewers to TV2 at a time, and the European soccer championships had a good half a million.
Among the Olympic sports, Sunday night&#39;s cycling and the balance beam, which opened the fifth day of the competition, have attracted the most interest so far, both of which reached almost half a million viewers on the Olympic channel at a time.
The head of Yle sports, Panu Pokkinen, is satisfied with the number of spectators, and reminds that the spectators will be divided into several different media for the first time at the Rio Olympics.
In addition to television, Finns watch the Olympics from the Rio Arena.
We are satisfied with how many TV viewers choose the Olympics in general.
On the television side, viewers are also divided into TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
The Rio Olympics are the first sports competitions to which Yle has dedicated an entire channel.
When the broadcast is broadcast 24 hours a day, and there are 20,000 to 500,000 viewers all the time, that&#39;s a good base.
The number of spectators is lower than in the 2012 London Games or the 2008 Beijing Games, but the difference is partly explained by the time difference - a large part of the Rio Games broadcasts in Finland is at night.
Another reason for lackluster interest - if anyone considers it lackluster - is surely a traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken a surprise medal in the preliminary games, interest would have jumped up with it.
In addition, athletics is just starting, as are other sports that interest Finns: sailing and horse riding.
According to Pokkinen, the number of viewers at the beginning has been close to what was expected.
When the athletics start, the viewership explodes.
Yle launched the Yle Rio 2016 mobile application for the Games, which became the most downloaded free application in Finland in the Apple App Store in the first days of the Games.
By Monday, the application had been downloaded 150,000 times.
I would bet that now we are already going to around 200,000 downloads.
&quot;We will only get the network viewership figures later&quot;, Pokkinen says
Rio Areena has not worked as expected for all users.
Pokkinen says that feedback has been received and the faults have been fixed.
The use of Rio Areena has been associated with a delay and other small technical problems in the initial phase.
Updated versions of the applications have been received, which should fix the errors.
The Rio Olympics are shown on Yle&#39;s channels and Arena more widely than any other sporting event ever before.
You can watch some sports on the Yle Fem channel, and on the radio Yle Puhe broadcasts the competitions daily.
The Olympics are not only perhaps the busiest for Yle ever, but also the last ones that can only be watched on Yle&#39;s channels.
From 2018, Olympic sports can be seen both on Yle and on commercial channels.
How deep is Finland&#39;s deepest lake?
According to official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is Päijänne, which is 95.3 meters deep at Ristinselä.
It might be even deeper.
Technical diving instructor Matti Kannela found a depression of about 20 square meters in Ristisela, the depth of the bottom of which the dive computer showed as 104 meters.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environment Agency tried in vain to confirm the observation by echo sounding.
The method may not find a small depression in a hundred meters, development engineer Jari Hakala says.
So far, the official depth is still 95.3 meters.
Other deep lakes are Inarijärvi (92 meters) and Suvasvesi (90 meters).
Saimaa, Toisvesi and Pääjärvi reach more than 80 meters.
They have not been studied as thoroughly as Päijännett.
The bottom of Lake Inarijärvi in particular has not been accurately mapped.
&quot;You could very well find unknown depths there,&quot; Kannela reflects.
If the deepest lake is defined by means of the average depth, it is Suuri Jukajärvi, 23 meters.
Viewed this way, Päijänne does not make it into the ten deepest and Suvasvesi is even further away from the top.
Fix August 12 at 14:29: Fixed the last paragraph where the lakes with the deepest average depth were wrong.
A wonderful tax break: Taxation of pensioners still tighter
The taxation of pensioners is still tighter than that of wage earners.
Ihalainen says that the problem came up during the parliamentary elections and it was promised that the taxation of pensioners would be equalized compared to wage earners.
This is not included in the government&#39;s proposal.
We think it should definitely be there.
We should be able to keep the promises made after the elections, he tells Lännen Media.
At the beginning of this year, wage earners received income deductions, which reduced taxation.
The matter heated up the opposition representatives in the parliament, who grilled then finance minister Alexander Stubb (co.k.) for his election promises.
Purchasing power is safeguarded, it does not increase
According to Ihalainen, in the policy on tax reductions presented by Finance Minister Petteri Orpo (council), it is mainly about securing purchasing power and not increasing it, because wages will not be increased next year.
He says that the tax cut will have a positive effect on purchasing power and employment, if other issues do not increase people&#39;s uncertainty.
Ihalainen is satisfied with the messages from Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center) and Orpo about the desire to respect the hard-won competitiveness agreement.
He says that sticking to the agreement is important in terms of credibility.
It is the most important economic and employment policy measure of the government period.
It was made with the help of labor market organizations, so it shouldn&#39;t be wasted by questioning it.
It becomes necessary because the economy depends so much on domestic demand and people&#39;s own faith in the future.
Prolonged unemployment is caught in the rush
Ihalainen appeals to the government to tackle long-term unemployment in the budget crisis, or at least stop its growth.
There were about 17,000 more long-term unemployed in June than a year earlier.
He says that unless growth stops, the government&#39;s goal of raising the employment rate to 72 percent will slip away.
He warns that if the challenge of prolonged unemployment is ignored, there will be a very large social decline.
Ambassador: As far as we know, there were no Finnish victims in the attacks in Thailand
At least four people died in the bombings that took place in Thailand last night and last night Finnish time.
The embassy urges Finns in the country to be attentive and avoid the busiest tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
There is no reason for Finnish tourists planning to visit Thailand to cancel their trip because of the explosions, but the embassy&#39;s instructions on caution should be followed, says Westphalen.
There are very few Finns in Thailand
According to Westphalen, there are currently very few Finns in Thailand, although it is difficult to estimate their exact number.
Finns travel to Thailand at the turn of the year.
The majority of tourists to Thailand come from Southern Europe and China at this time of year.
The Finnish embassy has received some comments from Finns in Thailand via Facebook after the bombings.
The embassy has tried to target Finns in Hua Hin in particular to get information about the city&#39;s situation.
However, several of our contact persons in Hua Hin are out of town at the moment.
In general, everything seems to be fine, says Westphalen.
No information about the author
According to Westphalen, there is still no information on the perpetrator of the attacks.
The ambassador speculates that the events may be related to the political unrest in Thailand&#39;s divided society and last week&#39;s referendum on the constitution drawn up by the military junta.
The law was approved in a referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
In the country, among other things, people were arrested who announced that they were against the law.
In the southernmost provinces of Thailand, an ethnic-national conflict related to the Muslim population is simmering, says Westphalen.
Muslims want to increase their right to self-determination.
In the past, however, attacks have not been extended to tourist destinations.
Today is a big, local holiday in Bangkok, says Westphalen.
According to him, the city celebrates the Queen&#39;s birthday and Mother&#39;s Day.
There is very little traffic in the city.
The attacks affect the course of the day so that the authorities are very careful about security.
Thai police: The attacks are not about international terrorism
According to the police, the attacks are &quot;local sabotage&quot; and differ from usual terrorist attacks.
Islamist terrorism has also been ruled out, according to the Thai police news agency AP.
In Thailand, at least four people have died during the day, when 11 bombs have exploded across the country, such as in Phuket and Hua Hin, which are popular with tourists.
In the tourist destination popular with Finns, four bombs exploded at night on the holiday island of Phuket, reports the Thai newspaper Bangkok Post.
According to current information, there were no casualties.
According to the newspaper, two of the bombs exploded on Patong Beach.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nga, where one person was injured, according to the newspaper.
According to the local authorities, a total of four bombs have exploded in the popular tourist destination of Hua Hin yesterday and today.
At least one person was killed in both twin bombings.
In addition, at least one bomb exploded in the village of Surat Thani and the city of Trang in southern Thailand.
At least one person was killed in both attacks.
Surat Thani is also familiar to many travelers, as it is the route to the holiday islands of Ko Samui, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao.
The perpetrator of the attacks is unknown
According to Prayut Chan-O-Cha, the head of Thailand&#39;s ruling military junta, the perpetrator of the attacks is still unknown.
Bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
We should not incite people to panic any more, he told reporters.
According to Deputy Prime Minister Gen Prawit Wongsuwan, who is responsible for security, at least the attacks in Hua Hin and Trang are connected.
He told Thai BSB that the purpose of the perpetrators was to destroy the country&#39;s tourism, as all the attacks have taken place in tourist destinations.
The Embassy of Finland urges Finns in the country to be attentive and avoid the busiest tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
Finns planning to go to Thailand have no reason to cancel their trip because of the explosions, but they should follow the instructions of the big delegation about caution, says Westphalen.
Wounded Europeans
So far, very little is known about the attacks that took place during the night in Finland and their victims.
We have had time to get a little more information about last night&#39;s attack in Hua Hin.
It killed a local woman and injured more than 20 others, including at least nine foreign tourists.
Among the wounded are at least Germans, Italians, Dutch and Austrians.
At least three people were wounded in the latter attack in Hua Hin.
Two bombs exploded near the famous clock tower.
Thai PBS reports that police have cordoned off an area in Hua Hin where they believe they have found another bomb.
The Surat Thani bomb was hidden in a flower bed, according to the provincial governor.
A municipal employee died in the attack.
At least one person is injured.
The police chief interviewed by CNN says that two bombs were also used in the Surat Thani attack, which exploded about half an hour apart.
According to the Bangkok Post, the bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
Biles of the United States won the women&#39;s quadruple
USA&#39;s Alexandra Raisman was second with 60.098 points and Russia&#39;s Alija Mustafina was third with 58.665 points.
Biles, 18, is still aiming for pole vault, vault and beam championships at the Rio Games.
Biles has pretty much dominated women&#39;s gymnastics for the past few years.
He has eight individual world championships from the previous three seasons.
He has won the championships in the quadruple and permanno three times in a row, as well as the boom last year and the year before.
With the US team, Biles has won two world championships in the team competition.
Biles has fainter World Championship medals in vault and beam.
Finnish entrepreneur in Thailand: &quot;The strike has no effect on tourism&quot;
Esa Huovila, who runs a real estate agency in Phuket, Thailand, and a children&#39;s play club located in the same property, is not worried about the impact of the bombings in Thailand on tourism.
If there are no more attacks, I don&#39;t think anything more miraculous will follow, says Huovila, who has worked as a Finnish entrepreneur in Asia for about twenty years.
The experienced entrepreneur has seen up close many of the tragedies that have afflicted Thailand.
There&#39;s always something here.
First there was the tsunami, then the bird flu and last year the bombing in Bangkok.
If these trips haven&#39;t chased away tourists before, this one probably won&#39;t either.
Huovila&#39;s company office is located a few hundred meters from the explosion site.
Huovila heard about the attack from its own employee.
The employee called at around nine o&#39;clock local time and said it was not a good idea to come to the office.
Huovila says that both the promenade and the main street, Bangla Road, were completely closed early in the morning due to the attacks.
Many of my local workers came to the workplace in the morning as usual.
They thought the roadblocks were put in place because of the queen&#39;s birthday, Huovila says, referring to Friday&#39;s public holiday in Thailand.
In Patong, the atmosphere was calm and the shops on the main street were allowed to open at around ten o&#39;clock local time.
Many people on the beach had not even heard of the attacks.
At half past three in the afternoon Thai time, traffic in Patong had returned to normal and most of the shops had opened their doors.
Based on the impact site, the explosion was quite small, says Huovila, who visited the impact site.
Later, the car in question was seen in Kruunupy on Jouxholmintie.
When the police arrived, the car had been set on fire.
The patrol found two men matching the characteristics hiding in a nearby copse.
The other man was immediately arrested.
The other ran away, but the man was later found in the woods with the help of a police dog.
The men are suspected of theft of a motor vehicle, theft and aggravated damage.
The police would like to thank those who gave tips.
Research director on Russian leadership transitions: Clear displacement
On Friday, Russia underwent the most high-profile change of leadership in years, when President Vladimir Putin fired the head of his administration, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov&#39;s successor is 44-year-old Anton Vaino of Estonian background.
He is an ex-diplomat and served as Ivanov&#39;s second in command.
Kangaspuro says that the reason for Ivanov&#39;s dismissal may be Putin&#39;s desire to prevent powerful people around him from amassing too much power.
He adds that rotating management positions is one way of using power.
This is a way to prevent people from amassing power independent of the president.
According to Kangaspuro, it is also possible that Ivanov has fallen out with other executives or made a mistake.
Demotion for Ivanov
Ivanov, who was part of Putin&#39;s inner circle, will be transferred to the special duties of environmental and transport affairs.
In the tape shown by the state media, Putin said the change was a joint decision.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had requested a transfer to other positions and proposed Vaino as his replacement, reported Russia Today.
Kangaspuro says that from Ivanov&#39;s point of view it is a clear drop in status.
Environmental and transport issues are not very high in the order of importance in Russia.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most prominent people at the top of Russian power.
In addition, Ivanov has played a significant role in the President&#39;s Security Council.
During the Soviet Union, Ivanov worked with Putin in the KGB.
He was considered a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev became president.
Kangaspuro points out that the old guard, for example governors, have recently been replaced in Russia.
Senior researcher Katri Pynnöniemi from the Foreign Policy Institute says that more interesting than the successor to Ivanov is the fact that Putin is changing his inner circle to a younger one.
Isis fighters used civilians as human shields during their retreat in Syria
They used civilians as human shields when they fled to the town of Jarabulus so that we wouldn&#39;t target them, said Sherfan Darwish, who is a representative of the Manbij Military Council.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, civilians were placed in hundreds of cars in which they were taken to Jarabulus.
Last week, Arab and Kurdish fighters captured about 90 percent of the city of Manbij, which is important to ISIS.
However, according to estimates, dozens of jihadists remained in the city at that time.
Corrected previous news at 7:30 p.m.: Earlier we incorrectly reported that civilians were fleeing the city, actually ISIS fighters kidnapped civilians while fleeing the city.
Professor: The Ministry of the Interior&#39;s policy on document disclosure is against the law
The Ministry of the Interior&#39;s policy on the disclosure of documents is against the law, says Tomi Voutilainen, professor of public law from the University of Eastern Finland.
Voutilainen tells STT that document disclosure cannot be based on the authority&#39;s own guidelines, but is based on the law.
The Ministry of the Interior previously refused to hand over the list of participants of the Minister of the Interior&#39;s events to Ilta-Sanom.
The minister justified the decision with the instructions of the government office and the fact that the information was recorded in the minister&#39;s calendar and not in the accounting material.
The ministry&#39;s director of communications tells STT that the ministry has noticed a need to reform practices.
Usain Bolt&#39;s last Olympic show begins in Rio
As in recent years, Bolt has been running against time during the prestigious competitions.
He injured his hamstring early in the season and had to miss the Olympic qualifiers in Jamaica.
It hasn&#39;t been perfect preparation, but I&#39;m in much better shape.
I&#39;ve been training well and that&#39;s the key, Bolt said at his press conference in Rio.
That press conference included scantily clad samba dancers and fans-turned-journalists.
The buzz around Bolt underscores that the Jamaican&#39;s star has risen in an era when athletics has struggled with doping scandals and slipping interest.
Bolt&#39;s previous loss at the Olympics came in Athens 2004, when he qualified in the 200m heats with a time of 21.05.
At the time, 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise slowed down by injuries and a lax training attitude.
Four years later, in Beijing, his reign began in the 100 meters, where he crushed the world record and the confidence of his competitors, despite the final celebration, with a time of 9.69.
This is more difficult
A year later, at the World Championships in Berlin, Bolt reached the legal mark of his career measured by the clock.
The world records of 9.58 in the 100 meters and 19.19 in the 200 meters, set in Berlin, are still valid.
In Rio, Bolt has announced that he is aiming for a 200-meter world record and under 19 seconds, but no one believes in its creation other than Bolt himself.
In the 100, Bolt&#39;s toughest challenger is the Athens 2004 100 Olympic champion Justin Gatlin.
Last year, in the World Cup final in Beijing, Bolt defeated the American by only one hundredth of a second.
During his reign that started in Beijing, Bolt has not lost in the finals of the prestigious games even once, if only he has made it.
In Daegu 2011, Bolt missed the 100 World Championship final due to a false start.
Bolt will turn 30 in just over a week.
He is an old man in the junior men&#39;s sport, and the Rio Games will be his last Olympics.
Bolt has set next year&#39;s World Championships in London as the last finish line of his career.
These are the Olympics that separate me from others.
I&#39;m older and this is harder.
&quot;But every time I&#39;m down, I remind myself: this year I have to do it,&quot; Bolt said three months ago in an interview with Sports Illustrated.
Revelations from Rio: two athletes are suspected of a doping violation
According to the Chinese state news agency Xinhua, Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 18, has given a positive doping sample at the Rio Olympics.
Traces of banned substances were found in Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi&#39;s doping sample.
Bulgarian runner Silvia Danekova is also suspected of a doping violation.
In addition, the Kenyan track and field coach was sent home because he gave a doping sample on behalf of the athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with signs of epo hormone.
She finished fourth in the women&#39;s 100m butterfly in Rio.
According to the Brazilian newspaper Estadao, the Chinese swimmer has taken his doping case to the CAS of the International Court of Appeal for Sports.
Xinhua reports that signs of a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide would have been found in the sample given by Xinyi on Sunday.
Other doping suspicions have also come to light in Rio.
The BBC reports that the Bulgarian female hurdler Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with signs of the epo hormone.
Kenya, on the other hand, sent the track and field coach home from Rio because of a doping violation.
The International Olympic Committee IOC said on Thursday that the Kenyan coach had pretended to be an athlete in a test situation and had given a doping sample on his behalf.
According to media reports, it is the Kenyan sprint coach John Anzrah.
According to the Daily Mail, he had used the race pass of 800 meter runner Ferguson Rotich in the situation.
Nothing can stop Phelps - the historic gold came in show style
The most successful athlete in Olympic history, American Michael Phelps swam his 22nd Olympic victory in the 200m individual medley in Rio.
Michael Phelps has already won 22 Olympic golds.
At the same time, Phelps became the first swimmer to win Olympic gold in the same sport in the fourth consecutive games.
Phelps&#39; winning time was 1:54.66.
Japan&#39;s Kosuke Hagino finished second in the medley ahead of China&#39;s Wang Shun.
I&#39;m just trying to have a little fun, BBC Olympic swimming commentator Helen Skelton laughs in Iltalehti&#39;s quick interview.
The story about Helen Skelton (right) on Monday is one of the most read on Iltalehti&#39;s website this week.
Next to commentator Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton does not stress much if there is a little noise on social media or in the British press about her revealing and unusual outfits.
After all, television is a visual medium, he emphasizes.
Skelton is dressed in high-heeled shoes and a short dress, which is certainly at least enough revealing - at least to the eyes of many conservative British viewers.
However, there will be no back steps.
It&#39;s important to look good, and little bumps are just fun.
Skelton certainly wants to shock and perhaps startle, but he insists that he does not want to be in the lead role.
This is not about me, he states.
We are here to watch sports, and the focus must be on the athletes.
It shouldn&#39;t really matter how I dress.
Can you imagine that the commotion has reached Finland?
I can&#39;t, but anything that draws attention to how hard these swimmers work and how big the sacrifices they make is fine with me, Skelton grins.
You know what?
It&#39;s an uproar over nothing if it comes from (the presenter&#39;s) dressing.
I&#39;m a little amused if this has hit someone&#39;s radar.
Rio police made two arrests on suspicion of terrorism
Rio police announced on Thursday that it has arrested two people on suspicion of terrorism.
The police made the arrests in connection with the security control of the Games.
In the same connection, the police made five other arrests and interrogated two people before releasing them.
All the suspects have been Brazilians.
According to the G1 news website, the people arrested for terrorism belong to the same group whose members were arrested by the police already in July.
Those arrested are believed to have connections with the ISIS extremist organization.
The arrested had reportedly incited violence on social media.
Messages calling for violence had been spread, among other things, on the popular WhatsApp service.
85,000 police officers are responsible for the security of the Rio Games.
The police blew up a suspicious package in Rio
Spain and Nigeria had to start their match in the opening group of the Rio basketball tournament in an empty hall on Thursday.
The police found a suspicious package in the basketball arena and closed the place to the public.
The police let the public in after detonating the package in a controlled manner.
This was the third time during the Rio Olympics that police have carried out a controlled explosion mission.
The police closed the arena because of a suspicious package found there.
The public got in after the police had detonated the package in a controlled manner.
The audience did not make it to the stands by the start of the match, because the police closed the arena for a while due to a suspicious package found in the hall.
The police blew up the package and only allowed the public into the hall afterwards.
The bang woke up the Spanish team, which had a sleepy start to the competition.
Spain, who started the tournament with two losses, beat Nigeria with 96-87 points.
In the two previous games, Spain won silver.
The police carried out a controlled detonation mission already for the third time during the Rio Summer Games.
Most recently, the police had to blow up a suspicious find near the finish line of the road cycling last Saturday.
Spain and Nigeria started their opening group match at the Rio basketball tournament in front of empty stands.
The Argentinian lady booed Petäjä-Siren - the Finn pondered the protest
Tuuli Petäjä-Siren had a colorful competition day in Rio.
Tuuli Petäjä-Siren had a hard time on Thursday.
The Argentinian lady beat Tuuli Petäjä-Siren on Thursday in Rio at the opening start of the women&#39;s surfing day.
The wind was clearly broken.
The opponent conceded a foul.
He got stuck because of the crash, and the others ran away, Finland&#39;s head coach Joakim Wilenius said.
The athlete considered protesting for a long time.
It wasn&#39;t worth doing then, because it would have been pointless according to the Olympic rules.
I should have fallen into the water to get a refund, Petäjä-Siren stated.
The Finn hung on to his board until the end because he didn&#39;t want to get into Rio&#39;s dirty water.
Due to the crash, the Finn started in 27th place.
Overall, the London 2012 Olympic silver medalist is eighth.
Regarding the tip, the crash didn&#39;t affect much.
Friday is an important day, when the races start from 10-12.
Edited 0.39: Contrary to the first information, Petäjä-Siren did not protest.
7 special things that, according to science, make you live longer
Science has explored everything possible between the earth and the sky.
These things have been proven to add years to a person&#39;s life.
Some things are habits that directly or indirectly affect a person&#39;s health so that their life is extended.
Sometimes things that the person cannot influence can bring him extra years.
These include, for example, a tendency towards obesity or social status.
Regular shopping can extend your life.
You don&#39;t always have to rush - just fetching a can of milk is enough.
Many different studies have tried to find out the secret of long life.
Medical Daily presented seven of the strangest research results.
According to science, all of these things can lead to more years of life.
Drinking beer and coffee
Drinking coffee has been found to protect against some cancers, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer&#39;s and Parkinson&#39;s diseases.
A Harvard University study found that moderate coffee consumption is associated with a &quot;reduced risk of death,&quot; especially from neurological or cardiovascular diseases.
In favor of alcohol, studies show that moderate consumption - one to three doses per day - may prolong life.
For example, one found that wine drinkers lived to be older than people who didn&#39;t drink at all.
Regular flossing can extend a person&#39;s life by up to six years, one study says.
The claim is based on the fact that this prevents gingivitis.
They, on the other hand, can contribute to the onset of other diseases elsewhere in the human body.
A study conducted in Norway found out how laughing affected a person&#39;s lifespan.
The seven-year project monitored more than 54,000 people.
Those who laughed more were 35 percent more likely to be alive at the end of the experiment.
Sex, when protection against sexually transmitted diseases is taken into account, is good for health according to many studies.
On top of that, it can also prolong life.
Unfortunately, simply having sex as such is not enough.
In order for a person to get extra years in his life, he must also have an orgasm.
Of course, being physically active brings extra years, there&#39;s no denying that.
Achieving a long life, however, does not require absolute stealth.
In fact, a study by the University of Oxford found that women with big behinds had lower cholesterol levels.
They also had more omega 3 fatty acids in their bodies.
The same study linked these factors to lower mortality.
Whether it&#39;s an Olympic medalist or an Oscar-winning actor, he&#39;s more likely to live longer than the average chubby person.
Many studies have tried to find the reason for this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that will bring extra years to his life.
Some researchers, on the other hand, suspect that long life is due to a person&#39;s social status - which in turn enables the pursuit of recognitions such as the Nobel Prize.
A study investigating the shopping behavior of people over the age of 65 found that a person who shops every day is likely to live to be older than a person who shops less often.
This is because walking around physical shops reduces loneliness.
Again, it has been found to trigger biological mechanisms that may hasten death.
So put down your credit card - online shopping therefore does not have the same effect.
A drunk driver derailed towards the truck
On Friday evening, a serious head-on collision between a truck and a car took place in Varsinais-Suomen Koski.
The accident happened in Koski, halfway between Koskentie and Sorvastontie, on Friday at 21:00.
The truck had been driving in the direction of Forssa, when the oncoming car had driven into the same lane, hitting the right corner of the truck.
The truck remained upright in its lane after the collision, but caught fire.
The driver managed to extinguish the fire himself.
The passenger car skidded into a ditch and from there over the ditch onto its roof.
A woman born in 1972 who was driving a passenger car was trapped in her car.
The emergency services removed the injured driver from the car, and he was transported to Turku University Central Hospital for treatment.
The woman&#39;s breath test result was 2.02 per thousand.
He is suspected of aggravated drunk driving.
The post office sent loose candies to the wrong city
Salon K-Citymarket&#39;s selection of loose candy was missing because the post office had accidentally delivered part of the load to Seinäjoki.
Teija Haltia, who lives in Perniö, was buying loose candies at Salon K-Citymarket on Thursday, when a funny sign caught her eye.
Unfortunately, there are product shortages in bulk sweets, because Posti delivered our load to Seinäjoki!
We&#39;ll get more when Posti gets the load delivered!
If you don&#39;t have a traffic jam when mowing the lawn, the sign said.
The sign attached to the merchant is related to the fact that Posti expanded its services last spring to also cover grass cutting.
Posti offers lawn mowing until the end of August.
Haltia thought the sign was mostly amusing and decided to share it on social media.
The popularity of the update blew me away.
Media representatives have also been calling all the time, and the attention this matter has attracted is incredible, Haltia wonders.
On Friday evening, Haltia&#39;s update had more than 700 shares on Facebook.
Haltia was able to grab her favorites in a bag of loose candy, even though a few boxes were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesoja, who is responsible for Posti&#39;s Business Transport Services, apologized for the damage to Ilta-Sanom.
The background is that three of the five pallets went astray to the wrong place yesterday (Seinäjoki) and we no longer went to make a partial delivery (to Saloon) with three, but only took five pallets today, Kaidesoja told Ilta-Sanom.
Ilta-Sanomat was the first to report on the matter.
Teija Haltia was not upset by the sign, because she found all her own loose candy favorites in the selection.

Piia Koriseva, Lotta Backlund and Mikael Saarinen were involved in the Do it now project.
I get a lot of strength and enthusiasm from your pictures, when I&#39;m on the same journey myself, says another.
In the spring, Lotta lost the last kilos with the Let&#39;s do it now project.
At that time, he told Iltalehte that he wanted to finally reach a normal weight, which at the time was ten kilos away.
During the three-month fitness course, five kilos were finally lost.
The wish of the family of a woman murdered in Loviisa: Remembering the victim for the benefit of police dogs
The family of a 42-year-old woman who was murdered in Loviisa a week ago hopes that the victim would be remembered with a donation for police dog work instead of flowers and addresses.
Sipoon Veterinary Clinic has published a Facebook update in which it conveys the wish of the victim&#39;s family for donations to benefit the police dogs.
The publication says that the victim had worked as a substitute at the Veterinary Clinic in Sipoo and had also completed her nursing training there.
The veterinary clinic remembers the woman with touching words.
Happy, smart, with a sense of humor and not afraid of work.
Good friend.
We still can&#39;t quite fathom that he&#39;s gone.
The Facebook update includes an account number where donations can be transferred.
The update mentions that the donation money will go entirely to the police dogs, primarily to the purchase of safety vests.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old Loviisa woman was murdered in her own backyard in Loviisa&#39;s Koskenkylä.
The woman&#39;s neighbors have told Iltalehte that the victim was very fond of animals.
He owned several animals, including a horse, dogs, cats, chickens and a rooster.
The 27-year-old man suspected of the murder did not know the woman and they had no connection with each other.
The police dog Börje was involved in the pursuit of the murderer, which was fatally wounded during the arrest.
However, Börje survived and is recovering.
The District Court gave Posti a verdict for violating the Equality Act
Posti had no right to withhold the salary of an employee who refused to train a temporary worker, the district court of Kanta-Häme judged in its verdict.
The district court ordered Posti to pay the employee the largest part of the withheld salary and 2,000 euros as compensation for discrimination.
According to the judgment, Posti could have withheld only a part of the orientation worker&#39;s salary that corresponded to the orientation&#39;s share of the entire day&#39;s work.
According to the district court, the employee was placed in a less favorable position based on his trade union activities, in violation of the Equality Act.
The employee had complied with the organizational decision of the Postal and Logistics Union PAU on the ban on orientation.
During the postal strike in November last year, PAU made a decision according to which Posti employees will not train contract workers who break the strike.
It was first reported by Kansan Uutiset.
Turkey must return to a path that respects human rights
Turkey must return to the path of democratic and human rights-respecting development, write Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps.) in their response to the Journalist Union.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (PS) agree on the human rights situation in Turkey.
The Union of Journalists previously asked Sipilä and Soin in their letter to express their concern for freedom of speech and the press in Turkey.
Sipilä and Soini say that Finland has repeatedly highlighted the importance of press and freedom of speech to Turkey.
Putin fired the head of his administration - replaced by Vaino of Estonian background
Russian President Vladimir Putin has fired the head of the presidential administration, Sergei Ivanov, the Kremlin says.
Anton Vaino, the grandson of Soviet Estonian communist leader Karl Vaino, will replace him.
Vaino is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has served as deputy head of the presidential administration since 2012.
Vaino will also become a member of the Russian Security Council, the news agency Interfax reports.
Vladimir Putin fired the head of his administration.
According to the Kremlin press release, Ivanov, who was part of Putin&#39;s close inner circle, will be transferred to the special duties of environmental and transport affairs.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had requested a transfer to other positions and proposed Vaino as his replacement, Russia Today reports.
Ivanov worked together with Putin during the Soviet Union in KGB espionage.
Many considered Ivanov a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev became president.
Ivanov was appointed to his position in 2011 before Putin&#39;s re-election as president in 2012.
BBC: ManU&#39;s giant acquisition suspended - not seen in Premier League opener
The world record holder for football transfers will not be seen on the field when the English Premier League kicks off at the weekend.
Paul Pogba&#39;s suspension followed him to England.
Manchester United&#39;s giant signing Paul Pogba is on the sidelines due to suspension when ManU opens their league season on Sunday against Bournemouth, reported the BBC on Friday.
According to the British media, ManU paid 105 million euros for Pogba to the Italian club Juventus.
However, the English Football Association FA keeps him out of the game, as Pogba was banned from Juventus.
He received two bookings in last season&#39;s Coppa Italia and will be banned for one match.
That suspension has been transferred to England, the FA told the BBC.
Pogba&#39;s next game is in the second round of the league on August 19, when ManU face Southampton.
In Flow, megalomania is a virtue
The exact criteria of entertainment and ambitious visions have established Flow Festival&#39;s position as an internationally respected event, which is starred by the world&#39;s top artists.
Flow Festival starts on Friday in Helsinki.
Festival-goers have typically expressed themselves with distinctive clothing.
One of the artists on the main stage this year is the punk legend Iggy Pop.
The event area of Flow Festival will be styled with, among other things, artificial grass and art installations.
It has never been enough for us to just have a main stage and a marquee, says Tuomas Kallio, artistic director of the event.
This weekend&#39;s Flow Festival in Helsinki&#39;s Suvilahti has grown from a small block party to an event with tens of thousands of visitors.
The success is based on a simple question: What kind of event would the creators themselves like to go to?
It is quite unusual for event productions to think like this.
Often the goal is to reach the level of necessity and act in accordance with the official regulations, says the event&#39;s artistic director Tuomas Kallio.
He knew a week before the event that Flow would sell out again this year.
The goal has been to increase last year&#39;s 70,000 visitors by 5,000 people.
A number of interesting domestic and foreign artists will be seen at the festivals again this year.
The increase in the number of visitors is a good thing, because things have to be financed in some way.
On the other hand, we don&#39;t want to grow too much, because at some point the mass would be like a herd of cattle being guided along huge avenues.
That&#39;s not what we want.
Over the course of 13 years, the ideology of the successful event has been expanded so that the area, partly decorated with artificial grass, has 130 performers, art installations and numerous restaurant outlets and drink bars.
In addition to the main stage and smaller performance stages, this year&#39;s venue will be a tent for 15,000 people.
Kallio admits that the event could be implemented more simply.
Maybe I&#39;m a little bigoted, but at the same time we&#39;ve managed to keep the spirit of Flow.
If you lose it, this is no longer our business.
For Kallio, the greatest joy and reward for the work done is that nowadays even big visions are practically possible.
In the early years of the event in the mid-2000s, the operation was very dependent on the support of around 20,000 euros from the city of Helsinki.
Last year, the turnover of the limited company that runs Flow was around six million euros.
It can be used to create &quot;creepy things&quot;, such as the construction of that 73 meter wide tent.
Flow&#39;s visitors have typically expressed themselves with distinctive clothing.
Alongside the music event, we can talk about the community of trendy young adults.
However, the event is not consciously profiled as particularly fashionable.
Above all, we want to stand out with content.
Still, fashion phenomena also fit Flow&#39;s world of values: curiosity and the desire to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
This year, one of the artists on the main stage is punk legend, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
The man has a huge fan base in his own genre, but he is not the most typical performer at a festival that combines indie rock, pop music, rap and soul.
According to Kallio, Iggy was booed because this is probably the last time he will be seen at a concert in Finland.
We are interested in everything, history and the future.
Not just what is played on commercial radio.
Iggy&#39;s latest album is damn good and he&#39;s been doing damn good shows in recent years.
Bombs in a Thai tourist paradise were hidden in flower pots - tourists fled in terror
Two bombs exploded in Hua Hin local time on Thursday evening.
At least one local woman died and more than 20 were injured in the attack.
The bombs were apparently hidden in a flower pot and detonated using mobile phones.
The bombs were placed on a street where most of the customers are foreigners.
They were detonated at the same time as tourists started to leave the bars and return to their hotels, police spokesman Samoer Yoosumran told CNN.
Edwin Wiek, a wildlife protector who has lived in Asia since 1989, tweeted a picture that speaks volumes about the attacks.
If the tweet is not showing properly, you can view it here.
At least 11 of those injured in Hua Hin were foreign tourists.
A crowd ran towards me and said that a bomb had exploded near the bars.
It happened on one of the biggest bar streets, Swedish tourist Emelie Olsson told Aftonbladet.
The next morning local time, two bombs exploded in Surat Thani.
At least one died.
The number of wounded is not yet known.
Very soon after this, two bombs exploded on the island of Phuket, which is also popular with Finns.
No one is known to have died.
At the same time, there was another twin bombing in Hua Hin.
At least one was killed and three were wounded.
In addition, one bomb exploded in the city of Trang.
The police said that they reportedly found at least one bomb in Hua Hin that had not yet had time to explode.
According to Thai authorities, rebel forces who are not satisfied with the actions of the Thai military leadership are probably behind the bombings.
According to local authorities, criminal organizations may also be involved.
According to Aftonbladet, the police have recently caught up with the activities of criminal organizations involved in human trafficking.
KSML: This part of the new standby forces is the first to go into battle in a war situation
In an acute war situation, conscripts are ordered to combat duty only several months after taking the military oath, says Keskisuomalainen.
According to Brigadier General Jukka Sonninen, the head of training of the Defense Forces interviewed by the newspaper, for example, out of the conscripts who serve for 5.5 months, only those who are in the final stages of their training are fit to fight in a war situation.
According to the head of training, reservists from the standby forces will be assigned to the service first.
No conscript or reservist is ordered to a task for which the required training has not been given, says Sonninen.
Earlier in the summer, it appeared that the Finnish Defense Forces will start training conscripts for immediate readiness units starting next year.
If necessary, units can be used in military operations already during conscript training.
Pamela Tola received giant compensations from Hometalo
Actress Pamela Tola and her ex-husband, CEO Pauli Waroma, have won a bitter dispute over the apartment they bought in Espoo in 2009.
The purchase price of the two-story detached house had been 330,000 euros.
However, after the sale, a serious moisture problem was revealed in the house, which caused microbial growth that was dangerous to health.
The couple had to sell the apartment in demolition condition in 2014.
The sale price had dropped to 132,000 euros, so Tola and Waroma accumulated a financial loss of no less than 198,000 euros.
The couple took the matter to court and there demanded a price reduction from the seller.
The seller denied the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case in both the district court and the court of appeal.
The Court of Appeal gave its verdict in the case on Wednesday.
It upheld the judgment of the district court, by which the seller was ordered to pay Tola and Waroma EUR 150,000 in price reduction.
In addition, the seller has to compensate the couple&#39;s court and settlement costs totaling 47,344 euros.
The court reasonably reduced the price slightly, because the buyers had already known about the need for some repairs in the apartment when the apartment sale was made.
However, according to the court of appeals, the construction defects that appeared were substantially more serious than what had been presented.
Tola was looking for a good home
Tola told the court of appeals that the couple had specifically been looking for a home in good condition because they did not want to start repair work.
He had the impression that the building has been renovated and is in good condition and that there is no harm in the things mentioned in the condition inspection report.
In the condition inspection report, ventilation and the fact that the management of rainwater and meltwater running down the rock surface is not sufficient were mentioned as risks and problems.
Based on the discussions, however, it did not appear that it was an urgent matter at all.
Tola and Waroma were left with the impression that the rainwater coming from the rock should perhaps be controlled a little within a few years.
The transactions were made in October 2009.
Within a few years, it became apparent that the moisture problems in the apartment were much more serious than thought.
In the inspections carried out in 2012 and 2013, microbial growth was found in the building, which, according to witnesses, was caused both by rainwater from the rock and by capillary rise of soil moisture.
On the west side of the house, according to the inspector&#39;s assessment, the air contaminated by microbes could also reach the interior through the porch.
Mold or yeast that could pose a health risk and exceed limit values was found in smear samples from the utility room, the basement staircase, the bay window of the living room, and the basement laundry room.
The terraces were built without permits
The court also disputed whether the apartment had been expanded in violation of the building permit.
The court considered that Tola and Waroma were not aware of the decision of the city of Espoo, according to which changes had been made to the apartment contrary to the permit, before the transaction was made.
Among other things, the terraces had been built, although the appropriate permits were not yet available.
However, mold problems were a key issue in court.
According to the Court of Appeal, the buyers could assume, based on the information they received from the seller before the sale, that the building was suitable for living as is and that there was no need for extensive repair work in the near future.
In the opinion of the Court of Appeal, Tola and Waroma had no special reason to conduct a more extensive inspection than usual.
The buyers have not neglected their reporting obligation, the Court of Appeal states in its verdict.
Horrifying archival discovery: hundreds of thousands of women wanted to give birth to children for the Nazis - the register also includes Finns
In his recent Dagens Nyheter article, journalist Christopher Andersson writes how the US National Archives in Maryland has microfilmed documents concerning a total of 218,500 women, all of whom wanted to marry SS men.
Most of the women are German, but there are also American, French, Dutch and Russian women.
In addition, at least 65 Danes, 86 Norwegians, 14 Finns and 31 Swedish women wanted to be Nazi brides.
The documents and registration cards come from the racial office that operated in Nazi Germany.
The Racial Office operated under SS leader Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he had been examined by an SS doctor.
The same applied to an even greater extent for women who had to be able to give birth to more than 10 children.
According to Andersson, gynecological examinations were performed on the women to clarify the matter.
The Racial Agency found out the women&#39;s backgrounds, among other things, by examining church records.
The purpose was to ensure that there were no Jews in the women&#39;s family tree.
The women also had to be ready to give up their Swedish citizenship and provide the breed office with handwritten biographies and good recommendations from relatives.
The Race Office wanted guarantees that the women were &quot;child-loving&quot;, &quot;thrifty&quot;, and &quot;good National Socialists&quot; who knew German well.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as brides for SS men.
The story does not tell what happened to the 14 Finnish women found in the archive&#39;s documents.
SS leaders created a state-sponsored program known as Lebensborn in 1936.
Among other things, the program stipulated that every SS man should have four children, either in or out of wedlock.
Lebensborn homes take care of children born out of wedlock and their mothers.
However, the program was not promoted very actively, according to the website of the American Holocaust Museum.
Instead, Nazi population policy focused on the family and marriage.
The state encouraged marriage by offering loans and supported having children.
The German Mother&#39;s Cross of Honor was awarded to women who had given birth to at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between &quot;Aryans&quot; and &quot;non-Aryans&quot; were prohibited by law, the museum&#39;s website states.
Petäjä-Sire&#39;s sixth, Nirkko rose and fell
Tapio Nirkko finished third in the first start of the sailing Finnjollie day at the Olympic Games in Rio, but was at the tail end of the whole group in the second start of the day.
Nirkko rose to eighth overall after five starts, but the failure of the second start dropped him to 14th place.
Tuuli Petäjä-Siren fought for 17th and 3rd places in the RS:X class day&#39;s starts.
In the overall situation, Petäjä-Siren is sixth.
In the 470 class, Joonas and Niklas Lindgren finished in 23rd place at the opening start of the day.
In the overall situation, the Lindgrens are in 19th place.
Jari Sillanpää&#39;s Satulinna was recorded with a couple of hours of sleep: &quot;I was so nervous&quot;
Jari Sillanpää has been one of Finns&#39; favorite artists for more than 20 years.
Sillanpää, who rose from a barman on a cruise ship to the tango king of 1995, the best-selling solo artist in Finland, and a star of dance stages and parties, still manages to rock and is currently on a wild rise.
The book Jari Sillanpää - Baljaana, written by Mari Koppinen, about the life of the favorite singer, was published today, Thursday.
In the book, Sillanpää talks about his life and career, both good and bad.
Sillanpää&#39;s career took off when he won the tango king crown at the Seinäjoki Tango Market in 1995.
In the competition, Sillanpää sang tangos, but he had already planned slightly different music for himself.
In the spring of 1995, Jukka Kuoppamäki had composed a tango song for Sillanpää at his husband&#39;s request, which Kassu Halonen adapted to a slightly different form.
The Satulinna song became one of the most popular songs in Finnish music history.
The book says that the recording of the song did not go exactly as planned: Sillanpää sang it on the tape with a terrible hangover and after only a couple of hours of sleep.
We had a party in the evening.
I was so upset!
Sillanpää recalls in the book.
From the recording of the song, which became a huge hit, you wouldn&#39;t immediately guess that it was sung in a hangover.
Even though I wasn&#39;t at my best physically, the aftermath was still good.
I learned that you don&#39;t have to demand perfection and perfection from yourself all the time.
Another coincidence related to the man&#39;s most popular songs, which is told in the book, happened almost twenty years later.
In 2013, Sillanpää broke up with his partner at the time, and the case eventually ended up in the lyrics of the song You deserve gold, which was released as a single in 2014.
The book says that the Song Lyrics ordered from Saara Törmänen were not what Sillanpää would have wanted.
Sillanpää had imagined that he was making a record that tells a true story about his own life, but the words of the song about the breakup were not true, but were written based on the news from the 7 days magazine.
In the newspaper&#39;s news, the reason for the breakup between Jari and his ex-lover was stated to be Jari&#39;s excessive partying and alcohol consumption, but according to Jari, it was complete bullshit and not true.
According to the book, Jari called the record company in a rage and refused to sing the song, but in the end he ended up singing it anyway - and that&#39;s a good thing.
In June, the British surprised even themselves by voting their kingdom out of the EU.
In the end, 52 percent of the voters supported leaving and 48 percent would have remained in the union, even though opinion polls during the voting week predicted the opposite result.
British economists and economic institutions were almost unanimously in favor of remaining in the EU.
Not a single prestigious research institute or university voted for the separation, although a couple of individual researchers did not agree with the mainstream of their profession.
The basic mantra of Western politics, former US President Bill Clinton&#39;s recent election campaign theme phrase &quot;It&#39;s the economy, stupid&quot; flew into the scrap heap in the UK&#39;s Brexit vote.
Economists were shocked when their voices were not heard.
They were shocked when the economy didn&#39;t even seem to be the most important thing in politics.
Financial jargon
In its latest monthly survey, the Center for Macroeconomics asks the profession for answers to the Brexit disaster.
The most typical answer is that the economists were not listened to, because this time the voters made the decision on other than economic grounds.
One explanation given by economists for the loss of economic status is that people do not understand economics.
Many people still have the idea that the number of jobs is independent of the number of people working, so almost constant.
If an immigrant gets a job, it will be taken away from a real Briton.
Many also have the idea that a decrease in the value of the currency would be a good thing because it would promote the export industry.
In the opinion of the economists, the voters did not believe the economic arguments, because the consensus of the economists was not sufficiently presented.
They were particularly annoyed by the fairness of the BBC, which gave as much space to economists in favor of leaving the EU, representing only a couple of percent of the economists, as to the overwhelming majority.
The EU-hostile press was not interested in telling what the IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE and other combinations of economic powerhouses think about the consequences of the separation.
Those distant letter combinations spoke facelessly about economic growth, trade relations, national debt and currency.
And if the economists&#39; messages were both listened to and understood, they were not taken care of, because the economists represent an elite with whom the voters, in their own opinion, have no common interests.
Academics in big cities like economists would have stayed in the EU, but the message was not effective in small towns and rural areas.
Immigration is also an economy
The overwhelming winning argument for the Brexit vote was about immigration.
An immigrant takes your job, an immigrant overcrowds your hospital, an immigrant takes advantage of you.
These arguments are valid.
Every cafe has foreign workers.
How many more jobs would the Brits have if they left?
You see immigrants in the waiting room of every health center.
How much easier would it be for Britons to get doctor&#39;s appointments if they didn&#39;t exist?
There are children of immigrants in every school.
How much easier would it be for the children of real Britons to get a place at school if they got rid of them?
Foreigners live in every municipality.
How much more space would the natives have if they faded away?
I think these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
However, economists did not manage to answer them, and even if they did, their answers did not get visibility.
Economists failed to explain that thanks to immigrants, Britons have more jobs, fewer queues at health centers and more money for education and social security.
Immigrants - and EU immigrants in particular - are net contributors to the British public finances, and their consumption creates jobs.
Aberdeen real estate fund braced for Brexit with cash
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments are managed by Finnish Pertti Vanhanen.
According to him, Aberdeen was prepared in time for Brexit by preparing plans A and B.
Plan B, i.e. the victory of the EU-leave camp, began to be prepared in more detail a few weeks before the vote, just in case the result was Leave.
The concern was that investors would start pulling their funds out of the market.
Real estate funds do not normally have large liquid assets, but now they might be needed.
We went to increase cash reserves.
When Brexit happened on the 23rd, we had 25 percent of the fund&#39;s investments in cash or liquid assets, Vanhanen says of Aberdeen&#39;s only open daily quoted real estate fund, which was affected by the news.
According to Vanhanen, the normal level would be 15-20 percent.
The value of the fund at the time was £3.5 billion.
In total, the company&#39;s funds are worth around £20 billion.
It was the highest amount in nine open-end real estate funds, Vanhanen says of all open-end real estate funds in the UK.
He estimates that the lowest amount of cash in these funds was ten percent or even less.
Real estate funds therefore prepared for Brexit with very different strategies.
Funds closed trading
When the pro-EU exit camp won, Europe went haywire.
However, the two weeks following the vote in the real estate market were quite calm, Vanhanen says.
Then two things happened that changed the situation.
The first was the speech of Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, in which he estimated that Brexit could be a big risk for commercial real estate operators.
In addition, the first of the real estate funds, Standard Life, froze its trading.
Together, they seized the situation and brought it to the headlines of the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was immediately compared to 2007 and 2008, says Vanhanen.
This made investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained calmer, but private investors got nervous.
The snowball started rolling, and fund after fund had to close its doors.
Aberdeen was doing well because of the cash raised, but it too eventually had to freeze trading for six days.
According to Vanhanen, they did not actually close trading, but changed the pricing downwards.
In practice, according to him, investors were given time to consider whether it is worth pulling money out in a panic.
Aberdeen&#39;s message was that if you don&#39;t have to take your money out now, it&#39;s not worth it because it would result in losses.
That calmed the situation down, and most canceled the announcement.
After that, it was quite steady, and now the market has been very calm for a couple of weeks, Vanhanen says.
He points out that, for example, Aberdeen&#39;s continental European funds have not experienced any similar upheaval.
However, there were a lot of inquiries.
Unreasonable attention to real estate funds
In Vanhanen&#39;s opinion, the closures of real estate fund transactions received an unreasonable amount of attention.
The open-ended funds affected by the closures control around four per cent of UK real estate.
Aberdeen&#39;s closure lasted six days and the company sold off less than ten of its 80 properties in London.
Some other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned its investors this week that it may hold onto its fund until mid-2017.
There is uncertainty in the air at the moment, and economic growth forecasts have been slashed downwards, but the situation does not look any &quot;wilder&quot; for Aberdeen.
The biggest questions now concern the future development of the British economy.
Despite the uncertainty, the situation has even brought some real estate investors new opportunities, Vanhanen points out.
The exchange rate between the pound and the dollar is at its weakest in 30 years, and the market is also 15 percent off compared to the time before the Brexit vote.
A dollar buyer can now buy the same property for up to 30 percent less.
There are many willing buyers, Vanhanen says.
Brexit brought disadvantages to the London real estate market
At two in the morning, the situation still didn&#39;t look too bad.
But at four, when Pertti Vanhanen, who is responsible for real estate investments at the British real estate fund Aberdeen Asset Management, woke up again to look at the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
That&#39;s all there was to it.
I realized that this is now going towards plan B, says Vanhanen in his second home in Helsinki.
He immediately headed to work.
The City of London was already fully alive despite the early night.
In the office, the TV screens, normally set to silent, played the news, and the normally loud crowd went completely silent to listen when Prime Minister David Cameron stepped in front of the camera this morning to announce his resignation.
When the market opened, the display terminals flashed nothing but red.
It was the kind of morning you never thought you would live, says Vanhanen.
Not because, despite the turmoil, Aberdeen, one of Britain&#39;s largest real estate funds, completed two real estate transactions the day after the Brexit vote, i.e. Midsummer.
The atmosphere was mixed.
However, the company was well prepared for the alternative, and that&#39;s why the situation was kind of calm, Vanhanen says.
The Brexit vote started a correction movement
The vote was followed by a storm.
The pound collapsed, the British leadership changed.
The market began to anticipate drastic declines in the real estate market in Britain and especially in London.
Losses of up to 20 percent were predicted for London office space in the coming years.
Soon a number of UK real estate funds began to freeze their trading one after another.
Aberdeen also did so for six days.
Now the storm has subsided, but there is still uncertainty in the air.
However, it is not visible on the face of Vanhanen, who spent his last days of summer vacation in Helsinki this week.
In his opinion, it is still too early to say much about what will follow from Brexit.
So much is still open: how the separation will happen and how Scotland will react to the situation, for example.
Initial information on the development of the London real estate market has already been received.
Real estate service company CBRE&#39;s information on price development covers about a third of the market.
According to them, the prices of all properties in London fell by 3.3 percent from June to July.
In the office buildings of the City of London, the minus accumulated 6.1 percent, Vanhanen lists.
The numbers are not that terrible, but they are monthly changes.
The monthly index started to be published in 1987, and there have been worse figures in only five months, says Vanhanen.
All drops of equal magnitude occurred in the crisis years of 2007 and 2008.
It is also interesting because Brexit was compared quite quickly to the collapse of Lehman and the global financial crisis that started from the US real estate market.
In Vanhanen&#39;s opinion, the comparison is not quite apt, because now we are dealing with Britain&#39;s home-grown crisis.
The atmosphere is also different.
The real estate market has not seen panic sales like those times, but a willingness to sell to improve liquidity, says Vanhanen.
Financing is normally available as well.
The repair shop could have been ahead anyway
In fact, the price correction movement is not a miracle for him - such a thing could have been ahead even without Brexit.
According to Aberdeen&#39;s assessment, real estate prices in London and other world-leading cities have been too high for years.
We have been saying for two years that the City and especially the offices are overpriced, says Vanhanen.
So the fall started really high.
Prices in London have risen for four reasons, Vanhanen lists.
The British economy has grown strongly, as has London&#39;s population.
Another big trend is that real estate is the last ownership class to globalize, Vanhanen says.
New players have entered the market from the Middle East and Asia, and more and more institutions and even private investors are looking for real estate investment targets abroad.
As a well-known city, London is an easy destination.
In addition, prices have been fueled by low interest rates, which has forced pension companies, for example, to look for income from new targets.
On top of this, loans have been easily available - although, according to Vanhanen, leverage has been used clearly less now than during the boom before the 2008 crisis.
Scatter, scatter
In London, the rise in prices leveled off last summer, Vanhanen says.
Aberdeen also started to lighten its holdings in London, and was a net seller last year.
Some kind of twist was expected, and now it came.
What next?
It depends on how the British national economy develops, says Vanhanen.
He does not dare to estimate much about the future, but says that there is hardly any upswing.
The mood suggests that there is a downward or steady trend ahead.
Vanhanen has already seen several moves up and down, as he has been in the real estate industry since 1988.
And he is still an optimist who believes that potholes can be overcome with work.
If you are well prepared for risks, you are in a better position.
He believes in global decentralization.
If you have invested in one market, you are too much its victim.
If it has been decentralized, the risks have also been decentralized, says Vanhanen.
The S group starts to register purchase data more precisely than before
Point S group knows what you eat, because the shopping group said today that it will start collecting even more detailed information about the purchases of its loyal customers.
When information has been collected so far about the total amount of the receipt, the group will start collecting it from the purchased products at the beginning of May.
The S group is following Kesko in this, because information on goods purchased with a plus card has been collected in Kesko&#39;s customer register for a couple of years already.
According to Ismo Riitala, CEO of K-Plus Oy, the feedback received from the program has been mainly positive.
Product-specific information is collected with the customer&#39;s consent and is used for marketing with permission.
The most effective channel is e-mail.
Very few customers have denied the use of product information, Riitala tells Taloussanomi.
According to him, Kesko is not going to react to the S group&#39;s registration change.
Kesko classifies its loyal customers into ten groups based on food purchases alone.
The rating is updated monthly.
Loyal customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount of money spent on them.
The information is used for customer-targeted marketing.
Product-specific purchase data is only collected from K Group&#39;s own chains.
Collaborators, such as Neste Oil, do not disclose their information.
Lidl Finland does not have a loyalty program and there are currently no plans for one.
Suomen Lähikauppa has its own Ykkösbonus loyalty program, which can be joined at Valintatalos, Siwoi and Euromarkets.
We currently do not collect information on product or product group levels, we stay at the level of the total amount of the receipt.
That is, we know in which store the purchases were made and on which day, as well as the total amount of the customer&#39;s receipt.
We haven&#39;t gone to the same level as the K-group or the S-group, says commercial director Anu Ora.
According to him, it is planned to renew the loyalty program in the future, but Lähikauppa will tell you about it later.
However, Ora does not promise that product data will start to be registered.
An experiment at first
SOK&#39;s customer owner and customer register has been relatively extensive until now.
In addition to personal and address information, the basic information has also included occupation, education, form of residence, and children&#39;s birth years and previous personal information.
Persons belonging to the same household and their roles are also registered.
The date and time of purchase, place, total amount of purchases and payment method are recorded from the S-Etukortti purchase.
In addition, the S-bonus partners&#39; information has been obtained from their cash register systems.
From the beginning of May, product-level purchase data will be stored in the Sokos and Emotion chains.
Instead, in S-markets, Prisms, Kodin Terros and ABC chains, the information is recorded at the product group level for the time being.
For a long time, there have been wishes from customers that marketing could be targeted more precisely, says Marjaana Saarikoski, head of SOK&#39;s customer owner and partner operations.
The S group says it will inform its customers about the change.
These can prohibit the use of product-specific information for marketing.
However, the information is stored at the cash registers anyway, whether you want it or not.
Those who want to can check their stored data on the S group&#39;s website.
For example, cash registers cannot access the information, emphasizes Saarikoski.
Video: The Heila puppy is Tulli&#39;s newest dog reinforcement - the puppy will become the first explosive dog
A black labrador retriever puppy energetically sniffs five similar boxes lined up on the ground at Helsinki-Vantaa airport.
It won&#39;t be long before it sits resolutely next to the middle drawer.
Customs inspector Lassi Suntio rewards his dog Heila for playing with its favorite toy.
From the box, next to which Heila was sitting, a jar of shell casings reeking of gunpowder gas was revealed.
Gunpowder gas is the first smell that has been practiced with Heila, says Suntio, the owner of the Heila dog.
The security situation and online shopping are the main reasons
Heila is Tulli&#39;s first dog specialized in the detection of weapons and explosives and will be placed to work at Helsinki-Vantaa Airport next year.
The tasks may also take Heila and Sunti to other border crossings and ports if necessary.
However, the airport will be Heila&#39;s main workplace because the international security situation has changed due to the serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The attacks in Paris and Brussels caused Customs to take measures, and after the attacks, supervision has been strengthened, says Customs Inspector General Mikko Grönberg.
Another main reason for training a gun and explosives dog for Customs duties is mail shipments passing through Helsinki-Vantaa.
With the increased internet trade, up to 40 million mail items pass through the airport every year, among which may be weapons and explosives ordered from abroad.
In recent years, customs has made about 300 discoveries related to weapons, weapon parts, ammunition and explosives and their precursors at Helsinki-Vantaa airport among online shopping, passenger plane luggage and air cargo.
Heila will work in different parts of Helsinki-Vantaa.
It will examine checked baggage and mail.
In the future, it will be a big benefit in ports, when it can go through large container areas and mark areas that require a more detailed investigation, says Grönberg.
Based on Heila&#39;s performance, Tulli will assess whether more gun and explosives dogs will be trained in the future.
Grönberg is optimistic about the idea.
School in Kirkkonummi
The training of the Heila puppy is coordinated by the Tulli dog school located in Kirkkonummi.
Suntio goes to train with Heila also with experts from the police and the Defense Forces.
The police have strong experience in training dogs and the Defense Forces have expertise in explosives.
Customs together with other authorities decide which smells Heila will be taught to recognize.
Heila is always given further training as needed, says Grönberg.
Heila&#39;s colleagues in Helsinki-Vantaa are Customs&#39; six drug dogs and money and drug dog Massi.
Labrador retriever Heila has been chosen from a litter of ten puppies.
The selection criteria of a dog for the airport include agility and hunting spirit, as well as calmness, because the dog deals with weapons, explosives and crowds of people.
Heila, who lives in Suntio&#39;s home, is a close colleague of the customs inspector, but also a family member.
You can&#39;t do anything without Heila at home, Suntio laughs.
Subtle orders are sent to Heila from a single layer.
Ilta-Sanomi&#39;s cameraman loses the cover of the camera&#39;s microphone to a fast dog, but Heila returns the cover that looks like a soft toy immediately after the &quot;let go&quot; command.
There is a lot of competition for working dogs
Heila&#39;s initial training will be completed next year.
There are still level exams ahead, next in October, where it is assessed whether the training is sufficient for demanding work tasks.
Heila can be seen working in Helsinki-Vantaa next year, if everything goes according to plan.
Unfortunately, passengers cannot come and pet a dog wearing a work vest, reminds Suntio.
The costs of one working dog are around 60,000-70,000 euros per year for customs.
Their working life is about seven to eight years, even ten, after which they retire to the care of their owner.
The working days can be long, from eight to ten hours, but the active work sections only last from ten minutes to a couple of hours.
There is a lot of competition at Customs to become the owner of working dogs.
About 20-30 Tulli employees applied to become the owner of Heila.
Luck fell on Suntio, who has never had a working dog before, but he has years of experience with dogs and supervision duties at Customs.
The mini-state got its first Olympic medal - the nation gets a day off
With a population of less than a million, Fiji&#39;s Olympic gold in rugby is so highly valued in the country that the government has designated August 22 as a national holiday.
According to the country&#39;s public broadcaster, the Fijian government confirmed the matter after the championship was decided.
The day off is the day after the team returns home.
There are also celebrations planned for the hero team in their home country.
Fiji&#39;s rugby team celebrated the championship.
The Guardian reports that the country watched the final in the capital, Suva, where a screen had been set up in the stadium.
Normally only native Fijians are interested in rugby, but this game brought our multicultural community together.
Even the Chinese restaurants were watching the game, I heard them cheering, Fiji Times reporter Maikele Seru told the Guardian.
Drama in Rio - the Finnish lifter fainted after a wild performance
Weightlifter Milko Tokola succeeded in his last attempt at 175 kilos after a hard fight.
Tokola has a special and life-threatening feature as a lifter.
During or immediately after heavy lifting, he has passed out many times.
No one has really been able to say why.
In Rio, Tokola scored 175 kilos in the push and 145 kilos in the snatch.
His total weight was 320 kilos.
Tokola tried to get 175 kilos in his last push, as well as in his second.
On the third attempt, the weights rose, accompanied by a ferocious roar.
The body trembled under the weights until the jury accepted the lift.
The Finnish lifter&#39;s joy was accompanied by the fact that he has suffered from knee problems.
RoPS acquired Estonian striker Prosan - Veikkausliiga - Ilta-Sanomat
Rovaniemi Palloseura, which plays in the Men&#39;s Football League, has signed a contract with Estonian striker Albert Prosa that will last until the end of the season.
We are looking for a top player for our team who has power and whose threshold to come to Finland and Rovaniemi is low.
Together with more than ten player agents, we went through more than 50 players from different parts of the world.
Little by little, Prosa started to stand out as a good alternative, RoPS coach Juha Malinen said in the press release.
Prosa, 25, arrives at RoPS from Flora in Tallinn, where he scored a total of 51 goals in 109 matches.
He has also played in the Estonian national team.
Prosa is scheduled to be with RoPS already on Saturday at Seinäjoki, where the Rovaniemi will face the reigning Finnish champion SJK.
RoPS needed a new striker when last season&#39;s goal king Aleksandr Kokko moved to Australia.
The formidable Modern Family star shrugs again: the teen star&#39;s shorts reveal almost everything
Ariel Winter, who became familiar as Alex Dunphy in the comedy series Moderni Perhe, is once again showing off her gorgeous body.
Winter was photographed in Hollywood this week in mini shorts that don&#39;t leave much to the imagination.
The shorts revealed not only the actor&#39;s legs but also his backside.
18-year-old Winter has recently attracted attention by changing her style and behavior to become significantly bolder.
The star has posed in very skimpy clothes in the pictures she has published on social media and has taken numerous tattoos.
The young woman has also been seen wearing very skimpy outfits.
Winter, who is on the threshold of adulthood, has recently also published several pictures of herself partying.
If the image is not visible, you can view it here.
Earlier this summer, Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed her public image so radically.
At the time, Amy Palmer, founder and CEO of PowerwomenTV, suspected that Winter was undergoing a &quot;typical Hollywood transformation&quot; from child star to adult.
She has been on television almost her entire life and grew up in the era of the Kardashians.
He has learned that the more you show the bare surface, the more publicity and attention you get in Hollywood, Palmer tells Fox News, adding that the exact same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started in the Moderni Perhe series when he was only 11 years old.
The actor has angered some of his longtime fans with his image change.
It&#39;s not hard to guess where he will be in ten years, when the decline is already so hard, says one woman on Winter&#39;s Instagram.
Some of the woman&#39;s fans, on the other hand, defend the actress and urge not to care about the criticism.
You look amazing!
No matter what others say.
You are an inspiration to many women, says the young woman.
The Japanese prefer to go to Finland from the Nordic countries - tourists are attracted by the northern lights: In autumn it is possible to see the fairy-tale mirror Aurora
The purpose of the campaign is to attract Japanese people to start Northern Lights trips already in early autumn, says Visit Finland in a press release.
Inari and Levi are the main destinations for northern lights tourism in Japan.
The northern lights are the trump cards of our winter tourism, and they are strongly associated with winter in the heart and snowy landscapes.
Lapland&#39;s winter northern lights trips are in great demand, but we are now trying to increase the sales of the autumn trips.
Few people know that the northern lights season starts in early autumn and continues well into spring.
In autumn, it is possible to see the so-called mirror aurora, where the surface of the lake reflects the northern lights, making the sight twice as fairytale-like, says Visit Finland&#39;s acting director in the press release. marketing manager Anne Lind.
The main target group of Visit Finland&#39;s northern lights campaign are wealthy 25-35-year-old Japanese women living in the city who dream of travel and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland through, among other things, online advertising.
According to a survey carried out by researchers from Aalto University and the Universities of Turku and Tokyo, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive image of the country among the Japanese compared to the other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese would like clearer, unique sights from Finland, and according to Lindi, the northern lights have enormous potential here.
The number of overnight stays by Japanese tourists has clearly increased in Finland more than in other Nordic countries.
Last year, they stayed more than twice as much in Finland as in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are an interesting target group for Finnish tourism, as they spent more than 80 million euros in Finland.
On average, Japanese people spent 183 euros a day in Finland, says Lind.
Britain settles for rugby silver as a masterclass organized by Fidi leads to gold
Great Britain&#39;s impressive run through the rugby tournament came crashing down to a last-ditch challenge from Fiji in Thursday night&#39;s final as the team suffered a crushing 43-7 defeat at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji put on a masterclass in handling, tackles, dodges, support, running lines and silk power as they won gold - their first Olympic medal.
Defeat came with the modest consolation of a silver medal - Britain&#39;s third of the day - and they could be proud of their hard work in the inaugural Olympic rugby tournament, which saw them beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The tough 7-5 victory over South Africa in the semi-final played earlier on the same day could trouble them in the final.
But despite this, in this condition, Fidi would have beaten even a top-fit team of 15 people.
Great Britain can perhaps - but probably not - be comforted by the fact that at least one Briton will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: Fidi&#39;s head coach is Ben Ryan, England&#39;s former boss at Wimbledon.
The UK journey has been quite the journey.
Eight years ago, coached by Ryan, they lost every game in the Adelaide tournament.
Here they only lost one.
This backlash hurts, but the development is startling.
Fidi got off to a great start, fending off Great Britain&#39;s tackles for fun.
For captain Tom Mitchell and his team, it was like running into moving buses, with the world champions leading 5-0 after Osea Kolinisau dived into the goal area at a corner.
With four minutes on the clock, Jerry Tuwai&#39;s second touchdown on the right wing led to a field goal.
12-0 and Great Britain had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell&#39;s brilliant Tackle stopped man-mountain Leone Nakarawa from scoring the third goal, but it was just a setback for Fidi.
At seven minutes, Jasa Veremalua scored in the right corner and Great Britain were 17-0 down.
Nakarawa scored again on the restart with over a minute left on the clock...in the first half.
After that, Vatemo Ravouvou charged through Great Britain&#39;s loose tackles and rushed to the line to score.
After the field goal, the score at halftime was 29-0.
It was as if Fidi was born to play rugby while Great Britain was just learning the game.
And that&#39;s actually how it is.
Great Britain made a flurry of changes at the break that blocked Fidi&#39;s barrage...for the full four minutes, which compared to the first half was fine, until Josua Tuisova scored after Fidi&#39;s impressive passing play.
Dan Norton scored for Great Britain with a touchdown in the left corner to make it 36-7, but the game had long been lost for the South Sea Islanders, whose supporters chanted, waved flags and danced in the stands.
It was hard not to admire Fidi&#39;s cheerful approach.
Mata Viliame&#39;s last-minute goal was the icing on Fidi&#39;s cake, which didn&#39;t need icing.
The whistle blew, the Fijians hugged and Great Britain fell to the grass, completely beaten.
Earlier in the day, Fidi had thumped Japan 20-5 in the semi-final and Great Britain beat South Africa in a tight semi-final in which each scored one goal - Britain&#39;s goal kick decided the game.
Kyle Brown put South Africa ahead in the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the finish line with some dazzling footwork to score under the goal posts in the second half.
A great late tackle from Marcus Watson, brother of England&#39;s 15-aside rugby team Anthony, secured victory and ultimately a silver medal.
The coach&#39;s fight against cancer led Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to rowing victory
There won&#39;t be a more emotional gold at these Games, and that really means something.
From first stroke to last, 220 grueling scrambles for the history books, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found a deeper meaning in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
Although they rowed alone, there were three voices in the boat. The echo of coach Robin Williams was present throughout as the pair raced to their second successive Olympic gold in the women&#39;s doubles - the first women in British sporting history to achieve the feat.
Their control was perfect and this was their 39th appearance unbeaten, which is also a record.
What we see, two great athletes connecting on the surface with a swan&#39;s clasp, does not fully reflect the nature of the victory.
Behind every rowing gold is a group of helpful pairs of hands who gradually promote the things that matter. And no pair of hands was as essential as that of the coach who, after receiving a cancer diagnosis 30 months ago, did not know if he would live to see this day.
As he said, the situation was dire.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of the things that can be operated on, and they performed the operation.
If they don&#39;t cut, it will spread everywhere.
The situation could have been pretty bad.
It changes the way you think a little bit.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio was fortunate in that his treatments could be started in the early 2014 off-season, when they caused as little disruption as possible - if that phrase can ever be used in situations like this.
I had to get paid, so I had to get better quickly.
It encouraged me.
I was in the hospital walking around the ward - 20, 30, 50 feet at a time when they said a few steps would be enough.
That&#39;s how it started.
Rowing itself is a journey, but it makes it a little bigger.
Immediately after the win, the first thing on the pair&#39;s mind was Williams, who had had a nervous morning and had been talking a little more than usual, trying to deal with his own nervousness.
Stanning, a veteran of Afghanistan Command from the Royal Artillery Regiment, said: &quot;I&#39;ve been an emotional wreck this week, which might be a bit of an overreaction, but this means so much to me.&quot;
It just highlights how important this is to me, how hard me and Helen, and Robin too, have been working.
The past three years with Helen and Rob have been great.
Without Robin we would be nothing, so we owe him a lot of thanks, he is the best coach in the world.
I couldn&#39;t have imagined a better training partner or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in five years.
The pair set a tough pace that their competitors couldn&#39;t match.
Even in the last 500 meters, when the New Zealand and Danish teams started to close, Stanning and Glover had too much energy in store.
We were very caught up in the moment.
Helen shouted “stay in the process, stay in the process”.
It&#39;s really important to stay in control.
We had a good start and at the same time we weren&#39;t trying to do anything special.
We weren&#39;t looking for fireworks today, we were just looking to row well and win the race, and that&#39;s what we did.
The couple will wait a year before deciding on their future.
Glover will attend a wedding next month when she marries TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Right now he just wants to enjoy the moment.
“I didn&#39;t want to say that this would be my last race.
That would have put too much pressure.
It took about six months after London to realize that I was an Olympic champion.
Everything was so new and I was so stressed.
Here it took about four minutes.
This feels so much better,” he said.
Iceland replaces Panama leaks tainted government
In October, Iceland will hold early parliamentary elections, which protesters enraged by the Panama leaks have already demanded in the spring.
The so-called Panama Papers revealed that several Icelandic politicians evaded taxes using tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned over the scandal, but that was not enough for the protesters.
His successor, Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson, promised at that time to hold new parliamentary elections in the fall.
The election day has now been decided on October 29.
According to analysts, it is difficult to predict how much the people&#39;s anger last spring will affect the fall election result.
In the presidential elections in June, criticism towards those in power was clearly visible, and Gudni Johannesson, who ran outside politics, was elected president.
Trump said he was being sarcastic when he claimed Obama was the founder of ISIS
US Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump retracted his latest rants.
He said he was being sarcastic when he claimed that sitting President Barack Obama was the founder of the terrorist organization ISIS and that Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton was also involved in the organization&#39;s founding.
The Democratic Party was outraged by the speech and demanded an apology from Trump.
No one should ever be allowed to be the commander in chief of the military who can sink that low, Clinton tweeted.
In the south of France, the mayor of Cannes has banned the use of the burkini, a covering swimsuit favored by Muslims, on the beaches, reports the British newspaper Guardian, among others.
The decision, signed by Mayor David Lisnard, states that going to the beaches and swimming is prohibited for anyone who does not wear a swimsuit that respects good manners and secularism.
The decision also says that swimwear that heavily expresses religious affiliations could increase the risk of disorder in France, which has been the target of terrorist attacks.
In mid-July, 85 people were killed and hundreds injured in Nice when a 31-year-old man drove into a crowd celebrating France&#39;s National Day.
At the end of July, two men linked to the extremist organization Isis attacked a church in northern France and killed an over 80-year-old priest.
The quality of the swimming waters in the Oulu region passed the sieve - blue-green algae cloudiness in Pyykösjärvi
The water samples taken from the official swimming beaches in the Oulu region meet the quality requirements set for swimming water.
Only at Pyykösjärvi&#39;s swimming beach has blue-green algae clouding been observed.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, the Oulu region&#39;s environmental agency took water samples from nine EU beaches and 30 other public swimming beaches in the Oulu region.
With the exception of the Meriniemi beach, the concentrations of E.coli and enterococcal bacteria in the bathing waters of all beaches were below the action limits given in the regulations of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
The E.coli and enterococci concentrations in the Meriniemi swimming beach water were confirmed on Wednesday, when the bacteria concentrations had fallen below the action limits.
The blue-green algae deposition observed at the swimming beach of Pyykösjärvi does not yet make the water unfit for swimming, but under favorable conditions the situation can quickly turn into a blue-green algae bloom, when a mass of blue-green algae forms in the form of rafts on the water surface.
The environmental department monitors the situation with more frequent inspections.
If the blue-green algae fall turns into a blue-green algae bloom, the matter will also be announced separately on the notice board at the beach.
See the results of the swimming water samples here.
MTK&#39;s Hakkarainen on forest gift reduction: More than 80 percent of forest owners outside
Forest gift deduction is one tax change in the Ministry of Finance&#39;s budget proposal for next year.
A tax reduction is proposed in the Income Tax Act, which would be granted on the basis of the gift tax for the generational change of forest farm.
According to the Ministry of Finance&#39;s presentation, the forest donation reduction has four goals: to promote generational changes in forest farms, to rejuvenate the age structure of forest owners, to increase the size of forest farms and to increase the supply of wood.
The aim of the ministry is to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
The forest owner would make a deduction from the net capital income of forestry.
In general, the idea of creating such a tool to promote generational changes in forest farms is a good one, comments Juha Hakkarainen, director of the Finnish Federation of Agricultural and Forestry Producers (MTK).
However, Hakkarainen finds something to criticize in the tax reform proposal.
Forest donation deduction is proposed to be made from the pure capital income of the forest owner.
It is capital income minus all other deductions.
According to MTK and Hakkarainen, the effectiveness of the tax reduction would be greater if the reduction could be made directly from the income from the sale of wood.
The VM&#39;s presentation starts from the fact that by making a deduction from the net capital income of forestry, it is prevented that there would be a loss of the capital income of forestry based on it, which would be deductible in other taxation.
Such a person would get a tax benefit, even if the wood is not sold.
The calculation model is unnecessarily complicated.
The average forest owner is unable to understand it, says Hakkarainen.
In addition, according to him, the model only applies to a small part of forest owners.
In the proposal, the tax deduction limit tied to Metsä&#39;s yield value is 40,000 euros.
In Hakkarainen&#39;s opinion, it has been drawn too high.
As such, according to him, it excludes 82 percent of Finnish forest owners from the scope of the reduction.
The model would affect about 10 percent of forest owners, he says.
In VM, it is considered that the limit guarantees the goal of increasing the farm size.
According to Hakkarainen, forest gift reduction has been discussed in forest policy for decades.
Its background is the aging of the forest owner population.
According to MTK, the average age of forest owners is currently over 60 years, and about half of forest owners are pensioners.
A strong hailstorm surprised motorists on Himanga - two cars derailed into a ditch and collided with each other
On Friday morning, a strange chase happened at Himanga in Kalajoki.
According to the rescue service, two cars driving in a row derailed into a ditch, after which the car coming behind collided with the car in front.
According to the fire marshal on duty, Harri Pyyhtiä, the derailment into the ditch is suspected to have been caused by a strong hailstorm.
There were two people in the car driving behind, both of whom were transported to the hospital for treatment.
There is no more detailed information about their injuries.
The driver of the car driving ahead was not injured.
The accident happened on highway 8 from Himanga, a few kilometers towards Kalajoki.
Finnish research can help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
The recent research results of researchers at the University of Turku can help develop cancer treatments to be even more effective.
The findings of Academy Professor Johanna Ivaska&#39;s research group show that the hardness of a cancerous tumor increases the malignancy of the cancer.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissue, are very soft, and cells in the tissue grow normally in such an environment.
According to Ivaska, it was possible to prevent the growth of cancer in laboratory conditions by restoring the tissue surrounding the cancer to correspond to normal, soft tissue.
In the future, it may be possible to improve the effectiveness of cancer drug treatments by focusing on the interaction between the cells and the surrounding tissue in addition to the cancer cells.
The research results have been published on August 4 in Nature Communications, a respected journal in the field of cell biology.
The trial of Muhos&#39; family home murder continues in the court, the prosecutor demands a murder verdict for the second perpetrator as well
The trial of Muhos&#39; family home murder continues in the court for both convicts.
In June, two young men were sentenced to prison for a murder in a family home in Muhos.
Another got 8 years and 4 months for, among other things, murder and aggravated robbery committed as a young person.
The other&#39;s sentence is 12 years in prison for murder and aggravated robbery committed as a young person.
The man convicted of manslaughter was also sentenced for aggravated endangering traffic safety as a young person and driving a vehicle without a license as a young person.
The district court&#39;s verdict was appealed by the prosecutor, the interested parties and the man who received a harsher sentence.
The prosecutor demands that the man who received a lighter sentence be sentenced to 12 years in prison for the murder committed as a young person.
They were in full understanding at the time of the act
According to the district court, 17-year-old youths killed a man who worked as a supervisor of the school&#39;s child protection unit in July of last year.
The 17-year-old who received a murder sentence attacked the instructor from behind, who was sitting on the sofa in the living room, according to the reasons for the sentence.
The director had gotten out of his grip and taken the young man to his room, whereupon one of the young men hit him with a vacuum cleaner.
The director was also strangled with a lead, beaten and kicked in the head.
According to the state of mind examination, both convicts were in full understanding at the time of the act.
According to the court, the young people had been planning to escape from the family home since at least the previous day.
The ice shark is the world&#39;s longest-lived vertebrate, breeding only at the age of 156
The ice shark has been confirmed as the world&#39;s longest living vertebrate, according to a study published in Science magazine.
In the northern parts of the Atlantic, such as around Greenland, the ice shark known as Holker can live up to 400 years.
The female does not breed until she is 156 years old.
The ice shark&#39;s lifespan is increased by the fact that it grows only one centimeter per year.
Only one species of clam is known to outlive ice sharks.
The researchers found out the age with radiocarbon dating.
Due to nuclear tests in the 1950s, some sharks had radioactive residues.
Based on them, the researchers were able to estimate the age of the sharks.
The age of the oldest was estimated to be 392 years - although a throw in one direction or the other can be up to 120 years.
Donald Trump as an economic sage - Kansan Uutiset
Donald Trump&#39;s America doesn&#39;t need a different world.
Even a third of the state&#39;s total tax revenue would be lost if the change to corporate tax pushed by Donald Trump is implemented.
Tax revenues would also decrease especially with the tax breaks benefiting the richest.
Trump described his tax plan as revolutionary when he unveiled it in Detroit on Monday.
Corporate tax would drop from 35 percent to 15 percent.
A truly staggering sum would remain uncollected, 1,000 billion dollars a year.
The top income tax rate is now 39.6, after Trump&#39;s reduction it is 33.
Inheritance tax would be completely waived.
Trump accused the state of over-regulating business life and driving small businesses into bankruptcy.
The environmental standards decided by Hätiki must be renewed and the regulation of the energy sector dismantled.
Barack Obama&#39;s health care reform must be taken up again.
&quot;Experts instead of bureaucrats&quot; must be appointed to the administration.
According to Trump, the &quot;disastrous&quot; trade policy is the biggest cause of the problems in the United States.
Free trade agreements would be abandoned.
A penalty tax of 45 percent and 35 percent from Mexico would be imposed on imports from China.
We offer a new future.
Americanism, not globalism, is our creed, Trump declared.
Donald Trump&#39;s America does not need to change the world:
American cars will drive the streets, American airplanes will connect cities, American ships will patrol the seas, American steel will raise new skyscrapers all over the country.
In a departure from his custom, Trump faithfully read through a speech written by aides, despite being interrupted 14 times by well-organized protests.
Economists - including those close to Republicans - see Trump&#39;s program as taking the United States into a deep economic recession.
Hillary Clinton announced her own program early on Friday Finnish time.
A tidal wave from the past - People&#39;s News
The sea is fatally turbulent, but the actual tidal wave strikes in the middle of the street bustle of Madrid - the reckoning with the past can begin.
That sums up the essence of Pedro Almodóvar&#39;s new story.
Almodovar&#39;s previous directorial work Matkarakajat (2013) was a funny and sarcastic satirical comedy, the skin I live in before it (2011) was the pinnacle of the Spanish actor&#39;s career.
In terms of level, Julieta (2016) falls somewhere between those two works.
It is a conventionally serene love, interpersonal and family drama centered on the relationship between mother and daughter.
The story is simple and is mostly seen as a long flashback.
Life seems to be going well for the middle-aged title character (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to collapse.
In the aftermath of a chance encounter, a new boyfriend (Dario Grandinetti) can be amazed until the end of the film.
In the form of a flashback and a long letter, Julieta recounts the stages of her life to her grown-up daughter.
He begins with the time before the daughter&#39;s birth, with the moments when he met her future father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, Adraina Ugarte, who plays Julieta as a young teacher, will be the second female lead, known from the TV series Ommelte väsä aika (2013-2014).
Julieta&#39;s aging has been handled in a way that can be considered a joke, but I would personally say that it&#39;s quite subtle and literally with a single swipe.
In Julieta, there is a fair distance from the often characteristic flamboyance of Almodóvar films, up to the point of humor.
It is an evenly acted, restrained film with good music in places and a rather sad film, which as such has ingredients for an elegy.
Instead, the visual color saturation typical of the Spanish director is preserved and in such a way that it slowly starts to catch the eye more as a pure form factor than as a functional dramatic effect.
The characters in the film are afflicted by illnesses, deaths or otherwise just sudden losses, but the surface remains just as Korean.
This is especially true for the costumes: in the case of the title character, the outfits change from scene to scene, and the same goes for the flashy earrings.
Almodóvar is precise in these matters, but the main thing, i.e. the tuning of the scene at that time, does not particularly improve.
When repeated mechanically, the impression is external and a bit lifeless.
Almodóvar has written the screenplay based on three novels by Canadian Alice Munro, who won the 2013 Nobel Prize in Literature.
The short stories have been published in Karkulainen: Stories.
Almodóvar has invested in dialogue, the result is a somewhat flat literary film adaptation.
The material would have been incomparably more emotionally strong for a drama, so big issues - especially gnawing guilt - the theme of the movie deals with.
Directed and written by: Pedro Almodóvar.
Based on three short stories by Alice Munro.
Starring: Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The premiere of the film is 12.8.
The government is trying to rig the election - Kansan Uutiset
No new cuts will be made, the ministers insist, so that the Basic Finns don&#39;t collapse completely.
However, surgeries decided in the spring are done wholesale.
There will be no new surgeries.
The already decided savings of four billion are enough.
This is what Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center) and Finance Minister Petteri Orpo (center) assure under the budget tussle.
It is true in the sense that there are no new cuts in the VM&#39;s presentation, because the cuts to social security were already decided during the spring budget debate.
Child benefit, national pension, basic unemployment insurance and almost all other benefits tied to the national pension index will be cut by 0.85 percent.
The duration of earnings-related unemployment insurance will be reduced from 500 to 400 days.
Training cuts continue.
Municipal elections are haunting
Why do the ministers emphasize so vehemently that no new cuts are made on top of these?
Because next year is an election year.
Municipal elections are held in April and they are the most important gauge of the election season, not the polls.
It has been seen before that municipal election results that lead the government parties in different directions spoil the mood of the government for a long time.
Gallup reports, however, that the ruling party is expecting a crushing defeat for basic Finns, even though the result of its previous elections was a modest 12.3 percent compared to the parliamentary elections.
Four years ago, Basic Finns got 752 new councilors, a large part of whom will realize the price of influence in the right-wing government next spring.
The lifeline of the government of three roughly equal parties depends on the support of the basic Finns.
Now it hasn&#39;t lasted, but more than half of those who voted for the party had enough of the government&#39;s policy already within the first year.
The first signs of the fermenting state of the party&#39;s parliamentary group have also come to the surface.
The rhetoric that there will be no new cuts firstly obscures the fact that next year they will be done drastically and secondly tries to soften the blow that awaits basic Finns.
Major surgeries in 2018?
A year from now, everything will probably be different - if Sipilä&#39;s government is still standing.
The government has set a goal of debt reduction this election period, but in Petteri Orpo&#39;s budget proposal, next year debt will be 5.9 billion euros, i.e. more than this year.
After the municipal elections, the government has two options.
The first is to raise your hands already in the middle of the election season and admit that the government is unable to follow its own program: the debt build-up will not collapse or even slow down.
Another is to stick with the program.
It means new, even tougher cuts on top of the old ones in the 2017 budget rush.
The budget would be at least close to balance during 2018, and then in the spring, what comes will be accepted in the parliamentary elections.
With these actions, you won&#39;t get into debt
It is completely clear that current measures will not reduce debt, no matter how Juha Sipilä tries to stir up a positive atmosphere.
The curves presented by State Secretary Martti Hetemäki at the budget briefing prove it irrefutably:
Global economic growth forecasts have repeatedly proven to be over-optimistic, meaning that the international economy will not provide traction.
Finland&#39;s national economy has hardly recovered since the collapse experienced in 2008, except temporarily during the stimulus policy implemented in the early 2010s.
Unemployment has increased by 35 percent this decade and has lasted from 34 to 54 weeks on average.
Unemployment now costs three billion euros a year more than in 2008.
On the curves presented by Hetemäki, the debt of public entities, which exceeded the 60 percent limit in 2014, will rise to 70 percent in the middle of the next decade.
What is responsible?
In the spring of 2015, the debt relief proposed by the left-wing coalition was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
Next year, the maintenance of unemployment will cost around six billion euros, which will practically be covered entirely by taking on new debt.
This is the perception of the centre, the coalition and basic Finns about what is responsible.
Survey: They want to leave a lot of tasks to the municipalities
Three out of four consider that organizing children&#39;s day care, youth work and physical activity are the municipality&#39;s responsibility, according to a survey by the KAKS - Municipal Development Foundation.
A clear majority of the people assign responsibility to individual municipalities for libraries, culture, civic colleges, building supervision, high school education and waste management.
On the other hand, the province&#39;s responsibility is most clearly wanted for regional planning, specialized hospital care, vocational training, universities of applied sciences and institutional care for the mentally disabled.
We do not want to transfer any of the tasks of the municipalities to the state.
An underage drunk driver ran away from the police at the end of the chase
A 16-year-old motorcyclist from Joensuu ran away from a police patrol on Ilomantsintie in Joensuu on Friday night at half past one.
The police patrol tried to stop the motorcycle that was driving without lights, but the young man ran away from the police at a fair speed.
The chase continued to Sonkajanrannantie, from there to Sorronahontie and a smaller forest road, where the motorcycle ran off the road.
Even after this, the young man ran away, but the faster-footed policeman caught the fugitive.
The driver&#39;s breath test showed 0.75 per thousand.
He also did not have a driver&#39;s license, which would have justified riding a motorcycle.
The case is being investigated, among other things, as a gross endangerment of traffic safety.
A truck loaded with stone fell into a ditch
A truck loaded with stone fell into a ditch in Polvijärvi on Kaavintie on Thursday evening at 9:15 p.m.
The truck had driven off the road in a curve to the left and fell on its side into a ditch.
The rescue service lifted the injured driver out of the overturned truck through the door left above, together with the personnel of the rescue helicopter and paramedics.
Lifting the vehicle was left to the car owner.
The overturned truck spilled hydraulic oil onto the road, which the rescue service absorbed into the peat.
The police are investigating the cause of the accident.
An elderly woman disappeared in the afternoon in Ilmajoki
An 87-year-old woman has been missing since the afternoon in Ilmajoki&#39;s Lahdenkylä in South Ostrobothnia.
The police are looking for a woman about 165 centimeters tall, slim and well-built, with white hair that reaches below her chin.
Observations and clues about the movements of the missing person are asked to call the Ostrobothnia situation center&#39;s tip number 0295440513.
The ingredients of a major accident in the air - see the photo gallery of the destruction of Parafest
The torrent that overthrew the tents of the Parafest festival caused extensive destruction.
Arto Pippuri, chairman of the Joensuu Parafest Association, estimates that the festival will be financially viable, and the event can be organized next year as well.
Kalle Salonen, the last performer of Parafest, performed on the market stage at the end of Friday evening.
On Saturday, the program continues with performances held in the premises of the city theater starting at 1 p.m.
Taidekeskus Ahjo has a Parafest exhibition from 13:00 to 15:00.
The program will be organized as planned.
A downdraft is created in a thundercloud when rainwater and its weight initiate a descending air flow.
The changes in the state of the water in the thunderstorm trap heat, and thus the descending air mass cools and its speed towards the ground accelerates.
The Finnish Meteorological Institute reports that there are several downdrafts in Finland during the summer.
It is difficult to predict the path of torrential currents.
The torrent hit the backyard of the Joensuu Art Museum, which was the venue for Parafest, on Friday afternoon before five.
Three tents collapsed, there were a total of about 200 people in the tents.
Four people slightly injured themselves in the accident.
There was one child in the crowd, who was taken to further treatment with a slight injury.
Air pollution is aging Londoners
According to the study, the skin of Londoners ages faster than usual.
The cause of skin aging is air pollution.
The Evening Standard reports on the British study.
The British skin care company Caci analyzes the most toxic small particles in London&#39;s air and their effects on the skin.
The results show that the skin of many Londoners of retirement age is two and a half years older than, for example, a peer living in the countryside.
The small particles that age the skin are very fine dust pollution that originates from traffic fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases, which kill nearly 9,500 Londoners every year, according to the Evening Standard.
Studies have found that the particles are small enough to penetrate the outer layer of the skin.
Cac&#39;s research found that early aging is a risk, especially for those Londoners who commute by walking near congested streets.
Londoners can try to protect themselves from air pollution with, for example, various masks, but a more practical solution is to regularly clean the skin.
The tractor&#39;s brakes failed - you pushed the man standing in front
The man had moved rocks in his yard with a tractor.
When he got off the tractor and went to walk in front of it, the tractor&#39;s brakes failed and the tractor rolled over the man.
The man did not fall under it, but the tractor still managed to push the man enough that he was transported to the central hospital for further examinations with serious injuries.
The tractor didn&#39;t have time to run any further, because it hit the stones in front.
Riento with renewed strength for the coming season
Liiga-Riento from Joensuu, which plays in the Volleyball Championship League, starts the series starting in October with better starting points than in memory.
The team has been together for almost three weeks.
A common note can certainly be found better than in previous seasons, when the beginnings of the series have been dark for Rienno.
Jani Säisä, who continues as Rienno&#39;s head coach, praises the new team as enterprising and united.
From the trio of foreign nationals, middle defender Fred Musoni starts his second season in Rienno.
The new faces are 23-year-old Murangwa Nelson and Hiago Garchet.
Nelson, who appeared in the national team of Rwanda, is a 205-centimeter chipper.
Correspondingly, Garchet is short, the Brazilian measures 198 centimeters.
Through Josba, Kataja and Jokipoikie to the USA national team
Anne Jumppanen has played in almost all floorball World Championships since 2003.
Now the sixth Games are going on in Tampere, only 2013 was missed when Canada was better in the North American qualifiers.
I was in Turku working and playing in the local women&#39;s club when I saw the announcement.
The USA was establishing a national floorball team.
I got interested and here we are now, Jumppanen, 48, says.
Jumppanen was born in 1967 near New York in the town of Elizabeth.
The family moved to Helsinki when the girl was one year old.
In 1987, Jumppanen entered the University of Joensuu to study computer science.
When I came to Joensuu, there was no such sport played at the championship level like floorball.
Sähli was played at university.
I played basketball in Kataja and later ice hockey in Jokipoji in the SM series, Jumppanen remembers.
Jumppanen played for the university team in the SM series of floorball in the season 1991-92, the next three seasons were spent in Josba.
Along with playing, he coached the club&#39;s A-girls to the championship.
The women&#39;s championship career culminated in silver in 1995.
In total, Jumppanen played in the women&#39;s championship series for 10 seasons, the balance accumulated in 169 matches was 51+34=85.
The last SM season is 2001-2002.
Perttu Puska and Tatu Väänänen were named to the national team
Perttu Puska of Joensuu&#39;s floorball club Josba was raised and Tatu Väänänen from Enola was selected to join the Finnish national team, which will play in the EFT tournament in Brno, Czech Republic on 6-8. November.
25-year-old Perttu Puska, who attacks in Helsinki&#39;s Erä, has played six men&#39;s international matches before this, where he has accumulated a total of 9+4=13 power points.
The 32-year-old defender of the Swiss Wiler-Ersigen, Tatu Väänänen, has recovered from a thigh problem and is part of the national team&#39;s standard equipment with 117 international matches.
Seinäjoki Peliveljie&#39;s legendary player Mika Kohonen, who was last seen in a Suomi shirt at last December&#39;s World Cup, was also named to the national team.
Petri Kettunen from Kontiolahti is the head coach of the national floorball team.
Beach volleyball player Essi Hasu&#39;s circle closes in Kouvolaa - the SM gold is missing from the trophy cabinet
Essi Hasu is retiring as a beach volleyball player, at least temporarily, after the current season.
The Finnish beach volleyball championships will be decided this weekend at Kouvola Sports Park.
During the three days, medals are played for in both adult and youth series.
In cooperation, Kouvola Volleyball players and the Finnish Volleyball Association will qualify for the SC final tournament, the best six pairs in the ranking of each series.
The local color in the tournament will be represented by Elimäki NMKY graduate Essi Hasu, who has been one of Finland&#39;s top beach volleyball players for several years.
Hasu, who lives in Helsinki today, is looking forward to the games in front of a familiar crowd.
I hope as many as possible can get to the stands this weekend.
Pesisstadion will surely have a great arena.
I haven&#39;t played in the adult leagues very often in Kouvola either, so it&#39;s great to play in the finals at home, Hasu says.
The Kouvola region ignited Hasu&#39;s spark for sports and provided good food for a great hobby.
There are many memories from childhood.
I started playing volleyball at the age of 9 in Elimäki NMKY&#39;s E-girls.
The top thing in mind is a jersey that&#39;s too big, knee pads rotating around the ankles, and amazing ace shouts and choreography after the point, Hasu recalls.
In a small town, the Sports Club was a tight-knit community where everyone knew each other.
The collective spirit of the group created an environment where it was comfortable to play.
Everyone&#39;s families were strongly involved in the activity - a teammate&#39;s father coached us and our mother was the president of the club for a long time.
For Essi Hasu, beach volleyball was already a natural choice as a counterweight to indoor volleyball as a junior.
Beats have been played on the Käärälammi swimming beach since the 1990s.
Activities at Käyski have always been active.
I also went to watch the junior championship tour competitions myself, thinking that one day I would be playing there myself.
Now this dream will come true, when Hasu will play together with Anniina Parkkinen from Pieksämäki in the WC finals this weekend.
The goal of the duo ranked second in the tournament after Riikka Lehtonen and Taru Lahti is clear.
We have a medal as a realistic goal.
We&#39;re still missing the championship gold in the trophy cabinet, Hasu enigmatically throws.
This weekend&#39;s performance in Kouvola might be Hasu&#39;s last in front of a familiar audience.
At the beginning of September, new challenges await in civil work.
Yes, the international career is over after the Kisakallio tournament.
Otherwise, flip flops will be put on a nail at least temporarily, Hasu plans.
A torrent knocked down tents at an event for the disabled in Joensuu, a major accident was close
The torrent overturned three tents at the Parafest festival for the disabled in Joensuu.
According to Sanomalehti Karjalainen, four people were injured in the accident.
One child was transported to the hospital for further treatment.
According to Karjalainen, there were a total of around 200 people in the tents.
A show was going on in one of the bigger tents.
Two of the tents were smaller.
The accident happened on Friday at 5 p.m.
Markus Viitaniemi, the on-duty fire marshal interviewed by Karjalainen, tells the newspaper that the situation had the ingredients for a major accident.
According to the newspaper, the continuation of the event is at stake.

Salomon Koli bravely set out to become an agricultural entrepreneur
Agriculture as entrepreneurship means risk-taking, sweat and energy.
A young farmer, Salomon Koli, 25, became an agricultural entrepreneur because he believes in a positive future in the countryside as well.
Almost two years ago, Koli, together with his younger brother Valtteri Koli, started operations as a continuation of their home farm.
Their father Markus Koli helps and advises the brothers with his own experience.
Starting out as a rural entrepreneur meant taking on debt and increasing the size of the farm so that bread could come from agriculture.
This has been my thing since I was a little boy.
I&#39;ve always enjoyed working on the farm, and now that I&#39;ve started as an entrepreneur myself, I&#39;ve put everything on the line.
If you start something, I think it should be done seriously and properly.
In 2013, we set out to build a garden shed, and at first the bank wasn&#39;t enthusiastic about it either.
However, I really bravely joined the project myself and I have been fully involved in it, Salomon Koli says and adds that he would not have taken the initiative if he did not have faith in producing pure Finnish food and that everything will turn out well.
The goal of Salomon Koli, who grows meat trucks, is to invest in an even bigger barn.
The work has paid off, as Salomon Koli has been selected among the top ten in the Maaseudun Tulevaisuus magazine&#39;s young food producer competition.
Currently, he is competing for a possible win.
You can vote for him on the newspaper&#39;s website on August 21. until.
Bulgaria reports inflation for the first time in eight months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1% in July.
This is the highest reading in years (since June 2012) and the first reading above zero since October last year, when a positive 0.2% was reported.
Annual average inflation, as measured by the cost of living index, was -0.8% in the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) when compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015).
The cost of living index for July 2016 was 101.0% compared to June 2016, i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0%.
Since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015), the inflation rate has been -0.2%, and annual inflation in July 2016 was -0.2% compared to July 2015.
Compared to the previous month, in July 2016 an increase was observed in the prices of the following consumer goods: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transport (1.8%), leisure and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2 %), miscellaneous goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household goods and routine maintenance (0.5%), health (0.1%).
Prices remained at the same level as the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communication and education.
Snapchat&#39;s &quot;anime&quot; effect is criticized as an Asian caricature
According to Snapchat, anime inspired the filter, but some observers say it&#39;s racist.
With its lens tool, Snapchat allows its roughly 150 million daily users to reshape reality and play with identity in ways that are almost ridiculous.
You can transform yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a character that would fit in a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
Lenses are simple, face-contorting tools that produce more than 30 million enhanced selfies a day.
All missteps quickly end up in public documents.
Snapchat&#39;s lenses have previously been criticized with accusations that the application promotes a blackface mask or favors bleached skin as the ideal of beauty.
So when Snapchat this week promoted a lens that gave some users crooked eyes, crooked teeth and chubby cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people - &quot;yellowface&quot;.
And they wonder if these recurring controversies could be a sign of a larger problem with diversity at the company.
The news and outrage spread widely on Wednesday with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day later Snapchat said it had ended the feature.
The company offered an explanation: The lens was intended as a tribute to anime characters, not a caricature of Asians.
But for observers who experienced racism, the lens was a reminder of offensive stereotypes in action.
Others vehemently denied the anime comparison.
Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet about the photos was widely shared, said in an email that the lens was &quot;offensive and uncomfortable to say the least.&quot;
He added that &quot;it&#39;s hard to argue against a comparison where a gross Asian caricature and filter effects are side by side.&quot;
It shows that the filter is not just yellowface, but yellowface taken to the extreme of vilification.
Snapchat isn&#39;t the only company crossing these cultural traps.
From corporate boardrooms to Hollywood to the devices we all carry in our hands, American culture seems caught in a never-ending struggle for diversity and inclusion.
And Snapchat&#39;s huge audience of young people, more racially diverse than their parents, may mean they&#39;re even more likely to expect an understanding attitude.
25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview on Thursday that when one of Snapchat&#39;s lenses creates an offensive image, &quot;it&#39;s a lot harder for these guys to be inconspicuous than before.&quot;
On Thursday, Zhu, a product manager and engineer working for Medium, decided to delete his Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In an op-ed for Medium and in a phone interview, he said he believes the racial controversies reflect a lack of diversity in Snapchat&#39;s hiring practices.
Zhu criticized the company&#39;s predominantly white male management and ended his post with the hashtag #DeleteSnapchat
“Either they don&#39;t have a diversity of color on their staff that allows them to make these kinds of decisions,” said Zhu, who is Chinese-American, “or they have people of color on the job, but they&#39;re not in positions where they feel safe or can speak up. &quot;
Other observers share his sentiment, a complaint that Snapchat has largely gone unanswered.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its staff, noting its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the racial backgrounds of its staff, but a representative said the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented populations and advance internal inclusion efforts.
For her part, Zhu said she will keep her Snapchat account closed, adding: &quot;Is it so that they actually need more users like us to say this is not ok.&quot;
According to a congressional panel, military officials falsified ISIS intelligence
In a report released Thursday, a congressional panel said officials at the U.S. military&#39;s military theater headquarters manipulated intelligence reports to present a more optimistic picture of the war against ISIS in Iraq and Syria than the events on the ground warranted.
An interim report by a task force set up by the Republican chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee found &quot;widespread dissatisfaction&quot; among headquarters intelligence analysts who said superiors tampered with their assessments of American efforts to defeat ISIS.
The headquarters, known as Centcom, is the headquarters of the Armed Forces War Zone in Tampa, Florida, which oversees the operations of the United States Armed Forces in the Middle East and Central Asia.
“Intelligence outputs accepted by senior Centcom leaders typically painted a more positive picture of US counterterrorism efforts than the facts on the ground warranted. They were consistently more positive than the analyzes produced by other factors in the intelligence community,&quot; the report&#39;s press release said.
&quot;What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our warfighters suffer when poor analysis is presented to high-ranking decision makers,&quot; said Rep. Ken Calvert, R-Calif.
Centcom&#39;s management failures reach the very top of the organization.
The 10-page report details persistent problems with headquarters&#39; descriptions and analyzes of US efforts to train Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
While it does not provide clear evidence that senior Obama administration officials ordered the reports to be tampered with, it suggests that analysts felt pressured by Centcom leaders to portray the threat posed by the Islamic State, ISIS, in a more positive light.
&quot;Throughout the first half of 2015, many of the headquarters&#39; press releases, statements, and testimony to Congress were significantly more positive than the events themselves,&quot; the report said.
For example, a Centcom official stated publicly that a major offensive to retake Mosul could begin even as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq&#39;s second largest city, is still under ISIS control.
&quot;After months of investigation, this is very clear,&quot; Representative Mike Pompeo, Republican of Kansas, said in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the highest-ranking intelligence leaders at the headquarters of the US military&#39;s military domain manipulated the headquarters&#39; intelligence output to downplay the threat of ISIS in Iraq.
Republicans created the task force after hearing that analysts had raised concerns that intelligence on the Islamic State group was being manipulated.
The report published on Thursday will be followed by more extensive results while the investigation is ongoing.
The Inspector General of the Ministry of Defense has begun an additional, ongoing investigation into Centcom&#39;s intelligence.
Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee released their own findings Thursday, which agreed with some of the Republican task force&#39;s conclusions.
&quot;Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an unnecessarily insular process for assessing intelligence on ISIS and Iraqi security forces,&quot; Representative Adam B. Schiff, the committee&#39;s top Democrat, said in a statement.
According to Schiff, this process &quot;delayed the release of intelligence outputs&quot;, worsened sentiment among analysts and &quot;didn&#39;t allow enough room for divergent viewpoints&quot;.
Schiff and Democrats said they found no evidence that the White House tried to pressure Centcom analysts to fit their findings into a &quot;preset or political narrative.&quot;
The Daily Beast reported on Tuesday the preliminary results of the congressional investigation.
Last August, The New York Times reported that the Pentagon&#39;s inspector general had opened an investigation following complaints from Centcom analysts.
Commander Capt. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Defense Department will not comment on the congressional report while the inspector general&#39;s investigation is ongoing.
But he said that &quot;experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data, and the intelligence community and the Department of Defense welcome a healthy dialogue about these vital national security topics.&quot;
The research has other ramifications than just whether the US-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria is succeeding (as a growing number of defense officials now claim).
Last year&#39;s allegations called into question how much President Obama can trust headquarters to provide honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis hotspots.
The criticism of Islamic State intelligence echoes a controversy more than a decade ago, when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker wrote a research paper saying that, despite the objections of many analysts, President George W. Bush&#39;s administration supported a small force in Iraq and spent very little time considering what sanctions the 2003 the attack would have.
Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion regarding Islamic State intelligence.
Officials said last year Hooker&#39;s team concluded that, despite public statements to the contrary, airstrikes against Islamic State-controlled refineries had not significantly weakened the terrorist group&#39;s economy because it had built makeshift refineries to sell oil through the black market.
However, The Times reported in September that this discovery was not communicated outside of headquarters.
Centcom&#39;s then-commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, came under fire last year after many lawmakers saw his testimony to the Senate as an overly positive assessment of the war.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced at headquarters by General Joseph L. Votel.
The United States wins for the fourth time in a row in women&#39;s field hockey, setting up a showdown with Great Britain
A day after scoring three goals in the team&#39;s 6-1 win over Japan, Katie Bam scored the U.S. women&#39;s field hockey team&#39;s first two goals in a 3-0 win over India on Thursday.
Five goals in two games sounds like an unforgettable achievement, but 27-year-old Bam said he wasn&#39;t sure if he had done the same before.
&quot;I have no idea,&quot; he said.
&quot;I&#39;m not really the kind of person who keeps track of my goals.&quot;
But this much he does know: The Americans are 4-0 in the Olympic tournament and tied for first place in their group with Great Britain, which was still unbeaten after beating Japan 2-0 on Thursday.
Great Britain and the United States meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams have qualified for the quarterfinals and this game will decide who will finish first and who will finish second in their six-team group.
The first-placed side avoids the strong Netherlands, the leader of the second group, for a slightly longer quarter-finals start.
However Saturday&#39;s game ends, the Americans have caused a stir with their surprise success here, four years after they finished last of 12 teams at the London Olympics.
Bam was on that team.
He grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, picking up a field hockey stick for the first time at age 3 (his older twin sisters played the sport at Drexel) before joining the national team at 16, becoming its youngest player ever.
He did not participate in the 2008 Olympics because he did not make the final list of players.
In 2012, nothing went right for him and his teammates.
The following year, Englishman Craig Parnham was appointed as coach, and things began to change.
&quot;Cultural change, mental change, physical change,&quot; Bam said.
We didn&#39;t have the same pace of work in London as we do now.
We have done a full translation.
On Thursday night, Bam started the scoring in the first half with a knuckleball from close to the goal.
India had come into the game without a single win in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the score at 1-0 until the end of the third period, when Bam took over.
He carried the ball for a long time on the left side of the field, then turned to the center and raced the ball into the goal, giving the Americans a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez added the final goal midway through the fourth period.
The shutout was the first of the tournament for U.S. goalkeeper Jackie Briggs, who had conceded one goal in each of the first three wins.
He&#39;s in a good mood.
So is Bam.
&quot;We&#39;re in a good situation now,&quot; Parnham said, but how good it is depends on the outcome of Saturday&#39;s game.
Trampoline peace in the middle of the Olympic frenzy
Wherever you are, whatever time it is, the Olympics are on.
The events of Rio de Janeiro feel continuous and inevitable, a furious message of competition and effort.
Just as if the Olympic torch itself were a flaming baton passed from archer to swimmer and gymnast to triathlete.
It&#39;s impossible to turn on the TV, read a newspaper, or listen to a neighbor&#39;s conversation in line at a coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the feud between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there&#39;s Logan Dooley.
Dooley, a first-time Olympian and future heartthrob with dimples, could well be one of those prime-time household names, backed by sponsorship deals and feel-good TV commercials - if she were a swimmer, a gymnast or even a fencer.
But Dooley, 28, of Lake Forest, Calif., is competing for Olympic gold on the trampoline.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate all sports equally.
Farther from the center, partly in the shadows, are the sports that are not generally accepted by everyone: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We always have breaststroke, long live it.
But if I may make a moderate number about my particular favorite, I would like to draw attention to the understated charm of the trampoline.
Although trampoline has been an Olympic sport since 2000, when it made its debut at the Sydney Games, its presence has been so little noticed in the intervening 16 years that many I interviewed had no idea it was an Olympic sport.
This may be regional ignorance.
Although the United States has sent athletes to compete in the sport, it has never won a medal in it and did not have an athlete advance to the finals until 2012.
The Chinese and Russians usually share the men&#39;s medals, while the Chinese and Canadians share the women&#39;s medals.
This year China&#39;s Dong Dong and Canada&#39;s Rosie McLennan are defending their London gold medals.
Trampoline, however, has a certain underdog allure, partly because to the uncivilized ear it sounds more suited to clown school than the Olympics.
Here I must confess that I am no expert, just a fan of the flightless.
The sport has possibilities for fun, as can be seen from the vibration of endless bounces in cartoons, but it also has the stealthiness of gymnastics and diving, two sports that are basically combined in it.
The word &quot;trampoline&quot; comes from the Spanish word el trampolín, which means springboard.
Champs jump up to a height of almost 30 feet on a giant trampoline and must complete a series of twists and turns (flips, flips, and flips) before landing on their feet.
According to the official Olympic program, they are judged on execution, difficulty and &quot;flight time&quot;.
32 athletes from 17 countries will compete in Rio, 16 men and 16 women.
The most common direction of the Olympics is straight ahead.
Those hoping for a medal must go further, faster, up and over in search of gold - sometimes to the finish line, sometimes back and forth around the field.
They are hunting not only the finish line or the starting wall, but also, in the televised coverage, another elusive limit: the world or Olympic record.
This determined pursuit is noble, admirable and even fanatical - and it can even move the viewer to tears.
But that&#39;s also the reason why even watching the games can be a bit exhausting.
The trampoline offers a moment of rest here.
The direction of the trampoline is up.
The goal is not to move forward.
The competitor rises to another ascent, appearing weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly up again.
Of course, there is no lack of competition or difficulty in this, but during the program there is no furious rush towards the end, no leaps into the distance, only a dreamy, fluid suspension of time and gravity.
It&#39;s as close to a zen state as you can get at the Olympics.
The women&#39;s heats and then the finals will be held on Friday afternoon starting at 1pm ET, with the men&#39;s heats also on Saturday at 1pm.
NBC will air the finals as part of its afternoon schedule beginning at 2 p.m. both days.
In the middle of the Olympic frenzy, they offer a quiet, charming moment that will probably not be noticed in the general chaos.
And if awareness is only achieved by offering male athletes to be stared at and objectified (as the US male gymnasts recently suggested, according to The Wall Street Journal ), Dooley is just waiting for his new fan base to sigh.
A &quot;generation is showing its mind&quot; in Ethiopia, a longtime US ally
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Protesters demanding political change in Ethiopia have faced violent opposition from the government.
Witnesses say dozens of protesters have been shot dead in clashes with police.
Is Ethiopia breaking apart?
Over the past decade, it has been one of Africa&#39;s most stable nations, a staunch ally of the West, with a rapidly growing economy.
However, in recent months, anti-government protests have shaken the country as they spread to more and more areas.
Last week alone, thousands of people took to the streets demanding fundamental political change.
According to human rights groups, the government&#39;s response was relentless.
Witnesses said police shot and killed dozens of unarmed protesters.
Widespread videos recorded at the protests, believed to be late last year or early this year, show security officials beating young people with batons while forcing them to stand with their hands against a wall.
The main human rights authority of the United Nations is now demanding a thorough investigation.
&quot;Keeping this country together was always difficult, and it will be even more difficult in the future,&quot; said Rashid Abdi, who is the Horn of Africa project manager at the International Crisis Group.
Ethiopia is the second most populous country in Africa after Nigeria, and Western countries appreciate its stability.
America&#39;s military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians in the fight against terrorist threats in the region, especially in Somalia, and hardly any African country receives so much help from the West.
Ethiopia&#39;s economy has grown at an impressive pace.
Its infrastructure has improved tremendously, and the capital, Addis Ababa, even has a new commuter train.
The city&#39;s streets are typically quiet, safe and clean.
Although Ethiopia has not been a model of democracy. Human rights organizations have consistently spoken out about government repression, the country&#39;s opposition has been limited, and dissent has been effectively silenced.
Many have been expelled from the country, imprisoned, killed or driven far into the desert.
But this may be changing.
&quot;If you suppress people and they have no choice but to express themselves, this is what will happen,&quot; said Seyoum Teshome, a university teacher from central Ethiopia.
The entire youth is demonstrating.
One generation is protesting.
The complaints are diverse and cover everything from land use to the ruling coalition&#39;s stranglehold on power.
After last year&#39;s much-criticized elections, the ruling party and its allies won the last seat held by the opposition, and now holds all seats in parliament.
At the same time, tensions on the border with Eritrea are growing. Fighting along this tense and contested border claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, which have been more or less defeated in recent years, may try to take advantage of the turmoil and re-arm.
Numerous factors explain why, after years of bubbling under the surface, bitter feelings are now about to explode.
The first seems seemingly innocuous: smartphones.
Only in the last few years have a large number of Ethiopians been able to communicate through social media, as cheaper smartphones have become more common and internet service has improved.
Even if the government shuts down access to Facebook and Twitter, as it often does, especially during protests, many people can still communicate through location-hiding network proxies.
Many young Ethiopians said this is how they came together for the protests.
Second, Ethiopia&#39;s two largest ethnic groups, the Oromo and the Amhara, get along better.
Oromos and Amharas are not natural allies.
For a very long time, the Amharas, who come from the predominantly Christian highlands of Ethiopia, prospered in politics and business by taking advantage of the Oromo, many of whom are Muslim, who live in the lowlands.
But this too is changing.
&quot;We are on the way to organizing under one umbrella,&quot; Oromo leader Mulatu Gemechu said.
The largest demonstrations have been in the Amhara and Oromo regions.
Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is unfairly ruled by the Tigre people. The nation covers about six percent of the population and controls the armed forces, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the loss of Meles Zenawi.
Meles, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopia&#39;s prime minister for 17 years until he died of a mysterious illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could see around corners.
Analysts say he was particularly adept at spotting early signs of discontent and using secret emissaries to neutralize opponents.
&quot;The current administration doesn&#39;t have that kind of basic instinct,&quot; conflict analyst Abdi said.
Ethiopia&#39;s new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was picked as a relative unknown to fill Meles&#39; boots.
Unlike Meles, who was from the tigre region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam is from the south.
Analysts say he is not trusted by the security services controlled by the Tigers.
Many fear that this could lead to increased bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia was in such turmoil was in 2005, when thousands demonstrated against an election that analysts say appeared to have been rigged and then rigged by the government.
The ensuing crackdown left many protesters dead, though fewer than in recent months, and that period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised Ethiopia&#39;s leaders for visionary infrastructure planning, such as a new commuter train, and significant strides in the fight against poverty.
But clearly, this has not stopped the internal intensification of contempt for the Ethiopian government.
And now it&#39;s starting to take on a dangerous, ethnic shape.
Last month, protesters in the Amhara city of Gondar attacked tiger-owned businesses, and anti-tigre hate is becoming increasingly common on social media.
Analysts say the protests put the United States and other Western allies in an awkward position.
The American government has been using Ethiopia as a base for air flights to neighboring Somalia, although it said some time ago that it had closed this base.
Although Western countries clearly want to support democracy, they also do not want their ally in an already unstable region to collapse.
“This,” Abdi said, “is a real balancing act.”
Donald Trump explains his Obama-founded-Isis claim as &quot;sarcasm&quot;
Donald J. Trump sought to quell the latest controversy engulfing his campaign on Friday by insisting he wasn&#39;t serious when he repeatedly insinuated this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the &quot;founders&quot; of the Islamic State terrorist group.
The report raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate&#39;s ability to communicate clearly to the American public.
It also put his defenders, who have scrambled to defend him during a tumultuous period, in the awkward position of having to explain away remarks he may not have meant.
After the insinuation at a campaign rally Wednesday night, Trump made the same claim with increasing fervor in interviews Thursday, in which he insisted that he really meant to say that the president and Clinton created ISIS.
However, in an early Friday morning Twitter post, Trump said he was just being sarcastic.
The publication was a complete reversal from the previous day, when Trump said in several interviews that he was indeed serious about the accusation.
When conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump tone down his remark by reminding him that Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate took a deaf ear.
The latest storm of criticism comes as Trump has sought to refocus his campaign on the economy amid declining poll results.
Trump and Clinton battled over the economy this week in Michigan.
On Friday, Trump again tried to return to the topic.
Taking to Twitter again, he warned that Clinton&#39;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found the speech boring.
Trump has used the sarcasm defense before.
In late July, after facing widespread criticism for apparently suggesting that the Russians should have hacked Clinton&#39;s emails, he later clarified his remarks by saying &quot;of course I&#39;m being sarcastic.&quot;
The approach allows Trump to straddle the boundaries of political speech and then backtrack when necessary.
“I think it&#39;s a model where he&#39;s testing certain messages that are important to his fans. He looks at how they work and then &#39;clarifies&#39; one way or the other depending on the reaction,&quot; said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who has followed the language used by both candidates.
But I also think he&#39;s sly about his statements and knows they&#39;re vague enough to be filtered through several different lenses.
Instead of toning down his rhetoric for the large voting public, Trump has been more bilious in recent days as his popularity has continued to slide.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll released Friday showed Trump trailing Clinton significantly in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, and that the race is tight in Florida.
Although Trump generally tries to avoid apologizing for the provocative things he says, he often accuses his critics of misunderstanding his words or misunderstanding his sense of humor.
As he faces increasing scrutiny in the final months of the presidential campaign, Trump&#39;s jokes have forced his staunch allies into the uncomfortable position of having to publicly support him no matter how provocative his remarks.
Former New York City Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of Trump&#39;s most prominent supporters, went to great lengths to defend the candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
&quot;I think there are real, political comments in his words,&quot; Giuliani said when asked about the veracity of Trump&#39;s claim that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
It&#39;s true in the sense that before Obama, Isis was almost unknown, a small organization that he called amateur, completely wrong, and that&#39;s why this happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans try to argue that the Obama administration, under which Clinton served as secretary of state, allowed ISIS to get worse because it failed to effectively deal with the situation in the Middle East.
Ahead of Friday&#39;s caucuses in Pennsylvania, Trump continued his Twitter attack on the news media, which hang on his every word and are biased against him.
He mocked the &quot;bad, pathetic&quot; TV pundits who try to figure him out, saying &quot;They can&#39;t!&quot;
Some Democrats derided Trump&#39;s excuse as further evidence that he is unfit to be president.
A previously closed coffee shop is returning to Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a seedy, cash-only place in Williamsburg that didn&#39;t have Wi-Fi, but served good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, the street side of Bedford Avenue became too expensive for it.
The shop that replaced Verbi in the summer of 2014, Soap Cherie, sells cupcake-shaped soaps.
Locals mourned it as the latest loss in a city that is being renovated into a middle-class one.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: &quot;New York is changing, I know, but I still can&#39;t believe that CBGB is dead and the Chelsea Hotel is crushed and Verb is now a soap shop.&quot;
But if New York is change, it is also reinvention.
A revitalized Verb opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile from its original location.
The new Verbi has wifi and you can pay with credit cards, but some of the staff are still the same and there is the same unsophisticated atmosphere.
The coffee is still good too.
The new Verb is run by Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old cafe, who is the owner and general manager of the new location.
He started at Verb in 2001 and was there until the end.
When a client offered to finance her new location, she said she was thrilled.
Rodriguez, 36, kept many things the same.
Verb uses the same bagel supplier and bought a similar espresso machine.
It even used the lights of the old Verb.
But Rodriguez said he also wanted to try.
He brought new ingredients.
The menu includes bacon-egg-cheese sandwiches, and toppings include, for example, capers and browned onions.
There is brown rice in the bowls.
The cafe no longer serves beer, but fresh juices are made there.
Over the course of nine months, Rodriguez says he&#39;s noticed a steady stream of old loyal customers.
&quot;Williamsburg became too expensive for many former customers as well,&quot; he said.
One last Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was one such customer.
Oliveira, 34, used to live in Williamsburg and was a regular at Verb.
Even after he moved to Greenpoint, he wandered into the coffee shop.
He says that after Verbi closed, he gave up drinking coffee for a while.
&quot;I realized that I enjoyed Verbi&#39;s coffee and culture,&quot; he said.
Now he&#39;s back to coffee, although that day he ordered a blended chai drink instead of his usual iced coffee, one of the new additions.
Another long-time customer, Tom Rosenthal, has been faithfully visiting Verb since 2003.
He used to go there before working and always made the same order.
&quot;Every day at three past seven, regular as clockwork, I&#39;d go in and they&#39;d be making my spicy bagel with butter,&quot; he said.
Photo. Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and introduce new ingredients to the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still makes his usual order, but sometimes for a change, he orders a spicy bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez says he doesn&#39;t hold a grudge against the soap shop that took over the old space.
in fact, the owners of Soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for Verb that would use the cafe&#39;s cold-brewed coffee as an ingredient.
&quot;I think we can still take the offer,&quot; Rodriguez said.
And Greenpoint&#39;s traditional Polish residents have also embraced the cafe.
One of those new customers translated the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said he plans to display it somewhere soon to make his new neighbors feel welcome.
The new location has other advantages.
A local juice place wants to bottle and sell cold-pressed coffee.
It is possible that the cafe will expand into the adjacent building.
For many customers, it is enough to get their old favorites in the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer and said he was heartbroken when the place closed.
When the new location opened, Whitt said he felt like coming home when he walked in and ordered a coffee.
“I&#39;ve been dying to smell it,” he said.
A Square Meal: The Depressing Food of the Depression
In March 1933, shortly after becoming president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down to lunch in his office.
A gourmet, President Roosevelt enjoyed sophisticated Fifth Avenue dishes such as foie gras and Maryland terrapin soup.
That day, her diet was more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and plum pudding for dessert.
&quot;It was a show of culinary solidarity for people who were suffering,&quot; Jane Ziegelman said.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, added: &quot;It was also a message to Americans about how to eat.&quot;
The couple, who live in Brooklyn Heights, are food historians.
Coe&#39;s latest book, Chop Suey, was about Chinese food in America, and Ziegelman told life in a Lower East Side tenement through food in his book 97 Orchard.
Their latest collaboration, A Square Meal, which Harper publishes on Tuesday, is a history of American food during the Great Depression of the 1930s.
Showing some sort of culinary solidarity of their own, they meet the editor for dinner at Eisenberg&#39;s Sandwich Shop, a tiny, unsophisticated lunch bar in the Flatiron District that has been in business since the 1929 stock market crash.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese and olive sandwich, and Coe, 57, had turkey, mashed potatoes and veggies.
When the reporter ordered meatloaf, the couple saw fit to discuss eating during the recession.
&quot;The shortbread was very popular,&quot; Ziegelman said.
There were peanut pretzels, liver pretzels, bean pretzels.
They were made from a preparation material and some cheap ingredient that was used to continue the actual preparation material.
Imagine eating enough peanuts to make up your dinner.
Coe grimaced.
&quot;It must have felt heavy in the stomach,&quot; he said.
In the years before the Depression, American tables, especially in rural areas, were like an eat-as-much-as-you-can buffet.
Groups of women cooked for the male farm workers, and fresh pie was served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
Americans sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. A Square Meal chronicles the ways in which a nation coped with the fact that it was suddenly no longer a land of plenty.
&quot;At that time, food became a central, vexing subject for Americans,&quot; Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Equally unnerving was the new, affordable diet: Mystery dishes like pretzels and boxes became staples, and box was “a great way to use leftovers,” Ziegelman noted, because chefs could hide less appealing ingredients under a layer of creamy sauce.
Fresh fruits were replaced by cheaper dried fruits.
Meat, which had been at the center of American meals for years, became a sparingly portioned luxury product.
Special combinations were tried, with calorie count and nutrient content being more important than taste or even common sense in the kitchen.
While doing research for the book, which also includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a period dish in which fried onions were stuffed with peanut butter.
“It wasn&#39;t a popular addition to the dinner table,” Coe said.
Ziegelman elaborated: “It was unreal.”
Peanut butter is no match for fried onions.
This was characteristic of many household recipes.
Home economics experts such as Louise Stanley, director of the federal Home Office from 1923 to 1943, guided the nation&#39;s eating habits more than ever before or since.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become &quot;budgeters&quot; and take on the challenge of turning lumps like mashed spaghetti and carrots into tasty portions.
A Square Meal is a celebration of historical delicacies.
Particularly tasty are the accounts of government responses to hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover&#39;s let-me-eat-cake attitude.
While he publicly extolled the simple, country Iowa food of his childhood, he dined like the sophisticated millionaire he had become.
“He liked continental food, like fish and pickles,” Coe said.
He ate in an almost gilded dining room wearing a tuxedo.
He was awesomely out of everything.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not encouraged him to lead by example with his own stomach.
As the book recounts, when Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper with no interest in taste, the White House became a place that &quot;served not only some of the worst food in Washington, but also some of the most wretchedly prepared food.&quot;
Many of the Depression-era eating habits were abandoned as soon as the country got back on its feet.
The legacy is our continued focus on calories and nutrition, Ziegelman said, and the way science is applied to cooking.
The couple said that while writing the book, they gained a better understanding of Ziegelman&#39;s mother&#39;s eating habits, such as how she couldn&#39;t throw away food.
“He was really afraid of wasting food,” Coe said.
Ziegelman recalled, “He even made people sick.”
There was a wind hat incident.
After the plates were cleared at Eisenberg&#39;s, he and Coe pulled out a dessert they had made at home: the plum dessert that President Roosevelt had for lunch.
“It&#39;s called plum mousse,” Ziegelman said, adding that a common ploy was to give humble recipes a flashy name.
There was no whipped cream in the dessert, just plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly dipped their spoons into the gooey, brown paste.
Surprisingly, it wasn&#39;t bad.
Coe faltered once and again.
Sounding like a positive budgeter, he told his wife: &quot;some chopped walnuts could help&quot;.
Gilead awarded legal fees in hepatitis C patent battle against Merck
A U.S. district judge has ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc. is entitled to legal fees it incurred in a hepatitis C patient lawsuit against drugmaker Merck &amp; Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was released from paying $200 million after they infringed on two Merck patents related to Gilead&#39;s blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni. That release followed a US judge&#39;s finding of misconduct by Merck, which included perjury and other unethical practices.
In Thursday&#39;s ruling, U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman said Gilead is entitled to relief from damages it incurred while opposing the lawsuit.
Merck is trying to catch Gilead, which dominates the market, with a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure well over 90 percent of patients with the liver disease.
The lawsuit dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other for ownership of the laboratory work on the basis of sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead&#39;s drugs.
US-backed forces say they have fully captured Manbij, which is held by ISIS
US-backed forces have fully captured the northern city of Manbij, near the Turkish border, after the last remaining Islamic State fighters left the city, a spokesman for the group said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now probing the city after the last group of fighters hiding in the city left.
The forces had freed more than 2,000 captives held by the fighters, Sharfan Darwish of the SDF&#39;s allied force, the Manbij Military Council, told Reuters.
&quot;The city is now completely under our control, but we have begun to investigate it,&quot; he told Reuters.
The Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015, paid 34.2 percent in federal taxes
On Friday, Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax return, which showed the Democratic presidential nominee and her spouse&#39;s income for that year was $10.75 million, and their effective federal tax rate was 34.2 percent.
In 2015, the Clintons donated $1 million to charities, primarily the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton earned nearly $5.3 million in speaking fees, and the former Secretary of State reported receiving $3 million from publisher Simon &amp; Schuster for his book about his State Department career.
Clinton&#39;s running mate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, along with his wife Anne Holton, released 10 years of tax returns.
Their effective federal tax rate in 2015 was 20.3 percent.
&quot;Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine are setting the bar for financial transparency,&quot; Clinton campaign aide Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
In stark contrast to this, Donald Trump hides behind false pretenses and reneges on his previous promises to release his tax returns.
It is customary for US presidential candidates to release their tax returns, although they are not required by law to do so.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers have cited the tax board&#39;s audit as the reason for refusing to publish tax returns.
&quot;Your turn,&quot; Clinton campaign aide Ian Sams said on Twitter when he posted a link to the Democratic candidate&#39;s tax returns.
On Thursday, Trump&#39;s special assistant, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to release them until the audits were complete.
Trump&#39;s critics, including 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and other fellow Republicans, have said his refusal raises questions about his wealth, his charitable giving, his business dealings and numerous other ties to Russia, among others.
Clinton has seized on the issue, releasing an online video Friday that featured prominent Republicans urging Trump to release his taxes.
On Thursday, he raised the issue in a speech on the economy in Michigan.
&quot;He refuses to do what every presidential candidate in the last few decades has done: release his tax returns,&quot; he told the crowd.
Politico has reported that Trump has paid little or no taxes for two years in the 1990s, and a New York Times business columnist on Friday quoted numerous tax attorneys and accountants who said the situation may still be the same.
Federal tax rates have become an issue in presidential elections.
Clinton has supported a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett that would ensure that those earning more than $1 million a year would pay at least 30 percent in taxes.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
At Clinton&#39;s meeting in Omaha, Nebraska last week, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is based there, challenged Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he, too, is undergoing an audit of the IRS, and that Trump is &quot;not afraid&quot; of the IRS, but of the voters.
Clinton&#39;s campaign has released tax returns going back to 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, had an effective federal tax rate of about 32 percent between 2007 and 2014, and their effective combined tax rate was about 40.5 percent.
Clinton&#39;s 2015 tax return showed that only $100 of their income came from wages, unlike the majority of Americans.
Their primary investment was a low-cost, index-linked mutual fund, and the Clintons reported $109,000 in dividend and interest income.

Chili powder condoms and firecrackers boost elephant protection in Tanzania
Conservationists in Tanzania are using an unusual method to prevent elephants from wandering into human settlements - they throw condoms filled with chili powder at the animals.
The method has proven to be effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with the idea several years ago, together with the American Nature Conservancy, has intensified its promotion by training volunteers in the villages of northern Tanzania to use a non-violent four-step method to protect homes and crops without harming animals.
In the past, many used spears to protect themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day, dedicated to the conservation of these animals.
“Since we developed the...tools, we&#39;ve seen a change in attitude in these communities. They are now much more confident that they can keep elephants out of their fields without harming them,” Honeyguide executive director Damian Bell said in a statement.
The first two steps involve pointing at the encroaching elephant with a flashlight and blowing the horn.
If it doesn&#39;t stop the animal, a so-called &quot;chili cloud&quot; is thrown.
The condom is filled with a mixture of chili powder and soil and a firecracker, after which the condom is screwed shut so that only the ignition wire is visible.
When lit, the condom bursts open with a bang, spewing chili powder dust into the air.
One sniff is usually enough to send an elephant in the other direction.
The last resort is a trigger that shoots a roman candle into the air. A firework produces a loud, bright explosion.
RT News: Jewish filmmaker criticizes Berlin hotel that removed Israeli area code at Arab request
A French filmmaker of Jewish background unleashed a media firestorm after revealing that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin does not list an Israeli area code. According to the employee, this is due to the &quot;requests&quot; of Arab customers.
Claude Lanzmann, who made the Shoah documentary about the Holocaust, vented his frustration on the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin, writing an open letter in the German publication FAZ.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the list of country codes provided by the hotel.
However, the country was not mentioned among the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel has been removed and erased?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers the possibility to call Israel through its own call center.
Looking for an explanation, the filmmaker brought up the matter at the hotel reception.
Lanzmann wrote that the response there &quot;shocked him&quot;.
The hotel receptionist said that it was &quot;a considered decision by the management of Kempinski hotels&quot;.
The reason behind the decision caused the filmmaker even more consternation.
&quot;Most of our guests are Arabs, and they demand the removal of the Israeli area code,&quot; the employee is reported to have said, according to Lanzmann.
Israel&#39;s ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, calls the incident &quot;a great injustice,&quot; Zuddeutsche Zeitung reports.
&quot;We were horrified and shocked by the incident.
That in itself is a great injustice.
But it is an even bigger shame that this happened in Germany and in this particular hotel chain.
This needs no explanation.
We expect the hotel to come to the right conclusions,&quot; the official said.
The incident generated quite a backlash online with people calling it a scandal.
Some argued that the Kempinski Hotel simply &quot;gave in&quot; to the alleged demands of Arab customers.
&quot;Shame on you,&quot; said another publication, noting that the hotel, located on the magnificent Kurfurstendamm, stands near a synagogue.
The hotel itself quickly denied all the accusations and called what happened an &quot;inaccuracy&quot; and &quot;apologized&quot; to Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reported.
&quot;A clear order not to include Israel in the speed dial list was never made,&quot; a Kempinski representative is reported to have said, according to the Suddeutche Zeitung.
It adds that the area code has now been added.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesting Brazilian students
Students clashed with police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday as students gathered to demonstrate against the government&#39;s reforms to the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.
The trouble started when law enforcers tried to break up the student crowd, which led to the police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students attended the demonstration to express their horror at the plans.
Under proposals by Sao Paolo state governor Paulo Geraldo Alckmini, just under 100 public schools would be closed and 300,000 students would be relocated to save money.
Some of those taking part in the demonstration were seen writing graffiti against interim President Michel Temer on the walls.
This latest demonstration comes just days after protesters marched in unison to support impeached President Dilma Rousseff as the country&#39;s Senate voted to impeach her.
RT Business: Trade between Russia and Iran suddenly increases by 71%
After the removal of sanctions, the turnover of trade between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9 percent compared to the previous year, says the Russian ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan.
After the lifting of international sanctions against Iran, Russian companies have largely shown interest in doing business in the country, the ambassador said.
Russian companies continue their existing ties with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
&quot;Naturally, one of the most important goals of Iran&#39;s bilateral cooperation is to expand trade,&quot; Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that in the first five months of 2016, the turnover of trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015, totaling $856 million.
Russian exports to Iran in particular rose by 91.5 percent, totaling 697 million dollars.
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to 158 million dollars.
&quot;Trade growth was achieved through the delivery of machines, vehicles and weapons,&quot; the ambassador said.
In addition, Dzhagaryan expects a record number of Iranian tourists to Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian embassy in Iran issued about 35,000 visas to Iranian citizens, mainly for travel.
Iran was also for the first time among the 20 countries from which the most tourists visit Russia.
&quot;It&#39;s probably safe to say that last year&#39;s record number of Iranian tourists in Russia will be broken,&quot; he said.
At the same time, quite a few Russians visit Iran, something the ambassador hopes will change.
&quot;I can personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd. They have preserved the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization in good condition,” he said.
Scotsman Callum Skinner stormed to the finish line as the British took the cycling gold
Scotland&#39;s Callum Skinner claimed glory in the men&#39;s team sprint at the Rio Cycling Stadium last night as Team Great Britain&#39;s trio defended their title from London 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow anchored a role in which fellow Scot Sir Chris Roy excelled, the legend was proud of the youngster as he raced to the finish to grab victory from the pre-favourite New Zealand team.
Britain took a shock victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic golds.
And they repeated the trick after finishing a modest sixth at March&#39;s track world championships in London, although Hoy has since retired from racing.
The problem between the Beijing and London games was the replacement of special envoy Jamie Staff.
This was accomplished just in time when Hindes appeared.
Hoy&#39;s retirement also created a void that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was a man that the British coaches held on to, seeing the potential in the Scot, which has now been realised.
Hindes, Kenny - who won the title with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set Olympic records in the time trials, but New Zealand took the lead in the first round.
And the British trio won the duel for gold.
Hindes was well behind after his own lap, but Kenny took the team lead and Skinner held on.
The change in strategy was a big part of the makeover and that included Hindes driving in a bigger gear to slow him down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to hold the pace.
Hoy watched from his position as a BBC pundit and caught the attention of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they took to the podium.
Skinner, 23, from Glasgow, said: &quot;The comparison is flattering.&quot;
I&#39;m just here to do my best and gain fame.
We set an Olympic record in the final and won the world champions.
It was simply incredible.
There can be no better way to win.
After winning in London 2012 alongside Kenny and Hoy, Hindes admitted that he had deliberately crashed on the track after a bad start.
He later retracted his comments and Britain&#39;s rivals have not complained.
This time there was no similar problem with the overwhelming victory.
Hindes said: &quot;It felt like I was in London with so many British flags on the pedestal.&quot;
As a team, we found a connection over the past three months.
We&#39;ve lost so many world championships, so to win the Olympics again is just fantastic.
One event, one gold medal for a nation that won seven out of ten cycling events in both Beijing and London.
If this reflects the development of the last five months, we are in for a successful five days at the cycling stadium.
Based on the form Kenny has shown, it is not at all impossible to imagine him repeating Hoy&#39;s feat of winning three Olympic golds in one Olympics.
It would mean Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who is also born on March 23 (that apparently holy day in British sport, which also happens to be the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - would take his medal tally to six golds and to one silver.
That would be the same as Hoy.
Kenny will next compete in the sprint, which starts today and lasts for three days.
The 28-year-old, from Bolton, said: “I&#39;m just enjoying this one now.
Team competition is always the best.
It is won together with friends.
To be honest, winning alone is lonely.”
Hindes said: &quot;If he wins another two gold medals, he should be knighted.&quot;
This was the only medal race of the day, but there was more good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull were fastest in the four-person, four-kilometer team pursuit.
Their time was 3:51:943.
The world record that won gold in London 2012 is 3:51:659.
The first round and final (10:42 p.m.) will take place today, the second day of competition, with Wiggins sure to be the center of attention.
He had an argument with the judges yesterday before qualifying when the officials called him for a length measurement.
In the corresponding women&#39;s race, which continues and finishes tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Milngavie&#39;s Katie Archibald advanced in world record time as the clock stopped in 4:13:260.
Team Great Britain has come to rely on its formidable track cycling team to take over the middle of the Olympics and achieve a whole host of medals.
After showing truly exceptional and complete control in Beijing and London, expectations have been downplayed ahead of the Rio Games.
There has been drama in the background, not the least of which was the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April amid allegations of sexism and harassment, and the end of the racing careers of greats such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, based on the first night&#39;s racing at the Cycling Stadium, it looks like Great Britain&#39;s now-legendary reputation for peaking at the perfect moment could hold true once again.
Future of Portland smelter in doubt due to power contract cuts
The future of Portland&#39;s Victoria aluminum smelter, along with the jobs of hundreds of workers, is uncertain after the power company that supplies the plant revealed that one of the plant&#39;s owners is terminating the distribution contract, so a cut in all distribution contracts is expected.
The measure follows the decision made by the Victorian government earlier this year that the subsidies required to keep the plant operating will not be extended.
Tukiainen&#39;s 20-year fixed period ends in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs could be at risk at Alcoa&#39;s Portland plant.
Up to 2,000 jobs may be at risk, directly or indirectly, with the closure of the factory.
In addition to that, a snowball effect may be possible, as the smelter uses about 10 percent of Victoria&#39;s total electricity production.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelter, which led to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoa&#39;s Portland smelter is losing money and is under threat of closure.
The move now follows several years of speculation about the factory&#39;s future, which began as a result of the strong Australian dollar and has recently been driven by the price of the factory&#39;s production.
AGL, which supplies electricity to a large aluminum smelter from its Loy Yang An power station in the Latrobe Valley, said it also expects three other owners to terminate their contracts.
Most of the plant is owned by the Alcoa and Alumina group, with China&#39;s CITIC and Japan&#39;s Marubeni Corp owning smaller shares.
&quot;AGL expects the Portland plant to continue operating, which means the smelter&#39;s physical electricity demand will continue,&quot; it said.
According to AGL, the agreements are so-called &quot;hedging agreements&quot; that were supposed to enter into force in November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so they effectively end in 2017.
&quot;For that reason, AGL expects the contracts to produce a profit in the 2017 financial year,&quot; the utility company said.
Any possible profit impact for AGL from the financial year 2018 onwards is currently limited by the strong prospects of the electricity wholesale price futures market.
AGL said it had already written down the value of the contracts in its books by $187 million &quot;in anticipation of termination&quot;.
Alcoa said the decision to end the contracts &quot;will not affect Alcoa&#39;s ... ability to keep the smelter operating or secure the smelter&#39;s electricity supply&quot;.
The US company said it signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, and that the contract was due to take effect in November this year, but has yet to explain why it pulled out.
Analysts have been wary of the possible closure of both the Portland smelter in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle, due to the poor economic situation in the industry.
Earlier in the week, AGL executive director Stephen Mikkelsen told analysts that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity annually and Tomago about 900 megawatts.
&quot;If both factories leave the market, it will be a significant reduction in the demand of the [electricity] market.
For us as a power producer, this would not be a good thing,&quot; he said.
Kendall, not just a Kardashian reality star, is on the cover of September&#39;s Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, the fourth daughter of the model and mother-manager Kris Kardashian-Jenner clan, is on the cover of US Vogue&#39;s coveted September issue.
Kendall, who is a brand ambassador for Estee Lauder and has modeled at Milan, Paris and New York fashion weeks, announced the news on Thursday on her Instagram account.
&quot;Seeing this cover in a room full of loved ones brought me to tears,&quot; Kendall wrote.
The cover release was followed by a quirky (or maybe just Kardashian-esque?) scripted reality video in which the entire Kardashian-Jenner clan (minus troublemakers Rob and Caitlyn, and joined by everyone&#39;s favorite entertainer, Keeping Up producer Ryan Seacrest) forgot about their sister&#39;s cover, but which ended with a classic twist: they planned a surprise party.
It&#39;s the clichéd plotline of almost every children&#39;s television &quot;birthday episode&quot; (Seacrest delivers the line &quot;you didn&#39;t think we&#39;d forget you&quot; with the credibility of a morning bunny), but Kris had to get her other girls to somehow benefit from this publicity.
That&#39;s because we&#39;ve definitely entered a new era of Kardashians with a spot in September&#39;s Vogue.
Kendall&#39;s older sister Kim may have graced the cover of Vogue first (she shared it with husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the magazine&#39;s September issue is in a class all its own.
Vogue&#39;s September issue is the best-selling edition of the entire year.
Its thickness is more like a coffee journal than a fashion magazine, and the issue attracts a huge number of advertisers (Fashionista calculated that 615 of last year&#39;s 832-page opus was advertising content).
The reveal of its cover star is so eagerly awaited that for the past two years, photos from the magazine have been leaked before the official announcement.
Previous women on the cover have included Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
Indeed, in recent years there have been more &quot;celebrities who act as models&quot; than &quot;models who are celebrities&quot; on the cover.
Oscar winner and Dior ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga&#39;s honor.
But if it happens that Jenner, who the magazine describes as the &quot;success model&quot; of her generation, falls into the first mentioned category, she&#39;s in pretty good company.
These celebrities aren&#39;t relatives of famous people or reality stars or today&#39;s youth who know how to make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner is all of those things).
They are legitimately talented women who are succeeding in the entertainment industry.
Last year&#39;s cover model Beyonce has had one of the strongest years of her career with the release of Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is happy about Jenner&#39;s success.
With her reality TV history, Jenner&#39;s position in the fashion world will always be a thorny one.
In June, original Victoria&#39;s Secret model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them &quot;the moms of the moment.&quot;
This sentiment resurfaced with Jenner&#39;s Vogue cover.
But wallowing in discontent is irrelevant.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of Vogue&#39;s September issue.
She is a supermodel in the purest sense of the word.
She is a model for Marc Jacobs.
She sells you Estee Lauder foundation.
She and all her sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their own paywalled apps.
He sells photos of Cindy Crawford&#39;s daughter that he took for LOVE magazine.
And in his spare time, possibly just to see his sister Kourtney and her kids, he&#39;s a reality TV star.
Community legal centers turn away 160,000 people every year
More than 160,000 of the nation&#39;s most vulnerable are turned away from community legal centers every year as the sector prepares for the impact of further funding cuts on its already stretched-out operations.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mainly the elderly, migrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, those without the means to fight unfair evictions and the like - are already turned away when they seek free legal advice and representation.
The community&#39;s already stretched legal services are preparing for further cuts.
In June of next year, these legal centers are set to lose 30 percent of their federal funding.
Community Legal Centers Queensland director James Farrell said thousands of people were already being turned away each year, according to the latest National Association of Community Legal Centers census report.
Farrell said if the federal government&#39;s decision is not reversed, the situation will only get worse.
&quot;Queensland&#39;s community justice centers are chronically underfunded, meaning thousands of people are turned away from the essential services they need every year,&quot; he said.
People leaving abusive relationships with unmanageable and crippling debt, families in divorce, unfairly dismissed workers - all these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they are not getting the help they need.
The Federal Government will cut funding by 30% in June 2017, meaning thousands of vulnerable Queenslanders will be forced to navigate complex legal issues without help.
We appeal to the Attorney General and Queensland Senator George Brandis to immediately reverse these funding cuts so people can get the help they need with their legal problems.
Last year the state government delivered on its promise to raise legal aid funding to the national average.
Now is the time to look at the needs of community legal centers and their client communities, and the Palaszczuk Government should invest in this important work.
Donald Trump&#39;s campaign was sued after an employee was allegedly threatened with a gun
New York: Donald Trump&#39;s campaign has been sued for allegedly doing nothing after being told the campaign&#39;s North Carolina operations chief threatened a staffer with a gun in February while they were riding in a Jeep.
The incident was described in a lawsuit filed Wednesday in state court in Charlotte by former state campaign software intern Vincent Bordini.
Bordini said he waited for months for the situation to be handled internally before realizing &quot;it wasn&#39;t going to happen.&quot;
Chief Earl Phillip &quot;took out a pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger and pushed the barrel against Vincent&#39;s kneecap,&quot; Bordini said in the lawsuit.
After complaining to local and regional campaign managers, Bordini learned that at least four other people had had similar experiences with Phillip, the suit said.
&quot;Guns do not need to be fired to cause harm,&quot; Bordini said in the lawsuit.
The challenge comes just two days after the Republican presidential nominee caused outrage by telling a crowd in North Carolina that &quot;Second Amendment people&quot; -- generally understood to mean gun owners and gun owners -- could take action if his rival Hillary Clinton is elected and allowed to pick judges.
Trump&#39;s campaign said the media had taken his words out of context and that he does not support violence.
Bordin&#39;s lawsuit seeks compensation from the campaign for negligent supervision, and from Phillip for violence, assault and causing emotional shock.
Trump&#39;s spokeswoman Hope Hicks did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Attempts to reach Phillip were unsuccessful.
WCCB, a local news affiliate in Charlotte, reported that Phillip recently left the campaign.
A call to his consulting firm Innovative Consulting Services was not immediately returned.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump&#39;s campaign has been controversial.
The case is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump for President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division Country of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain needs to channel the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow brings regeneration and prosperity to the whole stomach, not just to local communities and across London.
For me, this was the great appeal of Heathrow, just as it was the appeal of the London 2012 Games, when we went to great lengths to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the Games.
The Olympics brought huge benefits to Stratford and the East End.
And we will do so again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
10,000 new apprenticeships and 40,000 new jobs will be created for local communities alone, and youth unemployment around the airport will be eliminated.
As before the London 2012 Games, some will come away thinking that the challenge of expanding Heathrow is too great.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Games and that we would be an embarrassment to the world.
The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will be wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question that is thrown at it.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for the many, not just the few.
The expansion has the potential to create up to 180,000 new jobs and £211bn of economic growth, as well as leaving a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow who have delivered an £11bn infrastructure investment program on time and on budget: from T5, voted the world&#39;s best airport terminal five years running, to T2, built between two of the world&#39;s busiest runways.
Now the team is ready to build a third runway, backed by £16bn of private money.
The London 2012 Olympics were a great success for Great Britain and I am convinced that the Heathrow expansion will be as well.
It&#39;s time we channeled the Olympic spirit and expanded Heathrow, securing the future of our trade and creating a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is chairman of the Heathrow Board and a former commercial secretary to the Treasury.
Adblock Plus and Facebook in a cat and mouse game about blocking ads
For companies that make money from online advertising, trying to bypass ad-blocking software is &quot;a game of cat and mouse,&quot; said one of the companies that make such software.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced it would block ad blockers on its desktop pages, Adblock Plus released a blog post saying users can update the program&#39;s filters to once again block ads on the social network&#39;s pages.
On Tuesday, Facebook said it is changing the code around the ads on its websites to make it harder for ad blockers to detect which parts of the page are ads.
But now Adblock says it has circumvented the new code.
In a blog post, Adblock&#39;s Ben Williams wrote that &quot;this kind of back-and-forth between the open source ad-blocking community and its circumventors has been going on since ad-blocking was invented,&quot; and that it&#39;s possible Facebook will come up with its own solution soon.
The fact that the world&#39;s largest social media company has joined the fray is a strong indication of just how much of a pain ad blockers have become for the industry.
Around 200 million worldwide use ad blockers, according to last year&#39;s Pagefair and Adobe research. This is almost four times the number who used these programs in 2013.
1.03 million active daily users use Facebook on mobile devices, and mobile advertising now accounts for 84 percent of Facebook&#39;s ad revenue.
However, the company is pursuing ad blockers on desktop pages, as mobile ad blockers don&#39;t work on Facebook&#39;s mobile apps for the social network or Instagram, the representative said.
Desktop ads still bring in enough revenue for Facebook to consider such a move worth the investment.
Also on Tuesday, Facebook said it would update its “ad preferences” tool to give people more power over how ads are targeted to them.
On Thursday, Facebook argued that Adblock&#39;s new filters were troubling because they would also block some non-advertising content on the site.
&quot;This is not a good experience for people, and we have plans to address the issue,&quot; a Facebook representative said in an emailed statement.
Ad blockers are boring tools, which is why we&#39;ve focused instead on building tools like Ad Preferences that put people in control.
A woman was hit by a car on a Swiss highway, apparently due to suicide
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are appealing for witnesses after a woman was run over by multiple vehicles on a freeway in the early hours of Thursday in what appeared to be a suicide.
The incident happened on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud just after midnight on Thursday.
The woman committed a &quot;desperate act&quot; and laid down on the road in the dark, where she was hit by several vehicles, Vaud police said in a statement.
The victim, who clearly tried to kill herself, was a 49-year-old Swiss woman who was hit by several vehicles, including a truck.
He died at the scene.
Several drivers related to the incident have already been questioned, but not all of them have been identified yet, said the police, who appeal to them and all eyewitnesses who witnessed the incident to come forward.
A criminal investigation has been initiated, which is a &quot;logical&quot; step in a situation like this, lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve.
&quot;However, it remains to be seen whether any of the drivers involved will be charged.
Was it possible to avoid the collision?
It is up to the prosecutor to decide,&quot; Hofstetter said.
Two similar incidents in the last five years suggest that drivers are not being held accountable.
In both cases - both involving a person walking in the dark on a freeway - it was judged that motorists cannot expect to encounter a pedestrian on the freeway in the middle of the night, the paper said.
Last year, a police officer was cleared of manslaughter charges after he hit and killed a man who was lying on the A! Road near Paynerne one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and had passed out on the road, the court was told.
The court found that the police, who were responding to the emergency call, drove in a justified manner, and that the presence of the man on the road was &quot;a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation&quot;, the judge said.
Anyone with information about Thursday&#39;s incident near Morges should call the police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
According to NASA&#39;s new climate model, Venus was probably once habitable.
Scientists at NASA&#39;s Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to study Venus&#39; past using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to find out if Venus, with its hot, waterless surfaces and atmosphere filled with carbon dioxide, could have ever had Earth-like conditions.
Scientists have previously proposed that Venus&#39;s slow rotation rate is explained by its thick atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, Earth-like atmosphere and still spin slowly.
The model also looked at the surface formation of early Venus.
The planet likely had areas drier than Earth, but there was once enough water and geographic variation to support life and protect against rapid water evaporation.
Early Venus also had the advantage of a 30 percent dimmer sun.
&quot;In the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus exposes its daytime side to the sun for almost two months at a time,&quot; GISS researcher Anthony Del Genio explained in a news release.
This warms the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick cloud layer that acts like an umbrella, shielding the surface from much of the sun&#39;s heat.
As a result, average climate temperatures are actually a few degrees cooler than Earth&#39;s current temperatures.
The model produced a story about the stages of Venus&#39; development that is similar to what planetary scientists had previously assumed.
Although Venus was likely once habitable, it was exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light over several billion years.
Its oceans evaporated and its water vapor burned in ultraviolet light.
When its hydrogen escaped, all that was left was a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere with its deadly greenhouse gas effects - the Venus we know today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy is stepping down as Avalanche coach
Patrick Roy resigned as Colorado Avalanche coach and vice president of hockey affairs on Thursday, citing a lack of influence in the team&#39;s decision-making process.
Colorado vice president/general manager Joe Sakic confirmed the news and mentioned that the team will begin the search for a new coach immediately.
&quot;For the past three years, I have performed my duties as the Colorado Avalanche&#39;s vice president of hockey affairs and head coach with enthusiasm, passion and determination,&quot; Roy, 50, said in a statement.
I&#39;ve thought long and hard over the summer about how I can improve this team to give it the depth it needs and take it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the vision of the coach and VP of Hockey must be fully aligned with the vision of the organization.
He must also have the opportunity to influence decisions that affect the team&#39;s performance.
These conditions are currently not fulfilled.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contributions to the team.
&quot;Patrick told me today about his decision,&quot; Sakic said.
We appreciate all that he has done for the organization and wish him the best of luck in the future.
Roy was named the league&#39;s Jack Adams Award for Coach of the Year in his first season with the Avalanche in 2013-14.
He led the team to 112 points and a Central Division title, but Minnesota knocked off Colorado in the first round of the playoffs and the team has not made the playoffs in the past two years.
The Avalanche&#39;s 2015-16 season finished with 39 wins, 39 losses, and 4 ties, and the team lost by five points to the Wild to lose the Western Conference wild card playoff spot.
Hall of Fame goaltender Roy won four Stanley Cups - two with both the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers continue negotiations and postpone the strike
North Sea oil workers&#39; industrial action over pay will be postponed as all sides in the dispute sit down for a new round of talks, top negotiators said.
Strikes against oilfield services company Wood Group have been organized sporadically on North Sea rigs led by Royal Dutch Shell.
&quot;The Wood Group and the Unite and RMT unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the process aimed at resolving the current dispute,&quot; the joint statement read.
We will be holding several all-day meetings over the next few weeks, starting early next week, to bring a fresh perspective to the issues.
Unions say their recent industrial action, which they say is the first in more than 25 years, was in protest against potential pay cuts of up to 30 percent.
This year, Wood Group cut North Sea contractors&#39; fees by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure.
The company&#39;s fee reduction follows the 10 percent reduction of contractors in its countries from 2014.
The company said the additional cuts would give the company the necessary wiggle room to weather the market downturn.
Shell, on the other hand, has cut thousands of people from its payroll and announced plans to exit oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as the company streamlines operations following its giant merger with British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices, and this economic situation is exacerbated by Britain&#39;s decision to leave the European Union in June.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest North Sea labor disputes in a generation.
He said the North Sea is essential to the region&#39;s economy.
&quot;We need an economy that works for the many, not just the few, both in the North Sea and in the whole country,&quot; he said in a statement.
In 2016, less than USD 1.4 billion of investments in new projects are expected in the North Sea, while the average of the previous five years has been around USD 7 billion.
Kepler measures the rotation speed of the stars in the Pleiades constellation
The latest mission of the Kepler space telescope has helped astronomers gather the most complete list of the rotation rates of stars in the Pleiades constellation.
The new data will help astronomers understand why the cluster&#39;s stars rotate at varying speeds, as well as how rotation periods relate to planet formation.
&quot;We hope that by comparing our results to other star clusters, we will now learn more about the relationship between a star&#39;s mass, its age, and even its solar system history,&quot; Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech&#39;s Pasadena Center for Infrared Processing and Analysis, said in a press release
The Pleiades star cluster is located 445 light years from Earth.
Many of the cluster&#39;s stars were born about 125 million years ago, and are just now reaching adulthood.
They are now running at their peak.
At their peak rotation speed, these maturing stars eject large amounts of stellar wind.
As these winds pass through the stars&#39; magnetic fields, they put the brakes on the stars.
As a star ages, its rotation rate begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by watching for the appearance of recognizable starspots, such as sunspots.
The most recent list of stellar rotation rates suggests that more massive stars rotate more slowly than less massive stars.
Rebull compares stars to dancers, the bigger ones doing pirouettes slower than the smaller ones.
&quot;In the &#39;ballet&#39; of the Pleiades, we see that slow rotators tend to be more massive, while the fastest rotators tend to be very light stars,&quot; Rebull said.
Because the Pleiades star cluster is so close, it is an ideal cosmic laboratory for evaluating the properties of stars by their rotation rates.
&quot;The Pleiades star cluster provides an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation that include both directions, younger and older,&quot; Rebull said.
We still have a lot to learn about how, when and why stars slow down their rotation rate and hang up their &#39;dancing shoes&#39;, so to speak.
Rebull and his colleagues described their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the Pleiades in three papers to be published soon in the Astronomical Journal.
