Two Mexican states have sounded the alarm because of Hurricane Hannah
The Mexican National Directorate of Civil Defense announced an "orange" (high) level of alarm in the two eastern states of Tamaulipas and Nuevo León due to the approaching hurricane Hanna, TASS reports.
The hurricane will bring heavy rains to Mexico, in some areas it is predicted to fall from 150 to 250 liters of precipitation per square meter.
The authorities have prepared about 800 shelters for the population.
10 thousand people will provide assistance to people, including rescuers, National Guard soldiers and military.
At the moment, the hurricane has reached the coast of the US state of Texas with a wind speed of 150 km / h.

Semilarski against the prosecutor's office: the cassation of the former vice-mayor of Tartu will be considered on August 4
This means that a decision on it is likely to be made in early September.
The courts of the first two instances refused to consider Semilarsky's claim, but in April his cassation appeal was accepted by the State Court.
On 12 December 2019, the Tartu Administrative Court returned the complaint to the applicant, as it did not fall within the competence of the Administrative Court.
The court's decision stated that the complaint contained a claim for compensation for damage caused during the criminal proceedings.
"It is up to the prosecutor's office and the county court to regulate such matters," Tartu court spokeswoman Anett Kreutsmann previously explained to ERR.
According to her, Walvo Semilarski appealed the ruling to the district court, which on February 5 did not change the decision of the court of first instance.
Now the State Court will have to say its word.
According to Semilarski's lawyer, sworn lawyer Oliver Nääs, his client was unreasonably under suspicion of bribery for about two years.
Now he demands that the prosecutor's office refute the incorrect allegations against him and compensate him for moral damage.
The reason for filing a complaint with the court was the statements of the Prosecutor for Special Cases of the Lyuna District Prosecutor's Office Margus Gross, made by him in October 2017, when Semilarski, together with another at that time Vice Mayor of Tartu Artem Suvorov, was detained on suspicion of committing several crimes.
"Recall that when I was detained, the Security Police and the Prosecutor's Office immediately organized a press conference and informed the entire Republic of Estonia that the leaders of Tartu - one of the most influential local government bodies - were corrupt.
These public suspicions hanging in the air accompanied me for about two years.
And now that these allegations and suspicions have turned out to be false, the prosecutor's office does not want to say anything about it," Semilarsky commented in early August 2019.
According to Oliver Nääs, at the press conference, the prosecutor went beyond the legal framework in which the prosecutor's office should act.
"The allegation of bribery and venality turned out to be false, but this is not the only problem here.
The European Court of Human Rights, for example, has repeatedly stressed in its rulings on Russia, as well as on Lithuania, that at the stage of the investigation, state representatives should be careful when choosing their words so that suspects would not be presented as criminals before sentencing.
The prosecutor's office is also obliged to do this by the presumption of innocence, which, unfortunately, was not respected in this case against Walvo Semilarski," Nääs said.
"The public presentation of Semilarski as a serious offender and bribe-taker in circumstances where the facts underlying the suspicion of bribery are still being clarified is inadmissible, which is contrary to the presumption of innocence and unfair to the applicant," the lawyer added.
As rus.err.ee wrote, the former vice-mayor of Tartu, Valvo Semilarski, will not be prosecuted on charges of bribery - the criminal case initiated against him in July was partially closed.
At the same time, the former official is on trial on charges of knowingly violating anti-corruption legislation when conducting transactions on a particularly large scale.
According to the indictment, between 2015 and 2017, the former deputy mayor of Tartu participated more than thirty times in meetings of the city government when making decisions related to companies operating in Tartu, with whose owners or managers Semilarski actively communicated on a personal level outside working hours.
According to Gross, in all these cases, Semilarsky had personal interests, and therefore he had to distance himself from participation in decision-making.
Earlier, as rus.err.ee wrote, the prosecutor's office charged Semilarsky with suspicions of receiving a bribe and violating anti-corruption legislation when conducting transactions on a particularly large scale.
This happened in October 2016, when he was detained along with another deputy mayor, Artem Suvorov (Centre Party).
At the time, the prosecutor's office and the Security Police said there was strong evidence against both vice mayors.
After that, both officials resigned.
Suvorov's case later reached the court, which fully acquitted the politician.
The judicial investigation into the case of Walvo Semilarski is still ongoing.

How will the decision of the Central Bank to reduce the key rate affect the economy
The Bank of Russia expectedly again reduced the key rate.
It fell by another 0.25 percentage points, to 4.25% per annum - formally another historical minimum.
Judging by the return of a short step of rate cuts, as well as the tone of the Central Bank's statements and updated forecasts for the Russian economy, the regulator looks at the economic prospects more optimistically than before.
This means that the current cycle of monetary easing may soon come to a halt.
"We continued to ease monetary policy, primarily given that there are still risks of inflation deviation down from 4% in 2021," bank of Russia Governor Elvira Nabiullina said.
They are associated with a significant decline in economic activity, a drop in domestic and external demand.
Economic recovery, according to Nabiullina, will take more than a year and a half.
At the same time, she noted that after the lifting of restrictions due to the pandemic, economic processes revived: energy consumption, consumer and investment demand were restored, construction and production of consumer goods expanded, the annual rate of decline in freight turnover of transport and industrial production slowed down.
According to the updated forecast of the Central Bank, in 2020 the economy will shrink by 4.5-5.5% (before that it was expected to be 4-6%), and the recovery growth of the economy in 2021 will be 3.5-4.5%, in 2022 - 2.5-3.5%.
In addition, the Bank of Russia revised the forecast for annual oil prices to $ 38 and $ 40 per barrel of Urals in 2020 and 2021, respectively.
Earlier, the Central Bank expected 27 and 35 dollars per barrel.
Finally, the Bank of Russia's inflation forecast for 2020 was 3.7-4.2% against the previously expected 3.8-4.8%.
The Bank of Russia's view of the situation in the economy is becoming more optimistic, which brings us closer to the end of the easing cycle, say Sofia Donets and Andrey Melaschenko, economists for Russia and the CIS at Renaissance Capital.
Thus, the Bank of Russia has been consistently reducing the key rate for more than a year, since the beginning of last summer it has already fallen by 3.5 percentage points.
And at the last meeting in June, the Central Bank lowered it immediately by one percentage point due to low inflation due to suppressed demand and the need to stimulate the economy that slowed down due to the pandemic and related restrictions.
The chances of adjusting the monetary policy remain (at the next meeting on September 18 and before the end of the year), but the limit is already close, agrees The chief analyst of Rosbank Evgeny Koshelev.
The totality of proinflationary risks also indicates the proximity of a pause in the easing of interest rate policy - disrupted supply chains, a possible increase in costs due to measures to prevent the epidemic and a faster (compared to expectations) recovery in demand, he says.
To top it off, the Bank of Russia's subsequent actions will require greater attention to inflationary processes during the harvest season, as well as external volatility that has increased against the background of geopolitical conflicts, Koshelev points out.
One way or another, the reduction of the key rate will lead to a further reduction in rates for the most reliable borrowers, as well as, possibly, on mortgages, says Maxim Petronevich, senior economist of the analytical department of Otkritie Bank.
The correction of rates will be less pronounced than the reduction of the key rate, he said.
Consumer loan rates may fall by another 0.3-0.6 percentage points during the second half of the year, mortgage rates may end the year in the range of 6.2-7%, BCS Premier economist Anton Pokatovich does not exclude.
Average deposit rates, in his opinion, will also fall - in the coming months they may fall to 4.2-4.5% (now barely higher than 4.5%).
Further, they can drop to 4% if the Central Bank reduces the key rate in the autumn, Pokatovich believes.

Poll: The ruling Union of Peasants and Greens of Lithuania again topped the rating of parties
The Union of Peasants and Greens of Lithuania, which heads the ruling coalition of the Seimas, topped the rating of the parties.
This was shown by a survey conducted by the sociological research company Vilmorus at the time of ordering the newspaper Lietuvos rytas.

This politician was the first in the list of "peasants" in the 2016 elections.
In third place is the Social Democratic Party, for which 7.1 percent of respondents are now ready to vote.
For a month, she unexpectedly lost 2 percent.
The fourth is the Party of Labor, headed by a businessman of Russian origin Viktor Uspaskikh (6.2 percent).
Other political organizations, judging by the survey, will not yet be able to overcome the 5% electoral threshold.

Unnecessary requirements for applications for public procurement will be excluded by law
The legislation may establish exhaustive requirements for applications for participation in procurement.
In the autumn session, at the plenary session of the State Duma, it is planned to consider in the second reading a bill establishing requirements for the content and composition of the application for participation in the procurement, the participants of which can only be small and medium-sized businesses.

"As a result, customers establish excessive requirements for the content, execution of the application, the mandatory presence in its composition of certificates, certificates, extracts, the period for obtaining which in the authorized bodies is comparable to the deadline for submitting applications, which leads to the impossibility of participating in such a procurement and a reduction in the number of participants in the procurement," the explanatory note to the bill says.

International affairs experts Aaron David Miller and Richard Sokolsky called Mike Pompeo the worst secretary of state in the history of the United States.
The material with their opinion on July 23 was published by CNN.

The head of the region Igor Kobzev met with the mayors of the Ust-Ordynsky Buryat district
During the working meeting, which took place today, July 24, the government of the Irkutsk region discussed the main directions of development of remote agricultural territories.
During working trips to the districts of the Ust-Ordynsky Buryat District, the head of the region gave a number of instructions.
Today, the mayors reported on their implementation.
First of all, the construction of the House of Sports in Ust-Orda was resumed.
The instruction on this facility was given by the President of the Russian Federation fourteen years ago.
But only now the situation has managed to move from the dead point.
866 million rubles will be spent on construction.
The deadline for the completion of the structure is 2022.
And this year the school in the village of Bayandai should be put into operation.
At the moment, the finishing of the premises has been completed.
Of the remaining works - landscaping.
In general, the program for the construction of preschool and secondary education facilities is of particular importance for the region.
For your county in particular.
The demographic situation here is the best in the region.
And we are obliged to create all conditions for the education and leisure of children of all ages, - said igor Kobzev, Acting Governor of the Irkutsk Region.
At the meeting, the head of the region instructed all mayors to actively engage in the development of general plans for settlements.
This is one of the main conditions for the integrated development of the district.
All settlements must have established boundaries and a master plan.
This is necessary for the development of the territory, for the construction of socially significant facilities, as well as infrastructure and cultural heritage, the head of the region emphasized.
Also during the conversation, a problematic issue was raised with a reduction in milk intake from cooperatives by 30%.
This was due to the redistribution by the processing enterprise of the purchase of milk in favor of peasant farms.
Because of this, the share of product acceptance from cooperatives has decreased.
The head of the region instructed the acting Minister of Agriculture to go to the site, study the structure of milk sales, analyze the experience of other territories and determine options for solving the problem.

The authorities of the Moscow region told about the fate of closed landfills
In the Moscow region, solid waste landfills continue to be closed.
This year, the authorities promise to eliminate the latter.
Some of the 39 landfills that existed in the region are being modernized into modern waste processing complexes.
But this option is not possible for every landfill - many of them have acquired dense residential development.
After the landfill is closed, it stands for reclamation - the body of the landfill is poured with soils, degassing and infiltrate drainage systems are installed.
This allows you to stop the chemical processes inside the landfill so that it does not ignite, does not exude a stench, does not poison the soil and groundwater.
And then the former landfill is left to rise as a useless pile among the surrounding residential development.
Why not make something useful out of it?
For example, in Ruza, where the reclamation of the Annino landfill was completed just the other day, the authorities are considering the option of turning a pile into a ski slope.
This landfill, which was operated from 1976 to 2016, has grown so much that it went beyond the boundaries of the land allocated for it.
Therefore, during reclamation, it was necessary to buy out neighboring plots, de facto have long been filled with garbage to the brim.
"Some time will pass, the landfill will "settle", the fortress will be gained, and we will think about what can be done to make it useful.
A ski resort catches the eye," nikolai Parfenov, the head of the Ruza district, told reporters.
Two landfills will become sites for the extraction of renewable energy sources
The Torbeyevo landfills in Lyubertsy and Timokhovo in the Bogorodsk District will become sites for the extraction of renewable energy sources from landfill and biological gases.
By the end of the year, a gas piston power plant will be launched on the territory of Torbeyev, capable of generating up to 8 million kilowatt-hours of electricity and about 0.95 gigacalories of thermal energy per year, which will meet the own needs of the landfill - heat supply to administrative and industrial premises.
Timokhovo will produce 72.5 million kilowatt-hours and will continue to operate as a waste processing complex.
And at the Balashikha training ground "Kuchino", which was closed after complaints from residents about the "Direct Line" with the President of the country, a museum can be created.
"There was such an idea - to create a museum of reclamation of landfills in the Moscow region," said Dmitry Kurakin, deputy chairman of the government and minister of ecology and natural resources of the region.

Beautiful tall minarets only adorned Hagia Sophia
Once again about Hagia Sophia - I came across a text by Fr. Vladimir Zelinsky that, they say, it is necessary to protest.
First, there was free admission - hooray!
I have not been to Istanbul, but it is better to have free admission to the House of God than a paid one.
Secondly, muslims conquered this land as honestly as the Orthodox conquered the Volga-Oka interfluve, the Muslim Caucasus (and built a church in Grozny) and planted apple trees on Mars.
God help!
The Jews conquered the Holy Land.
The Americans conquered America.
Are we going to give everything back to everyone?
Do you think there will be no pagans who will demand the return of their temple, on the site of which the Tithe Church is located?
Thirdly, Muslims have improved this building and invested in it.
That is, they, just like the factories and estates that the Leninists took from the bourgeois in their ownership, belong to the Leninists - Putin and other nomenklatura.
They've improved everything from the Kremlin to the Angara, so it's all their rightful progressors.
Beautiful tall minarets very decorated Hagia Sophia, very.
There was a silly inkwell, there was a silly inkwell with beautiful minarets.
Fourth, there are no "Islamic" and "Orthodox" civilizations.
There are believers, there are hypocrites, there are hypocrites who combine faith and hypocrisy.
A believer in terms of civilization does not think.
This is the thinking of toynbee, an official at the British Foreign Office, who is ashamed to think like that.
And to the believer there is a place of prayer everywhere.
And always.
A believer does not pray only where he is asked to leave from - he retires to another place and prays there.
He is a believer, not a champion.
We are koloboks, not sullen stones.

the decision to expand the RPL would not have been supported by either UEFA or FIFA
President of the Russian Football Union (RFU) Alexander Dyukov believes that it is wrong to expand the Russian Premier League (RPL) to 18 teams at the moment.
"Firstly, it was the decision of the RPL, but I agree with it, because it is wrong to change the rules after the tournament is over.
This violates the integrity of the tournament and the sporting principle.
And, of course, this decision would not have been supported by either UEFA or FIFA," Dyukov said after the final of the Russian Cup "Zenit" - "Khimki" (1:0).
Currently, 16 clubs play in the RPL, but the option of increasing the number of teams to 18 was considered.

The head of the Russian Basketball Federation (RFB) Andrei Kirilenko shared his memories of his games against the legendary Kobe Bryant and Michael Jordan in the matches of the National Basketball Association (NBA).
I knew that Bryant's ego couldn't be hurt by some trash talk so as not to stimulate his athletic anger.
Kobe had a killer instinct, so on the court I tried to talk him in such a way that he did not perceive the game in an aggressive way.
On the set, I complimented him: "Oh!
Kobe, well scored, great pass!
Listening to my enthusiastic responses, he slightly forgot that he needed to pick up the ball once again and score another 3 - 4 points.
We communicated well with Kobe," Kirilenko was quoted as saying by Vechernyaya Moskva.
He also talked about his first game against Jordan.
"I took care of him.
For the first three minutes of the match, I ran around in complete awe of the fact that next to me was a legend that I had only seen on TV.
While my breath was running out of joy in my goiter, Michael scored a lot of points.
Soon I moved away from the excitement, a couple of times covered his shots...
In that game, my team won, and Jordan still scored 44 points," the head of the RFB added.
In the NBA, Kirilenko spent 12 seasons.
He was selected by the Utah Jazz in the 1999 NHL Entry Draft with the 24th overall pick.
In addition to Utah, for which he spent ten seasons, the Russian forward played for the Minnesota Timberwolves and Brooklyn Nets.
In total, he has played 797 games, in which he averaged 11.8 points, 5.5 rebounds, 2.7 assists and 1.8 blocks.
Earlier it was reported that Kirilenko will nominate his candidacy for the election of the head of the RFB.
Degtyarev was surprised by the information about the purchase of Gas "Sakhalin-1" for dollars
Acting Governor of the Khabarovsk Territory Mikhail Degtyarev on Sunday, July 26, during a meeting with residents of Sovetskaya Gavan, was surprised that the region buys Sakhalin gas produced by the American company Exxon Neftegas for dollars.
American gas is contracted in dollars until 2025.
"To be honest, I didn't know that and I'm in such a knockdown because of this information.
I had no idea that this is still possible in 2020 in Russia," RIA Novosti quoted him as saying.
Degtyarev noted that this issue was discussed with the head of the Ministry of Energy of Russia Alexander Novak during his visit to Khabarovsk on July 24.
The acting governor also stressed that by 2025 Gazprom will switch to supplying Russian thermal power plants and capacities, which means that Russian gas purchased in rubles "at normal prices" will be used.
The Sakhalin-1 project is being implemented through a production sharing agreement, where Exxon Neftegas Ltd is the project operator with a 30% stake, Rosneft has another 20%, Japan's Sodeco has 30% and India's ONGC has 20%.
The Khabarovsk Territory has been acquiring gas from this project since 2005.

The actor of the Russian series responded to accusations of "propaganda of LGBT and feminism"
The actor of the Russian series "Chiki", the creators of which were accused of "propaganda of LGBT and feminism", responded to claims to the film.
The authors "understood the sharpness of the topics raised and did not want to offend anyone," said American Stephen Thomas Ochsner in an interview with the publication "Rise".
"It seems to me that this is a story about power and common aspects of human life.
It has nothing to do with LGBT and feminism," said the actor, who played the boy's father, who dressed in women's clothes.
He stressed that he is "proud of the work" and does not consider it propaganda.
At the same time, the American added, he is frightened by the reaction of some people to the storyline of the series: for example, there was a case when "a man in a deep binge shot the set and said that all this is not true."
"Then there were a couple of cases when we met disgruntled locals who did not understand what we were doing.
But we were open, so people who first came with complaints, began to help us," he summed up.
The case of the shooting, the publication explains, occurred in September 2019 in Kabardino-Balkaria: a drunk man attacked the car of the film crew with weapons, after which he was detained by police officers.
Earlier it was reported that the public commissioner for the protection of the family Olga Baranets sent a complaint to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Roskomnadzor on the service more.tv, which hosted the Russian series "Chiki".
Baranets accused the creators of the series of "propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations and feminism", drawing attention to the fact that the main characters of the film work as prostitutes, and the series itself contains "scenes of physical and psychological violence."
The ombudsman was also outraged by the fact that "the series pays a lot of attention to the homosexual sexual orientation" of the minor character.
The comedy drama "Chiki" tells about three prostitutes who started a new life and opened a business on the advice of a friend.
