India also reportedly hopes for a defense cooperation agreement between the two states.
FASO of Russia will hold the final Expert Session
The Federal Agency for Scientific Organizations (FASO of Russia) together with the Russian Academy of Sciences will hold the third Expert Session "Evaluation of the Effectiveness of Scientific Organizations".
The meeting will be the final in a series of meetings held by the agency throughout the year, according to a press release received by the editorial office of Lenta.Ru.
At the third meeting, it is planned to sum up the results of the Expert Session for the year and form a final list of indicators for assessing the effectiveness of scientific organizations.
Separately, the participants of the event plan to discuss the rules for the formation of expert groups responsible for assessing the work of scientific groups, and the criteria for conducting assessments.
The third expert session will be the final event in a series of events to form a common approach for all three academies to the methodology for assessing the effectiveness of the activities of scientific organizations.
Over the past five months, we have managed to do this, and the final version of the regulatory documents is being coordinated.
Following the results of the next session, we must complete the formation of the processes of scientometric and expert analysis, agree on the stages and timing of the assessment," said Elena Aksenova, head of the expert and analytical department of FASO of Russia.
The event will be attended by representatives of more than a hundred scientific institutes of Russia.
As a result, a resolution is expected to be adopted.
The meeting will begin at 10 a.m. Moscow time on September 16, 2014 at the address: Moscow, Solyanka Street, 14.
Scientists have found a way to detect related stars
Astrophysicists at the University of California, Santa Cruz, have studied turbulent mixing and its effect on chemical homogeneities in star clusters.
It is expected that the discovery of specialists will allow you to search among the stars related, that is, those that arose from the same cluster.
The authors published the results of their research in the journal Nature, and briefly they can be found on the university's website.
The reason for the same chemical composition of nearby stars is the turbulent mixing in the gas clouds that precedes the formation of stars.
Even if the born star then leaves the star cluster, its chemical composition can determine the place of its birth and the region of formation of relative stars.
Previously, scientists had doubts that the evolution of a star outside the cluster could lead to differences in its chemical content from that of relatives in the cluster.
The results of the simulations conducted by astrophysicists show that such differences should not appear.
In their study, experts using a supercomputer simulated two streams of interstellar gas, which together formed a cloud.
This object within a few million years, under the influence of its own gravity, is transformed into a cluster in which protostars begin to form.
The scientists added label paints to the original gas streams and found that due to rapid turbulent mixing in the cloud, a high degree of chemical homogeneity is achieved.
According to astrophysicists, their study proves that it is possible to search for relative stars by chemical composition, as well as to determine the possible regions of formation of such objects.
Karratha police arrest 20-year-old after chasing motorcycle at high speed
The motorcycle was confiscated after it was driven at 125 km/h in an area with a speed limit of 70 km/h and through bushland to escape from police in Pilbara.
A transport police patrol in Karrat this morning tried to stop a blue motorcycle, finding that its speed reaches 125 km / h, when it left the service station on Bathgate Road.
Police say the motorcyclist did not stop and continued on Burgess Road, then turned into bushland, causing police to lose sight of him.
A motorcycle and a man matching the driver's description were spotted near a house on Walcott Way in Bulgarra.
Karratha police charged a 20-year-old man with refusing to stop and driving dangerously.
He is due to appear before the Karrata Magistrate's Court on 23 September.
The motorcycle was confiscated and detained for three months.

George Webster accused of rape at hotels in Nairne and Pitlochry
A man will stand trial on charges of raping women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, faces charges during a High Court hearing in Glasgow.
He allegedly raped a woman at the Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry, Perthshire, on June 7, 2013.
It is alleged that Webster attacked her when she was "unconscious, asleep and unable to give consent".
Webster is also accused of raping another woman at the Golf View Hotel in Nairne, which is in the North Scottish Highlands, on May 4, 2014.
Judge Lady Ray set a hearing at the High Court in Edinburgh for Nov. 17.
Lavrov: Russia will not "slam the door" in connection with new sanctions and will not withdraw from the WTO
Russia will not "slam the door" in connection with the new sanctions.
This was stated today by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, speaking to students and teachers of MGIMO.
As for our retaliatory measures in the event of a new wave of anti-Russian sanctions, I will not even speculate, fantasize, because everything should be specifically calculated," he said.
And when we understand what our European and American partners will do this time, then we will make decisions on how to respond to this.
This will not be connected with slamming doors, some grievances, misunderstood," the minister stressed.
First of all, we will start from our interests, our interests to protect our economy, social sphere, our citizens, our business and draw conclusions from the actions of our partners for their adequacy, negotiability and reliability.
By the steps that are being taken in the field of sanctions, it is possible to judge very well what the partners are seeking," the Russian Foreign Minister continued.
If they say loudly that "sanctions will also be painful for us, but we are forced to do this in order to punish Russia," this is probably not very adequate.
As for the WTO withdrawal of the Russian Federation in response to possible new sanctions, it is not.
We, on the contrary, want to more actively master the TOOLS of the WTO, including when it comes to trade disputes," Lavrov said.
We have already used these tools to overcome what we believe is the EU's discriminatory policy on anti-dumping procedures.
According to the minister, Russia is accused of dumping and at the same time anti-dumping measures are used against sectors of the Russian economy.
"We are ready to use the WTO mechanisms in order to defend our position on the inadmissibility of applying the norms of the third energy package of the EU retrospectively," Lavrov said.
How to use lilacs in garden design?
Irina Okuneva answers the questions:
Since lilac after flowering loses its main attractiveness, it is desirable to plant it together with other shrubs.
It goes well with many cultures.
Moreover, next to lilacs, it is possible and necessary to plant both plants that are decorative at other times, and those that bloom simultaneously with it.
Another plus of lilacs is that it provides a lot of opportunities for creativity.
You can form it with a stem tree of various heights, an improved bush, a bush with a wide base and even a semblance of a garden bonsai - a tree with a bizarrely curved trunk.
Just choose the shape that is more in line with the design of your garden.
In Karelia, a resident of the Leningrad region was convicted of selling counterfeit money
According to the republican Ministry of Internal Affairs, the man was engaged in his criminal trade in the Olonets and Segezha districts.
In addition to Karelia, he committed similar crimes in other regions of the country.
In particular, the accused has already managed to inherit in the Vologda region, where in the spring of this year he was sentenced to two and a half years in prison.
Later, the man appeared before the Olonets District Court.
And to complete the investigation of crimes committed in our republic, he was transferred to Segezha.
In the process of investigation, guilt was proved in several episodes of the sale of counterfeit money dating back to the summer of 2013.
At the end of June this year, the materials of the criminal case with the indictment were sent to the court.
On Friday, August 29, the court decided to replace the term of imprisonment with four years with serving in a colony of general regime.
The verdict has not entered into force.
Recall that last week two more sellers of counterfeit money who paid them in the stores of Petrozavodsk were convicted.
Azerbaijani citizens also came to Karelia from St. Petersburg.
One of them was imprisoned for five years, the other - for four.
Each was fined 500 thousand rubles.
The verdict has also not yet entered into legal force.
Arkhangelsk celebrated the 73rd anniversary of the arrival of the first convoy "Dervish"
The rally, which took place in the regional center, was dedicated to the first Arctic convoy.
The Dervish delivered military aid from the United States and Great Britain to the USSR.
In Arkhangelsk, a memorial rally was held at the foundation stone to the future monument to the participants of the northern convoys, which is located on the Sedov embankment in Solombal.
The event brought together representatives of veteran organizations of Arkhangelsk, children from the cadet class.
We first met twenty-three years ago, when the foundation stone was laid.
But at the same time, today's event is not a holiday, but a day of remembrance for those who were not returned by the sea," said Boris Karpov, Chairman of the Council of Veterans of the Northern Shipping Company.
Then the city brass band performed at the event, and pupils of cadet classes presented flowers to veterans and marched with the flags of Russia and the Victory Banner.
The rally ended with the laying of flowers at the foundation stone.
The convoy itself consisted of five British ships and one Dutch transport loaded with strategically important raw materials (10,000 tons of rubber, 1,500 tons of uniform boots, tin, wool and many other implements and equipment).
In addition, on board the ships were military equipment and weapons - 3,800 depth charges and magnetic mines, fifteen Hurricane fighters, in disassembled condition.
At the same time, the convoy escort consisted of 16 ships of the British Navy, among which were two aircraft carriers.
The caravan of ships was not detected by the enemy and safely reached its destination - Arkhangelsk.
A total of 848 ships that took part in vital caravan operations perished 126 transport and about 50 warships.

Remembering the very American ideal that labor rights are human rights
Congressmen Keith Allison and John Lewis have proposed a bill that would protect union organization as a civil right.
"Where there are unions, there are middle-class jobs," says Allison, a Minnesota Democrat who co-chairs the Progressive Caucus Congress.
That's why I'm proud to introduce the Workers' Empowerment Act along with civil rights movement symbol John Lewis.
This groundbreaking bill will give workers the same legal options for discrimination against trade union organizations as other forms of discrimination, stopping the forces of union opponents.
Amending the Labour Relations Regulation Act to allow workers facing discrimination for their participation in trade union organisations to seek justice in the civil courts – and to receive damages and punitive payments – is a reasonable and necessary initiative.
However, this is certainly not a radical initiative – at least by American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis, and the bill's co-sponsors are proposing is to recall a very American thought.
Despite the attacks unions have faced in recent years — in Wisconsin, Michigan, and other states across the country — Americans have once supported countries around the world in embracing, expanding, and respecting labor rights.
There was a time that millions of Americans still remember when this country simultaneously defended democracy, free speech, freedom of the press, and the right to organize.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and his aides helped the country adopt a constitution drafted to ensure that Hideki Tojo's paramilitary autocracy was replaced by democracy.
Fully aware that workers and their unions played a role in shaping the new Japan, they included a text that explicitly recognized that "the right of workers to organize, and to negotiate, and to collective action is guaranteed."
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his aides helped the Germans write a constitution that ensured that Adolf Hitler's fascism was replaced by a strong democracy.
Recognizing that workers would need to organize and be heard in the new state, the Germans included an article that explicitly stated: "The right to form associations in order to protect and improve labor and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every person and every profession or field of activity.
Agreements that restrict or seek to infringe on this right will have no legal effect; measures aimed at that purpose would be found to be unlawful.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt was Chair of the International Commission on Human Rights, which drafted the World Declaration on Human Rights, which would be adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a world agreement, Roosevelt and the drafters included a guarantee that "everyone has the right to organize and join trade unions to protect his interests."
For generations, Americans have taken for granted the basic premise that labor rights are human rights.
When this country advised other countries on how to build civil and democratic societies, Americans explained that the right to organize unions — and to have that union participate as an equal partner in collective bargaining with corporations and government agencies — must be protected.
At a time when these rights are being attacked in America, it is wise, indeed, to return to the American ideal that working people should have the right to organize and to have their voices heard in a free and open society.
As the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the trade union movement did not undermine the strength of the nation, but increased them.
By raising the standard of living of millions, unions miraculously created a market for industry and lifted an entire nation to an unimaginable level of production.
Those who attack unions forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History remembers how we should.
Formal recognition of labour rights as human rights – and greater protection of civil rights to prevent discrimination against trade union organisations – is long overdue.
Keith Allison and John Lewis are reviving ideals that have historically expanded America and made the promise of democracy a reality.
Judge Temporarily Blocks Law That Could Shut Down All Abortion Clinics in Louisiana
In the U.S., a federal judge on Sunday temporarily blocked the enactment of a Louisiana law that his supporters say it is likely to close all five abortion clinics in the state.
Under the measure, which was signed into law by Louisiana Gov. Bobby Ginadl in June and was set to take effect Sept. 1, doctors who perform abortions would be required to have the authority to see patients at a hospital within a 30-mile radius of their practice.
However, the judge's decision means that for now, doctors can continue to perform legal abortions while continuing to seek such authority.
"Plaintiffs will be permitted to work legally while continuing to obtain authority," Judge John deGravells wrote in his decision.
A hearing will be scheduled within a month, at which the judge will issue a more permanent ruling on the law.
Abortion rights advocates welcomed the decision, the latest in a string of decisions against similar measures, saying it would give doctors more time to obtain hospital credentials.
"Today's decision ensures that Louisiana women will be protected from an insidious law that seeks to deprive them of their health and rights," said Nancy Northup, president and head of the Center for Reproductive Rights, who filed a lawsuit to stop the law on behalf of three of the state's five clinics.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision applied to doctors from the two clinics who were not plaintiffs in the case and had also applied for admission authority.
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have passed similar laws, and courts recently declared such measures unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi.
Key parts of a Texas law that would have shut down most of the remaining clinics in that state were blocked by a federal judge Friday.
Abortion advocates, along with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, say admissions laws impose medical restrictions on doctors that are not medically necessary.
Opponents of abortion argue that such measures are aimed at protecting women's health, although some have also noted their positive effect in closing clinics.
Only one doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana has hospital admission authority, the Center for Reproductive Rights said.
If all the other doctors on staff were forced to stop performing the procedure, that doctor, fearing for his safety, would stop performing the procedure, the group said.
Criticizing the decision, Louisiana officials said they would not punish doctors who perform abortions while their applications for admission credentials await a decision.
What will the introduction of quotas for domestic products lead to?
At least half of the products for each type of product in the range of retail chains should be of Russian production, said Oleg Nilov, a State Duma deputy from the Fair Russia faction.
The parliamentarian has prepared a bill aimed at introducing protective measures against domestic producers, the Izvestia newspaper writes.
The document will still be detailed to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.
This applies to goods that are not produced in Russia. <...> For the remaining groups of products that are produced in Russia, the retailer will have to provide at least half of its shelves to domestic producers," Nilov told the publication.
Together with amendments to the article "On the Basics of State Regulation of Trade Activities in the Russian Federation", the bill provides for amendments to the Tax Code, establishing a reduced VAT rate of 10% when selling products produced in Russia.
The idea to introduce a 50% quota in retail chains is included in the package of incentive measures for Russian producers.
Several times more domestic goods will appear on the shelves.
However, the initiative can have both positive and negative effects, experts say.
According to the lawyer of the company "Tax", a member of the independent expert center "Public Duma" Sergey Litvinenko, for the Russian economy, as well as for the domestic agricultural and food industries, the effect will be positive, and will lead to growth.
In the black will be agricultural producers, farmers, small shops.
They will be able to sell more, which means that profits will grow.
In addition, they will have the right to dictate their terms and prices to retailers, because they will be forced to buy their goods.
Russian producers will be able to increase their activities and sales, which will lead to the payment of higher taxes than before.
This will increase budget revenues, create new jobs, some industries will begin to expand, some will be developed faster, and will contribute to GDP growth.
Russia's dependence on foreign food will decrease several times, although not immediately," the expert said.
Previously, Russian enterprises often could not break into the shelves of local stores due to high competition from foreign analogues.
Now, after the introduction of the embargo, this niche has been vacated and you can breathe a sigh of relief.
But do not forget that after all the necessary approvals and sanitary checks, food products from Latin America, Turkey and Serbia will enter the Russian market.
In other words, now is the "lull moment", when the old players have already left, and the new ones have not yet come.
After almost a month, we can talk about the increased demand for domestic raw materials, as well as an increase in prices for finished products," Tamara Kasyanova, First Vice-President of the All-Russian Public Organization "Russian Club of Financial Directors", Candidate of Economic Sciences, told AiF.ru.
Definitely, the idea of selling at least 50% of Russian food products in each category will allow the sector to be assigned to local producers.
In this case, they will compete with each other, and not with goods that, due to subsidies from another state, are cheaper.
In other words, the struggle for the buyer will unfold between companies operating according to the uniform laws of the industry.
On the other hand, Kasyanova notes, Russian manufacturers are able to meet 50% of the domestic needs of compatriots not in all respects.
And in this situation, retail chains will have to "reach" the share of Russian goods to half of the range.
In this regard, fears are growing that low-quality goods will arrive on the shelves.
Perhaps, under the guise of those produced in Russia, foreign products with broken labels will be supplied," the expert adds.
The negative effect of the introduction of quotas will be felt by large retail chains, especially those that are more profitable to cooperate with importers.
It is logical that in this situation, foreign suppliers themselves will suffer, since the demand for their products will decrease.
Litvinenko does not rule out that the law on quotas for domestic goods may affect consumers.
The fact is that some Russian-made products may be inferior in quality to imported analogues, while stores will be able to inflate the prices of the second, as a scarce product.
Economists again started talking about the idea of import substitution, forgotten in the early 2000s, in February of this year due to the incessant devaluation of the ruble.
Now, against the background of difficult relations with the West, the issue of abandoning imported products is becoming even more relevant.
The law is designed to oblige retailers to take into account domestic producers when forming orders.
Then we will go along the path of import substitution much faster and more confidently, and the production planning system for the necessary types of products will be created in a shorter time," says MP Oleg Nilov.
The quota mechanism will be particularly effective for those agricultural sectors where the potential is particularly high, for example, in the dairy sector, where the share of imports was 25%.
Our farmers are really able to completely cover the shelves of Russian stores.
In addition, meat production can also receive a powerful impetus.
As you know, the largest share of imports remains for beef - from 30% to 35%.
It turns out that 65-70% still falls on Russian products," Kasyanova argues.
Experts are of the opinion that the introduction of quotas for domestic products will contribute to import substitution and can accelerate this process.
However, in itself, this initiative will not lead to import substitution, since this requires a set of measures, Litvinenko is sure.
In any case, 50% of the goods sold under this initiative can still be brought from abroad, which means that full-fledged import substitution will not happen, but significant steps in this direction will be taken.
In addition, it is not enough to set quotas, it is also necessary to establish the production of domestic products in the country in order to fulfill these quotas.
These quotas will provide just such guarantees," the expert states.
Late diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment mean that ovarian cancer in rural areas kills more
Angelina Jolie and her brother James posted a video in memory of their late mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women who survive in rural Australia face a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than those living in urban areas.
Researchers analysed disease maps of more than 1100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005, finding that just 35 per cent lived five years after being diagnosed.
Lead researcher Susan Jordan of the QIMR Institute for Medical Research Berghofer reported that those living in regions and remote areas of the state are 20 percent more likely to die during the study than those living in urban areas.
SMALL STUDY: New Drugs May Slow Lung and Ovarian Cancer
The researchers traced the women's medical path over seven years.
Dr Jordan said the woman's age at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, the presence of current diseases and socioeconomic status also affected the likelihood of survival.
Older women and those with cancer were at a later stage at the time of diagnosis had the lowest survival rates.
Those who lived in regions or remote areas of the state were 20 percent more likely to die during the study than those who lived in urban areas.
Although the study was not designed to determine why women living outside cities are more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suggested that untimely diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment are possible factors.
"This disease is best treated by surgeons who specialize in gynecological oncology, and they are mostly in big cities," she said.
Despite improving the quality of telemedicine services to reduce the impact of distance, she suggested that increasing the number of on-site services that will allow specialists to treat women closer to home and support programs for people undergoing treatment far from their home could help.
Dr Jordan said that regardless of geographical location, the study found that long life expectancy among women with ovarian cancer was rare, highlighting the need for more effective treatment and prevention strategies.
The study, funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer cancer, will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, at the age of 33, a young mother from the Gold Coast, Elisha Niv, was told she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
In September, a new FAP will open its doors in Kuzhenersky district
The construction of a medical institution in the village of Toktaibelak was started in April this year and was carried out according to a standard project.
The cost of the work amounted to just over 10 million rubles.
According to the Department of Public Relations and Information of the Head of Mari El, the financing of the construction of the facility was carried out at the expense of the republican budget in accordance with the targeted investment program.
The total area of the constructed medical and prophylactic institution is almost 230 square meters.
It will provide medical assistance to residents of eight settlements: the village of Toktaibelyak and the villages of Dementyevo, Püncheryumal, Tunya, Fomichi, Toraybelyak, Shinur and Chachkayal.
The new paramedic and obstetric station will replace the existing FAP, the building of which was built in 1918 and has long exhausted its resource, and its premises do not meet sanitary and hygienic requirements.
The new institution will open soon.
The newborn who killed her four-month-old son in a drunken state will stand trial
A resident of Chuvashia will be in the dock for the murder of her own child.
In Cheboksary, the investigation of the criminal case against a 31-year-old resident of Novocheboksarsk, accused of causing death by negligence, has been completed.
The investigation established that on July 26 of this year, the accused, together with her four-month-old son, came to celebrate the birthday of her godfather's child in Cheboksary.
After a long feast, the novocheboksarka decided to stay away and put the child to bed.
When the baby woke up and cried at night, the drunken woman put him next to her on the bed to breastfeed, but soon fell asleep.
During sleep, the woman fell on her son, as a result of which he died of suffocation.
The criminal case, according to the press service of the Investigative Directorate of the ICR in Chuvashia, was sent to court.
Inflation is out of vacation.
Will Russians feel a sharp increase in prices?
As a result of cross-sanctions of the Russian Federation and the West, inflation in Russia will accelerate and will not meet the forecasts of the authorities, analysts of VTB Capital are convinced.
According to experts, the delayed consequences of anti-sanctions will lead to an inflationary shock in the first quarter of 2015, writes RBC Daily.
According to the latest forecast of the Ministry of Economic Development, in 2014 inflation will be 6.5-7.5%, next year and even less - 6.5%.
However, according to the newspaper Kommersant, this week the Ministry of Economic Development should make "small but fundamental" adjustments to the macroeconomic forecast until 2017.
According to the publication, the agency may lower the inflation estimate for 2015, which will eliminate the expected zeroing of income growth of the population.
The forecast assumed that the food sanctions of the Russian Federation are valid for a year - until August 2015.
How, in such a situation, could such high inflation be assumed?
The current situation suggests a one-time shock, but the downward trend of inflation will not change," the newspaper's source in the Ministry of Finance said.
Economists from VTB Capital do not share the expectations of the financial and economic bloc of the government regarding inflation and predict price growth in 2014 at the level of 8%.
The main effect of food bans will come along with the possible introduction of a sales tax (NSP) in the regions of the Russian Federation in 2015, experts are convinced.
The inflation peak of 9% will be in February, after which the annual growth rate of prices will decline, experts say.
By the way, last week Rosstat summed up the first inflationary results after the Russian Federation introduced "careful sanctions".
AiF.ru interviewed experts and found out their inflation expectations.
Artem Deev, Head of Analytical Department of AForex FC:
Price growth is already observed in the main segments of goods.
Moreover, when socially significant products began to rise in price, the government was forced to launch measures of systematic monitoring of price stability in order to prevent the risks of unjustified price increases in the short term.
Suppliers and retailers are already reporting on a daily basis to regulators so that the authorities know exactly who, when and for what reason is initiating the price increase.
The key factors in the growth of the consumer price index continue to be the colossal rates of capital outflow, excessive refinancing of the banking sector by the Russian mega-regulator, internal conversion due to the flight of the population into foreign currency, as well as the embargo on the import of food products from countries that have joined the sanctions against Russia.
If inflationary pressures had remained under control, the value of the basket of the minimum set of products would not have jumped by 12% in just one quarter.
The ban on the import of food products provoked a supply shock in the domestic market and led to a completely logical increase in the final cost.
Since at the current stage we are not able to fully launch the import substitution mechanism, as well as increase the self-sufficiency of the Russian market through domestic production, retaliatory sanctions will continue to bear the risks of an increase in the inflation component.
If we add to this the fiscal reasons associated with the lack of confidence in the national currency, as well as the deteriorated prospects for economic growth, by the end of this year inflation may well exceed 8%.
Alexander Razuvaev, Director of Alpari's Analytical Department
In the 90s, inflation sometimes reached 20-30% per month, in the zero it was also higher than the current level, another thing is that then it was compensated by rapid economic growth.
I think that by the end of the year inflation will be 8-8.5%.
Platon Maguta, Asset Manager, Maguta Fund Management Company
The external factor associated with sanctions against Russia has so far been successfully restrained, but if there is a further increase in pressure, primarily on the financial sector, this may lead to certain difficulties and increase inflation expectations of the population, which are usually traditionally manifested in purchases of cash currency in order to secure their savings.
It can be assumed that the government, the Central Bank of the Russian Federation and the Ministry of Finance will try to mitigate the smooth weakening of the ruble, both by market methods and state regulation.
But the rise in prices traditionally begins after the summer lull and, perhaps, this autumn will become more noticeable.
The target level of consumer inflation in Russia of 7.5% is likely to survive, since the Russian Federation still has financial savings.
Horticultural centers are saddened by the decline in the number of homeowners
Such a drop, driven by an exceptional reduction in the number of homeowners under the age of 35, could cause horticultural centres to start losing tens of millions of pounds a year as today's young consumers reach the "basic age of horticulture", according to an HTA study reported by the Financial Times.
According to this report, people renting a home spend an average of 55 percent of the amount that owners of their own homes spend on gardening.
It cites an increase in the number of people living in highly urbanised areas without gardens, the popularity of asphalting yards in front of a parking house and a shrinking garden as other factors posing a threat to the industry, which has an estimated £5 billion in annual sales.
Greater London, where the number of homeowners has fallen from 61 per cent to 43 per cent in six years, has the lowest level of spending on gardeners' goods per household in the UK.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society said renting and not having space for a garden didn't mean people couldn't grow plants.
Guy Barter, chief horticulture adviser at RHS, said: "Growing plants in containers, for example, is particularly popular with tenants who can transport plants with them when they move. "
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of retail horticultural goods as a result of increased homeowner numbers and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
It also predicts that the market will improve this year thanks to better weather after unfavorable conditions in March and April last year.
The Ministry of Agriculture of Bulgaria conducted a massive purge in the fund "Agriculture"
Three of the four chiefs of the Agriculture Foundation were replaced on Friday.
In total, three of the four chiefs of the Agriculture Foundation were replaced on Friday.
Officially, the Ministry of Agriculture of Bulgaria announced only the removal of Executive Director Atanas Dobrev from office.
His place was taken by Lozana Vasileva.
It turned out that on Friday, two of the three deputy executive directors of the fund were quietly replaced.
Deputy Executive Director Tatyana Angelova, who until that time was responsible for state aid and the SAPARD program, has been released, BGNES reports with reference to the newspaper "Trud".
I did not attend the fund's board of governors because we are not members of the management by law, but I was informed later that I had been released.
I can't say why my dismissal is not reported on the foundation's website.
I'm on vacation.
I hope that I will find out more on Monday," Angelova told the publication.
Her place will be taken by Ivanka Bagdatova, who until now was the head of "Investment Lending" in the central fund in "Agriculture" in Sofia.
Deputy Executive Director Nikolai Dachev was also released.
Up to this point, he was responsible for direct subsidies for fields paid by the EU.
In his place will be appointed Zhivko Zhivkov, who was the head of the regional directorate of the Fund "Agriculture" in the city of Veliko Tarnovo until January 2014.
Only the deputy head of the fund, Atice Aliyeva-Veli, retained her post.
It is currently responsible for the Rural Development Programme.
The official reasons for all the changes in the department are not mentioned.
Turkey summons U.S. diplomat over espionage report
Turkey's Foreign Ministry summoned the country's highest-ranking U.S. diplomat for clarification on a report on U.S. and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bülent said the U.S. chargé d'affaires and Turkish officials discussed the report on Monday.
German magazine Der Spiegel and online magazine The Intercept reported that documents provided by former U.S. National Security Agency analyst Edward Snowden show that Turkey has been a priority intelligence target for U.S. and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news outlets, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan downplayed the importance of the report, saying all the major countries were spying on each other.
Earlier reports that Germany's main intelligence agency had also made Ankara an intelligence target elicited a more angry response from the Turkish government.
The largest Chinese companies have united against Alibaba
Chinese companies, including China's largest commercial real estate developer Dalian Wanda Group and Internet giants Tencent Holdings (social networks, messenger, etc.) and Baidu (the largest Chinese search engine), are creating a company that will compete in the online trading market with Alibaba.
However, catching up with the miracle of the Chinese Internet, which left behind even its American rivals - eBay and Amazon.com, will not be easy.
Union of the Largest
The companies plan to invest 5 billion yuan ($ 814 million) in the joint venture, 70% of it will be owned by Wanda and 15% by each of the Internet companies, the Wanda Group said in a statement.
It is planned to register a company in Hong Kong.
The joint venture will combine Baidu's search services with the popular social platform WeChat (the largest social network in China, the number of users of which is about 438 million people), Tencent and Wanda infrastructure.
In addition to a network of 40 luxury hotels, the Wanda Group manages at least 49 commercial properties throughout China and 40 shopping centers.
Last year, the company invested 50 billion yuan (more than $8 billion) to build a film studio and theme park in Qingdao, a city in eastern China on the shores of the Yellow Sea.
The project is expected to attract more than 1 million visitors annually and generate a profit of $960 million.
In addition, Wanda owns the American cinema chain AMC Entertainment Holdings, which makes the company the largest cinema operator in the world.
By 2015, Wanda plans to equip all its shopping centers, hotels and entertainment venues with e-commerce services, the development of which will be engaged in the created competitor Alibaba.
According to Dong Ce, who will lead the new company, thanks to the merger, Wanda will be able to increase the number of users of its e-commerce services from the current 40 million people to 100 million by next year.
The new platform should become the world's largest online-to-offline platform, Dong Ce notes.
The essence of online-to-offline (O2O) commerce is to attract buyers on the Internet so that they come to ordinary offline stores or buy other traditional services.
A classic example of O2O is coupon services like Groupon or Vigoda.ru.
"O2O is the biggest 'pie' in online commerce," said Wanda ceo Wang Jianlin (quoted by Bloomberg).
"Now there is no real O2O site in China, and in this situation the chances are approximately equal for everyone," he said.
China's e-commerce market is the largest in the world, and McKinsey & Co. estimates that its volume will more than triple by 2015 compared to 2011, to $395 billion.
The number of Chinese Internet users has grown to 632 million, Bloomberg cites official statistics: this is more than the population of any country in the world, with the exception of India.
And according to forecasts, by 2015 this number could grow to 850 million people.
Union of the Richest
Tencent CEO Ma Huateng until recently was China's richest man, however, according to bloomberg's millionaire index, Alibaba founder Jack Ma has already overtaken him by $ 5.5 billion.
Jack Ma's fortune is estimated at $ 21.8 billion, of which $ 11 billion falls on his share in Alibaba.
Baidu CEO Robin Li now ranks third among China's richest people, while Wanda's Wang Jianlin is fourth in the rankings.
"This battle is very interesting to watch: the three richest people are joining forces to challenge the even richer," Cao Lei, director of the Chinese Center for E-Commerce Research in Hangzhou, told Bloomberg.
But he believes that the new company is unlikely to be able to seriously compete with Alibaba immediately after creation: "Rome cannot be built in one day."
The fact that it is not so easy to compete with Alibaba not only for new companies, but also for the honored leaders of world e-commerce, is evidenced by the report on the financial performance of Alibaba for the last quarter published yesterday.
Alibaba is often described as a cross between eBay and Amazon.com, but from April to June, the Chinese company earned more than both of its American competitors combined.
Alibaba's net profit for the period is almost twice as high as that of competitors - it grew almost three times year-on-year and amounted to $ 1.99 billion.
"Alibaba still has huge potential to generate money, thanks in large part to its mobile apps," an analyst at Hong Kong's Arete Research Service told Bloomberg.
According to the updated Alibaba prospectus on the website of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the number of active mobile users of the company's services in July amounted to 188 million, which significantly exceeds the March figure (163 million people).
At the same time, 32.8% of all Alibaba transactions over the past quarter accounted for mobile devices.
Alibaba will have to name the value of its shares before the IPO.
According to the average estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, the company could be valued at $187 billion after selling the shares.
According to Bloomberg sources, Alibaba's debut on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) may take place as early as September 16.
The company's road-show, preceding this event, starts on September 3.
It is expected that Alibaba's IPO will be a record in the history of the NYSE and will allow the company to raise about $ 20 billion.
Until now, the record for the volume of funds raised on US exchanges belonged to the Visa payment system, which in 2008 conducted an initial public offering of its shares, earning $ 17.9 billion.
At least half of the food products in retail chains should be of Russian production, according to State Duma deputies.
They have drafted a bill on the subject.
We are talking about amendments to Art. 8 of the Federal Law "On the Basics of State Regulation of Trade Activities in the Russian Federation" and to the Tax Code.
The purpose of the document is to introduce protective measures against Russian food producers.
An important clarification, according to the bill, at least 50 percent of domestically produced products in stores should be for each type of product.
However, the document will take into account that there are goods that are not produced in Russia, for example, vegetables and fruits in winter, so a "discount" will be made for them to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.
At the same time, the draft law amends the Tax Code of the Russian Federation, which establishes a reduced VAT rate of 10% for the sale of all food products whose country of origin is Russia, the Izvestia newspaper reports.
On August 27, a draft law on amendments to the Federal Law "On Retail Markets" was submitted to the lower house of parliament, which proposes to revive farmers' markets in Russia, where small producers will be able to sell their products.
Magaluf Police Chief Charged with Corruption
The plaintiffs presented evidence of extortion by police officers and officials of the municipality of Calvia to the office of the public prosecutor of Mallorca on Friday.
The chief of police of Calvia on the resort island of Mallorca was arrested as a result of allegations of corruption by businessmen and bar owners in the notorious center of unbridled drunkenness Magaluf.
Inspector General José Antonio Navarro was placed in custody as a result of corruption charges brought against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where most of Magaluf's bars and nightclubs are located.
According to the online daily Mallorca Diario, the plaintiffs presented evidence of extortion by police officers and officials of the municipality of Calvia to the office of the Mallorca prosecutor for the fight against corruption on Friday.
Two more local police officers have been arrested by Spanish National Guard guardsmen in connection with corruption allegations and will be questioned by a judge along with Navarro.
The Spanish daily ABC reported that disgruntled nightclub owners say that protectionism on the part of the authorities seriously affects the state of their business.
"It's no longer about making money, it's about surviving," one businessman told the court.
Our livelihoods must not be jeopardized.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made international headlines this summer after a popular YouTube video showing an 18-year-old British holidaymaker doing a pass to 24 men during a bar run.
The authorities of the island have since tried to stop hooliganism in a drunken state among the vacationers of Magaluf, minimizing the number of infamous alcohol runs in bars.
In addition, the Playhouse club where the incident occurred was forced to close for a year, while the Playhouse and carnage bar race organizers together were fined €55,000 ($73,000).
The tourist resort of Magaluf, mostly popular with young British holidaymakers, has also been the scene of numerous intoxication accidents associated with a crazy pastime known as "balconying", where people jump from one balcony to another or from a balcony to a hotel pool.
The first day of spring is marked by wet and windy conditions that affected flights at Adelaide Airport
SPRING has prepared a cold surprise in the south of South Australia, bringing torrential rains and strong winds that affected flights at Adelaide Airport.
Another 5 mm of rain fell on the city in the evening by 9 pm, following the 6.6 mm that fell during Sunday night.
The last rain was preceded by a couple of short showers with gusty winds, including a thunderstorm that began shortly before 8 pm and poured out almost 4 mm in about 10 minutes.
After winter produced an early dose of spring last week, temperatures fell again on Monday to a maximum of just 15.8C in the city.
Squally conditions are believed to have been one of the reasons for the delay in the landing of a Virgin Airlines flight from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was supposed to land on schedule just after 7:30 p.m., but was caught in a zone of wind shear — a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance — and was forced to gain altitude.
Wind gusts reached 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport at this time.
Flight data showed that the plane had to gain altitude during the second landing, and the plane eventually landed around 8:40 p.m.
The delay of this flight caused the subsequent delay of several other flights, including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Qantas flight from Sydney.
A high of 16C is forecast in Adelaide on Tuesday with a chance of one or two showers.
Calculation of the estimate of construction projects in the Russian Federation will take place in a new way
The Federal Antimonopoly Service takes special control over pricing, regulation of the construction industry, as well as problems of connecting to networks.
An expert council for the development of competition in the construction sector has been established under the FAS.
At its meeting, the head of the Department for Control of Housing and Communal Services, Construction and Natural Resources of the FAS Vadim Solovyov said that "today's calculation of the estimate of construction projects is absolutely incomprehensible."
The regulatory framework makes pricing opaque and can lead to an unreasonable construction price, according to the FAS.
And they propose to determine the cost of construction of state property facilities at the design stage on the basis of market prices of constructive solutions instead of the estimated norms and single prices for technological operations used today.
These proposals are included in the "road map" and are now under consideration in the Ministry of Construction.
"Replacing the traditional estimate documentation in construction with calculations of structural elements should lead to less corruption in the industry," Vadim Solovyov explained to RSL.
After all, now every bolt and nut is calculated in the estimate, and it is not always possible to check everything, so sometimes unscrupulous construction companies can bury "whole tractors" in the documentation.
The Ministry of Construction agrees with the FAS.
"The first developments on the transition to calculating the cost of structural elements already exist: methods have been developed for calculating prices for constructive solutions, drawing up estimates for these indicators," Elena Zhukova, head of the Department of Urban Planning and Architecture of the Ministry of Construction, told RSL.
The sphere of road construction was chosen as a pilot.
However, experts believe that the problem is much more serious.
As the head of the construction company Profi-Invest Anatoly Demyanko told RSL, the estimated standards have long been outdated, but no other mechanism has yet been offered to business.
"As for the proposed calculations for structural elements, in practice it is difficult to implement, since completely different technologies are often used in the construction of buildings," he said.
It is no secret that the construction market is developing largely due to the state order.
According to Ekaterina Lezina, Chairman of the Board of np "Expert Community of Public Procurement Professionals", today the state is the most solvent customer.
Vladimir Malakhov, Deputy Director for Engineering of the Industry Center for Capital Construction of Rosatom, drew attention to the fact that today the market is conditionally divided into companies that have access to a portfolio of contracts, and companies that own monopoly competencies and do not allow competitors in this field.
He believes that the creation of a transparent market is possible only if access to contracts is protected as much as possible from someone's controlling influence.
At the expert council, it was proposed to form a system of state order in such a way that the same executor is not entitled to receive more than one contract worth more than 1 billion rubles. or several contracts worth more than 1 billion rubles.
The Ministry of Construction believes that this approach should be assessed in terms of the impact on business, as well as the effectiveness of construction management.
As Elena Zhukova explained, in this case it will be necessary to endow the customer with the functions of a general contractor, which will lead to an increase in the staff of the customer and budget costs for its maintenance.
At the same time, the customer's specialists will have to have knowledge that allows them to assess the quality of the work performed by contractors, as well as their safety.
Often, with such a breakdown, it will be necessary to determine who will be responsible for the safety of the object as a whole.
In addition, this approach may entail an outflow of highly qualified public procurement participants due to disinterest in obtaining a state order for an incomplete amount of work and a small contract amount.
Alexander Evstashenkov, deputy head of the expert and consulting center of the Procurement Institute, believes that now the state order procedure has turned into a business game for the attention of the contractor.
And he gave the following example: "the participant, when filling out the application, must indicate "specific indicators" without specifying the words: "or equivalent", "should be", "from", "more", "less", "analogue", "or", "type", "similar type", "not lower", "below", "above", "may", "may have", "maybe", "earlier", "not earlier", "not higher", "not allowed", etc.
Thus, customers often abuse their right to set requirements for the content of the application submitted by contractors.
Another problem of 44-FZ, according to Evstashenkov, was the need to assess the quality of work through the "paper" proposal of the participant at the stage of submitting an application.
Considering the application of the participant, it is possible to assess only the qualifications of the contractor, but not the quality of the work, the implementation of which has not even begun yet, the expert believes.
The quality of work can be assessed only when they are accepted.
The expert council also proposed to transfer marginal income from the upper to the lower echelon so that intermediate contractors disappear.
Chairman of the Expert Council, State Secretary, Deputy Head of the FAS Andrei Tsarikovsky believes that this should not be done, since the general contractor should be responsible for the order.
Otherwise, it will turn out, as in the famous reprise of Arkady Raikin "Atelier": "Are there any complaints about the buttons?".
Israeli children return to school after gaza war
Thousands of Israeli children in areas near the Gaza Strip went back to school on Monday after spending the summer in bomb shelters as rockets and mines rained down on their settlements during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, while schools in the Gaza Strip remained closed as the territory recovered from the fighting.
The start of school brought a sense of joy and excitement to the rocket-affected settlements in southern Israel, but the fighting remained fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, employees of the Pashosh kindergarten, which was hit by a rocket, removed traces of shrapnel from walls and children's slides before the arrival of students.
"We are a little afraid, but we look to the future with joy," said Ronit Barth, a resident of Kibbutz Saad and an English teacher at his school.
Many children in our area really need to return to a measured life.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said it was "a little weird" to start going back to school.
"It was a difficult time and we didn't leave our homes at all," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the kibbutz, which is located near the gaza border, to express his support.
Before a ceasefire stopped the war last week, thousands of residents of border settlements such as Saad did not take to the streets or fled their homes, moving to safer areas further from the Gaza Strip to escape rocket and mortar fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a settlement near the Gaza border where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a fragment of a Palestinian mine, doubt that they should go back.
The Ministry of Education said about a dozen families still had not returned.
Their children were sent to other schools for this time.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a city on the gaza border that has been hard hit by Palestinian fire.
He advised the children to study diligently and said, "We will do everything we can to give you knowledge and keep you safe."
Israel and Hamas agreed to an indefinite truce last Tuesday.
The ceasefire immediately ended the fighting, but key issues remained unresolved, such as Hamas's demand for an end to the Egyptian-Israeli blockade of Gaza and the opening of airports and seaports in the Gaza Strip.
Israel wants Hamas to lay down its arms and recover the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the war.
A new phase of proximity talks is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
More than 2100 Palestinians were killed in the war, among whom three-quarters were civilians, and at least 494 children, according to estimates by the Palestinian side and the UN.
Israel disputes these figures and claims that at least half of those killed were militants; despite this, it has not provided substantial evidence to substantiate this allegation.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including one Thai worker, were killed.
During the fighting, Hamas and other Gaza militants fired 4591 rockets and mortars at Israeli cities, mainly in the south of the country.
The Israeli army, meanwhile, has carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
Israeli attacks have damaged and destroyed thousands of homes in the Gaza Strip, and an estimated 250,000 people have taken refuge in more than 100 schools, which have been converted into shelters.
With tens of thousands of people still in shelters and fighting continuing, education officials delayed the start of the school year last week.
"I hope the school will open soon so that we can complete our education as children of the world and Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who now lives in a Gaza school.
According to a popular criterion, real estate prices showed the largest winter increase in seven years.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic housing price index for house prices in the Australian capital rose 1.1 percent in August, RP data reported on Monday.
This increase led to a cumulative increase for June, July and August of 4.2 percent, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
Annual price growth was 10.9 percent, more than double the increase in the 12 months to August 2013, but the increase was not evenly distributed across the country.
RP Data research director Tim Lawless said Sydney and Melbourne are leading a two-tier market.
Figures from RP Data show that sydney house prices rose 16.1 per cent over the past year, while Melbourne has risen 11.7 per cent.
The next most powerful markets were Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices rose by an average of five to six percent.
At the other end of the scale was Canberra, which saw government spending cuts, where prices rose just 1.4 percent in a year.
Mr Lawless said that now that spring has begun, there will be an increase in the number of properties for sale over the next few months, which will be a "real test" for the market.
"Given the current high rate of auction sales, the overall high rate of sales and the current low-interest rate conditions, it is likely that the cost of housing will rise further over the next three months," he said.
How people live in the oldest house in Ufa
In the former house of gold miners and miners Evdokim and his son Ivan Demidov on October Revolution Street 57/1 (former Bolshaya Kazanskaya) there are 18 apartments.
The house of the XVIII century since the time of construction has not changed much, except for dilapidation.
Strangers go here as if on an excursion, and the tenants suffer more than they rejoice from their privilege - the right to live in the oldest Ufa house, the walls of which remember the commander Alexander Suvorov.
The date of construction of the house is inaccurate, historians point to two dates - 1730 and 1737.
But in any case, it turns out that the building is almost 300 years old.
Old courtyard, always open door, creaky staircase.
The doors to the apartments are located close to each other, the walls are cracked, and the street is visible in the gaps from the peeling plaster in places.
Everything seems to be based on an honest word.
And the locals assure: "You don't think it is."
Living in a wooden house of the XVIII century is very difficult, - says Tatyana Lukyanova, a resident of apartment No. 3.
The object is under state protection, but money for its maintenance has not been allocated for decades, and we feel like museum exhibits, which the authorities simply forgot.
The last renovation was 40 years ago.
The walls are still barely holding, but the foundation is all rotten.
Many residents still go to the toilet outside, and wash once a week in a public bath.
How can you be satisfied in such conditions?!
The road passes right under the windows, there is not even a pedestrian zone.
Tatiana pulls back the curtain.
Now you can see what was previously only audible: a stream of cars rushes under the windows.
You see, the glass rattles constantly, we cannot open the windows, but we are used to noise.
A person gets used to everything, to good and bad.
Our apartment is still exemplary, thanks to my husband, his hands are golden.
Moreover, we have two rooms, we live in three with our son.
And for other families, the conditions are much worse, on the second floor in general the ceilings are a little more than one and a half meters high.
For contrast, Tatiana suggests visiting a neighbor from apartment No. 6 Lyudmila Starostina.
A pleasant hospitable woman from the threshold offers a cup of coffee and with a sad smile says:
We have a one-room apartment, 14.5 m² for four people, and we live like this: my husband and I and my daughter and granddaughter.
I have been here since birth, there has never been another living space - Lyudmila looks around the room: mezzanine, two sofas with the letter "g"; one of them housed a granddaughter with a laptop.
Very cramped and not much different from the usual domestic interior: only the ceilings are beautiful, "historical".
But it regularly flows from the ceiling: the plumbing system is no good.
Lyudmila speaks about her apartment in an ordinary and surprising way at the same time, like an Italian woman whose house stands on Roman ruins.
That is, it brings into one very old and recent, everyday and legendary:
The water pipeline was carried out about 40 years ago during the last repair.
At the same time, they made us a small kitchen in the corner and a toilet from the former closet.
We live exactly where Demidov and his family lived, and servants lived on the second floor.
Our apartment is not privatized, and why?
The Ufa Real Estate Center says privatization does not matter.
Anyway, we will get only a one-room apartment, we can not claim more.
Four months ago, they promised to resettle us, but it did not go further than promises.
I'm not used to complaining and I won't.
A whole dynasty lived in this apartment (room!): my grandparents, my mother and father, me and my husband and my daughter and granddaughter.
Stuff happened during that time.
For example, hefty rats ran around the kitchen.
Look at the walls of the wing, they are a meter thick!
They say the solution was mixed into the eggs, which is why it lasts so long.
The house is built thoroughly, thanks to the Demidovs!
Probably, that's the only reason so far no one has been killed by a collapsed ceiling or pile.
Only the building is still slowly dying before our eyes: the boards and logs of the house rot, the floors have repeatedly failed, we poured cement, but everything is useless - the solution goes into the ground, as in a well.
They say so - under our room there is a secret manhole and a passage to the Belaya River, which was specially made by the Old Believers who once lived here, so that they could hide from danger, in case of anything.
They were persecuted.
Lyudmila Starostina tells how some historian came to them, begged them to let him begin excavations in the apartment.
And then he persuaded them to give them housing in exchange for his one on October Avenue.
Lyudmila refused the historian:
Where do the four of us go?
And here at least there is a tiny hope that they will give housing more spacious.
Had we agreed to the exchange, we would not have won anything.
However, the Starostin family did not win anything.
Lyudmila's biggest dream is to be resettled, and her daughter and her 16-year-old granddaughter were given a separate room.
That is, two families were allocated a two-room apartment instead of not the most majestic ruins, in which two generations live now.
A pretty, petite girl Olesya Karsakova from apartments No. 11 and 12 shows the second floor of the house.
There, in two cramped rooms with a total area of 23 m², called apartments, her large family lives.
There are seven of us in total, two children.
You can see for yourself what the conditions are.
Plaster falls off in pieces, like window frames, there are through holes in the walls in the kitchen and in the rooms.
The water in the tap all year round is only cold.
Walking through the apartments of the oldest house in Ufa, you can make sure that the Lavrentyev spouses from apartment No. 4 were the luckiest.
They occupy the most spacious rooms of the first floor.
You're right, there's a lot of space!
A room of 75 squares, three people are registered.
We live just in those rooms where, according to legend, Suvorov stayed during his stay in Ufa, - says the head of the family Alexander Dmitrievich Lavrentyev.
The ceilings are high and spacious.
One thing is bad - everything around is bursting at the seams, falling apart, collapsing.
Neighbors have probably already told!
Most of the torment we have with the floors: the wooden boards rotted, the ground literally went from under our feet.
I put up supports, wedges; there is still nothing in the hall, and in another room we walk like swinging on a swing, everything is so shaky.
Alexander Dmitrievich can tell about the house of the merchant Evdokim Demidov better than any guide.
He treats the gold miner as if he were his own, speaks of him with admiration.
Indeed, the personality was outstanding: the owner of the Kagin and Uzyansk factories built houses, cast cannons and bells, and held the Ural mines.
The heirs of merchant real estate are proud of their ancestor, but they no longer want to live under the same roof with history.
I settled here as a child, in the 40s of the XX century, - says Alexander Dmitrievich.
Then around there were wooden rooms for carriages, stables and guard booths, subsequently demolished.
In 1968, they wanted to clean our house, but something prevented us from...
History repeated itself in 2014: they again beckoned with new housing.
We, as if on cue, collected all the documents, ran around the necessary authorities, and suddenly learned that the move to the apartments was postponed to 2015 or 2016.
Something we no longer believe in all this...
Two years ago, Lavrentyev went to the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Bashkortostan to find out about the fate of the house.
Officials did not accept the tenant.
They sent it from one table to another, and then, as if in mockery, they issued a piece of paper without a signature and seal: "The Ministry of Culture does not object to the resettlement of tenants."
I even have a feeling that our house has long been gone from the city plan, because at first it was at number 57, then it became 57 A, and now it is 57/1.
It's like it's already been demolished in the '70s.
"Russian Planet" appealed to the head of the sector of information and analytical work of the Department for Land Resources of Ufa Vladimir Barabash.
The house on Oktyabrskaya Revolyutsii Street 57/1 is included in the program of resettlement of dilapidated housing.
I cannot be responsible for the actions of officials of the 70s, I only know that at that time there was a plan to demolish all old houses, despite the historical significance.
Fortunately, this did not happen, and the decision of the modern authorities to restore all the old houses along the October Revolution Street, which are of architectural value, is being successfully implemented.
Residents are soon planned to be resettled in new apartments.
According to Barabash, italian specialists who participated in the restoration of buildings in Venice will restore the Demidov House.
Now an architectural biennale is taking place in Italy, and the project "Old Ufa" is presented there among others.
I hope that by 2016 the entire former Old KazanSkaya Street will be restored," the official said.
The houses will acquire a proper look, corresponding to the one that was before, three centuries ago.
Demidov's house is likely to become a museum open to all comers.
In addition, at the government level, it was decided to make the street pedestrian on weekends.
On weekdays, unfortunately, it will not work, too much congestion of roads in the city.
Vladimir Barabash promises to resettle people from the future museum in 2015.
However, it is unlikely that they will be satisfied: their new apartments will be the same area as the current ones.
Only from a different era.
In Primorye, because of a thunderstorm, a forest fire began
A dry thunderstorm caused a forest fire on the territory of the Hunting District Forestry in the Pozharsky District of the Primorsky Territory.
At the site of the fire, a grouping of forces and means is being built up.
According to the management of the Primorsky Air Base, the conditions created at the scene of the fire require the involvement of aviation forces.
Vasily Medvedev, Deputy Head of the Air Base:
The fire, which arose in a hard-to-reach area, was detected by an observer pilot from the An-2 patrol aircraft on an area of 3 hectares.
Wood residues on the old burner are burning.
The strong clutter of the territory and the steepness of the slope of more than 45 degrees, the lack of firefighters suitable for landing paratroopers create significant difficulties in extinguishing.
A Mi-8 helicopter is needed.
The delivery of forces by the Mi-2 helicopter and the An-2 aircraft at the disposal of the air base is very difficult.
After the fire was discovered, 4 parachutists-firefighters were quickly landed at the extinguishing site.
The main task of specialists is to extinguish the fire and prepare the site for the delivery of additional forces and means of firefighting.
In the area of lunch, 3 additional paratroopers-firefighters were delivered by helicopter to the area of the village of Okhotnichy.
As soon as the landing site for the helicopter in the area of the fire is ready, specialists will be transferred to the place of extinguishing, according to the website of the administration of the Primorsky Territory.
Lenny Henry: My father never hugged me.
I never said, "I love you."
Henry was one of seven children born to a family of immigrants from Jamaica to Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and their relationship was limited.
Henry rehearses a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is based in part on imaginary conversations with his father and grew out of a series of radio 4 shows.
The soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap, and the melodies are cheerful.
However, Henry had to wade through some difficult childhood memories.
After his mother's death, there was "a lot" of treatment, and Henry often reflects on his relationship with his father.
He was very unavailable.
You've never seen his face, you've only heard his voice, "Stop making noise.
Get behind your sister.
Move!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton, who were adults when I was a kid, would go to the pub with him and talk about things like the shape of a beer glass, the beauty of a cricket strike.
I've never talked to him like that.
He was such an unsmiling guy in the corner who read the newspaper for most of my life.
Henry had recently opened a foundry in Dudley and although conditions were better than in his father's days, he was able to get a glimpse of what his life must have been like.
Now there is a little better, but these are dark, smoky, depths of the labyrinths of the underworld with flashes of fire and smoke and a bunch of soot.
My dad would climb into the tub and just lie there and you could hear him slowly starting to sing to himself because he wanted to wash himself off the foundry.
When I got there, I realized that he had been doing it for years and years to earn us a living, and I began to appreciate him more.
However, Henry came out of childhood deprived of parental love.
My father never hugged, never said, "I love you."
It wasn't until Mom became ill at the very end of her life that we started saying, "I love you, I love you, I love you.
The birth of his own daughter, Billy, by Don French allowed him to share the love he lacked as a child.
Can you stop this "I love you"?
Just stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Don French.
Why don't I be friends with her?
She's a great mom.
They're still great friends with French, to whom he's been married for 25 years.
Don is a good man.
Why don't I be friends with Don?
She's a great mom.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
He was one of the things that killed her.
So when I got really, really well and got symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You need to take drastic measures.
Then I started serious phytonosis classes, and I also had to go on a strict diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's boring.
No one eats carrots.
Henry's change in career trajectory is reflected, perhaps, in his noble, short-cropped beard.
Ever since he received critical acclaim for his Othello, he has completely immersed himself in the theater.
This was followed by "Comedy of Errors" and then "Fences" by August Wilson.
This work is different from sitcoms and comedies, which were an integral attribute of his rich professional life.
He started his career when he was 16 and worked in a factory.
The DJ noticed him parody on stage and wrote about him in New Faces.
His career in television began in the mid-seventies: "For quite a long time I was the only black parodist/comedian on television."
He studied at work.
Not only did I have to grow up in front of the public, I had to learn how to be an efficient joke delivery machine between 1975 and 1985, being a star working in television, and it was very hard.
Lenny in New Faces in 1975
Since his manager had the rights to The Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program in which people "blackened their faces," Henry found himself performing in it for five years.
My family didn't like it very much.
I kind of wish that had never happened to me, but I don't regret doing it.
Although it was a strange, reprehensible position, I worked in large venues and learned to work with the crowd.
But what was "an award-winning light entertainment classic on British television for years and years" was also a "grotesque parody of black people."
Introducing characters who both mocked and celebrated black culture in Britain, Henry worked on an alternative comedy project in the eighties.
The first season of "The Lenny Henry Show" aired in 1984, and in the nineties he was known as, among other things, chef Gareth Blacklock from the comedy series "The Chef!".
Commercials, documentaries, television series and film roles took the next ten years of his life, but after his 2008 BBC series "LennyHenry.tv," he thought, "What are you going to do next, Len, because it seems a little bit like you're dragging your feet or slowly turning away."
Then there was a series of documentaries on Radio 4 called "What's Good about...?"
The first was about Shakespeare.
I was really allergic to Shakespeare.
Not to say I was really taught this in school, and I thought it was, in many ways, the prerogative of middle-class white people with tights and cabbage at the bottom of the front.
So I was very afraid of him.
Everyone we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench, said, "You have to give it a try.
Don't scold it until you know what you're talking about.
Say some of these words out loud and you will understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry read 20 lines from Othello's last monologue for the documentary, and he was hooked.
I got a sense that I could do it.
It was as if my head had been straightened.
"That's what it is, it's a serious matter, take it seriously, learn your text, do a little research.
So, the rehearsal process was tough, and I read this play months and months before we staged it.
And it was a success.
It seemed that they were waiting for a catastrophe, but it did not happen.
Soon we started The Comedy of Errors.
Suddenly, I'm at the National Theater, and I just couldn't believe it until the end.
There was one moment when I thought, 'Oh, you've changed.'"
A technical problem arose, and Henry instinctively felt that his job was to entertain the public.
"A quiet voice inside me said, 'You're going to have to work for 10 minutes while they fix the computer.'"
Instead, the assistant director announced that the show would resume once the problem was resolved.
I walked off the stage and something in me said, "Oh, thank God."
It's not my responsibility.
I can let someone else sort it out.
"You play in the play, stay in the role.""
Henry in Fences at the Dachess Theatre
It was difficult to learn the text for "Fences".
Panic is quite useful, it strengthens the muscles.
She was also well received, so it was like a sign from above, showing: 'This is what you need to do.'"
He says this, of course, in a THUNDEROUS voice.
So I'm holding on to that.
I really love it.
I love being in the rehearsal room.
By the way, Henry still has the mindset of a comedian - all the way our conversation is interrupted by flashes of his humor, when he either begins or finishes parodying.
I just decided not to work in stand-up because this thing of getting an instant reward from a full room of strangers, I think, is pretty dangerous.
If you strive for this all the time, it can lead to a dead end.
I sometimes work at Live in Apollo whenever I want to, but mostly I don't get as much fun as I used to.
I'm asking if he'll ever give a stand-up tour.
The joy of sitting indoors with a director who helps shape the beginning, middle and end of the journey – I don't think I'll ever want to give it up.
So this is his new incarnation?
I think so.
I love being an actor.
It's nice fun.
You're always telling a story, and here's a great place to do that.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers civil servants to identify 'invisible workers'
Kenya has begun biometric registration of all government employees in an attempt to remove "invisible workers" from the government's payroll.
Employees who do not register within the next two weeks will no longer be paid, according to a government statement.
The government suspects that thousands of people continue to receive salaries after leaving the civil service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta has vowed to reduce corruption in state structures after coming to power in 2013.
An audit earlier this year found that at least $1m (£700,000) a month was lost through payments to "invisible workers" and other financial irregularities.
The government suspects salaries continue to flow into bank accounts even after a person dies or leaves public service, according to BBC reporter Wanyama Chebusiri from the capital, Nairobi.
All civil servants must report within the next two weeks to identification centers to ensure that their data is collected through a biometric registration procedure, according to a government statement.
Anyone who fails to do so without a good reason will be struck off the payroll, it said.
"This procedure will contribute significantly to the rationalization of the civil service by determining the actual number of civil servants, and will also be used to clean up the payroll at both levels of government – hence putting an end to the problem of 'invisible workers'," said Ann Vaiguru, cabinet secretary for planning and structuring power.
Dozens of Turkish police arrested in connection with 'conspiracy' against government
A total of 33 police officers were detained in Turkey on suspicion of "conspiracy against the government," local news agencies reported.
Police officials did not immediately comment on this information.
Among those detained were 14 high-ranking officers, according to Hürriet Daily News.
Some of them last December participated in an effort to expose corruption, which was aimed at vetting government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested on suspicion of forming an organized crime group and tapping a phone.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was prime minister at the time) defined their actions as part of measures taken against him and others in power by Islamic cleric Fethullah Gulen.
Not all children returned to school in Ukraine
Schools in much of Ukraine reopened their doors on Monday (September 1) after the summer holidays.
The day is traditionally a big event for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk took his daughter to school.
There, he told waiting journalists that not all schools had reopened, but that he would do everything he could to protect the country for future generations:
On the first of September, the ceremony was not held in every school.
There is no peaceful sky over every part of Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful sky.
The whole of Ukraine, a huge united Ukrainian popular front, must fight for a peaceful sky.
Aleksan Pastukhov, the principal of the school in Sloviansk where Yatsenyuk's daughter went, spoke Russian.
We hope that peace will finally be established here and that children will receive knowledge that will be useful in their future lives.
The first day of school is traditionally celebrated by the fact that children put on embroidered shirts, hold balloons in their hands and give flowers to their teachers.
In Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the kind of imposing leader she needs.
Behind her is a trail of fame from the worlds of banking, media management, and the inner circles of the Tory party.
In fact, she has her own experience in leadership positions.
Her career began at global management consultancy firm Bain and Co and then continued at Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and in the media world at Pearsons.
She was the head of the Financial Times for seven years, retiring when a male colleague in a lower position took a high position at Pearson's parent company.
Her earnings are said to be approaching £1 million.
Her political rating is also strong.
She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Browne, the former head of BP, when he tried to bring private sector professionals to Whitehall: she became a cabinet adviser.
Her husband is a former Tory adviser.
Earlier in May, I called the chairman's work a poisoned cup.
The BBC is not only a huge and complex organization at the heart of public life, but there is an internal paradox in its structure.
The Council has two strands: inward as the top level of the BBC's management hierarchy itself, but also outward as a voice of public concern and excitement when something goes wrong.
This is an almost unattainable duopoly that needs complete radical reform.
However, what new chairman would risk coming trampling and destroying an institution as complex as a Chinese dynasty if he himself was to lose his job in the process.
It's a tough decision.
It wouldn't be that difficult, many people will be happy to see the BBC shrink in size – following a review of its powers, finances and status.
As competitors narrow the circle and new technologies challenge cozy old habits, the inevitable negotiations over the cost of the licence pose a particular danger to the BBC.
For the modest sum of £145.50 a year, Britons acquire a stake in what is definitely the greatest media venture in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: it claims that the results of its work cover 96 percent of households and cost each of them only 40p a day.
What's more, it's clear that Beeb's popularity is growing, with 53 percent supporting it today versus 31 percent 10 years ago.
The BBC's browsing and usage patterns have changed: now I get news headlines on my mobile phone and watch skipped programs on iPlayer.
But it remains a very popular and impressive institution.
He needs an impressive chairman - I hope he found him.
Perry of Texas says the humiliating tweet was written by someone else.
A tweet from Texas Gov. Rick Perry's confirmed account Sunday night contained an offensive image of a Democratic district attorney who is at the center of a criminal prosecution for abuse of power.
The tweet was later deleted, followed by another one from Perry's account, in which the post was disavowed.
A tweet was just posted from my account that was written by someone else.
"I don't approve of this tweet and I removed it," a later entry said.
Perry's aides did not immediately respond to messages asking for comment.
Although the recordings were uploaded from Perry's verified account, it was unclear who was actually involved in posting to this feed.
An earlier tweet contained an unflattering caricature of County Prosecutor Travis Rosemary Lemberg, who was found guilty of driving while intoxicated in April 2013.
Perry imposed a funding ban on her agency when she refused to resign, leading to a grand jury trial in Austin this month against Perry, who is a potential presidential candidate in the 2016 election.
The caption in the tweet reads: "I don't always drive a car while intoxicated, 3 times the allowable level of alcohol in my blood,.. but when I do, I indict Governor Perry for telling me about it."
I'm the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
Lemberg's office did not conduct a grand jury investigation against Perry.
It was handled by Michael McCrum, a special counsel from San Antonio who was appointed a Republican judge.
Perry pleaded not guilty and called the charges a political ploy.
His powerful legal team asked the judge in charge of the case to dismiss the indictment, saying the law that has been used to prosecute the longest-serving governor in Texas history is vague, unconstitutionally.
Perry stopped $7.5 million in funding from the state's Division of Public Oversight, which is based in Travis County and prosecutes corruption in the Texas public sector, when Lemberg refused to resign.
The veto sparked a formal complaint from a left-wing public watchdog group.
Perry's verified account feed is updated frequently – and sometimes becomes famous.
Coming fifth at the party convention in Iowa during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry responded to rumors that he might quit the game by posting a tweet with a photo of himself running near the lake and saying, "Here we are, South Carolina!"
Berkeley reports that the real estate market has returned to "normalcy"
One of London's best-known property developers has warned that the property market in south-east England has "returned" to normal levels of activity.
Homes in the capital have been the subject of buoyant demand and skyrocketing prices, with widespread fears that the credit bubble will push the Bank of England to impose limits on mortgage loans in June.
Tony Pidgeley, founder and chairman of elite construction company Berkeley, said on Monday: "Since the start of the current fiscal year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since the peak of 2013," adding that this has ensured a "stable working environment".
London's property market did well during the downturn as foreign buyers flocked to the capital.
Prices in the city jumped 18.5 per cent in the past year alone, according to the Land Registry, significantly overtaking the 6.7 per cent average for England and Wales as a whole.
Average market prices on Berkeley's private, affordable and student schemes rose by about one-fifth last year, reaching £423,000 at the end of April.
However, the strengthening of the pound in recent months has made London real estate less attractive to foreign buyers, some of whom were also stopped by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhetoric around a potential "tax on mansions" ahead of the general election next May.
London-based real estate agency Foxtons warned last week that April's mortgage market reform, which introduced tighter loan conditions, would also lead to lower market growth in both real estate purchase and sale transactions and prices in the second half of the year.
Fresh data from the Bank of England on Monday showed a drop in the number of approved mortgage loans in June, suggesting further cooling in the housing market.
Hamptons International, another real estate agency, cut its forecast for London property price growth for 2015 to 3 percent on the grounds that the mood for property prices has already begun to weaken.
Transaction volumes, meanwhile, fell by a quarter from a year earlier in London's most expensive areas such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, according to WA Ellis.
However, demand for homes in the capital has proven to be very beneficial for Berkeley, raising sales volumes above £2.2 billion.
Mr. Pidgely added: "The demand for the right product with good design and the best location has remained the same and, reflecting this, sales have been preserved for the term."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3742 new homes this year through the end of April — nearly a third more than at its pre-crisis peak in 2007.
Annual profit before taxes rose 40 percent from the previous year to £380 million, revenue - by 18 percent to £ 1.6 billion.
Speaking Monday ahead of the company's annual meeting, Mr. Pidgely said Berkeley's estimated revenues for the year would be in line with current market expectations.
According to the unanimous opinion of analysts, a profit for the full year before taxes of £ 450 million is expected.
Berkeley's share price was held at £23.96 in the afternoon on the London Stock Exchange.
Photos of naked Jennifer Lawrence published on the Internet by a hacker
Jennifer Lawrence arrives at the 85th Academy Awards.
Photos of nude actress Jennifer Lawrence, who received an Academy Award, were posted on the Internet by a hacker who claims to have a "catalog" of photos of another 100 rising stars.
A spokesperson for the Hunger Games star confirmed that Lawrence's photos are real and condemned the hacker for "brazenly invading personal space."
Law enforcement has been contacted, and they will prosecute anyone who publishes the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos, which were originally posted on photo-sharing site 4chan, were allegedly obtained thanks to a lack of Apple's iCloud online storage system, and the alleged "directory" of hack victims includes the names of dozens of female celebrities, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, according to BuzzFeed.
It's unclear how many of these photos are genuine, though Scott Pilgrim vs. Everyone star Winstead on Twitter also condemned the hack.
"To those who look at the photos my husband and I took a few years ago, secluded at home, I hope you are proud of yourself," Winstead tweeted.
However, Victoria Justice of Nickolodeon's "iCarly" and "Victorious Victoria" denied that in the photos she wrote on Twitter: "These so-called nude photos of me fake, people.
Let me nip that in the bud. *pun intended*.
Buzzfeed reported last Sunday that a spokesperson for pop star Ariana Grande denied that the photos she was allegedly in were genuine.
An exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobson's new novel about love and the letter "J", which caused praise from critics
They dissolved, best of all, they gradually fell apart, like a cardboard box that was left in the rain.
Only occasionally would a woman tell him that he was too serious, too heavy to communicate, tense, closed, and maybe a little irritable.
And then she shook his hand.
He saw himself as irritable.
He was prickly as a hedgehog, yes.
The last victim of this prickliness was a little novel from which he expected more than usual, to get rid of a lonely and boring life and perhaps even some satisfaction.
Eylynn Solomons was a tremblingly fragile beauty with ruffled hair and a fluttering heart from a northern island village, even more remote and harsh than Port Reuben.
She came to the south with a companion older than herself, whom Kevern considered her aunt, while the latter inherited a house in a damp but paradise-like valley under the joyful name "Paradise Valley".
No one lived in the house for several years.
Pipes flowed, spiders sat motionless in the baths, slugs left their marks on all the windows, confident that the house belonged to them; the garden is overgrown with weeds, similar to giant cabbage heads.
It was like a cottage from a children's book, both frightening and enchanting, with a garden full of secrets.
Author's view: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is longlisted for the Booker Prize in 2014.
Shortlist to be announced next week
Kevern and Eylinn sat holding hands in broken chaise lounges among the tall grass, enjoying an unexpectedly warm spring day; they both absentmindedly connected to a cheap console that supplied the country with soothing music and soothing news when, looking at her crossed brown legs, he remembered an old song by a long-forgotten black singer that his father loved to listen to as he lowered the curtains in the house.
Your legs are too big.
Due to their inherent aggressiveness, songs of this type were no longer played on the console.
They weren't banned - nothing was actually forbidden - it's just that they weren't lost again.
They were helped to become archaic, like the word "archaic".
Public taste did things that could never be achieved by orders and prescriptions, and just as among the books people chose memoirs of the rich who grew up in poverty, cookbooks and romance novels, from all music they chose ballads.
Carried away by this day, Kevern began to play an imaginary piano and in a rough comic voice sing the big legs of Eylinn.
Eylynn didn't understand.
"It was a popular song by a jazz pianist named Fats Waller," he told her, mechanically placing two fingers to his lips.
This is what his father always did to stop the letter "J" before it flew off his lips.
It started with a game they played when he was little.
His father played it with his father, as he told him.
Start the word with a "J", forgetting to put two fingers to your mouth and it will cost you a penny.
It wasn't a very fun game then, and it wasn't much fun now.
He knew he was expected to do that, that's all.
He had to explain what jazz was.
Eylinn never heard him.
Jazz was also not played, although it was not openly banned.
Improvisation has gone out of fashion.
There is only one "if" left in life.
When the melody started, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
It's the same with wit.
His unpredictability got on people's nerves.
And jazz was wit expressed through music.
Although he had reached the age of 10 without ever hearing of Sammy Davis Jr., Kevern knew about jazz from his father's semi-secret collection of CDs.
But at least he didn't have to tell Elynn that Fats Waller was black.
Given her age, it is unlikely she remembered a time when popular singers were not black.
Again, no laws or pressure.
Society was obedient, which meant that each segment of it agreed with gratitude - the gratitude of those who were saved by fate - with the principle of group predisposition.
People of Afro-Caribbean descent in temperament and physical characteristics were well suited for entertainment and sports – and they sang and ran.
Natives of the Indian subcontinent, as if by nature talented in everything related to electronics, undertook to ensure that no family was left without a working electronic phone.
What remained of the Polish diaspora was engaged in plumbing work; what was left of the Greek beat the plates.
Natives of the Persian Gulf and the Levant, whose grandfathers did not quickly leave the country when WHAT HAPPENED, IF AT ALL, happened, in fear that they would be accused of igniting a flame, in fear, in fact, that the flames would engulf them next, opened restaurants with labne and hookahs, did not stick out and yearned for idleness.
To each according to his ability.
Since she had previously only heard ballads, it was hard to understand how the offensive words that Kevern had just sung to her could have been put to music at all.
Music is an expression of love.
"They're not really offensive," Kevern said.
Except maybe for people who have big legs.
My father never insulted anyone, but he loved the song.
He said too much, but the neglected garden gave him the illusion of safety.
Not a single word could penetrate the soundproofing of giant leaves that looked like cabbage leaves.
Eylinne didn't understand anyway.
How could your father love that?
He wanted to say it was a joke, but he didn't want to press two fingers to his lips again.
She already thought he was weird.
"He thought it was ridiculous," he said instead.
She shook her head incredulously, blocking Kevern's view.
There was nothing in the whole world but a pile of her blue-black hair.
Nothing he'd like to look at.
"Well, if you say that," she said, remaining unconvinced.
But it still doesn't explain why you sing it to me.
She seemed really upset.
Do my legs get too big?
He looked at them again.
You can't say no.
Ankles, maybe a little bit...
And you say you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
Do I hate you?
Of course, I don't hate you.
It's just that stupid song.
He could have said, "I love you," but it was too early.
"I like you precisely because you have thick ankles," he tried to say instead.
I have such a perversion.
That sounded wrong.
He wanted it to be funny.
Attempts to joke often put him in awkward situations because, like his father, he lacked that soothing charm that could soften the cruelty of the jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel.
Maybe he, Kevern, wanted to.
Despite the kind eyes.
Eileen Solomons blushed and stood up from the chaise longue, knocking over the console and spilling the wine they were drinking.
The wine was made of elderberry, so intoxication could not be an excuse for him.
In her excitement, she seemed to tremble like palm leaves in a hurricane.
"I like you precisely because you have a dumb head," she said.
Although you don't like it.
He felt sorry for her both because of the excessive rudeness of his words, and because of the fear that appeared in her gaze when she rebuffed him.
Did she think he would hit her?
She didn't talk to him about life in the cold northern archipelago where she grew up, but he had no doubt that she was basically like the one here.
The same huge icy ocean rained down on both of them.
The same confused men, even more sensitive and capricious after WHAT HAPPENED, IF AT ALL, than their ancestors, smugglers and destroyers, wandered in rage from pub to pub, ready to raise their hand at any woman who dared to refuse them or tease them.
Dumb head?
They would have shown her a blunt fist if she hadn't been careful!
First there would be a kiss - a kiss has now become the most common expression of erotic irritation between a man and a woman; an antidote to the bland ballads that the console gave out - first kiss it, and then hit it.
An unnecessary clarification, according to Kevern, because the kiss itself was already hooliganism.
Elynn Solomons showed that he needed to leave.
He rose from the chaise longue like an old man.
She herself felt a leaden heaviness, but the weight of his grief surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
She watched as he left, and from the top window watched as he left, her companion, a man who had taken on the burden himself.
Adam leaving the garden, she thought.
She felt a prick of compassion for him and men in general, even though some of them raised their hand at her.
A man turning away from her, with his back bent, ashamed, stricken, all the ability to fight left him - why did she think she knew it so well if she couldn't remember a single occasion, until today, when she would have seen such a thing?
Again, one Eylynn Solomons looked at her feet.
Twenty years before or so of the events described above, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and energetic 32-year-old researcher who worked at Ofnau, the unofficial public mood monitoring service, produced a small report on the persistence of low and medium levels of violence in the very parts of the country where it was expected to decrease, if not stop altogether, given the means and forces.  which were allocated to its eradication.
"Much has been done, and much is being done," she wrote, "to mitigate the innate aggressiveness of the people who fought in a thousand wars and won most of them, especially among these tangled branches and narrow crevices of the terrain, where, despite the spires of churches hovering over the hedges, the tender breath of human kindness has rarely been felt in history.
However, some qualities, it turns out, are indestructible.
The higher the spire, it would seem, the baser the passions that it generates.
The population sheds tears over sentimental ballads, swallows stories about obstacles overcome and declares their fervent faith in the virtue of marriage and family life, but not only does the old rudeness retain its strong grip both in rural communities and in urban settlements, but there is also evidence that a new and vicious cockiness is emerging in homes, in workplaces,  on the roads and even on playgrounds.
"You have an annoying habit of writing too much," her supervisor said after reading the report in its entirety.
I think you should read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum lowered her head.
I should also ask you: Are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to answer," Esme Nussbaum replied.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme again insisted on her right to privacy and silence.
Feminist?
Silence again.
"I'm asking," Luther Rabinowitz finally said, "not because I'm against atheism, lesbianism, or feminism.
We have no biases here.
We are servants of society without prejudice.
But some types of hypersensitivity, which are perfectly acceptable and commendable in themselves, can sometimes distort the results, such as the ones you showed me.
Obviously, you yourself are prejudiced against the church, and what you call "spiteful" and "rude" would be interpreted by others as an expression of natural zest for life and energy.
To continue to talk about WHAT HAPPENED, IF AT ALL, as if it happened, if at all, yesterday is to deprive the country of the vitality it needs.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinovitz spoke.
Behind his head, flamingo-like pink LED letters echoed the advice Ofnau had given to the country for the past quarter of a century or more.
Smile at your neighbor, appreciate your spouse, listen to ballads, go to musicals, talk on the phone, communicate, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Conversation is better than silence, the word of a song is better than a written word, but there is nothing better than love.
"I fully understand what you want to say," Esme Nussbaum replied quietly as she made sure her supervisor had finished speaking, "and I don't want to say anything except that we haven't healed as effectively as we convince ourselves to be.
My concern is that if we are not prepared, we will find ourselves repeating the mistakes that originally led to WHAT HAPPENED, IF AT ALL.
Only this time we will throw out our anger and distrust not on others.
Luther Rabinovitz joined his fingertips into a pyramid.
This gesture was supposed to mean endless patience.
"You're going too far," he said, "calling 'mistakes' actions that our grandfathers did or didn't do.
You go too far when you talk about how they have thrown their "anger" and "distrust" at "others."
In your place, a person should not need a reminder that by understanding the past, that is, protecting the present, we are not talking about "us" and "them".
There was no "us" and there were no "others."
It was a time of disorder – that's all we know.
"For which, to be honest with ourselves," Esme dared to interject, "No part of society can justify itself well.
I'm not blaming anyone.
Whether it was bad or good, what was done was done.
Then it was then.
Nothing more needs to be said - here we agree.
And just as you don't have to blame anyone, you don't have to make excuses if it were appropriate or if something could be fixed.
But why the past, if not to learn -
The past exists so that we can forget it.
If I can add one word to that -
Luther Rabinovitz's pyramid fell apart.
"I'll review your report," he said, releasing her.
The next day, on her way to work, she was hit by a motorcyclist who drove onto the sidewalk, as passers-by described, "in a vicious rage."
Coincidences happen.
The Lesotho army says no coup was planned; Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Lesotho army officials denied plotting a coup to overthrow the Government, saying they had acted against police suspected of trying to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Tabane left the country, saying the country's army had surrounded his official residence and seized government buildings in the capital Maseru.
The prime minister took his family to neighbouring South Africa, saying he had received a threat of an attempt on his life.
Army spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said there had not actually been a coup, but that the army was responding to the threat from "political fanatics" whom the police were trying to arm.
"What happened this morning is that the Lesotho Armed Forces Command took action by receiving several intelligence reports that there are some elements among the police forces that are really planning to arm some political, young political party fanatics who were willing to wreak havoc," he told VOA.
South African government spokesman Clayson Moniela said the army's actions looked like a coup.
"Although no one has claimed a seizure of power by force, by all accounts the actions of lesotho's armed forces so far have the main hallmarks of a coup," he said.
Lesotho army officials said the soldiers had returned to barracks on Sunday and that the capital was calm.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Motetoa Metsing runs the government in Tabane's absence.
Tabane said he believes he is under attack in an attempt to fight corruption in the country.
The situation in Lesotho has been very tense since June, when Tabane suspended parliamentary sessions as a result of disagreements within his unified Government.
He said his actions had not undermined the government despite accusations to the contrary.
Chelsea midfielder Marco van Ginkel will spend the upcoming season on loan at Ac Milan, according to Milan Channel.
The 21-year-old Dutchman will arrive in Italy in the coming hours for a medical examination.
Last season, he appeared on the field in the London club only three times.
Earlier, Milan loaned striker Fernando Torres from Liverpool.
Production in the euro area at its lowest rate in 13 months
Output growth in the euro zone slowed to its lowest level in 13 months in August, according to a popular study.
The latest value of the index of business activity (PMI) of the manufacturing sector of the eurozone on Markit fell to 50.7 in August, dropping from 51.8 in July.
A value above 50 indicates growth.
New orders were delayed and businesses suffered amid growing tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The values came ahead of a meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.
Markets will be waiting for a clear plan from the bank on how to deal with stopping the eurozone's recovery, as well as the threat of deflation with inflation at just 0.3%.
There is speculation that ECB chief Mario Draghi may give additional signals later this week that he is mulling a quantitative easing scheme for the eurozone similar to those used by britain and the US during the financial crisis.
"While at least some growth is better than no growth at all, the inhibitory effect of rising economic and geopolitical uncertainty on producers is becoming more apparent," said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit.
The PMI of the manufacturing sector of Germany, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell to its lowest level in 11 months at 51.4.
Meanwhile, in the bloc's second-largest economy, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
France continues to cause real concern, as does Italy's weakening from stable growth to stagnation.
Signs that the growth momentum has faded in the main industrial engine, Germany, as well as in Spain and the Netherlands, also do not add to confidence," said Mr Dobson.
The slowdown in industry is likely to add fuel to analysts who expect additional monetary or fiscal stimulus.
One positive news was from Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, its highest level since late 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing that can be said about the August survey of the eurozone manufacturing pmi is that it shows that the sector is still growing."
He added: "Eurozone producers obviously find life very difficult at the moment, as the current heightened geopolitical tensions – particularly those related to Russia/Ukraine – add uncertainty to the still challenging environment in many countries.
These heightened tensions have obviously hit businesses – and especially consumer confidence – and are likely causing some orders to be delayed or even cancelled, especially large orders.
He said it was "increasingly likely" that the ECB would eventually have to do some form of quantitative easing, "although we suspect it will be limited."
Residents of Mariupol will put up a human chain against the militia
Everything was calm in Mariupol until last week - no one was eager to organize the Mariupol People's Republic, the city on the Sea of Azov lived and worked.
Now residents are waiting with horror for the arrival of the "militias".
According to political scientists, the separatists are breaking through to Mariupol to reach the Sea of Azov - the city of Novoazovsk, which was also not part of the self-proclaimed republics, was recently taken.
Mariupol residents decided that the Ukrainian army, although it would protect them, but it had few forces against the well-armed representatives of the DPR-LPR, and were going to help the military.
They dig trenches, build roadblocks and fortifications.
On Saturday evening, several thousand residents arrived at the eastern border of the city, and stood there in a human chain, singing the anthem of Ukraine.
They're going to do the same in case of an offensive.
Volunteers collect and carry equipment and food, collect medicines, and publish a newspaper.
Shops are gradually closing in the city, banks and ATMs are stopping their work.
Ten years of hell for the survivors of Beslan: Ten years since the terrible seizure of the school, how the children who found themselves in it are still suffering
A decade ago, more than 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militants at a school in Beslan, in southern Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed during this three-day ordeal that shocked the world.
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had cheated death during the school atrocity.
Exactly ten years after the horrific takeover of the Beslan school, which killed 334 people, including 186 children, the heroic survivors of the disaster warned last night of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When terrorists, Islamic fanatics, captured and killed children and parents on September 1, 2004, at the beginning of the new quarter, it seemed like something of an extreme degree of possible evil.
Tragedy united East and West in disgust, which miraculously then grew into action and hope for the future in the face of severe grief.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan in southern Russia to find some of the victims who had cheated death during a school atrocity.
We found amazing young people who stood up to adversity, even though the memories of terrorist hell will live with them forever.
Their greatest hope?
That the war that is now tormenting Ukraine, in which children like them are dying, will now stop.
The girl in the photo is trying to climb back into the gym being shelled
She is captured in a picture of the famous Russian photographer Dmitry Belyakov, when in one underwear she tried to climb back into the gym under fire after the explosion of a mine.
Confused, Aida desperately searched for her mother, Larissa, who is now 40.
There were fears that both of them died, but in fact they survived.
"The woman told me to run as hard as I could, but I couldn't," Aida said at the time.
My legs were covered in blood.
I got up and climbed back inside to find my mom.
The soldier picked her up and took her to safety.
After a series of surgeries, she thought she had fully recovered, but yesterday she said, "Three months ago, the pain came back.
I'm afraid I might need more surgeries.
A few pieces of shrapnel remained in my knee.
Her goal now is to become a dentist, to help people in the same way that doctors helped her.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it certainly didn't break it," she says defiantly.
"It happened to me and you can't change that fact.
Once a year, I always go to this gym to remember everyone who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too severe.
My best friend, who was supposed to be my classmate, Dzera Gapoeva, was killed there.
We played together when we were little and dreamed we would go to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I finish my studies and start working.
I'll think about the family later.
She says the grip stays with her, though the memories dim a bit each year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our troubles and we are so grateful for the help we have received from people in the UK and elsewhere.
When I see a picture on the Internet of me climbing through a school window, I think a lot of people will see it for the first time, learn about our tragedy, and make sure that doesn't happen again.
A boy who ran through a hail of bullets, believing his mother was dead
It was his first day in school (Russians start school at age 7) and survived three days of capture by hugging his mother Tamara.
He was seven at the time, and he would say, "Mom told me to lie down if there was an explosion and hold her hand."
After one of the explosions, he thought she was dying.
She told him, "Run."
Fearing she was dead, he ran and on the way saw a crying baby, grabbed the baby by the arm and ran through a hail of bullets.
His father Vladimir, who grabbed his son outside, said: "Damir told me that his mother had died.
He said, 'I couldn't save her.'"
In fact, Tamara was released and was in the hospital with injuries on her legs, in turn thinking that her son was dead.
After their reunion, she said: "I cried with joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir was later brought to London (the now defunct News of the World newspaper), where he was awarded as Barnardo's Children's Advocate by Premier Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"That horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it," he said yesterday.
Still, I can say that in my memory it fades.
I remember throwing away all my toy guns right after that.
But now I can play computer games with shooting, and this is not a problem for me.
"I'm not afraid to go back to that gym, but I don't think about myself.
I remember those kids I played with in the yard who never got out.
We never say they are dead or dead.
We say they stayed in the gym.
I remember my trip to London so well, especially the toy store where I was allowed to pick whatever I wanted and the ride in the open-top car.
But now he fears for places like Ukraine, where wars lead to the kind of grief that he and his friends have endured.
That horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
"I feel so sorry for all those who suffer from these horrors," said Damir, who last week volunteered at the convent.
I want to help so much.
I want to serve in the police someday and hope that I will be enrolled in the training academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said: "37 children were killed in our neighborhood, can you imagine?
I remember the eerie silence immediately after the seizure, there were just no children screaming and running around, and that silence went on for months.
She vividly remembers her trip with Damir to London.
People in London cried when I told our story.
I understood then how people on the other side of the earth can understand our feelings, can provide support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for that award and the opportunity to travel to London in the autumn of 2004.
I'd like to call Cherie and just tell her that 10 years have passed, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped Damir and me.
I remember when Damir wanted to eat borscht, they called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember him playing with the waiters in the restaurant, Damir would shoot them with his water pistol and they would run away and play with him.
And it's only been a month since our nightmare then.
I was shocked that the British were so willing to share our pain and support us.
She said: "I keep thinking this world hasn't gotten any better in these 10 years.
Now there is a war going on in Ukraine, people are dying every day, and I think many children have been killed and will be killed.
They're just kids like ours.
I think for a lot of people, war is a news report that they listen to when they're bored or when they're busy with something else.
I just know how these people feel, the horror of it.
And I can't stop feeling it.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, and it's so sad.
Damir grew up and became a very soft and calm boy, he is not at all aggressive and not angry.
He's not looking for revenge, for example, he's not fixated on this past nightmare.
I know he doesn't like to remember him, but they're very close to six classmates, and they go to the gym from time to time and light candles there.
When he was younger, he suffered from it - I remember him lying on the couch, turning away from us, for hours.
He didn't sleep, his eyes were open.
I also remember him throwing away all his weapons and other military toys. Damir is now 17, he is taller than me, cute, smart and healthy.
I can hardly believe that for a few hours I was so sure that he was dead and that I would never see him again.
When I was able to recover from the explosion and got to my feet, I looked around, I saw hell all around me, with body parts lying everywhere.
I was absolutely sure that it was impossible for my little boy to survive in this hell.
"I remember shouting at him, 'Damir, run, run away,' but again I was so sure he didn't hear me.
But he heard and ran away.
This is how life goes on for us, unlike so many others.
Georgy Ilyin, 17 years old
A boy whose shocking photo after capture became decisive for the tragedy in Beslan
Rest: Beslan survivor Georgy Ilyin with his mother Fatima after capture in 2004, and on the right Georgy today
His bloody face bore the imprint of fear as he fled death when Chechen terrorists shot his classmates.
His photograph was one of the most shocking symbols of barbarism in Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, the chief medical officer, took him to school on his first day of school before taking his eldest son Vladimir to university.
"I left two minutes before the terrorists ran into the yard, so my little boy was left alone for three days of nightmare," she recalled.
Not quite alone, there was a family of our relatives, but they were all killed.
Only my George managed to survive.
The closer that date is, the harder it is to think and talk about it.
There is not a single day when we do not remember this tragedy.
We don't think it was a long time ago, I think it happened yesterday, some scenes of these days are always in front of my eyes.
No one will ever forget, I promise you.
Sinks into the soul: a photograph of George (left) was one of the most shocking pictures of the attack and was immortalized in a sculpture (right)
I remember that George was so eager to go to school that day that he said he wanted to hug the teacher.
I only found out he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there is even a sculpture of a crying George in San Marino.
George doesn't like to look at this photo, and it's hidden in a bookcase in our house.
I understand, but it also seems to me that thanks to this photo, people from all over the world feel our pain.
George says now, "It's important that this never happens again.
"I doubt we'll ever know the truth.
People continue to investigate such tragedies and will never know the truth.
Now they are investigating this Boeing crash in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what caused it?
This world is heading for something very bad.
"I can't understand how this happens, because if you ask people, no one wants war, so how does it happen?
Ten years is nothing for such pain.
We need decades to pass to forget it a little bit.
It has affected my health and I still feel it.
For about three or four years, I had nightmares about the seizure, but now it's better.
I went back to school later in 2004, I was very scared every day.
I thought about my friends and classmates who had been killed.
That's why I keep going to this gym before every Sept. 1.
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends.
It's hard for me to walk into the gym, but I have to do it.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is part of my past now.
I won't forget it, but I don't feel sorry for myself.
My life goes on.
I graduated from high school this year and entered the medical university in Vladikavkaz.
I will study to become a cardiac surgeon.
My first choice was to join the army.
I wanted to be in the military, but my health did not allow me.
I wanted to fight for my country, but it won't happen.
Georgy Farniyev, 20 years old
A boy who survived despite being at the feet of a terrorist killer
Unbelievable: Georgy Farniyev was at the feet of the terrorist-killer at the time of the capture, but still he managed to survive
During the capture, he was photographed in the gym sitting next to a bomb at the feet of a terrorist assassin.
Indeed, it is a miracle that he was not killed.
"It seems to us that it was yesterday," says Georgy, who wanted to study to become an intelligence officer at the FSB, but could not because of the damage that was caused to his health during the seizure.
It's still with me, it's not something I left behind.
I'm older now, and they say that children easily cope with bad events – I have to say that's not true.
"In 2006, I worked with psychologists and I felt a little better after that, but I can't forget it.
And I'd like to forget.
In 2005 – the following year – was the first and last time I walked into this gym again.
I fainted.
I would never go there again, and please don't ask me to show where I was sitting in this famous photo.
Survivor: Georgy Farniyev today with a photo of himself in the hospital open on his laptop after being captured
My pain is immense and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know I don't like to think about it or discuss it, and they've never asked me about school.
As for the physical condition, I am healthy.
I need to be careful with a knee that has been damaged, but I walk normally now.
But still, my health did not allow me to go to study at the FSB Academy in St. Petersburg, as I wanted.
I sent my documents, including medical reports, and they replied that it was impossible.
My second hobby was animals, so I went to veterinary school.
I studied there for two years.
He learns to treat all animals "from cats to cows."
He said: "I know I will never tell my children about my experiences.
It's not something kids need to know about, and it's certainly not something they should be going through.
His mother Marina, 42, said: "This pain never leaves me.
It's in my soul, it's worse when the anniversary approaches.
I will go and attend the ceremonies that will be held to celebrate her.
I know George won't go.
For him, it should be even stronger because he was there and I wasn't.
I was waiting for him at home and couldn't help.
I am so grateful to God that he came back to me. Here in Beslan, the imprint lies on everyone.
He stays with us.
George is now an adult, but that nightmare is still with him.
It's hard to accept when something so terribly unfair happens to you.
He's a boy, he loves sports, but he can't do it because of his knee.
He has had several surgeries, he can walk, but he cannot play sports.
I would say that he 50% overcame this nightmare, but it is impossible to completely overcome and forget it.
That eerie experience will stay with us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the capture, and this only adds to my pain.
I lost a lot of people I knew well and who were dear to me.
My son is with me and this is the best gift God could give me, but my heart aches for those who were killed.
I know families where new children were born, but I also know widows who never married again.
It's hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don't want to.
I will never forget how my heart jumped out of my chest the moment I saw it in the hospital.
Now I look at what is happening in the world – wars in different regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is very close to our country now, and I can hardly believe it.
We were one friendly country in the past, how is it that we are at war now?
People and children are suffering, I am sure many children have already been killed in Ukraine and many will be killed.
If only you could grab all the rebels and throw them away- as far as you can.
Alyona Tskaeva, 10 years old
The baby who was touchingly carried away to safety by a special forces soldier
Rescued: Alyona Tskaeva is carried to safety by a Russian special forces soldier (left).
She's ten now (right) and doesn't remember the heinous crime at all.
The world stopped breathing in 2004, when little Alena was carried in her arms from a seized school in Beslan by a Russian policeman.
The terrorists released her, but brutally left her 30-year-old mother, ten-year-old sister Christina and brother Mahar in the school's gym.
Mahar, who was then three years old, escaped, but Alenina's mother and sister died in a deadly massacre.
Her father Ruslan has since remarried, and he and his new wife Svetlana have a young daughter, whom he named Christina in memory of the daughter he lost.
Alena, who is now ten, remembers nothing about the seizure and blossomed into a smart and cheerful girl, neighbors say.
"They are a big happy family now, and Alena and Mahar are both beautiful children," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a great father and wants to keep them away from all memories when the tenth anniversary is celebrated.
You can see why.
Midfielder Shinji Kagawa, who has returned from Manchester United to Borussia Dortmund, said he was looking forward to taking the field again in the form of the German club.
According to him, this transfer is a joyful event in his career.
Of course, I am very happy that I will play for Borussia Dortmund again," Bild quoted Kagawa as saying.
I feel very good.
Full of positive emotions and looking forward to being able to take the field again in a Borussia Dortmund uniform.
Recall that Kagawa moved to Manchester United from Borussia Dortmund in the summer of 2012 for 16 million euros.
However, he was never able to gain a foothold in the English club, spending only 38 matches in the English championship in two seasons, scoring 6 goals and giving 8 assists.
Man accused of hitting a girl at a pelican pedestrian crossing in Fife
A 78-year-old man will stand trial on charges of hitting a three-year-old girl at a pelican pedestrian crossing in Fife.
Gordon Stewart allegedly hit the girl at a crossing in Pittenwyn in East Newk.
Prosecutors said Mr. Stewart drove his Audi Q3 without due care and attention and hit the girl, causing her injury.
Stuart, 78, of Anstruther, denied his guilt in Dundee's sheriff's court.
Sheriff Charles McNair, QC, set a trial date for January.
Obama, Merkel and Hollande will not buy goods in Vladivostok
Duty Free shop of Vladivostok airport hung a sign prohibiting a number of world political leaders from making purchases in this store.
Do not buy them perfume, vodka and cognac.
The administration of the store decided that US President Barack Obama, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Francois Hollande, Vitali Klitschko, Yulia Tymoshenko, the Prime Minister of Japan and several other well-known comrades would not be able to buy vodka, cognac and perfume in their store.
And she hung a sign on the door.
Earlier, Obama received a ban on the appearance in an even less accessible institution for him by the nature of the service - diet canteens of Moscow State University, as reported by the website of catering establishments.
Whether the American president ever cherished the dream of eating in a diet canteen in Russia is not known, but the authors of the bans clearly seem to themselves terribly witty.
Is there cheese after the embargo: Medvedev gave advice to farmers
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev believes that in the conditions of the embargo, Russian farmers should master new technologies in order to establish the production of cheese varieties in demand among buyers.
The advice was given during a visit to the enterprise "Yugpitytseprom" of the company "Agrocomplex".
The head of government also gave advice to restaurateurs to reorient themselves to Russian meat, the quality of which is at the proper level.
The annual embargo on food imports was introduced in Russia on August 7.
The head coach of the Russian national team Valentin Maslakov is satisfied with the results of the DecaNation tournament.
According to the expert, the third place is a good result, given the lack of purposeful preparation for the competition.
Our athletes performed at their level, - quotes "All Sport" the words of Maslakov.
The third place is a confirmation of our fairly high team level.
It's nice that the advantage of the French and even the Americans over us is minimal.
It should be borne in mind that we did not prepare for these competitions.
The season is over, and we did not oblige our leaders to participate in the DecaNation match.
In recent years, we have been second in this tournament, but this season we have updated the national team.
The French, on the contrary, put up a combat-ready team, including 13 European champions.
They have made no secret of their intention to win this year, as they have repeatedly publicly announced.
But even such a composition of the hosts of the competition could not resist the Americans.
Therefore, I believe that the Russians performed in such a representative company at a good level.
But the results in some sports were an order of magnitude lower than in the same "Diamond League".
The season is over.
Naturally, the result is no longer so important for athletes, especially in team-level competitions.
The main thing here was the place.
And according to the results, I agree, it came to the point of absurdity, when at 1500 m men were so fond of the tactical intricacies of running that they showed a result below the average level ... women's races.
4 Tips on How to Get Better Quality Underwater Photos and Videos
If you want to take pictures or shoot videos underwater, there are a number of equipment options in front of you.
The cheapest option is a waterproof soap dish like the Nikon Coolpix AW120, or an action camera like the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which sell for around $300.
I took these pictures at a family holiday with a few cameras, all priced at around $350.
No matter what equipment you use, a few rules need to be followed in order to achieve the best results.
Double-check your equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure the camera battery and other compartments are tightly closed.
Also, set up your camera for the type of photos or videos you'll be taking.
Some cameras and camcorders have shooting or subject type modes that optimize exposure for darkened underwater conditions.
And before you jump into the water, figure out how deep your equipment can sink.
Some cameras are only 5 feet long, others are 50 or 60 feet.
Check out our buyer's guide and digital camera ratings for both traditional and waterproof models.
Shoot a few shots - because many of them will not work.
"Soapboxes" have LCD that will help you put together pictures, whereas action cameras usually do not.
Even if you have an LCD, it will be difficult to see underwater, and the layout of the frame will be a random process.
So take a few shots.
Also, if your camera has a burst mode that shoots multiple shots with slightly different exposure settings, use it.
Stay on the surface.
The amount of light is significantly reduced the deeper you dive under the water.
If possible, stay close to the surface when you're shooting in a pool, river, or ocean.
This will also allow you to convey more color in the photos; the deeper you go, the less color you'll see.
Swim closer to your subjects.
This is great advice for shooting on land, but it's even more important underwater due to the darkened light conditions.
Especially important if you're shooting with an action camera: This equipment is often equipped with a fixed, wide-angle lens, which means you'll have to get close to your subjects if you want to fill the frame.
The bronze medalist of the 2012 Olympic Games in freestyle wrestling Bilal Makhov can move to Greco-Roman wrestling.
This was announced by the head coach of the Dagestan national freestyle wrestling team Sazhid Sazhidov.
The specialist did not rule out the participation of the athlete at the World Championships in Tashkent in September 2014.
Currently, Bilal Makhov is at the training camp of the team of "classics", - quotes "R-Sport" the words of Sazhid Sazhidov.
In general, in juniors, Bilal performed in both styles.
At the 2005 World Youth Championships, he won the freestyle tournament and third in the Greco-Roman competition and decided to concentrate on freestyle wrestling.
There has long been talk that our heavyweight will spend a new stage of his career in Greco-Roman wrestling.
I will say more: Makhov can perform already at the World Championships in Tashkent - if he wins the estimate.
But the decisive word always lies with the coaching staff led by Gogi Koguashvili.
Andrew Lawson was the kind of person whose personality power could shake things up, even in an organization as gigantic as the National Health Service.
A consulting anesthesiologist, he devoted his career to saving patients from both the suffering of the disease and the agony of treatment.
Among those who addressed him, his wife recalls, was an MI6 officer who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson understood that while doctors were fascinated by diagnoses and diseases, those undergoing treatment were mainly concerned about something completely different — pain.
One day in 2007, however, he happened to be the one who began to suffer.
"I didn't feel like I used to," he wrote last May.
It was hard for me to find the strength.
Struggling with flu-like symptoms, he found himself angrily rebukeing his wife, Juliet.
"I want things to happen faster, not later," he said.
When Juliet left on business for a week, Lawson found him unusually upset.
Something was wrong.
He asked a colleague to take a chest X-ray.
Just two weeks earlier, he had skied in the French Alps.
The results of the X-rays came.
It was mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that affects the pleura, or the lining of the lungs.
For most cancers, it is difficult to figure out the exact cause.
Although some smokers develop lung cancer, for example, not all lung cancer patients have smoked.
But it's different with mesothelioma.
In almost all cases, the cause is contact with asbestos, a fibrous building material that was once called a "miracle" but which is now known to be deadly.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that can be ignored.
Asbestos, after all, is material from the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in the UK since the 1960s, when an industry ban came into force.
Even when it was in use, only people from specific industries worked closely with it: pipe insulators, builders, carpenters, and dock workers, for example.
An industrial toxin from another era, it is hardly seen as a cause for concern today.
But such calmness is wrong.
The UK, it turns out, is now at the peak of the mesothelioma epidemic.
More people die from mesothelioma here than in any other country on the planet.
With an annual death rate of about 2500 people, more than twice as many people die from the disease than from car accidents.
Annual number of mesothelioma deaths since 1980 and projected number of future deaths in the UK
The reason we feel its deadly effects now is that while the use of asbestos has been illegal for years (all types of asbestos were eventually banned by law in 1999), mesothelioma usually takes decades to develop.
And the scourge of mesothelioma is not limited to veterans of industrial construction specialties.
Asbestos was, and in many cases remains, embedded in the homes where we live, the offices where we work, the schools where we study, and the shops where we go shopping.
As a result, mesothelioma does not pay attention to class, level of income, profession or age.
Bastions of chosenness, from fashionable London department stores to private schools, have proven to be no salvation.
The parliament building is riddled with asbestos.
Even the hospitals that are designed to treat us have proven to be reservoirs of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He wasn't a pipe insulator.
As a matter of fact, he had to think about where he might come into contact with asbestos.
Then he figured it out.
"It seems like there could have been a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Gaia Hospital, where I spent six years in an internship," he wrote.
Everyone - students, nurses, doctors and longshoremen - used these tunnels.
I wonder how many of my peers will get the same disease?
It was a question to which, unfortunately, he could give a partial answer.
"Of the four doctors who have trained at Guy's hospital and who have subsequently developed mesothelioma in the last five years," he said in a 2010 letter, "I am the only survivor."
How many of us will get this disease?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma when he was 48 years old.
When he died, on February 17 of this year, he was 55.
It's unusual to live that long.
Fifty percent of mesothelioma patients die 8 months after diagnosis.
It's always deadly.
So now we can only repeat Lawson's question: "How many of us will get the same disease?"
According to professor Julian Pitot, a leading expert on mesothelioma in the UK, it is most likely to assume that around 90,000 people will die between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in the UK is due to die.
Most now have no idea that they will die this way.

A quick scan of reports from courtrooms, where victims often seek compensation, shows how far the mesothelioma attack has spread.
This June, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted that they had inadvertently exposed Janice Ellen to asbestos.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, managing the apparel departments at two sites, one of which was the main store on Oxford Street.
Mrs. Ellen was just 18 years old when she started working at M&S.
She now has two children over the age of 20.
"Before that happened," she says, "I had never heard of mesothelioma, I barely knew about asbestos.
It never occurred to me that I would be affected.
Few people really know much about asbestos.
Strictly speaking, asbestos is not one substance, but a group of six minerals.
They get their name from the word "asbestiform," which means a fibrous structure that gives them strength and flexibility.
Of these six, three were often used in construction.
Chrysotile, commonly known as white asbestos, is much more commonly found in buildings today.
It was used in roof panels, floor tiles, pipe thermal insulation, boiler joints, even in the brake pads of cars.
It is less lethal than other forms of asbestos, but is still recognized by the European Union and the World Health Organization as a "serious source of health damage" that can lead to death.
More dangerous, however, are brown asbestos (amosite) and blue asbestos (crocidolite).
The UK was once the largest importer of brown asbestos in the world, and experts suggest that "there are strong, albeit circumstantial, reasons to believe that this is the main reason for the exceptionally high number of mesothelioma patients [in the UK]"."

Janice Ellen may not have thought of herself as a typical victim of mesothelioma, but Julian Pitot's work suggests that her story is far from unusual.
He conducted a study of patients that suggests that "a significant percentage of mesotheliomas, when there is no known exposure at work or at home, were most likely caused by exposure to asbestos from the environment."
Much of that impact, he says, is due to "routine use and weather exposure" on our buildings.
No one seems to be sure they are safe.
A Goddard Consulting report looking at the Palace of Westminster shows how people, even at the heart of government, may have been exposed unconsciously.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the technical mines and pipelines behind the premises of parliamentary committees were contaminated with asbestos, the deadly fibers of which could be driven by something as harmless as "strong air currents".
Members of Parliament are often accused of pursuing their own interests, but in this case it seems that the opposite is true.
Although Parliament's Technical Services Directorate insisted that the Palace of Westminster had received a "clean sanitary certificate", it has now recognised that £1bn of parliament needs to be redeveloped, improving the electrics and removing asbestos, and that after the 2015 general election, MPs may be meeting at the QE2 conference centre nearby, rather than on Westminster's green benches.
The Goddard report noted that "the asbestos situation has not been managed under various regulations."
It's impossible to know if this management mistake will cost lives.
All you can do now is wait.
One of those who never managed to identify their contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott, 50, suspects he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
"I worked at a hospital that successfully sued for asbestos," he says, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It's so hard to remember all the places I worked and the dates.
What he remembers clearly is the day in early December 2009 when he was hit by something that looked like the flu.
He was 45 and was in the middle of surgery late at night.
Suddenly, I started to get feverish.
It started very quickly.
I felt terrible.
I thought I wouldn't be able to drive all the way home.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain came from the pleura, the lining around the lungs.
However, like Janice Ellen, he simply had no reason to suspect mesothelioma.
In the end, he couldn't go to work for a month.
Puzzled doctors took x-rays of the chest and put pleural catheters to pull fluid out of the lungs and send her for tests.
Yet his condition went undiagnosed.
Gradually, his health improved and he returned to work.
But from time to time, the same symptoms returned, often after he exercised and breathed heavily.
In 2011, one of Abbott's patients came to his waiting room with similar symptoms, and he was subsequently diagnosed with mesothelioma.
Even then, however, Abbott did not link this to his own case.
After all, his patient was decades older and had worked with asbestos directly.
The connection in this case was obvious.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition deteriorated again, and the doctor who consulted him showed his CT scans and X-rays to a team of specialists.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott began to feel unwell, a sensor equipped with a camera was inserted into the cavity between the shell of his chest and the shell of his lung.
I'm an optimist.
I usually just move on," he says.
I wasn't too worried about it, to be honest.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy came in the week between Christmas and New Year: "I was told it was mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: mesothelioma diagnosed
Suddenly, Abbott was immersed in meetings with Macmillan nurses, one of whom suggested that he contact a lawyer.
It was then that he realized the scale of the epidemic.
"It turns out that asbestos was widely used, especially in large public buildings, where there was quite often asbestos thermal insulation on pipes," he says.
People who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now contracting the disease.
Thus, mesothelioma now affects younger people of atypical occupations.
The most dangerous asbestos-insulated pipes in hospitals were in basements, so it is unlikely that patients will be harmed.
But many employees who walked through pedestrian tunnels to get from one building to another (like Andrew Lawson), or ate in basement canteens (as Graham Abbott often did) were almost certainly actually exposed to the toxic substance.
For several decades after the war, it turns out that hospitals were a place where, in theory, they saved lives for potential patients, but a place that posed a threat to the lives of the doctors who treated them.
It's still being deleted today.
Schoolchildren installed their Bunsen burners on asbestos stands.
And it's not just hospitals.
Asbestos has often been used in offices, shops, libraries, and city halls because of its amazing insulation and fire-resistant characteristics.
Schools, too.
As a matter of fact, many were most likely exposed to asbestos in class for the first time.
Across the country, in countless chemistry classes, schoolchildren installed their Bunsen burners on asbestos stands.
Websites have emerged to draw attention to the problem of asbestos in schools.
Meanwhile, in our homes, innocuous things like floor tiles or shed roofs tended to contain asbestos.
"It's an industrial poison planted in a huge number of our buildings," said Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in the case against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact a sick woman could recall was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s.
So be careful when demolishing garden sheds.
The effect of the diagnosis, when it is known that the disease is incurable, is enormous.
"It takes quite a while to realize that," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but realized I couldn't focus on what I was doing.
I was in surgery for two weeks.
Then I realized that I would have to leave and deal with myself.
Well, I'm not going to see Christmas again.
One of the most difficult things was the transition from the position of a doctor to the position of a patient.
Like countless patients before him, he remembers being baffled by the amount of information that needed to be taken.
"It was hard to comprehend everything," he says.
"I asked my doctor, 'How much time do I have?'
I was given about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not going to see Christmas again.
That's it.'"
Mesothelioma is particularly dangerous, as it's the mechanics of how we keep life alive — the very act of breathing — that causes cancer that kills.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by contact with asbestos.
Asbestos consists of tiny fibers.
When asbestos is broken down and fibers are inhaled, they can get stuck in the pleura, the lining of the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate the pleura and can cause cell mutations.
"The problem arises from the inhalation of asbestos needle fibers," professor Tom Treger, a cardiothoracic surgeon who came to Guy Hospital in 2001.
It is the hospital where Andrew Lawson suspected he was exposed to asbestos that is now, ironically, the leading mesothelioma treatment center.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated some others who had probably been exposed while interning at the hospital.
When asbestos needles enter the lung tissue, Says Treger, "the breath pushes them to the periphery, where the shell is located.
This is, at its core, an invasive process from the start.
Conventional treatment options for other forms of cancer are much less effective in mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of surgery, for example, is hotly debated.
Some people think it's worth a try.
Treasure disagrees.
"You can't cut out a pleura," he says.
It's impossible to approach her around with a knife.
Meanwhile, this cancer "does not respond very well to chemotherapy," which "works" but does not cure.
"From time to time there are patients who live a long time," says Treasure.
But eventually, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients are living much, much longer than expected.
Writer Stephen J. Gould died 20 years after he was diagnosed.
Two and a half years after his diagnosis, Graham Abbott continues to fight.
After he contracted mesothelioma, Abbott was introduced to Andrew Lawson, who, four years after his diagnosis, single-handedly turned into a support and counseling bureau for similar patients.
"Hello, Cancer Central," he said cheerfully as they called.
"He was very positive," Abbott says.
He was diagnosed 4 years ago and is still very energetic.
Abbott was first offered six cycles of chemotherapy that would take four months and extend his life by just a month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson, however, "managed to give everything a slightly more positive connotation."
After meeting with several specialists, Abbott decided to continue the treatment with Professor Loïc Lange-Lazdunski, Professor of Thoracic Surgery at Gaya Hospital.
"We had the advantage of not needing a referral, I just called them and they accepted me," Graham admits.
The average patient would have to get referral and approval for funding.
Money plays a crucial role for patients with mesothelioma to get the best treatments available.
However, when such treatment is finally inevitably ineffective, many sufferers face another financial cause for concern – the future of the families they will leave behind.
And then they go to the courts for compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"Asbestos has been known to be unhealthy since 1898," morgan says.
But what changed in the 1960s was that it became clear that even very small amounts could put health at risk.
It was then that they started talking about the dishonesty of companies.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital eventually settled the case, but it wasn't a "full-cost settlement," morgan said, as Lawson could not definitively prove that his mesothelioma was the result of contact with asbestos at Guy's hospital.
After investigating his death, a spokesman for Guy's hospital did confirm, however, that "the asbestos in the basement in question was removed in the 1990s."
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
As a matter of fact, tying deadly contact with asbestos to a single company or place of work – usually decades after that – has proven to be a big challenge for patients with mesothelioma seeking compensation.
Many of their former employers changed ownership or closed.
Insurance archives may have been lost.
And those who defend themselves against lawsuits know that they have time on their side, which the plaintiffs, of course, do not have.
In response, serious new legislation has been released this year that makes it easier for patients with mesothelioma to recover compensation, even if their former employers cannot be traced.
Under the Act, a £350 million fund fund funded by the insurance industry has been set up for those who have been diagnosed since July 2012 and who can prove contact but who have no one to sue.
In such cases, patients will receive 80 percent of the amount that the court could have awarded in an ordinary case for compensation - about £ 120,000.
About 300 successful lawsuits under this scheme are expected each year.
Andrew Morgan, like many who work with mesothelioma patients, believes £350 million is a "very good job" for the insurance industry.
"It's a deal written by insurers for insurers," he says, hinting that the amount is a quarter of what insurers would have had to pay if the time lag had not intervened and mesothelioma patients had been able to track down companies and file a lawsuit in the usual way.
Even Mike Penning, previously the secretary of labor and pensions, admitted the law is "imperfect."
However, both Penning and Morgan acknowledge that, with seven people dying every day, quick action was necessary.
"People are suffering so much and they need help today," Penning said during Bill's second reading on mesothelioma last December.
By then, Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Professor Loïc Lange-Lazdunsky for 19 months.
After initial consultations, Lange-Lazdunsky recommended surgery, which, unlike Tom Treger, he considers effective.
This was followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy – a tritherapy in which Lange-Lazdunsky boasts as many as 40 percent of surviving patients over five years.
Abbott felt a surge of energy.
"It's certainly one of the most important things," Abbott says.
You see it in patients all the time.
There is some force that sustains you.
When you give up, the condition can worsen very quickly.
Graham Abbott went into surgery in March 2012.
By the end of August, he had completed the last of six cycles of chemotherapy.
Subsequent scans showed no trace of the disease.
Then I got a scan in March [2014].
There were a few spots [of cancer] in my chest.
I was just about to turn 50.
It's not a threat to life.
It's the end of life.
Again, Abbott went through six cycles of chemotherapy.
Now there is no trace of tumors.
However, this process is both physically and emotionally difficult.
You can think about practical things – about finances when I die, for example, or about showing my wife how the timer on the boiler works.
When you get bad news, you become bleak.
We need to look ahead.
As Ellie's father, 16, and Tamzin, 14, it's not always easy.
"It's hard for a parent," he says.
It's hard to know what to say and how much to say.
When I was first diagnosed, I told the girls that I had a disease that meant I wouldn't live to see old age.
They reacted very differently.
Tamzin is very sociable and energetic.
She told all her friends and we got a call very quickly from many.
Ellie was more reserved.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients have to face.
But for patients with mesothelioma, such discussions are not balanced by hope, even a glimmer of the possibility of survival.
This disease carries with it (even as it ultimately did for Stephen Jay Gould) a grim certainty.
As Andrew Morgan says, "Mesothelioma is not life-threatening.
The bodies of embalmed pharaohs are wrapped in asbestos fabrics.

China refuses to give Hong Kong the right to choose its leaders; protesters vow revenge
China's parliament decided on Sunday not to allow Hong Kong voters to run candidates for the 2017 elections despite growing demands for democratic reform.
Such a move would likely kick-start long-promised protests in Hong Kong's business district, as activists began planning and mobilization within hours of the announcement.
The decision of the National People's Congress essentially allows communist leaders to remove all candidates who are not loyal to Beijing.
"It hasn't disappointed our expectations, but it's still infuriating," said lawmaker Emily Lau, chairman of the Democratic Party.
This is not what Beijing has promised.
They deceived the people of Hong Kong.
And obviously we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
Defending China's decision, Li Fei, deputy secretary-general of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said allowing a popular nomination for Hong Kong's leadership would be too "chaotic."
Since 1997, when Britain handed over control of Hong Kong back to China, Beijing has promised to allow the region's residents to vote on the head of government starting in 2017.
China's leaders presented Sunday's decision as a democratic step forward, as it gives Hong Kongers the right to vote directly; however, the decision also makes it clear that Chinese leaders will continue to hold the process firmly in their hands with the help of a nomination commission tightly controlled from Beijing.
And, according to a new article, only candidates who "love the country and love Hong Kong" will be admitted.
The decision comes after a summer of some of the biggest and most publicized protests in Hong Kong in years.
Behind much of Hong Kong's pro-democracy campaign is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to shut down Hong Kong's financial district if Beijing does not guarantee true universal suffrage.
On Sunday evening, within hours of the announcement, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered in the rain in front of Hong Kong's government headquarters.
At the demonstration, organizers said their movement was moving into a new phase of civil disobedience and that they would rise in waves of protest in the weeks to come.
However, they did not provide details, apparently in an effort to avoid problems with state authorities.
In an online statement, the organizers said the movement "considered the possibility of capturing the central area only as an exceptional measure, an action that can only be taken if all possibilities of dialogue are exhausted and there is no other choice.
It is with great regret that we report that, to date, all possibilities for dialogue have been exhausted and the seizure of the central region will undoubtedly take place.
State authorities in Hong Kong had been preparing for Beijing's statement for several days, and security measures were stepped up at government headquarters on Sunday, involving police and barricades.
At the heart of the unrest is the feeling among many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their own city.
The influx of residents from the mainland increases competition in the field of goods and services.
There is also growing fear that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and free speech, are beginning to weaken under increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some have criticized the Occupy Central movement, saying its demonstrations put hong kong's business lifeblood at risk.
"The protest they're talking about, it could cause a lot of economic damage depending on how many people will participate and for how long," said lawmaker Regina Ip, who has long been critical of the movement.
We don't want to spread the worry that Hong Kong is getting out of control.
It's a perception that's detrimental to investment.
Chinese state media have also reported in recent days in which Hong Kong democracy activists have been portrayed as saboteurs directed by Western powers.
This summer, activists organized an informal referendum on suffrage that attracted 780,000 participants — more than one-fifth of Hong Kong's voters.
And in July, tens of thousands took to one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the region's history.
American Prom Culture Reaches University Life: Freshmen Invited to Arrive by Private Jet
We are delighted to respond to this demand by launching the UK's first luxury travel service for today's students.
To leave a vivid impression on arriving at the university, the company also offers transportation options such as a private jet, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Mr Stewart also stated that the service had thought about security.
This service is the perfect alternative for students, who usually have to drive their belongings across the country in a dangerously congested car.
Combined with our new options for VIF, we look forward to helping this year's students get to university with a minimum of effort and maximum luxury.
A spokesperson for the company said that since the service has just been launched, no orders have yet been received, but added that "students will start ordering this service in the next few weeks."
The company also said that despite the fact that students have to pay £9,000 a year for tuition, it still hopes to find a market for this service.
Today's students are quite different from the students of 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago in terms of expectations and hopes: it's more important than ever to make a great first impression, and VIF is exactly what it takes.
However, the National Union of Students criticized the service as out of touch with reality.
Megan Dunn, NSS Vice President for Higher Education, said: "This project seems incredibly out of touch with most students.
Many students who will start their university this month are facing a cost-of-living crisis, with affordable financial support in the form of loans and grants falling short of the skyrocketing costs of basic needs, before they can even start thinking about taking out thousands of pounds on something like a simple arrival at a hostel.
Feminists raise the issue of race and police behavior after Ferguson
An unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, earlier this month.
Those who come raise their hands, chanting, "Hands up, don't shoot," as they wait in line before the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri, over the murder of unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a shift in online conversation among white feminists.
In her experience, white commenting feminists put gender ahead of race when it came to promoting reproductive rights and income inequality.
However, as tensions in the Midwest grew and attracted nationwide attention, Perez saw responses from white women who focused 100 percent on race.
Compared to the reaction of black women shortly after the August 9 murder, personal essays with headlines such as "Thoughts on Ferguson on behalf of a white woman" and "Feminism is not just about the oppression of women" appeared relatively late.
But for Perez, they showed a significant shift.
"In feminism, I don't think there are many people who talk about white skin and privilege at such a high level," she said.
People felt the need to say something about what had happened.
It's very symbolic of the crisis we're facing, and because (the ferguson situation) is so tied to race, they felt it needed to be pointed out.
For an English professor at Ohio State University, Corita, Mitchell Ferguson exposed the problems that black American women face every day, but which are not perceived as "women's issues" in the cultural sphere.
"I can write something funny on Facebook about what's happening to me and my partner and get 150 likes from everywhere," Mitchell says.
When I write something about people of color being attacked in their own country, the silence is deafening.
"Why is it safe for women to talk publicly about relationships, but not about safety in the public sphere?" she asks.
For black women like Mitchell, who have studied race, gender, and sexuality in U.S. history, there is no dichotomy between issues relating to race and gender.
In her view, black women were in a position to clearly share those concerns; they face a complex reality every day.
While white women now bring together race and gender issues in the feminist mainstream, Angela Hattery, a professor of women's and gender studies at George Mason University, says their predecessors did the opposite.
"Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lynched, and the reason for this was almost always the rape of a white woman," Hattery said.
A white woman confirming the story was needed to justify the lynching.
From Hattery's perspective, the gap between white and black women occurred when white suffragettes like Susan B. Anthony studied the situation in the late 1800s and saw that fighting for the right to vote would only be effective for one group: women or blacks.
"They made the decision to put all their eggs in the voting rights basket for women, and the right to vote for blacks should have come later," Hattery said.
Looking back at things like this gives us a clear idea of why women of color don't trust white women.
We didn't do any good.
We have never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women won the right to vote in 1920, it took ten years for white women to unite against lynchings in the Southern Women's Association for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group comes nearly 40 years after black women first asked for help, Mitchell said.
From Mitchell's perspective, the rise of white feminists' responses to the issues raised by the Ferguson situation — police behavior, racial discrimination — reflects a time when white feminists had to "catch up" with problems that black women had to deal with for generations.
"True, it would be great if activists who have this [traditional feminist] ideology take the right to raise a child as seriously as they do about the right to contraception?" asked Mitchell.
Second-wave feminists who have made careers fighting for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives are now beginning to understand what that means.
Two weeks after michael Brown's murder, prominent white feminist activist Gloria Steinem used Facebook to publish a scathing article by Guardian columnist Rebecca Carroll, who demanded that white Americans take more part in protests over racism.
"I hope that women who have a different but similar reason to understand the danger inherent in the body — and perspectives on racial issues that differ significantly in public surveys — will be at the forefront of change," Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem vouches for a more overlapping feminism that includes both race and gender issues, her comments on race in America still surprise some.
American Entrepreneurship Institute researcher Christina Sommers, author of "Who Stole Feminism?", told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young men of color, are "far more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinem's remarks about Ferguson contradict criticisms she has made before.
Now we have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
However, when the White House recently initiated a small program, "My Brother's Watchman," to help vulnerable black and Hispanic youths, there was an angry reaction from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The police's relationship with the black community isn't the only issue pushing the cutting edge of traditional feminism.
After the U.S. Border Patrol arrested about 63,000 unaccompanied minors at the country's southwestern border this year, immigration reform has come to the surface again — this time as a women's issue.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women in support of immigration reform, said that in order to present this issue as important for women, she only needed to share the stories of immigrant women.
"They speak for themselves," Mercado said.
When the vast majority of work visas are issued to [immigrant men], women who come with them find themselves in positions vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories resonate with women's organizations," she said.
Ipswich House "with a Pig" for sale
A photo of a house for sale in Suffolk was removed by real estate agents when it turned out to show a large pig resting in the living room.
For sale for £120,000, a detached one-bedroom house stands on a private road in Ipswich.
The detailed description was distinguished by a photograph of the living room of the house - which depicted a pig with its head resting on a sofa.
Real estate agency Connells reported that the pig in the photo is the pet of the owner of the house.
"However, the photo was posted by mistake and has already been deleted," a company spokeswoman said.
In a detailed description of the house, Connells described the former meetinghouse as "a unique separate one-bedroom home".
Despite the fact that the agency removed the photo from its website, it still remains in promotional materials.
The sale of the home sparked interest on social media, where some asked if the pig was being sold along with the house.
Russian tennis player Maria Sharapova, who lost to Caroline Wozniacki in the fourth round match of the US Open, believes that she lacks stability.
According to the athlete, she wants to finish the year with dignity and try to reach a new level, Vasily OSIPOV reports from New York.
How will you generally assess your results at this year's Grand Slam tournaments?
Of course, I am glad that I managed to win at Roland Garros.
As for the other three tournaments, I lacked stability, especially at the end of some matches.
Now, of course, I'm upset.
After all, she could not even reach the quarterfinals.
What tasks do you set for yourself until the end of the season?
After a disappointing defeat, I have a huge motivation to reach a new level.
I have a lot to work on, and I'm going to do everything I can to finish the year with dignity.
The Asian series of tournaments begins in a couple of weeks.
A member of the State Duma Committee on Physical Culture, Sports and Youth Affairs, former world champion Nikolai Valuev proposed to give bonuses for compliance with the GTO standards when entering universities.
According to him, in general, the standards will be the same as in Soviet times - people will pass the standards for pull-ups, running and other exercises.
Recall that 12 subjects of Russia will begin to introduce GTO norms on their territory from September 1.
I also offered schoolchildren who passed the GTO to give bonuses when entering universities," Valuev said.
For example, you can add a little points to the exam.
There are also proposals to give an additional day off to employees of enterprises that have passed these sports tests.
In the city of Harvey in South Wales, a new millionaire appeared after winning the lottery
A lottery player from Harvey this month.
A search for a new millionaire is underway southwest of Perth, where one lucky person will take home nearly $1.1 million from a lottery draw saturday night.
A newsstand in Harvey brings gold in the top prize draw for the second time in five years, with the last win of $1 million in November 2009.
However, the lucky winner still needs to make a name for himself.
Shopkeeper Steve Forward said the win caused a stir in a small town southwest of Perth.
The whole city is talking about it, and everyone is very excited.
We thought that such a win could be secret.
Eight winners from Western Australia celebrated winning the top prize last month, marking the end of several successful weeks for the state's players.
Last week, the canning Vale player became one of August's five millionaires, following the $7.5 million win for the Belmont couple just a few weeks earlier.
The winning couple has been playing for twenty years and said that the win gave them the opportunity to travel the world and buy a new home.
A millionaire from Harvey brings the number of top prize winners in Western Australia to 59 this year, with a total winning of $85 million.
The Ministry of Economic Development wants to accelerate the growth of the electric vehicle market
This week, the Ministry of Economic Development will submit to the government a comprehensive plan for the development of environmentally friendly transport in Russia, said Oleg Pluzhnikov, deputy director of the ministry's department, at a round table held by Vedomosti at the Moscow Motor Show - 2014.
The plan was drawn up on behalf of the government, one of the main goals is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
It is expected that the document will be adopted in late September - early October, says Pluzhnikov, the proposed measures relate to electric vehicles and hybrids - a plan for the development of vehicles on gas engine fuel in Russia already exists.
The plan (Vedomosti has a copy) is designed for 2014-2017.
It is necessary to develop criteria for the evaluation of electric and hybrid transport and decide how to stimulate the use and production of environmentally friendly vehicles.
A report to the government describing tax and customs measures to support electric transport will be prepared by December 2014; the scheme of preferential lending and preferential leasing will appear by April 2015; and proposals to reduce the price of machines, stimulate localization and create a service infrastructure will be developed by October 2015.
In 2014-2015, it is planned to amend the regulatory legal acts in order to facilitate the conditions for the construction of charging infrastructure (in parking lots, gas stations, etc.).
In addition, federal officials intend to formulate proposals for regional authorities during 2015 that they also stimulate the use of environmentally friendly transport - in the form of giving it an advantage when driving and parking, for example; and by February 2016 - and proposals to expand public procurement of such transport.
Finally, by October 2014, the Ministry of Economic Development will include in the list of indicators for assessing the activities of regional authorities criteria reflecting the effectiveness of support for the production of environmentally friendly transport and the development of charging infrastructure.
The market for electric vehicles in Russia is still only being formed - in 2013, about 100 electric vehicles were sold throughout the country.
In early 2014, the import duty on electric vehicles was zeroed out, so sales will be about 500 units, predicts the chief executive officer of Mitsubishi Motors in Russia, Andrei Pankov.
But the fivefold growth does not make electric cars any noticeable: in 2013, according to the Association of European Businesses, 2.78 million cars and light commercial vehicles were sold in Russia.
So far, only Mitsubishi Motors imports electric cars to Russia.
Renault is preparing to start importing - the company focuses primarily on corporate customers, says Nicolas Remiz, director of strategic planning and partnerships at Renault in Russia.
Most other manufacturers of electric transport took a wait-and-see attitude towards Russia.
Russian manufacturers also have developments of electric vehicles - "", GAZ, "", but the release is scanty.
For example, in January-July 2014, according to ASM-Holding, AvtoVAZ produced 30 electric vehicles.
Demand is low due to the high cost of electric vehicles, admits Sergey Amanov, Director of AvtoVAZ for Engineering, without state support, there will be no breakthrough in this segment.
The development of the Russian market of electric vehicles in addition to the high cost of cars (those electric cars that are sold in Russia, on average, twice as expensive as analogues with internal combustion engines) restrains the underdevelopment of the charging infrastructure (refueling stations - units), sighs the general director of "AUTOSTAT" Sergey Tselikov.
Due to the high cost and low rate of cost reduction, electric cars in the next 3-4 years will remain a niche segment of the Russian market, predicts the editor-in-chief of Autoreview Mikhail Podorozhansky, Tselikov agrees with him.
Automakers, by contrast, say that some models of electric vehicles are already close to the cost of conventional ones.
The Russian market of electric vehicles has good prospects, the main thing is to instill confidence in consumers that "electromobility" is real; this, in particular, will contribute to the emergence of new charging stations, emphasizes the President of the BMW Group in Russia Wolfgang Schlimme.
Such infrastructure projects are implemented, for example, by the state company Rosseti: several stations have been built in Moscow, and about 80 more will soon appear.
Negotiations on the construction of a network of gas stations are underway with other regions.
According to Vladimir Sofyin, Director of the Rosseti Department, the company believes in the electric vehicle market and is ready to build gas stations throughout the country, but there are also problems: a small number of electric vehicles in the country and the lack of a single standard for charging electric vehicles of various brands.
In addition, Rosseti as a grid company does not have the right to sell electricity, the possibility of doing this in relation to charging electric vehicles is being worked out.
Pankov believes that the most effective measure of state support for the formation of the electric vehicle market in Russia is the zeroing of customs duties.
The zero rate will be valid until the end of 2014, the possibility of its extension and expansion of the preferential list is being worked out.
Replacing the transport tax with an environmental tax (the idea is being discussed and applies to all cars) will also support the market, but not as significantly as customs preferences, Pankov believes.
The transport tax in Russia is small, says Pankov, unlike, for example, Norway, where the tax cut has led to a sharp increase in sales of electric vehicles - now they account for 12% of the market.
In Russia, we also need incentive measures for car owners, for example, free parking in the city center (as has already been done in Moscow), Pankov is sure, or the possibility of moving electric vehicles along dedicated lanes, which is not yet available in Russia.
A private plane crashed in Colorado
Single-engine aircraft Piper PA-46 crashed in the US state of Colorado.
Three of the five people in it died, reports ITAR-TASS.
The survivors were taken to the hospital.
The accident occurred a few kilometers from the runway of the airport in Denver.
Now the causes of the tragedy are being established.
In the Donetsk region, prisoners of the Donbass battalion are being dealt with.
The punishers were surrounded near Ilovaisk.
They were betrayed by their own commanders, and dozens of security forces died under fire.
Those who survived say that if they had known what the situation in southeastern Ukraine really was, they would not have gone to war.
108 prisoners can be called lucky.
The punishers from the Donbass battalion survived after the "meat grinder" in which they fell near Ilovaisk.
Surrounded by the army of the Donetsk People's Republic, the militants spent several days, actually abandoned by their commanders and the Ukrainian authorities.
When the headquarters reported that it was possible to leave the "ring" along the corridor allegedly provided, the column moved.
But just a couple of minutes later, shells and bullets whistled from all sides.
"Judging by the information I was given, we had a corridor, we were allowed to go out," says the acting deputy commander of the battalion, who has the call sign "Lermontov".
And when we descended between Polypolya and Chervonoselsky into the lowlands, crossfire began from anti-tank guided missiles, from "zushki", 30-millimeter grenade launchers, automatic BMD guns, small arms.
There were four cars in front of me and three in the back, in the end there were only two cars left.
An officer with the call sign "Lermontov" says: almost immediately at least 60 people were killed, dozens were injured, many died later.
The surviving militants are now receiving medical care from those they came to kill.
Now the prisoners are surprised that the so-called "terrorists" treat them well, give them food and medicine.
While their own commanders actually deceived them and doomed them to certain death.
We were betrayed simply," they say.
A column, the whole battalion, to be destroyed.
Like many of his comrades, Oleksiy joined the Donbass battalion as a volunteer, because the Ukrainian news told about the atrocities allegedly committed by "separatists" in the southeast.
Already here Alexey saw a completely different picture.
His mother was killed in Luhansk – and not just anyone, but the Ukrainian military.
A friend called me, told me that there was mortar shelling, that most likely it was the Ukrainian armed forces," says one of the soldiers, Oleksiy.
I then wanted to leave the battalion.
We were not allowed out of Ilovaisk, they said that we were in the ring.
I have already agreed with the commander, the report has already been written about leaving.
We were immediately taken from the training camp from Zurakhovo to Ilovaysk.
According to the prisoners, 300-350 people were stuck in the "cauldron" near Ilovaisk.
Now some survivors admit that if it were possible to turn back the clock, they would never join the punitive battalion.
The militia handed over all the prisoners to the DPR security forces.
Everyone will be tested for involvement in war crimes.
A headquarters has been created in the region to limit food prices
In the Krasnoyarsk Territory, a headquarters has been created, which, if necessary, will limit the growth of prices for products in the region's market.
The decree on the establishment of this structure has already been signed.
The headquarters included members of the regional government, representatives of the executive branch and supervisory agencies.
Together, they will monitor the prices of agricultural products in the region.
Will Kiev reimburse Rosneft for $140 million in losses?
The head of Rosneft, Igor Sechin, said that the company estimates the damage from the shelling of the Lisichansk refinery in Ukraine at $ 140 million.
He said this in an interview with Spiegel.
"We estimate the damage at $140 million and will negotiate with the Ukrainian government on the payment of compensation," Sechin said.
According to him, the commissioning of the Lisichansk Oil Refinery modernized by the company was planned in 2014.
However, part of the plant was destroyed by Ukrainian artillery.
"There was no fighting, there were no 'entrenched rebels', but Ukrainian artillery destroyed part of the industrial facility.
In addition, process oil pumped into pipes has disappeared," he said.
Recall, on July 18, in connection with the shelling of the Lisichansk oil refinery, an oil storage tank burned down and the buildings of two warehouses were destroyed.
Lisichansk Oil Refinery is the main oil refinery in Ukraine, the first stage of the enterprise was put into operation in October 1976.
The total capacity of the Lisichansk Oil Refinery is about 7 million tons of crude oil per year.
The plant is capable of producing Euro-4 fuel, as well as batches of Euro-5 diesel fuel.
In March 2012, oil supplies to the Lisichansk Refinery were suspended due to its unprofitability.
The company decided to start repairs.
A year later, Rosneft received the Lisichansk Oil Refinery along with other Ukrainian assets of TNK-BP.
The DPRK launched a short-range projectile towards the Sea of Japan.
According to South Korean media, this happened around 10:30 am local time from the side of Chagang province, which is located on the border of North Korea and China.
As told to "Interfax" in the Joint Chiefs of Staff of South Korea, presumably, the missile fell into the Sea of Japan after flying about 220 kilometers.
The ruble falls amid geopolitical pressure
On the Moscow Exchange, the dollar rose at the opening by 3 kopecks. to 37.15 rubles., The ruble fell to the bi-currency basket against the background of geopolitical tensions.
Trading on the UTS on the dollar started with transactions in the range of 37.11-37.2 rubles / $ 1, on average for two minutes the rate was fixed at the level of 37.16 rubles / $ 1, which is 4 kopecks. higher than the level of the previous closing.
The euro exchange rate was 48.79 rubles. for 1 euro, which is 3 kopecks. higher than the level of the previous closing.
The price of the dual-currency basket added 3.5 kopecks. and amounted to 42.395 rubles.
The US dollar is traded 23 kopecks higher than the official rate, the euro - 16 kopecks higher than the official rate.
The Russian market on Friday, August 29, continued its rapid decline, but there was no panic this time.
The ruble also continued to become cheaper and even updated the historical maximum against the dollar.
Now investors are already playing in advance the deterioration of the geopolitical situation and possible new sanctions against Russia.
For now, however, it looks more like an artificial hysteria fanned through the media, especially the Western ones.
There are not so many options for introducing new sanctions against the Russian Federation.
TeleTrade "At the opening of the Moscow Exchange, the ruble continues to weaken sharply against the bi-currency basket.
The geopolitical background remains the determining factor.
However, if in the near future we do not see a new negative, both Russian indices and positions of the national currency may be adjusted.
"Orenburg Airlines" will sue the "Ideal-tour"
"Orenburg Airlines" filed lawsuits against "Ideal-tour" for a total of 4.7 billion rubles.
We are talking about two cases, the hearings of which will be held in October.
Different judges will consider cases.
According to Interfax, the first lawsuit was filed on August 14.
Its amount is slightly more than 425 million rubles.
A hearing on it is scheduled for October 7.
The second application was filed on August 18.
Its amount is 4.24 billion rubles.
A hearing on it is scheduled for October 2.
As reported to journalists in the Russian Union of Travel Industry, the judges in the cases are different.
In July, the media reported on the debts of Ideal Tour to orenburg Aviliniya in the amount of 1.5 billion rubles.
The general director of the airline, Viktor Zyukin, talks about the amount of 1.6 billion rubles.
Aeroflot CEO Vitaly Savelyev calls an even larger amount - two billion rubles.
Twitter tried to become more interesting for new users
The microblogging service Twitter has changed the process of registering users in order to quickly involve new participants in active interaction with the platform.
This measure should reduce the number of people who abandoned their microblogs.
Now new Twitter users will view a large number of accounts recommended by the service during registration in order to immediately make their reading circle.
Recommendations are made on the basis of the interests indicated during registration.
In this case, Twitter automatically checks the subscription box for all automatically selected accounts.
Because of this, the user will have to personally remove the ticks so as not to read those who are not interesting to him.
If earlier users of the microblogging service saw only the avatars of recommended users, now Twitter displays a sample of one of the popular tweets of the blogger to help make an impression of a person.
This is the largest change to the Twitter registration page in the last three years.
Recently, Twitter has been actively working on modernizing the service.
Such activity is primarily due to the ongoing attempts of the service to achieve break-even.
In 2014, the microblogging service faced a slowdown in the growth of the user base and a drop in reader activity.
The company at the moment desperately needs more loyal consumers, who, having entered once, would remain for a long time.
This is the only way to ensure a stable flow of advertising funds.
Knowledge Day in Moscow will be chilly and rainy
The first of September in the Moscow region throughout the day will be cool and rainy, meteorologists say.
The air temperature in Moscow will be from 16 to 18 degrees, in the Moscow region - 13-18 degrees.
With cloudy weather with clearing, it will rain in places, the wind of the eastern quarter will be quite weak - only 3-8 meters per second.
The car recycling program resumed on September 1
From September 1, the program for the disposal of cars is resumed in Russia.
Until December 31, 2014, 10 billion rubles will be allocated for these purposes.
As explained by the head of the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation Denis Manturov, money is allocated from the limits that have already been brought to the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation by redistribution from other areas of support.
The program will affect all cars older than six years.
The amount of compensation will be from 40 thousand for a passenger car to 350 thousand rubles for a truck.
Earlier in Russia, a similar program of car recycling has already been operated.
The main difference of the current project, the minister explained, is that now it is planned not only to recycle cars to receive a subsequent discount, but also the opportunity, if the car has reached the age of more than six years, to purchase a new one at a discount when handing over the old one to the "trade-in" at the dealer, Interfax reports.
More than 16 billion rubles were spent on the previous federal recycling program, which operated from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2011.
Thanks to it, the level of production of passenger cars in 2010 amounted to about 1.2 million units (this is plus 101.4% compared to 2009).
The creator of Coming Out Simulator will release a game about modern journalism
Game designer Nikki Case, known for the game Coming Out Simulator decided to release a game about modern journalism.
He spoke about his project in an interview with Kill Screen.
Case began work on the game a few weeks ago, but this fact has become widely known only now.
The source of inspiration for the game was the events in Ferguson, where there are now protests that began after a policeman killed an unarmed black teenager.
The focus of the project, which does not yet have a name, will be how the information coverage of stories affects their consequences.
The hero of the game, a citizen journalist, will need to photograph what is happening in areas where clashes between the police and the population occur.
The hero can photograph what is happening in different ways, which will affect the course of events.
If he shoots the scene in such a way that the police will look like heroes, and the protesters will look like bandits, the police will begin to treat him better and let him go where an ordinary person cannot go.
If he covers events differently, his photographs could turn peaceful protests into a large-scale riot.
Points in the game will need to be scored using the hero's Twitter, in which new subscribers will appear if the photos posted there turn out to be popular.
The game does not yet have a name.
The release date and the platforms on which it will appear are unknown.
Case, however, posted an image demonstrating how an event might change depending on how a photo about it is taken and processed.
In an interview with Kill Screen, Case explained that he had been thinking about the concept of such a game for a long time, but initially wanted to devote it not to protests in the United States, but to events in the Gaza Strip.
After he began to collect material for the game, the game designer realized that he lacked the knowledge and skills to cover the history of the region.
However, when he saw how the media covered the events in Ferguson, he decided to make a game based on what happened.
Nikki Case is an independent developer who produces browser games.
His most famous project was Coming Out Simulator, released in 2014.
This game, which tells about the events from the biography of Case himself, is devoted to how a bisexual teenager tries to tell about his relationship to homophobic parents.
Geletey draws Ukraine into continuation of bloodshed
With a call to prepare for the next "tens of thousands" of victims, Ukrainian Defense Minister Valeriy Geletey draws the people into continuing the bloody confrontation, the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
"In Moscow, of course, they drew attention to the statements of the head of the Ukrainian military department Valery Geletey, who announced the "completion of the operation to liberate the East of Ukraine from terrorists" and the beginning of the "Great Patriotic War", the losses of which will be estimated at "tens of thousands".
The degree of adequacy of the head of the military department of Ukraine, who published the mentioned post on his Facebook page, is a subject for research by specialists not in the military field," Russian diplomats said in a statement.
They hardly believe that such statements can belong to the Minister of Defense of a civilized state.
On his Facebook page, the Minister of Defense of Ukraine wrote on Monday: "Through unofficial channels, the Russian side has already threatened several times that if resistance continues, they are ready to use tactical nuclear weapons against us."
At the same time, he said that the "operation to liberate the east of Ukraine" has been completed.
Perez Hilton deleted all intimate pictures of the stars and apologized.
Today, the horror has gripped more than 60 Hollywood stars.
Hackers broke into primitive passwords in iCloud (data storage) in smartphones, after which their intimate pictures appeared on the website of blogger Perez Hilton.
Not for long, though.
Recall, the official representative of the star of "The Hunger Games" Jennifer Lawrence has already reported the theft of photos from her mobile phone, and also confirmed that all the pictures that "shine" on the Web are genuine.
Perez Hilton, the creator of the tabloid site of the same name, apologized to actress Jennifer Lawrence and her colleagues for publishing their candid pictures, writes The Independent.
No, no one forced me to do that.
I was not contacted by their agents.
And now I will delete the candid photos of Jennifer Lawrence and Victoria Justice," the blogger wrote on Twitter.
However, all the candid photos of the stars have already scattered on the Web.

It happened in Los Angeles at a bend in Sunset Boulevard.
The British footballer got off with a bruise and stretching the muscles of his right arm.
Beckham walked out of the tattoo parlor where the paparazzi were waiting for him.

Tony Stewart crashes after returning to the track
Tony Stewart's return to the track ended a little more than in the middle of the race at Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart crashed into the wall a second time after his right front tire burst on lap 172, ending his performance.
Stewart drove his battered car to the garage and then walked out without talking to reporters.
His team principal Chad Johnston said 14 team members were upset but would now focus on next weekend's race in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish there had been a better attempt and a better finish for him," Johnston said.
We'll go to Richmond and hopefully we'll do better there.
Stewart first crashed into a wall earlier in a race Sunday night after colliding with Kyle Bush, necessitating repairs to the right side of his car.
"I started today with a pretty high hope of making it to the finish line well," Johnston said, adding, "It just didn't work out."
Shortly after the second accident, Stewart's car was loaded onto a tow truck, and the crew packed up and was ready to leave.
Stewart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car hit and killed another driver while racing on a dirt track in upstate New York.
He decided to return this week and needed to win either in Atlanta or at the next race in Richmond to take part in the Pursuit.
He returned to work while investigating the tragic incident that killed 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who took to the track to complain to Stewart during the race.
Law enforcement said Friday that the investigation into the cause of the crash would continue for at least another two weeks.
No decision was made on whether Stewart would be charged.
The three-time champion was greeted with loud cheers and applause as he was introduced before the race.
Starting from 12th position, Stewart was in the first 10 at the start of the race, reaching fourth position.
Then on lap 122 after the restart, Bush's number.
Car 18 derailed at the exit of Turn 2 and crashed into Stewart, pushing both cars into the wall.
Stewart continued, but fell to 21st position.
Sobchak and Vitorgan have breakfast with cigarettes with Zhvanetsky in Odessa
Ksenia Sobchak and Maxim Vitorgan are now in Odessa, which the TV presenter did not fail to report on her Instagram.
True, one photo was very surprising and very confusing to fans of the couple.
The picture was taken by Zhvanetsky.
"At the breakfast of Mikhail Mikhalych Zhvanetsky, Maxim explains what Instagram is :)) #одесса," Ksenia Sobchak signed the photo.
However, except for cigarettes, nothing is present on the table.
No coffee, rolls, butter or stuff...
Fans of the couple decided that Ksenia also smokes, and condemned her for this.
"And whose cigarettes?, "Smoking kills!", "Some kind of cigarette breakfast) ", "It seems to be at breakfast, and only cigarettes are on the table))) ", "Ksenia, do you also smoke?", - subscribers of her blog were worried about their favorite.
Recall that recently Sobchak boasted about what a delicious dinner maxim Vitorgan prepared for the first time in her life.
"Happiness is when you come to the dacha, and your husband cooked dinner for your arrival (for the first time in married life, but how delicious.The main thing is that now at the end of the dinner he does not say with words from an anecdote: "so that now it will be like every day," Ksenia Sobchak boasted to her husband.
The picture shows that Maxim is cooking something with diligence, and pickles and baked chicken have already been served on the table.
Bulgarian prison officials hold a national protest
Hundreds of prison officials from across Bulgaria held a national protest in front of the Justice Ministry in the capital Sofia.
During a peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their demands for the return of previous working conditions, which had recently been changed.
The salary increase is also included in the list of demands that will be discussed with the acting Minister of Justice Hristo Ivanov.
For a month, officers expressed a symbolic protest against the new work schedule, demanding the return of the previous 24-hour shifts.
Despite the fact that the union of prison employees has repeatedly met with representatives of the Ministry of Justice, no agreement has been reached, according to the Bulgarian National Radio (BPR).
Negotiations are continuing, Rosen Zhelyazkov, head of the Main Directorate for the Execution of Punishments, told the BPR.
Members of the Federation of Trade Unions of Officials of the Ministry of the Interior are expected to join the protest of the Prison Employees' Union.
The army controls the new government of Thailand
General Prayut (right) appoints Prawit Wongsuwan (left) as Defense Minister
Thailand's military ruler and prime minister, General Prayut Chan-o-cha, has announced the composition of the country's new cabinet, in which more than a third of positions are held by retired or generals.
Representatives of the army received key positions: ministers of defense, finance, foreign affairs and trade.
On Monday, Prayut Chan-o-cha was officially confirmed as prime minister after the King of Thailand officially approved the appointment of the head of the interim military government to the post.
The 60-year-old military man, who seized power in the country in a bloodless coup on May 22, was the only candidate for the premiership.
He was elected Prime Minister at a meeting of Parliament.
Earlier, the army appointed members of parliament.
According to Prayut Chan-o-cha, the coup was the only way to maintain stability.
It was preceded by six months of demonstrations in which protesters demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra's government.
Officially, Prayut Chan-o-cha will be interim prime minister as the military plans to hold general elections in late 2015.
However, there are fears that the military is trying to consolidate its power in the country.
The military came to power on May 22
against the backdrop of complete paralysis of civil power.
The leaders of the main political parties were placed under temporary arrest.
Immediately after the military came to power, they temporarily arrested the country's leading politicians, including Prime Minister Yingluk Shinawatra.
Some journalists and public figures were also detained.
The current political crisis dates back to 2006, when the army removed Yingluk Shinawatra Thaksin's brother as prime minister.
Both are popular among the rural population, especially in the northern regions of the country, which has repeatedly ensured their success in elections.
However, many representatives of the middle class and the metropolitan elite joined the anti-government movement, which since November 2013 has practically paralyzed the country.
No one said that mussels would be better in a salad, I did not promise you this, jokes the waitress from the new Palm brasserie.
We have to formally admit that this is indeed the case, but the mind and stomach remain adamant.
After all, everyone has long known: we say "Belgium" - we mean mussels, we say "mussels" - we mean "Belgium".
Restaurateurs like to thoughtfully state that the success of the institution depends on three factors: this is location, location and once again location.
There are such places, located not only well, but even excellent, but some unlucky.
In short, sitting at the Palm table, I remembered that once there was a cafe "Gorodok" (in honor of the same TV show), then "Odessa-Mama", and also a restaurant "Bojole" and a beer house "Friendship".
Now here again beer, but no longer nostalgic-Soviet, but Belgian.
Above the ground is only the tip of the iceberg: a bar counter and a couple of tables, the rest of the space is devoid of even a hint of sunlight.
But here it is fun, as in the children's room: red, yellow and green walls, multi-colored chairs, instead of windows - TVs, where mermaid girls swim.
Belgian establishments in St. Petersburg are no longer a novelty, so there is something to compare with.
There are eight types of draught beer (260-300 rubles per 0.5 liters) and countless bottled beers (170-1550 rubles).
A sociably positive waitress cheerfully presents the menu, saying that "mussels are hearty large seeds", and it should be noted: it is the service, despite some shortcomings, that is the most positive side of Palm.
The menu is expected in content, but often very unexpected in execution.
Well, who, for example, is given to predict that a meatloaf with Walloon prunes (280 rubles) is actually carpaccio, cut so thinly that parchment paper in comparison with it will seem ugly thick.
You can feel at least some taste only if you rake half a plate at once.
With salads, it's even worse.
The classic Liège (260) would most correctly be recognized as a crime against the Belgian people: some kind of parched iceberg, potatoes boiled once upon a time, sour Kenyan beans, hardened bacon chips plus pickled onions for some reason.
With such a Liège salad you would not wish a meeting on anyone!
The composition of the ingredients of the Belgian salad was partially different, but the impression was also not positive.
If you could still close your eyes to unripe quarters of cherry tomatoes or overcooked mushrooms, then why do mussels look like they have been defrosted and boiled several times in their lifetime!
After all, I already know: there are quite normal White Sea mussels here!
They are served in pans "in the sauce of your choice" (490-560 rubles per 0.5 kg).
Half a dozen sauces, the one made of white wine, celery and carrots, frankly did not set.
There are vegetables, but there is no aroma, and whether there was wine there remains a mystery.
But fritas with homemade mayonnaise are good for mussels.
Chicken waterseed here is not a soup, thick to such an extent that depending on your mood you can decide whether the first or second course is in front of you, but just a pleasant creamy soup.
It was stated that the rabbit was cooked in beer sauce by a local chef, and nothing was said about rosemary.
In fact, the situation turned out to be diametrically opposite: rosemary drowned out everything.
There was an impression that this rabbit during his lifetime was fed exclusively rosemary bushes, which is why the meat acquired such an unusual aroma.
But at the same time, a wonderful - no, just an excellent pear in a caramelized crust was attached to the rabbit leg.
Waffles in Palm offer not only sweet, but also hearty - with beef, chicken or bacon and cheese (220-280).
The maple sauce was unnecessarily watery and the waffles were dry.
But the manager who came to the table very informally asked about the lunch impressions.
So, it's worth coming again.
The dollar rose on the MICEX above 37 rubles on the news about the new sanctions against Russia being prepared by the West.
This is a new historical record.
The dollar by calculations "tomorrow" by 10:29 Moscow time grew by 26.9 kopecks and amounted to 37.02 rubles, the euro rose by 30 kopecks - to 48.73 rubles, according to data from the Moscow Exchange.
The bi-currency basket grew by 28 kopecks to the level of the previous closing and cost 42.28 rubles.
Before the Crimean events, the dollar reached a maximum on February 19, 2009 - then it cost 36.43 rubles, and on March 3, 2014 it was already 37.005 rubles.
On the night of August 29, the White House announced that US President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel were discussing the possibility of imposing additional sanctions against Russia.
The weakening of the ruble is of a long-term nature, both paired with the euro and paired with the dollar.
The long-term forecast assumed this mark," says Anna Bodrova, senior analyst at Alpari.
Everything related to Ukraine, one way or another, will be reflected in the courses.
As long as this continues, investors will react.
Today, rumors about the invasion of troops are not confirmed on either side, but the market turned out to be very emotional.
All talk that he was resistant to such news was crossed out yesterday.
The week, according to expert forecasts, will close near these levels - 36.90 and 37.05 rubles per dollar.
The tax period is over, oil prices are weak, politics, sanctions, the problem of gas transit through Ukraine - all these are links in the same chain.
Inflation is also projected to accelerate: from 5 to 10% will be added to current prices for the autumn.
Soon, in addition, seasonal vegetables and fruits will run out, and there will be a vacuum while the networks are reoriented to other suppliers.
"The dollar approached the mark of 37 rubles, passed it and returned back, there is no powerful hysteria," comments Konstantin Bushuev, head of the market analysis department at Otkritie Broker.
Everyone will still be watching whether the promised sanctions will be imposed on Saturday, how NATO will sit.
The ruble, according to him, weakened sharply after the end of the tax season, then there was news on Ukraine, in addition, the Central Bank last week announced that by the end of the year it completely switches to a floating exchange rate and refuses any currency interventions.
If you look at the daily fluctuation, it was no different from the previous ones during this month, it was the mark of 37 rubles that frightened everyone, the analyst continues.
And so, in terms of turnover, nothing powerful happened.
The troubled times for the foreign exchange market were, let me remind you, when at the end of January there was an increased demand for currency, as well as on the third of March, when the Central Bank shipped a record amount of currency.
UFS IC also sees a positive side of the ruble's weakening.
First of all, this is the growth of the revenue side of the budget from export operations, as well as increasing the competitiveness of domestic producers due to the rise in the cost of imports, says Alexey Kozlov, chief analyst at UFS IC.
The negative aspects include the rise in price of imported goods and services.
Sharp fluctuations in the Russian currency significantly reduce the attractiveness of investing in the Russian economy, provoke an increase in inflationary pressure and, as a result, cause an increase in the cost of borrowing money, which, in turn, hinders the development of the country's economy.
If we talk about the stock market, the depreciation of the ruble somewhat smoothes out the decline in stock prices, expressed in rubles.
For example, the MICEX Index fell by 1.67% during Thursday's trading, and the RTS Index lost 3.27%.
Such a significant difference in the relative magnitude of the decline in indices is explained by the weakening of the ruble during the day by more than 1.5%.
The weakening of the ruble is of an emotional nature and is explained by the mass desire to buy currency.
As practice shows, emotions gradually disappear, and ruble quotes partially or completely restore lost positions.
"We believe that soon we will be able to see the ratio of the dollar and the Russian currency near the level of 36 rubles per dollar," said Alexey Kozlov.
A genetic disorder is often misdiagnosed
The British woman said that she spent many years thinking that she would die after being misdiagnosed.
Caryn Rogers spent much of her teenage years thinking she had only a few years to live after she was diagnosed with another disease.
In fact, she had Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), a group of inherited disorders that cause damage to nerves outside the brain and spine.
The charity CMT UK has reported that misdiagnosis is a common problem among people with CMT because so little is known about the condition.
Around 23,000 people in the UK are thought to have CMT, which can cause motor symptoms such as muscle weakness, uncertain gait and twitched toes.
Patients may feel numbness or pain, and the condition does not heal and progresses, which means that symptoms worsen over time.
When Rogers was 13, she thought she was suffering from Friedreich's ataxia (AF), a condition whose prognosis was very poor.
Rogers thought she would be confined to a wheelchair by the time she was 18 and would die before she turned 30.
The mother-of-two, now 51, said: "As a child, I knew I couldn't do what others did.
I fell every day and it took me more time.
I've never been able to roller skate or skateboard with other kids, and I was bullied a lot at school because of the way I walked and ran.
Rogers said that when she was 13, after several surgeries to release her Achilles tendon and straighten her feet, she looked into the medical record when her doctor left the room and it said she had AF.
"I felt guilty because I stuck my nose where I shouldn't, so I didn't tell anyone, but I went home, found information about this condition in the library and wrote to the AF Association," she said.
When I received the information back, I was shocked and experienced the worst panic possible.
I thought I would be in a wheelchair at 18 and die before I turned 25, and that I would gradually lose all my abilities in that span.
I went through it alone and I planned my own funeral.
She said that by the time she turned 17, she realized that her ability to walk had not deteriorated as much as she thought and asked her doctor about it.
He just got up and hugged me and said, "My dear, I don't think you have this disease because you would already be in a wheelchair."
I think you have something that is much less life-threatening.
After several genetic examinations, she was diagnosed with CMT.
"When he explained what CMT was, I thought I had pulled out a lucky ticket," she said.
The CHARITY CMT UK has announced a month of information on CMT to try to draw attention to the disease.
The tax burden on Washington Zone entrepreneurs is growing as the economy recovers
A recovering economy means more customers, more sales, and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax bills for companies across the country increased modestly last year as the economic recovery accelerated, according to a new study released last week, and companies in the Washington Zone are no exception.
Companies in the county, Maryland and Virginia collectively paid $27.6 billion to state and local treasury in fiscal 2013, up 3.8 percent from the $26.6 billion raised in 2012.
The tax burden on business by state and locally increased 4.3 percent last year, to $671 billion, up from 3.9 percent a year earlier, and it was the third consecutive year of growth after consecutive years when bills declined, in 2009 and 2010.
Taxes levied by the state rose faster, 4.3 percent than local taxes, 3.9 percent, according to a study conducted by professional services firm Ernst & Young and the state's Tax Center, a tax policy group.
More than half of the county's tax revenue, 56 percent, comes from business taxes, while 36 percent of Maryland's tax revenue comes from firms.
Virginia, with 28 percent, generates the least amount of tax revenue, proportionately, from entrepreneurs.
To a large extent, the rise in tax revenues is caused by a return to the previous level of real estate value of companies, the researchers say, which raised property taxes by 3.7 percent this year after three consecutive years when growth was less than 1 percent.
While a large share of these revenues come from large states such as California, New York and Texas, it appears that the same thing is happening in the Washington Zone.
Companies in the county, Maryland and Virginia collectively paid $10 billion in property taxes by state and local last year, $9.6 billion more than in 2012 — an increase of 4.2 percent from the previous year.
However, the observed return in property values has no similar effect on the growth of tax revenues by state and locally in Maryland, where property taxes barely exceed one-fifth of companies' tax bills.
Virginia and D.C. companies pay about half of their state and local tax bills in the form of property taxes.
"What's happening in Maryland is that so much of their real estate, especially the tax base around the District of Columbia, is owned either by the government or by nonprofit organizations that don't pay property taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, executive director of the state's TaxAtion Center.
Thus, Maryland is forced to rely much more, for example, on income taxes, to pay for the same services that are available in other states.
The recent increase in tax revenues from entrepreneurs cannot be fully explained by the recovery of the real estate market.
Entrepreneurs' incomes also appear to be on the mend, according to these data.
Companies in the region declared state corporate income tax of $2.3 billion, $2.1 billion more than in 2012.
Maryland has raised $1 billion in corporate income tax revenue, the most in the region.
Although the trends are in one direction, the tax burden of entrepreneurs at the local level is not increasing at the same rate in all three localities.
The growth rate in the District of Columbia was at the same level as the national average, 4.3 percent, while growth in Maryland was significantly faster, 4.9 percent.
Only Virginia saw a below-average rise in tax revenue of 4.1 percent.
Virginia had the lowest corporate income tax of the three jurisdictions (each with the same corporate rate) of 6 percent.
In Maryland, the corporate rate is 8.25 percent, while in the county it is relatively high at 9.975 percent.
A similar study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year found that Virginia has lower taxes for entrepreneurs by state and at the local level and, in general, a more favorable climate when it comes to taxes for entrepreneurs than Maryland.
The county was not evaluated in this study.
Despite its advantage, Virginia is under competitive pressure from its neighbor to the south.
North Carolina recently signed legislation lowering the corporate rate this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, the same as Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5 percent next year.
If the state continues to meet its tax revenue targets next year, the law could bring the income tax rate for businesses to even 3 percent by 2017.
Meanwhile, small businesses in the Washington Zone seem to be doing better and thus paying more taxes by state and locally, according to a recent study.
Taxes for entrepreneurs paid as individual income tax by small business owners — the transitional structure under which most small firms operate — in the District of Columbia, Maryland and Virginia rose 20 percent last year to $2.4 billion, with a much higher growth rate than taxes for entrepreneurs as a whole.
The researchers say the trend and increase in business tax revenue across the country is likely to continue this year, with turnover tax revenues from state and local governments up 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period last year.
However, the Washington zone may lag behind, as the reduction in federal spending affects the labor market in the region.
Bronze Age of Russian Judo
The home World Judo Championships brought the Russian national team two silver and seven bronze medals.
According to this indicator, the Russians lost only to the main favorite of the competition - the Japanese team.
The tournament in Chelyabinsk started on Monday, and the first day brought the Russian team a silver medal.
Its owner was Beslan Mudranov, who performed in the category up to 60 kg.
At the same time, in an equal final struggle with Boldbaatar Ganbat from Mongolia, the outcome of the confrontation was decided by only one remark received by the Russian.
But the second day of the tournament was the most successful for the Russian team - on Tuesday three medals were won at once.
In the men's competition in the category up to 66 kg, silver went to Mikhail Pulyaev, and bronze - to Kamal Khan-Magomedov.
In the final match, the Russian lost to the world champion of 2011 and 2013, the Japanese Masashi Ebinuma.
Khan-Magomedov, who lost to his compatriot at the quarterfinal stage, triumphantly walked through the consolation tournament and became the owner of the bronze medal.
In the women's tournament of the category up to 52 kg, Natalia Kuzyutina also reached the third step of the podium.
In the semifinals, she lost to the reigning world champion Mailinda Kelmendi from Kosovo, who competed at this championship under the flag of the International Judo Federation and successfully defended the title.
In the dispute for bronze, Kuzyutina won against Ma Yinan from China, but after the end of the tournament, she still admitted that the third place is not at all what she expected.
And again, the obstacle on the way of the Russian to gold was Kelmendi, who defeated Kuzyutina earlier in the final of the European Championship.
On the third day of the tournament in Chelyabinsk, the bronze medal was put in the piggy bank of the Russian team by Musa Mogushkov, who fought in the category up to 73 kg.
In the quarterfinals, his opponent was the former representative of Moldova Viktor Skovortsov, now playing for the UAE team.
However, then the Russian won two fights and won the award.
Mogushkov competed at the home championship with an ankle injury, which he plans to heal in the near future, so he will take a break in the competition.
As for the ex-Moldovan Skvortsov, he and he reached the bronze medal at this tournament.
Interestingly, another of his compatriots, who took the sports citizenship of the UAE, Ivan Remarenko, completed his performance in the category up to 100 kg with a bronze.
The fourth day of the 2014 World Cup also brought the Russians one bronze, which ivan Nifontov won in the category up to 81 kg.
In the hard battle of the small final, he defeated Frenchman Alan Schmitt at the expense of a remark from his opponent.
On Friday, three sets of awards were played at once at the tournament, but the Russians traditionally limited themselves to one bronze in the men's tournament up to 90 kg.
Its owner was Kirill Voredov, and the Russian team was guaranteed this medal: his opponent in the consolation final was compatriot Kirill Denisov.
However, the fight itself did not take place: Questionov's opponent could not go to the tatami due to injury.
Men's bronze was won by the hosts and on the sixth day of the competition - it was put in the piggy bank of the national team by Renat Saidov, who performed in the category over 100 kg.
In the consolation final, he scored a clear victory over Brazilian David Moura.
Thus ended the individual part of the world championship.
On the last day of the tournament in Chelyabinsk, on Sunday, the titles of world champions in team competitions were played.
Both Russian teams - both men's and women's - were among the main contenders for the awards, but, as in individual competitions, the fair sex was not lucky - they did not get to the medal.
But Russian judoka won the team silver.
In the decisive confrontation, they lost in a stubborn struggle with a score of 2-3 to the main favorites of the competition - the japanese team.
At the same time, the Russian team led 2-0 after a clean victory of Khan-Magomedov and strong-willed - Denis Yartsev (weight up to 73 kg).
However, in the heavier weight categories, Murat Khabachirov (81), Magomed Magomedov (90) and Aslan Kambiev (100) could not cope with their Japanese rivals.
According to the same scenario, the bronze match in the women's tournament developed, where the Russian team, leading 2-0, lost to the Japanese - 2-3.
The team competitions in Chelyabinsk were attended by Russian President Vladimir Putin, who after the end of the tournament congratulated the men's team on silver.
"The second place is very honorable, but I want to say that it was clear that you could become champions," Putin said, as quoted by RIA Novosti.
To lose to the Japanese, the founders of judo - there is nothing shameful here.
But I'm sure you can win from them.
The Russian national team at the home World Cup performed much better than a year ago at competitions of this level held in Rio de Janeiro.
Then the Russian team had only three medals - one silver and two bronze.
At the same time, the current tournament was missed by Olympic champions Arsen Galstyan and Mansur Isaev.
We are all, of course, great maximalists.
Yes, I want gold medals.
But let's remember that if a person in the Olympic cycle is among the eight strongest, then he is a potential winner of the Olympics.
Especially in such a sport as judo, "the Minister of Sports of the Russian Federation Vitaly Mutko summed up the results of the tournament, whose words are quoted by the press service of the championship.
The Japanese team expectedly became the best in Chelyabinsk, winning 11 medals of various denominations, five of which turned out to be gold.
The next World Cup will be held next summer in Astana.

Joan Rivers' family hopes for the best
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since arriving at a hospital in New York city three days ago, but her daughter has expressed hope today that the 81-year-old comedienne will recover from her illness.
"Thank you for your continued love and support," Melissa Rivers said in a statement today.
We hope for the best.
Her mother arrived at Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after an emergency call that she had suffered a cardiac arrest at a clinic in the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy, the sources said.
Doctors intentionally keep her under anesthesia and under strict supervision until they are satisfied with her condition, which remains "severe."
The response has been broad, including plenty of online support from the likes of Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Kings can do it all.
On sale is the debut album of the band Royal Blood - the new hope of British rock, which brought rock duets from clubs straight to the stadiums.
The royal blood duo is only a year on stage, but already has a nomination for a BBC music award, a tour to open for Arctic Monkeys and a visit to the dressing room of a New York concert from Jimmy Page himself.
Their debut self-titled album received 100,000 pre-orders a few months before its release, and the contract for its release is in the portfolio of the major label Warner Music.
Given the current deplorable situation in the music market, the situation is out of the ordinary, because we are not talking about a new Lana Del Rey or another sweet-voiced representative of the "new R'n'B", but about a duo of bullish-looking Britons playing with the level of volume and intensity that was last in vogue a couple of decades ago.
In general, the stakes for the first album in connection with all the above circumstances were especially high and have already been fully justified.
The duo has not in vain taken a name for itself, which until then could be encroached upon only by very desperate hairy metalheads, and the blood of which kings flows, as it seems to them, in their veins, is also understandable.
This, of course, is primarily about the heroes of the past level of Led Zeppelin: like the great quartet, Royal Blood aims to shake up the stagnant blood of British rock, bringing it to a new height.
It is probably too early to make predictions about the success of this enterprise, but something can already be asserted.
A dozen songs that fit into a little over thirty minutes is not so much a demonstration of phenomenal composer's talent as a confident and powerful declaration of intent.
Some advantages of individual numbers, of course, can not be denied: for example, the pilot single "Out Of The Black" is characterized by the fact that it is remembered not by a melodic line, but by a drum part.
Musicians jokingly say that this song is generally easier to knock than to sing.
It is also worth highlighting the powerful "Little Monster" and the album's closing composition "Better Strangers" with a Shakespearean quote in the title.
However, the truth is that each of these songs will sound great at a party of fans of hard rock, but when played in a row, they merge into a more or less homogeneous canvas.
And that's not necessarily a bad thing, quite the opposite.
The strength of Royal Blood is that they do not claim the laurels of the new Lennon and McCartney (rather mark in the successors of Motörhead), but have brought numerous rock duos out of the ghetto of indie clubs.
Their music, despite some variety, is created for stadiums, in a room designed for less than a couple of thousand people, it is obviously cramped.
The secret is partly in the cunning use of bass, which replaced the guitar in the usual format, invented in the early noughties the White Stripes.
However, it's not only about the instruments, but also about the very approach to songwriting.
The heroes of the noughties with great difficulty got out of the postmodern paradigm, with great reluctance they went to recognize themselves not just as epigons, but as independent creative units.
Royal Blood already sounds so powerful and brazen that this pressure successfully drapes some secondary and hard-headed musical material.
And after all, who says rock has to be smart?
Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed what Information reported Friday morning: The online retailer — both a video producer and a hundred other things — is buying video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion ($US 970 million).
The news came as a surprise, not because no one expected Twitch to be sold, but because many expected YouTube to be a buyer.
Three months ago, Twitch's sale to Google's video service for a good billion looked completely finished, and the combination looked natural.
Twitch, founded just three years ago as Justin.tv, has set out to be a general streaming service – a real-time version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly evolved into a platform where gamers streamed their in-game moments; "YouTube for real-time gaming," according to Business Insider.
Twitch interface.
And "let's play," a genre of videos in which know-it-alls give (mostly old) games a treatment, as in "Mystery Theater," is already popular on YouTube.
The fact is that YouTube is mentioned often when Twitch is described, so the news that YouTube is acquiring Twitch was met with little interest, a classic example of an entrenched technology company buying out a potential competitor.
It's a mystery why the YouTube deal failed, given that it was reportedly willing to pay as much as Amazon.
All we have so far is a statement from Twitch CHIEF Executive Emmett Scheer: "We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term goals, and they want to help us achieve them faster."
Another mystery, honestly, is the incredible success of Twitch.
Snobs like me who say they'd rather play sports than watch it have a hard time understanding the appeal of watching games instead of picking up a joystick myself.
It's one thing to look over a friend's shoulder at 3 a.m. as she crawls through Resident Evil, and quite another to watch some stranger get 20 shots in the head in a row in Call of Duty.
All the games you could watch right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are designed for one person, so watching them shoot without controlling the angle of view yourself can be a headache recipe worthy of Do It Right.
I agree that the high-speed walkthroughs in which the Rogers Bannisters of our electronic age complete entire games in record time are entertaining.
But unless it's a game virtuoso or humor, it's unlikely that his Twitch channel will be interesting at all.
But what do skeptics like me know?
Twitch has 55 million unique visitors per month, and it is the fourth largest source of peak internet traffic.
How exactly will Amazon make money on this?
It's hard to imagine Twitch folding into Amazon Instant Video as gracefully as YouTube could just gouging through Twitch.
However, Twitch has something that any company would love to get: crowds of young men that advertisers dream of.
As the head of Twitch Scheer said, Amazon and Twitch "both believe in the future of gaming," and this channel shows no signs of fading, even - oh - as a spectator sport.
The 2004 terrorist attack killed more than 330 people, including 186 children.
More than 800 people were injured.
We spent a few days in Beslan.
We talked with the surviving hostages - almost all now students, with the parents of the victims, with the caretaker of the cemetery - the City of Angels - Ramon Kaspolatov, the head of the committee of the "Mother of Beslan" Susanna Dudieva, who took part in the special operation as an employee of the Ministry of Emergency Situations, - says the correspondent of the department "Society" Elizaveta Antonova, who worked on the special project.
Having already returned to Moscow, we met with Aslambek Aslakhanov, who 10 years ago was the presidential adviser on the North Caucasus and negotiated with terrorists, as well as with vyacheslav Bocharov, an officer of the "B" department of the FSB of Russia.
What particularly shocked me during my work on this topic is that it is as if beslan had not had these ten years.
This topic is extremely painful for everyone who has anything to do with it, people hardly agree to talk about what happened.
Impressions of the trip are very heavy.
But we cannot forget Beslan, and I hope we have coped with our task," Antonova said.
The special project was prepared by the infographics studio of the Rambler & Co holding, which has been working in the company since the spring of this year.
Previous special projects were dedicated to the First World War and the 15th anniversary of Vladimir Putin's stay in power.
The DPRK launched a short-range missile
North Korea launched a short-range missile into the Sea of Japan, Yonhap reports.
The launch was made at about 10.30 am local time from the direction of Chagando province, located on the border of North Korea and China.
Presumably, the missile fell into the Sea of Japan, flying about 220 km, said the Joint Chiefs of Staff of South Korea.
Deputies proposed to accelerate the entry into force of the law on personal data
In case of success of the initiative, the data of Russians can not be stored on servers abroad from January 1, 2015
A draft law has been submitted to the State Duma providing for the postponement of the date of entry into force of the already adopted law on personal data of Russians - from September 1, 2016 to January 1, 2015.
The initiative is posted in the database of legislative activities of the lower house.
Its authors were State Duma deputies Vadim Dengin, Yaroslav Nilov (LDPR), Evgeny Fedorov (United Russia), Vladimir Parakhin (Fair Russia) and Alexander Yushchenko (Communist Party).
Such a change, according to the authors of the initiative, will contribute to a more prompt and effective provision of the rights of citizens of the Russian Federation to the safety of personal data and the observance of the secrecy of correspondence in information and telecommunication networks.
The law, the entry into force of which is in a hurry of parliamentarians, obliges to store in the territory of the Russian Federation personal data of Russians processed via the Internet.
It also makes it mandatory to record, systematize, accumulate, store, clarify and extract personal data of citizens of the Russian Federation in databases located on the territory of Russia, as well as to indicate information about the location of such databases.
In addition, the law gives Roskomnadzor the right, on the basis of a court decision, to restrict access to information processed in violation of the legislation of the Russian Federation in the field of personal data.
The law also proposes the creation of so-called "black lists" of violating sites - an automated information system "Register of violators of the rights of personal data subjects".
This law was adopted by the State Duma in the summer.
The authors of the bill were Andrei Lugovoi and Vadim Dengin from the LDPR and Alexander Yushchenko from the Communist Party.
Dengin and Yushchenko are also among the authors of the current bill on the postponement of the date of entry into force of the already adopted law.
Those who do not have data centers in the Russian Federation will have to pay rent
Commenting on the bill submitted to the State Duma today, the first deputy head of the Duma Committee on Information Policy, Leonid Levin, said that he sees no problems for postponing the date of entry into force of the law on the protection of personal data.
According to him, those companies that by January 1, 2015 will not have their own repositories of personal data of Russians on the territory of the Russian Federation, will be able to rent them, for example, "from Rostelecom, which has repeatedly said that they are ready to provide their servers for rent and already provides their servers, from Mail Group, from Western companies that today already provide their servers."
"In addition, there are several independent data centers ready to cooperate in this area," he added.
"If companies decide to comply with the law and continue to work on the territory of the Russian Federation, I do not see any problems - they will receive technological opportunities for placement," Levin summed up.
Controversial bill
Immediately after the publication of the draft law, the Russian Association for Electronic Communications expressed concern that if the bill is adopted, Russians will no longer be able to use many global Internet services.
In particular, we are talking about online booking services for air tickets and hotels.
According to the association, "the bill deprives the subjects of personal data - citizens of the Russian Federation - the right to dispose of their own data, imperatively determining that their recording, systematization, etc. should be provided only in databases located on the territory of the Russian Federation."
The STATEMENT of RAEC emphasizes that a more effective measure would be the creation of a mechanism for informing the user about where the recording is carried out, systematization of his personal data.
In this case, he will be able to choose in which territory these actions will be performed.
The adoption of similar bills on the "localization" of personal data in other countries led to the departure of global services and to significant economic losses.
A participant in the test with a bucket of ice water dislocated her jaw
Isabelle Roberts from the UK screamed so much when ice water was poured on her head that she damaged the bone structure of her face.
This test with a bucket of ice water went painfully wrong.
The woman was hospitalized after she screamed so much during a test with a bucket of ice water that she dislocated her jaw.
Isabelle Roberts screamed so violently when ice water was poured on her head that she damaged the structure of her face.
"The water was so cold I was screaming, but when I did, my jaw started to get stuck," she told The Mirror.
Water is poured on a 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts seconds before the accident
I tried to close my mouth, but it wouldn't close, it was stuck, and then I realized something was wrong.
Then my mother and sister came to the same understanding and they began to laugh, but I had to be urgently taken to the emergency room.
A 20-year-old woman from the UK was taken to the hospital to straighten her jaw after participating in a popular hobby on Tuesday.
The clip became an internet sensation and was published thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
Militia handed over more than 400 prisoners to the Ukrainian military
The "Army of Novorossiya" claims to have shot down the Ukrainian Su-27, and accuses the enemy of violating the ceasefire agreement
As of 10:00 a.m. on September 1, the militia handed over 402 prisoners to the Ukrainian side, 72 of whom were wounded, as well as the bodies of 35 dead servicemen.
This was reported to Interfax by a representative of the press service of the Army of Novorossiya.
He added that "air defense forces in the area of the village of Mereshki shot down a Su-27 aircraft, which violated the ceasefire agreements."
According to the agency's interlocutor, the Ukrainian side used cluster munitions prohibited by international conventions during the artillery shelling of the Luhansk airport.
The representative of the press service noted that the militia managed to damage two helicopters of the Ukrainian Air Force at one of the field airfields during the night, as well as destroy two armored personnel carriers and two ammunition depots.
"Losses in the enemy's manpower - up to a hundred people killed and wounded, 13 people surrendered," the representative of the headquarters summed up.
Interfax does not have confirmation of this information from Ukrainian sources.
On Sunday, the armed formations of the "people's republics" of Donbass announced the transfer of 223 captured servicemen and soldiers of the National Guard of Ukraine to the Ukrainian side as part of the observance of the ceasefire.
At the same time, at night, the DPR army, according to the "Army of Novorossiya", "stopped the attempt of the National Guardsmen, in violation of previously reached agreements, to withdraw heavy equipment from the encirclement area."
Then the militia reported the destruction of two tanks and two BMPs in a rapid battle, the capture of six tanks and the disarmament of 198 servicemen.
According to the headquarters, the total losses of the enemy in all directions (Donetsk, Lugansk, Mariupol) that night amounted to five tanks, eight armored fighting vehicles, more than 120 people killed and wounded.
At the end of last week, a large group of Ukrainian servicemen was surrounded by militias in the area of Ilovaisk in the Donetsk region.
Russian President Vladimir Putin asked the leadership of the "people's republics" to release Ukrainian servicemen from the encirclement.
The DPR agreed to do this on the condition that the enemy surrendered weapons and ammunition.
The first dozens of soldiers began to leave the surrounded settlements on Saturday morning.
According to the commander of the encircled battalion of the Ukrainian territorial defense "Donbass" Semyon Semenchenko, on Sunday night another 14 people came out of the "cauldron".
In his Facebook, Semenchenko wrote that the Ukrainian wounded are "in captivity of the 137th regiment of the 32nd division of the Russian Federation and the 9th tank brigade of the Russian Federation," where they are treated well.
Meanwhile, the Russian Foreign Ministry and Defense Ministry denied reports by the Ukrainian military and NATO about the presence of Russian units in Ukraine.
Russian Foreign Ministry: Russia will take retaliatory measures in case of eu introduction of new sanctions
Russia reserves the right to take retaliatory measures aimed at protecting its legitimate interests in the event of the introduction of new anti-Russian sanctions, the Russian Foreign Ministry reports.
The report of the Russian foreign diplomatic department says that the "conclusions" of the European Council of August 30 demonstrated the inability of the EU member states to overcome the inertia of their reckless support for the Kiev authorities.
Brussels continues to insist that Russia is involved in the situation in eastern Ukraine, relying on "absolutely unsubstantiated allegations about the presence of Russian armed forces on the territory of this country," the agency's website says.
The Russian Foreign Ministry regrets that the European Council, contrary to the interests of its member states, succumbs to the influence of countries that are interested in intensifying confrontation with Russia.
Members of the European Council should call for a peaceful settlement of the conflict in eastern Ukraine, as well as provide conditions for a full-fledged "dialogue between the warring parties," the ministry emphasizes.
Also on the website of the department it is noted that now there are no objective assessments of the humanitarian situation in the Donbass, where a full-scale humanitarian catastrophe has unfolded, and the number of victims among the civilian population is growing.
Recall that during the next seven days in the European Union it is planned to develop specific proposals for sanctions against the Russian Federation.
At the same time, EU representatives work closely with American officials.
It is assumed that they will correlate with each other the measures introduced by the period of action and the degree of rigidity.
New EU sanctions may affect the energy and financial sector.
The Australian government also announced the expansion of sanctions against Russia in the field of defense, finance and the oil and gas industry.
Tricky Ways to Save on University Textbooks
With the cost of university textbooks exceeding $1,000 a year for many students, Matt Schroeder, who will soon be in his sophomore year, has come up with a clever way to cut costs.
He developed a system of how to borrow books from undergraduates, offering them nominal compensation to delay their sale.
"My math textbook, which usually costs $180, I got for a semester for $10 and a 'Chick-fil-A' cookie," says Schroeder, 19, who attends Covenant College in Georgia.
The necessary literature for last semester would have cost $430, he says.
He spent $120.
According to the College Council, the average student spends more than $1200 a year on textbooks and teaching supplies, but students have a range of options for reducing these costs.
Students are increasingly choosing online shopping and creative ideas like Schroeder's system.
Book rentals are becoming increasingly popular, allowing students to use the book throughout the semester, and are often substantially cheaper than buying them.
Nibo Incorporated, which owns more than 250 university bookstores, reports that book rentals have doubled since 2011.
Industry research shows that about a quarter of books in university bookstores were rented during last spring semester, says Nibo vice president Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of all books are purchased from university bookstores, according to the national association of university stores.
Here's an introductory course on the best ways to make a good deal.
Purchase in the online store
Sometimes, if you go online, the price of a new book can be one-third of what you'll see at a university bookstore.
The ninth edition of "Mathematical Analysis" by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs about $ 290 according to the price list, but a new copy can be purchased for $ 239.99 on the website of Chegg.com, which specializes in selling textbooks.
Buying used
If you don't mind other people's marks or damage, used textbooks are a good option.
"Mathematical Analysis" sells for $93.49 in used form on Chegg.com.
Matt Casaday, 25, a fourth-year student at Brigham Young University, says he paid Amazon.com 42 cents for a second-hand copy of the textbook "Strategic Decisions in Media: Understanding the Business Side of advertising."
The book sold for $48 new.
Teachers such as Ingrid Bracey, director of the College Without Walls at the University of Massachusetts at Emherst, invite students to ask their professors whether previous editions can be used.
Sometimes updates are insignificant for classes.
In such cases, old editions can often be found for a very small fraction of the cost of the latest edition.
In addition to chegg and Amazon, Half.com owned by eBay Inc. is a popular alternative for buying used books.
Hire
It's worth considering renting textbooks if you handle them well enough, don't forget to return them, and don't want to keep them after the course is over.
You can save more than 80% on the cost of a new book.
For example, one student was able to rent a "Mathematical Analysis" for a semester for about $20.
Find out the rules of the store where you get the books, including any fines you may be charged for notes, underlining, and damage.
If you rent a book, remember: if you do not return the book, the fines may even exceed the cost of a new copy.
E-books
E-books instead of traditional textbooks are another option.
Sometimes such books are actually rented, acquiring an electronic license for a certain period from distributors, for example, Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
Renting a "Mathematical Analysis" on the Chegg.com website for six months will cost about $ 61.
Bracey says that literature students can often find the best prices, as many classic works can now be downloaded for free, whereas literature in the natural and engineering sciences can be quite expensive.
No matter what, look around.
Joe Gault, 29, who is about to start his studies at Pepperdine Law School, recommends using an ISBN number to find out the prices of the book, as this ensures that you are looking for exactly the text you need.
Before you place an order online, Says Gault, be sure to check to see if the book is actually in stock.
This lesson was not easy for him.
Delivery of the book he had purchased was delayed by four weeks, and eventually he paid the full price at the university bookstore.
Putin said about the complete inefficiency of the far east development fund
Russian President Vladimir Putin said at a meeting on state support for priority investment projects and territories in the Far East that the budget investment fund for the development of the Far East, created two years ago, is ineffective, Interfax reports.
"15 billion rubles remained on deposits," the president stressed.
During the meeting, the head of state instructed to accelerate the approval of the list of territories of advanced development in the Far East.
He recalled that the draft law necessary for the creation of ASEZs should be submitted to the State Duma this autumn.
The Federal Assembly, the president noted, has not approved the list of priority development areas in the Far East and their criteria until July 1.
Vladimir Putin also formulated the main tasks to ensure the development of the Far East.
Among them, increasing the transport accessibility of the region, removing infrastructure restrictions - both in the domestic market and for the development of exports.
Among other things, it is necessary to create prerequisites for attracting additional investments to the region, as well as to form territories of advanced development, which should become competitive in relation to the key business centers of the Asia-Pacific region, the president emphasized.
Recall, earlier it was reported that the territory of advanced development can replace the SEZ.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" could not save the box office
Sylvester Stallone's "Expendable 3" returned less than $30 million from his $90 million U.S. budget, while Sin City: The Woman Worth Killing for returned only $12 million of its $70 million budget.
A "home video" with Cameron Diaz brought in only $14.6 million in its opening weekend, while children's films like "How to Train Your Dragon 2" also disappoint with revenue.
An article by Telegraph film critic Robbie Collina points out that when it comes to children's films, it may be the poor quality of the films themselves.
Collin called 2014 the "worst" year ever when it comes to children's films, and called How to Train Your Dragon 2 a barely "functioning" fantasy sequel.
However, when it comes to films aimed at an audience of a slightly older age, it seems that the problem is not necessarily the quality of the films themselves.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic ratings of each film released in the summer at least 2,000 copies between Memorial Day in May and July 20, for 2013 and for that year.
The results, which take into account the opinions of both moviegoers and film critics, suggest that this year's film harvest is similar in caliber to last year's hits.
Some commentators suggest that it may be due to changing viewing habits and the growing popularity of streaming Internet services such as Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on the upcoming Disney film "The Jungle Book," told the Hollywood Reporter website, "I think times are changing."
We have to acknowledge that and not try to chase what came before.
In contrast to the current drop in box office in Hollywood, Netflix's revenue from the streaming service reached $ 1.2 billion, almost double last year's figure of $ 837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the studios for relying too much on comic book franchises and predicted the "collapse" of Hollywood.
In light of the current downturn, some commentators argue that there was some truth to his gloomy predictions.
With several potential box office hits expected to be released in the summer of 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic Park, other in the film industry are more optimistic.
"X-Men" producer Simon Kinberg recently called the box office drop simply "cyclical," telling the Hollywood Reporter, "Next summer will be the highest-grossing summer in history, and no one will worry about it."
Food sanctions do not frighten the owners of establishments with Caucasian and Central Asian food, but for restaurants of European and Japanese cuisine, Russian suppliers are a terrible dream.
And in general, public catering still prefers to replace prohibited imports with products not from Russia, but from Latin America, Israel and China.
"It's better to eat a lightly salted cucumber than a bad mozzarella," laments Mariano Valerio, chef of the Italian restaurant Barlotti, about the quality of the cheeses that suppliers offer him instead of Italian ones.
Mozzarella and burrata cheese ended up in the restaurant first, they have a short shelf life.
Parmesan reserves should be enough for another couple of months.
What should I do?
Switch to Russian?
In 2005, I was at the Dorogomilovsky market.
Mariano Valerio makes such an eye that it is clear: shocking memories do not let him go until now.
The meat there was on carts just 30 inches off the floor!
There are cats there!
Rats!
Then I said that for our restaurant we will never buy anything in the Russian markets.
I don't know, maybe things have changed there now.
But the other day I was brought fish from the Far East for a sample.
So she was rotten!
I said I didn't even want to talk to the person who brought it to us.
Valerio is surprised that many things that are usual for Italy for a Russian manufacturer are a curiosity.
A few years ago, I was forced to buy Russian beef.
In Italy, meat is hung in a refrigerator for 10 days at a temperature of 1-2 degrees.
It has to sag to become soft so that the muscles relax.
I did it all with local beef.
Then I was asked: where did you get such tender meat?
I said: so it's yours, Russian!
Why doesn't anyone do that?
A five-minute walk from Barlotti in the French restaurant "Brasserie Most" in the kitchen hangs a stop list, which indicates the missing products: French oysters, sea urchin.
The chef of the restaurant "Brasserie Most" and the bar "Strelka" Regis Trigel is not as pessimistic as Valerio: oysters from France have already been replaced by oysters from Tunisia, and instead of French cheeses, the restaurant will buy Swiss ones.
However, Regis also becomes more emotional when it comes to Russian suppliers: "Cauliflower - 200 rubles!
I ask, "Why, on what basis is it worth so much?"
They say, "Well, we need to make money too."
But this cabbage should not cost more than 80 rubles!
We buy Far Eastern oysters by weight, but they live 15-20 years, can you imagine how much their shell weighs?
For the price, it turns out that this is a superdelicates.
It seems that Russian suppliers are one of the main sources of horror stories for foreign chefs.
Standard story: "For the first three months, everything was fine, then the quality dropped sharply."
The main complaints: Russian suppliers cannot withstand stable caliber and quality.
Many restaurants of European cuisine do not know what will happen to them when they run out of cheese stocks.

Sanction menu
On August 6, President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on the application of certain economic measures to ensure Russia's security, which are called mainly food sanctions.
It is forbidden to import beef, pork, meat and poultry by-products, meat delicacies, fish, shellfish, milk, yogurts, cottage cheese, cheeses, vegetables, fruits, nuts, sausages and sugar syrups.
Restaurants have begun a leapfrog with suppliers: food prices have increased, it is urgent to look for analogues from other countries.
Most of all, this will affect expensive restaurants with a mono-kitchen in France, Italy, Spain, to which products were supplied directly from the "mother" countries.
Catering had to be rebuilt before.
For example, when in early 2014 the Rosselkhoznadzor banned the import of Australian beef, and a year earlier - American and Canadian meat.
In return, suppliers established beef supplies from Argentina, Uruguay and New Zealand.
But the sanctions of the summer of 2014 turned out to be much more serious.
However, on August 20, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev approved amendments to the presidential decree, which remove from the ban fry of Atlantic salmon and trout, lactose-free milk, seed potatoes, sugar corn, peas and onions for sowing.
Italian Valerio hopes that the sanctions can still be softened.
In the meantime, some restaurants exist in conditions of uncertainty.
According to East-West, one of the largest suppliers of HoReCa, the share of imported products in the premium segment was up to 70%.
"Expensive restaurants will have to change their menus to what local farmers and other countries produce," said Sergei Mironov, a restaurateur and owner of the Restconsult agency.
If the chef is strong, it will not be a problem for him.
Only we have very few such chefs, and it may take two or three months to develop a new menu.
The trigel from the restaurant "Brasserie Most" is ready for this: you will have to give up 10-15% of the dishes, another half of the menu will be processed.
Restaurants with mixed cuisine are already beginning to replace dishes, such as marbled beef steak, with beef stroganoff, says Sergey Mironov.
"Cheeses from Europe can be replaced with Russian, Belarusian cheeses, cheeses from Serbia, Argentina, Tunisia, Chile," lists the representative of the company "East-West" Oksana Glibchuk.
Cream and dairy products from Europe have analogues in Russia and Belarus.
Chicken from the USA can be replaced by chicken from Russia and Belarus, salmon and salmon from Norway - salmon, salmon, trout from Belarus and Chile.
The lack of vegetables and fruits of European production can be compensated by the products of domestic producers, proposals from Serbia, Moldova and China.
According to Mironov, it will be easier for budget chain restaurants to rebuild than for the premium segment: it is unlikely that gourmets who can distinguish Italian mozzarella from Russian mozzarella went there.
Although it will be difficult for the establishments of the Ginza Project, he said.
Ginza Project has several dozen restaurants under different brands and with their own menus.
It will take a lot of time to replace it," Mironov said.
Ginza declined to comment, citing the lack of owners in the country.
Owners of cafes of Caucasian and Central Asian cuisine emphasize that products from the former Soviet republics are more fragrant than European ones
But there are also many restaurants, which the sanctions will practically not affect.
These include establishments with cuisine of the CIS countries: Georgian, Uzbek, Armenian and Azerbaijani.
"There are no expensive foods in Georgian cuisine," said Khatuna Kolbaia, owner of Saperavi, a Georgian restaurant and Ay Me! café.
All cheeses are made for us in Russia, many dishes are based on chicken fillet, exotic greens we do not use. "
Kolbai's establishments have not yet removed a single dish from the menu.
Timur Lansky, the owner of chaikhona N1 restaurants with Uzbek cuisine, is also not embarrassed by the sanctions: he will have to change only lamb to New Zealand.
If Russia establishes imports from Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, we will even win in price, for us it will be cheaper than imports from Europe," he says.
From the CIS, you can cheaper to get tenderloin, lamb, tomatoes, cucumbers, fruits.
At the same time, what is brought from Central Asia is much better than "plastic" from Italy, Spain and Turkey.
Everyone knows about Uzbek tomatoes that they are tasty and sweet.
Nobody says that about Spanish.
After the introduction of sanctions, the representative of the Ministry of Agriculture of Uzbekistan, Olimboy Artykov, said that he plans to double the export of fruit and vegetable products to Russia by 2016.
Belarus and Kazakhstan announced their intention to replace European imports in Russia almost immediately after the introduction of sanctions.
Fast food restaurants that responded to Dengi's inquiry are also quite calm about the sanctions.
The press service of McDonald's said that localization exceeds 85% and the network works with 160 Russian suppliers.
According to Tatyana Bogdanova, head of the department for work with suppliers of Subway Russia, about 80% of the products the network buys in Russia, although there may be temporary difficulties with the supply of vegetables and rising prices for meat products that are produced from imported raw materials.
In Teremka, "sanctioned products" generally occupied no more than 4%.
The sanctions did not affect the noodle "Walker".
KFC, Burger King and Baby Potato did not respond to Dengi's request, but other market participants claim that the degree of localization of Burger King is significantly less than that of McDonald's.
In the absence of Norwegian fish, restaurateurs are ready to buy Chilean rather than Russian Far Eastern
On his pink salmon
In the meantime, restaurateurs complain that due to the increase in demand, prices are rising even for local products.
"Prices for products for The Rake have increased by an average of 10-15%, for the Italian restaurant Cherry Mio - twice," says restaurateur Roman Rozhnikovsky.
Even in Georgian restaurants, the cost of dishes will increase by 5-10%, Admits Kolbaia.
"East-West" does not deny this: "For example, Belarusian dairy products have risen in price by 10-15% since the beginning of August."
"Brazilian suppliers have almost doubled pork prices," complains Sergey Rak, deputy general director of Stardogs.
Chicken leg has risen in price by 35%.
We are waiting for prices from China, maybe they will cool the hot Brazilian heads.
In the near future, Stardogs will have a planned price increase of 8%.
Now it is very undesirable to raise prices, says Cancer.
According to statistics, the growth of catering revenue for the second quarter of 2014 is only 1.8%.
This is the smallest figure since 2010.
Retail prices will continue to rise, he admits, but it is unclear how quickly: so far, most restaurateurs have stocked up on products for the next two months in the hope of waiting out the fluctuations in purchase prices.
But what will happen in two months, no one knows.
On the square in front of the Moscow City Hall there are a dozen tents decorated with greenery and wood.
In the center of the stage, the musicians play a waltz.
This is a festival of regional products with the cheerful name "There is time to eat".
"We have long been going to make a holiday of local food, and here are the sanctions, we hurried, organized a festival," says one of the organizers.
Behind the scenes with musicians, the Greek chef Anastas prepares a pasta salad and homemade sweets, the other day there was a master class on cooking borsch with caramelized apples.
All from Russian products, the organizers assure.
In the tents - an exhibition of achievements of the Russian national economy.
Honey from Bashkiria, venison from Salekhard, vegetables from the Moscow region "State Farm named after Lenin", cheeses from the Russified Italian Jay Close.
"Salmon for restaurants can be safely replaced with other salmon fish from the Far East," says Philip Galkin, owner of the Svoy Lyudi fish shop.
We catch sockeye salmon, chum salmon, coho salmon, pink salmon, Chinook salmon - "king salmon".
Yes, they are not as fatty as Norwegian salmon because they are wild fish.
Norwegian salmon is aquaculture.
You pick it up and it doesn't even move.
And you will not hold our Far Eastern salmon in your hands.
Only establishments without special claims agree to replace the Italian mozzarella with domestic
In the showcase of his tent there are shrimps with a tag "Magadan", cod, omul, muksun, mussels from the Crimea, scallops from the Far East.
Galkin is sure that it is high time to switch to fish from the Far East.
According to statistics, the catch of fish in Russia in 2013 is more than 4 million tons, a significant part of the fish goes to Japan, Korea and even to the United States.
Fish imports in 2013 - about 800 thousand tons.
The shop "Own People" has been operating since 2012, sells fish through an online store, before the introduction of sanctions it served another dozen restaurants, for example, "Simple Things".
Now Galkin has received applications from another 15 restaurants.
The same sushi can be made from our fish, - he is hot.
We bothered, tried different recipes.
Now we sell sushi through an online store for a million rubles a month.
Our fish is several times cheaper, and delivery is a maximum of 15 rubles per kilogram.
As a confirmation, in Galkin's tent they prepare a portion of "Philadelphia" with chum salmon.
Unlike rolls with salmon, these have to chew longer, but the knowledge that this fish is ours, domestic, gives strength.
On the website of the shop "Own people" there are even rolls of halibut and sea bass.
In sushi bars, however, they prefer to replace Norwegian salmon with Chilean ones.
Galkin explains this by the fact that chefs are too lazy to come up with new recipes with Far Eastern fish.
"Suppliers have not yet offered Us Russian fish," Killfish Bar owner Dmitry Evseev gives his explanation.
The situation is approximately the same with other products: Russian manufacturers could occupy the vacant niche, but this is not happening.
According to the founder and co-owner of the LavkaLavka project, Boris Akimov, now we can talk more about replacing imports from Europe and America with imports from China, Israel and Latin America.
There are large transnational corporations that have powerful logistics and large volumes.
They are able to quickly replace banned imports, unlike our farmers.
That is, the ban will benefit primarily large manufacturers of other countries," Akimov said.
However, in the last month, the restaurant industry received a more alarming signal than food sanctions.
As a result of mass unscheduled inspections of Rospotrebnadzor, the activities of three McDonald's enterprises in Moscow and two regional enterprises in Stavropol and Yekaterinburg were temporarily suspended.
"We are studying the essence of the claims made to determine the actions necessary for the speedy opening of restaurants for visitors," the press service of McDonald's told Dengi.
In fact, no one understands what will happen next.
If everything is limited to food sanctions, this is one option that can be survived, says an employee of a restaurant consulting company on condition of anonymity.
If McDonald's begin to close across the country, the scenario will be very different.
"Europrotocol" instead of a traffic police certificate
Payments for casco can be received without a certificate of the traffic police - so the Central Bank intends to stimulate the introduction of the "Europrotocol" in Russia.
The Bank of Russia has developed draft instructions, according to which, from September 1 of this year, in order to receive payments for casco, an insured motorist will be able to do without a traffic police certificate.
This, however, refers only to those cases when the accident was registered according to the "Europrotocol" without the participation of the traffic police.
That is, if only two cars were involved in the accident, there are no naturally injured persons, the damage does not exceed the established limit and both drivers have reached an agreement on the question of who is the culprit of the accident.
From August 2, the limit of payments under the "Europrotocol" is 50 thousand rubles, and from October 1 in Moscow, St. Petersburg, as well as in the Moscow and Leningrad regions it will be increased to 400 thousand rubles.
The bottom line is that often even with minor damage, in a situation where an accident can be registered according to the "Europrotocol", drivers who are in an accident call the traffic police.
After all, in the presence of a casco policy, it was impossible to receive compensation for it without a traffic police certificate.
The parameters prescribed in the draft directive are precisely designed to eliminate this obstacle to the introduction of the "Europrotocol" in Russia.
According to them, the maximum payment for casco in connection with an accident issued without traffic police officers should not be lower than the limit on the "Europrotocol".
But at the same time, it cannot be higher than the limit defined in the casco insurance contract.
The idea is certainly useful and theoretically capable of unloading both traffic police officers and roads.
But, most likely, neither motorists nor insurers will be delighted with it.
The latter are already talking about a serious threat of fraud growth, which may result from the introduction of new rules for casco payments.
As for drivers, it is difficult to imagine what work will have to be done to overcome the original Russian conservatism.
The driver in most cases will wait for hours for the inspector to arrange a minor accident, because it is more reliable.
And it remains to be seen what will be easier - to defeat the scammers or to convince drivers of the reliability of the "Europrotocol".
The savings certificate will be made nominal and irrevocable
The Ministry of Finance wants to ban bearer savings certificates, but will allow banks to make them an analogue of an irrevocable deposit.
The Ministry of Finance is preparing a bill that will ban bearer savings certificates.
Recently, this tool is gaining popularity, as the rates here are higher than on bank deposits.
The fact is that bearer savings certificates do not fall into the deposit insurance system, and they are cheaper for the bank, since it is not necessary to make contributions to the deposit insurance agency (DIA) fund.
The piquancy of the situation is that this step is planned to be taken because of small and medium-sized banks that distribute such certificates, and Sberbank and the Bank of Moscow, which, according to DIA estimates, control 98% of the core market, will suffer from it.
Moreover, the share of the Bank of Moscow, according to the agency's calculations, is about 3.5%.
The problem, the DIA explains, is that customers of a small bank who bought such a certificate, in case of revocation of its license, try to get money from the DIA.
Some depositors, not having sufficient financial literacy and buying bearer savings certificates, may assume that their investments are insured.
The justified absence of insurance payments on these certificates in the event of revocation of the license from the bank can lead to misunderstanding and social tension.
In the practice of the agency, there were cases when holders of bearer certificates tried to recover insurance compensation through the court," the DIA said.
The problem, of course, is far-fetched.
After all, no one will pay the buyers of certificates anyway, since they do not have the right to compensation from the state by law.
If the fact was that the instrument is not insured in the DIA, metal accounts would be banned along with it, in which citizens' funds are accounted for in grams of one of four metals - gold, silver, platinum and palladium.
After all, these accounts also do not fall into the deposit insurance system, but no one has yet encroached on their existence.
The fact is most likely that bearer certificates are a very convenient security, which in fact can act as a quasi-money.
At the same time, their movement is practically uncontrollable: any client of the bank can buy a certificate, transfer it to any citizen, and before cashing out, such a certificate can change many owners.
It is no coincidence that the bill states that a savings certificate must necessarily be a registered security, which must be stored in the depository.
And in order to sweeten the pill to banks, such certificates are allowed to be issued without the right of early repayment.
That is, an analogue of an irrevocable deposit, which bankers have long dreamed of, is introduced.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
Over the weekend, there were protests by those who opposed the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in downtown Newport for a march against NATO.
And on Sunday in Cardiff, around 150 people gathered outside Cardiff Town Hall for what has been described as an anti-summit.
Stephen Fairclough followed developments for us over the weekend and spoke to protesters who came from everywhere from Bridgend to Belgium.
Germany will send 30 anti-tank complexes to Iraq
Germany will supply weapons to Iraq to counter militants from the Islamic State terrorist group, ITAR-TASS reported on August 31, citing a decision taken following a meeting of representatives of the German government led by Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Reportedly, Germany will send to Iraq 30 portable anti-tank missile systems "Milan" and 500 charges for them, as well as 8 thousand assault rifles G3 and G36.
Deliveries will be made before the end of September.
In addition, it was decided to allocate another 50 million euros to Iraq for humanitarian assistance.
On September 1, Mrs. Merkel will make a government statement on this topic in the Bundestag.
So far, Germany has not supplied its weapons to hot spots.
The opinions of the inhabitants of Germany about sending weapons to the Iraqis are divided.
Some believe that this is the only way to stop the fighters from the "Islamic state", others fear that these weapons may eventually fall into the hands of terrorists.
Insurgents knocked out a Ukrainian patrol boat in the Sea of Azov
Donetsk militia knocked out a Ukrainian patrol boat in the Sea of Azov, ITAR-TASS reported on August 31.
According to available data, this happened in the Taganrog Bay near the settlements of Shyrokyne and Bezymennoye (10-20 km east of Mariupol).
A number of Ukrainian media reported on the shelling of two coast guard boats.
It is specified that the incident occurred today at about 16:20 Moscow time.
Teenagers were taken by helicopter from the Blue Mountains
TWO bushwalker teenagers were flown by helicopter to safety after spending the night stranded in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old went camping shortly after noon on Sunday at Govetts Lip in Blackheath.
Concerned relatives called police around 8 p.m. when they did not return home.
A search party was dispatched, which included local police and a rescue squad, and the couple was found around 11pm near Bridal Vale Falls.
The girl injured her knee, and the young man fell and bruised his head.
The officers stayed with the couple overnight and were picked up on a winch on Monday morning.
They were taken by ambulance in stable condition to Blue Mountains Hospital.
Two unions met
The high-level talks in Minsk did not solve the problems for which they were convened, but gave rise to a new format: the first persons of the European Union met with the first persons of the future Eurasian
Albeit on an alarming occasion (the situation around Ukraine does not tolerate delays), the leaders of the EU and the Customs Union for the first time discussed a number of "hot problems".
Whether such a structure is capable of working effectively is unclear; but it is clear who skimmed the cream from this summit.
Questions on this subject disappeared on the evening of August 26, when Belarusians, and after them other Eurasians and Europeans, saw the new President Lukashenko in the TV news.
The Belarusian leader showed an example of honed courtesy, it was the behavior of a man who had just hit the jackpot - and was planning a decent old age in high society.
How Maidan Lukashenka helped
The arrival in Minsk of three major European commissioners (EU ministers) who met with Lukashenka and allowed him to speak at the final briefing on their behalf is not just a legitimization of a president with 20 years of experience.
This is an application for the recognition of Minsk as a full-fledged subject of European politics and the main mediator of the Ukrainian crisis.
Senior analyst at the Belarusian Institute for Strategic Studies Denis Melyantsov is sure that from now on Brussels will no longer be able to talk to Minsk in the same tone as before.
"The fact that Catherine Ashton met tete-a-tete with Lukashenka gives reason to believe that relations with the EU will continue to unfreeze," he told Ogonyok.
This iceberg has a hidden part: the Belarusian authorities began preparations for a breakthrough long before the November Maidan in Kiev - in the summer of 2013.
"Results were achieved with the EU - these are successful negotiations on visa facilitation and readmission, dialogues on modernization," Ogonyok's interlocutor lists, "and negotiations on international security were held with the United States.
The U.S. even lifted a few sanctions.
As for the Ukrainian events, they themselves and the reaction of the Belarusian leadership to them only spurred this process.
Minsk, on the one hand, managed to maintain relations with Ukraine - warm enough not to lose much in mutual trade, and President Poroshenko could come to Belarus for negotiations.
On the other hand, the Belarusian leader, who de jure did not recognize the annexation of Crimea to Russia and called for punishing pro-Russian militias in the Donbass with all severity, did not quarrel with Moscow.
Minsk has not withdrawn from either the Customs Union or the CSTO, and a Russian air base is located in Baranovichi.
Brussels and Washington noticed the balanced position of Minsk on the Ukrainian issue - and appreciated it, Belarusian experts are sure.
How successful Lukashenka's movement towards political diversification will be will be seen in how often in the near future Minsk will have the opportunity to host meetings in the EU+ CU format.
The press service of the EU High Representative for Foreign Policy and Diplomacy Catherine Ashton could not quickly answer questions about what Brussels expects from relations in the new format.
Ashton spokeswoman Maja Kocijancic only told Ogonyok that against the background of resolving issues of war and peace, this topic is not a priority.
At the same time, there were reports that Kazakhstan could become the next meeting place on the Ukrainian issue with the participation of top officials in the new format.
A drop of tar for Minsk was the statement of President Nursultan Nazarbayev, in which he admitted that it turns out that he was personally asked about this by representatives of the European Union.
Nevertheless, at the final briefing, Alexander Lukashenko made it clear that all parties are not against Minsk remaining the central platform for meetings both in the format of Russia-OSCE--Ukraine, and at the level of heads of state and high representatives of the European Commission.
This means that the "last dictator of Europe" acquires the status of a completely handshake European leader who helps solve a global problem.
The best friend of the European farmer
The very composition of the EU delegation, which included the European Commissioners for Trade and Energy, pushed to the conclusion: the main background of the summit is not the tragic situation in the Donbas, but the economy.
Indeed, the schedule of future negotiations on gas supplies and on overcoming the concerns of the CU countries under the Association Agreement between Ukraine and the EU looks like an achievement more ambitious than peace declarations without specific dates and figures.
Trade Commissioner Karl De Gucht, however, pointed out that EU representatives "came to Minsk to look for a solution to the political crisis, which has economic consequences, and not vice versa."
It seems, however, that in the economy the crisis in Ukraine is "working" for Belarus.
Its consequences - and first of all the mutual sanctions of the West and Russia - give Minsk, which is still experiencing sanctions pressure, a long-awaited room for maneuver.
According to the head of the Mises Research Center, ex-presidential candidate of Belarus Yaroslav Romanchuk, European investors are actively interested in the possibilities of Belarus for the supply of agricultural products to the Russian Federation in circumvention of sanctions.
At the same time, supply schemes are put forward, for which Vladimir Putin scolded Minsk at the summit.
"The initiators of these schemes," Romanchuk told Ogonyok, "are not Belarusian businessmen, but Russian companies.
They have long worked out schemes for the supply of goods, including from Poland, Germany, Lithuania, and today these schemes have been destroyed.
Russian business is in dire need of somehow restoring them, even through the mediation of Belarusian structures.
The second story, - the expert continues, - is connected with the fact that many Ukrainian companies are not averse to establishing production in Belarus from Ukrainian raw materials, also with a focus on the Russian market.
Ukrainian producers have about $4 billion in exports to Russia, and Belarusian production and trade schemes may now be very popular."
According to Romanchuk, the role of the host of the platform for negotiations between the EU and the Customs Union is ideal for Lukashenka from the point of view of developing economic ties with Europe.
He recalls that the losses of the EU agricultural sector from Moscow's sanctions are estimated at 5-10 billion euros, and the European Commission has currently offered farmers only 125 million euros in compensation.
The Belarusian president can offer Brussels to work together to minimize the consequences for Eurofarmers.
This can raise Lukashenka's authority in the EU to an unprecedented height.
Hospitality without initiative
Catherine Ashton thanked the Belarusian authorities for the initiative to hold the summit.
But the paradox is that the official Minsk disowns its active role in the birth of the CU + EU format, and the Belarusian leader at a meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart stressed that Kiev became the initiator of the new format.
"It was your proposal to gather, to discuss without any headband, not to make a decision after signing the Association Agreement with the EU, to understand the situation that was developing in Ukraine at that time," he addressed Petro Poroshenko in front of the cameras.
However, observers interpreted this as an attempt to appease Moscow, which was rumored to initially be against Minsk's mediation, which greatly increases its political weight.
The Belarusian diplomatic department diligently emphasizes that Belarus, when organizing cooperation between the EU and the Customs Union on its land, does not pursue selfish goals, and the ultimate goal of this format is the creation of a single economic space from Lisbon to Vladivostok in the future.
"This is absolutely in the spirit of the concepts that the leadership of our strategic ally, the Russian Federation, puts forward and promotes in other spheres, in other areas," the Belarusian Foreign Ministry, a department where words have recently been scrupulously chosen, told Ogonyok.
In Moscow, there may be zones with paid entry
The Moscow government is considering the option of introducing zones with paid entry as a method of combating congestion of central roads by analogy with other major cities of the world, M 24.ru reports with reference to the Deputy Mayor of Moscow for Transport Maxim Liksutov.
One of the options that has successfully proven itself is a paid entry.
This is an expert opinion, we will definitely study it, look at all the minuses and advantages.
It is too early to say that any decisions have been made on this matter," Liksutov said.
The deputy mayor stressed that the experience of Asian cities, which are similar in structure and congestion to Moscow, is very important for the authorities of the capital.
One of the solutions taken from these countries is the already ongoing construction of a central ring road, Liksutov added.
The recent construction of the Central Ring Road is an example of the fact that it is not necessary to pass all traffic through Moscow.
If there was a sufficient detour infrastructure, then there would be no need to have transit traffic in Moscow," the deputy mayor said.
Also, Maxim Liksutov said that the introduction of paid parking lots significantly unloaded the capital's streets.
And, according to him, the city authorities do not plan to stop there.
Recall, on August 26, the mayor of the Russian capital, Sergei Sobyanin, took part in the ceremony of laying the foundation stone for the construction of the first start-up complex of the Moscow Central Ring Road (CKAD).
Sinful Boredom
Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez's Film Sin City 2: The Woman To Kill for did not make the revolution you would expect.
The first Sin City (2005), filmed with the minimal but symbolic involvement of Quentin Tarantino, revolutionized the relationship between cinema, comics, and literary noir.
The sequel is also revolutionary in its own way: in the sense that it destroys the "thesis - antithesis - synthesis" chain that is fundamental for modern thinking (if you understand the noir universe by the thesis, and the comic book space by antithesis).
From now on, it should be read: "thesis - antithesis - chaos".
Sin City 2 is chaotic on both a dramatic and philosophical level: both times it is chaotic in the bad sense of the word.
Yes, some of the characters are familiar from the first "City", although, behold, the thug Marv (Mickey Rourke), I remember, ended his life in the electric chair, and here, nothing, only manages to snatch - in the role of a kind of people's vigilante - from the air knives and other axes with nooses.
But the old people are literally elbowed by newcomers, as if they broke into the city from some other film, about the meaning and plot of which the audience is asked not to worry.
So, the super-lucky player Johnny (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) has his own story, shamelessly cut short by the authors at the most interesting place.
Her own - from the lustfully frigid Eve Lord (Eva Green) and for something avenging her Dwight (Josh Brolin).
But this confusion, in which Dwight, say, cannot be distinguished from Johnny in person - especially since the faces, like other parts of the body, the characters are demolished with inexorable regularity - is not a problem or even half the trouble.
These are not people, we understand that these are noir archetypes: a fatal bitch, an overly confident player, a detective who fell into the "honey trap" of sex, a corrupt ghoul senator.
Well, when the archetype waltzes with the archetype and the archetype drives, then this is no longer a movie, but read that abstract painting.
And asking abstract painting questions about the logic of the plot is ridiculous.
In addition, even in this turbulent world, there is something permanent.
The battle whores from the first "City" still hold a circular defense against the forces of darkness besieging their native slums.
And the ghost of Detective Hartigan is a no-no, and will look at the light, and Bruce Willis is always a pleasure to look at.
The main problem with Sin City 2 is different.
Frank Miller was good because as a draftsman he talentedly combined comic book and noir, and as a director he turned the idea of how to transfer comics to the screen.
Comic book and noir are two aggressively opposed "realities".
The phenomenon of the comic in its modern form was born in the late 1920s, at the same time when Dashiell Hammett's novels Bloody Harvest (1929), The Maltese Falcon (1930) and The Glass Key (1931) created a canon of noir, then called the hard-boiled school- "cool school".
Well, or pulp fiction.
Comics have given Hollywood many dozens of heroes: from the sailor Popeye - the spinach eater, who gives him heroic strength, Superman, Batman and detective Dick Tracy to the Hulk, Thor, Spider-Man and other "avengers".
But in any movie based on comics, there was something flawed: the drawn characters stubbornly did not want to overgrow the screen flesh, remained pretenders in the "real" world around them willy-nilly.
Simply put, they were completely devoid of "existence."
Noir, on the other hand, is the most existential genre of world literature.
After the World Wars, the traditional novel – with experiences, characters, family scandals and historical background – lost all credibility.
What Kind of Forsythes, what Thibault and Rougon-Makkar, which even Bolkonsky and Rostov are even conceivable after Verdun, Auschwitz and Hiroshima?
Such a novel peacefully mutated into the format of a soap opera, and a criminal - that is, by definition marginal - novel rose to the level of philosophical prose.
Hammett learned from his own skin what it was like to work as a nurse at the front.
He was a communist.
As, by the way, were at least close to the Communist Party and such pillars of the genre as writers Horace McCoy and Jim Thompson, directors Jules Dassin, Joseph Losey, Edward Dmitrik.
Therefore, the noir, the archetype of which they have set, is firstly rude and cynical, and secondly, it is purely social.
It's almost an American version of socialist realism.
The first Sin City was remarkable precisely because it unnaturally but organically combined the comic with noir.
For the first time on the screen, the comic came to life, not at all ashamed of its graphic nature, and did not pretend to be a "real" film.
The darkness of a corrupt world, where a cardinal ordered assassinations and a senator covered up a monstrous sadistic son, was well worthy of Hammett's pen.
And picturesque details like the severed heads with which the sadist decorated his nest, the pen of the brilliant James Ellroy, the author of "Black Orchid" and the best - that is, declaratively nauseating - representative of the neo-noir.
Sin City 2 is not even a digression, but a capitulation of Miller--Rodriguez's radical style to the comic book tradition.
Probably, this was largely due to 3D technology.
When you watch the second "Sin City", you feel yourself imprisoned in a glass ball, inside of which the snow fills the toy cloaca.
However, most often it is not snow, but bloody scum, but by and large, what is the difference?
Well, there is nothing to say about sociality.
After all, it is possible only when somewhere, somewhere in our country sometimes, albeit on the side of a dirty swamp, but there is a normal world where you can return a girl who walked along a crooked path or, say, tell inconsolable parents that her destroyer is punished.
When there is no place for anything but sin in the city of sin, then sin is no longer a sin, but the norm.
Boring as any norm.
The chaos of Sin City 2 is just boring.
To be fair, the domestic rental gave this bland sin a small but peppercorn.
The credits warn that the film contains harmful smoking scenes.
In relation to the spectacle, in the most vegetarian episode of which a person's fingers are broken with tongs, it smacks of hellish humor.
Hammett would have liked it.
France's Socialists must "shut up and put France in order," says Frasois Hollande's key ally
Mr. Wall called on the deeply divided left to "demonstrate a warm attitude" to the attacked Socialist president, whose reshuffle was not approved by the vast majority of the French.
The president deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It's our duty to stay close to him," he said, drawing applause.
As a gesture of reconciliation, the prime minister assured his government would not question France's controversial 35-hour work week despite conflict-fueling proposals it should loosen the rules made by Emmanuel Macron, the new economy minister, earlier this week.
On Saturday, Mr Hollande pleaded with his fellow Socialist Party members to remain "united" with the government.
However, Christian Tobir, the Minister of Justice, put spokes in the wheels by attending a meeting of dissenting members of parliament from the Socialist Party and criticizing the Socialist Party for allowing the French to "lose faith in the future."
Marine Le Pé, leader of the far-right National Front, expressed contempt for the constant internal conflicts among socialists, saying she had no idea that Walle's new government would last longer than a few months.
François Hollande is the naked king but naked and Prince Manuel Wall, forced to assemble a new government when the old one did not last even a summer.
"And the new one won't last the fall or the winter either," Ms. Le Pen told reporters.
She reiterated her party's call for the dissolution of parliament, saying she was confident the party could easily win early elections and was ready to govern.
France's ruling party suffered defeat in March's municipal elections, and the far-right National Front came first in THE EU elections in May.
A poll by Sunday's Journal du Dimanche found that 76 percent of The French believe the Socialist Party risks breaking up into several rival factions before the end of Mr Hollande's presidential term in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at The University of Siens Pau, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government failed to improve the economy and record unemployment.
"He's short on time, but public opinion needs to quickly sense that something is changing," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get even worse.
"Drug-Free City" was left without a lawsuit
The Sverdlovsk Arbitration Court left without consideration the claim of the Administrative Directorate of the regional Ministry for State Property Management to the Drug-Free City Foundation.
The agency intended to recover from the organization more than 7 million rubles. as a payment for the rental of a building in the center of Yekaterinburg.
However, the plaintiff failed to appear in court twice.
Today, the arbitration court of the Sverdlovsk region left without consideration the claim of the executive directorate of the Ministry for State Property Management of the region (MUGISO) to the drug-free city foundation (one of the founders is the mayor of Yekaterinburg Evgeny Roizman).
Representatives of the regional authorities intended to recover from the organization 7.3 million rubles. as a payment for the rental of the building.
Today it became known that the plaintiff twice failed to appear in court, which is why it was decided to refuse consideration.
Representatives in the DIRECTORATE of MUGISO could not explain the reason for the absence, the head of the legal department Maxim Titov did not answer the phone.
Representatives of the fund could also not be contacted.
Recall that we are talking about the mansion that occupied the fund in the city center on Belinsky Street, 19 free of charge since 2011.
This decision was made by ex-governor Alexander Misharin.
In November 2012, the Administrative Directorate of the Ministry for State Property Management of the Sverdlovsk Region filed a lawsuit with the Sverdlovsk Arbitration Court to evict the fund from the building.
According to the lawsuit, the department demanded through the court to recognize the contract of gratuitous use of the premises of the mansion-monument as not concluded.
According to the Directorate of MUGISO, the agreement did not contain significant conditions for the lease of the cultural heritage site.
The Sverdlovsk Arbitration Court rejected the claim, then an appeal was filed with the 17th Arbitration Court of Perm, which was satisfied.
Then, in the same court, the foundation filed a cassation appeal against this decision, which remained unsatisfied, after which the decision was appealed by the fund to the Supreme Arbitration Court, but the court took the side of the directorate.
In 2013, a new lease agreement was concluded, according to which the fund again began to pay rent, the head of the city Yevgeny Roizman told about it.
The rent was assigned 300 thousand rubles. per month.
The previous administration of the region gave us this building for free use, recognizing our merits in the fight against drugs, as a sign of respect for the fund.
The current administration has decided otherwise," he said.
Tatyana Drogaeva, Ekaterinburg
Why the mayor of Yekaterinburg was offered to leave voluntarily
On July 24, the deputy of the Yekaterinburg City Duma, United Russia Alexander Kosintsev, proposed to the mayor of the city - the speaker of the city Duma Yevgeny Roizman to resign.
The reason was the criminal case against oleg Kinev, a deputy of the City Duma, who was arrested on suspicion of murdering a pensioner, who is considered an associate of the mayor.
How Evgeny Roizman found a criminal case
On July 1, it became known about the initiation of a criminal case on the fact of "libel" (Article 128.1 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation) in the blog of the mayor of Yekaterinburg Yevgeny Roizman.
This was reported in the Ministry of Internal Affairs in the Sverdlovsk region, where the general director of the legal center "Protection"" Anna Filatova appealed with a corresponding statement.
According to her, Mr. Roizman accused her in his blog entries that she was involved in crimes that her ex-husband allegedly committed.
The mayor of Yekaterinburg is convinced that "this is another attempt to avenge the truth."
iPhone will turn into a wallet
On the eve of September 9, when Apple should present its new developments, new leaks appear in the press about what can be expected from the presentation.
Citing sources, US media report that the sixth generation iPhone will be equipped with a mobile wallet function as a result of a joint project of Apple and payment systems Visa, MasterCard and American Express.
According to Bloomberg and the specialized Internet resource Re / code, at the presentation of new products on September 9, Apple, among other things, may announce a joint project with Visa, MasterCard and American Express, as a result of which the mobile wallet function will be available in the new iPhone 6 smartphone.
The companies themselves decline to comment on the matter.
This function allows you to make a payment at the checkout of the store using a smartphone.
Identification of the payment will be carried out by the user by his fingerprint using the Touch ID function.
It is reported that the iPhone will for the first time built-in technology NFC (near field communication), which allows you to make contactless payment using a smartphone and the corresponding reader at the checkout.
The NFC technology itself will be available thanks to a special microprocessor from the Dutch high-tech company NXP (formerly Philips Semiconductors).
For the first time, the NFC function was introduced back in 2004 as part of the cooperation of Sony, Nokia, Philips Semiconductors and more than a hundred other companies that were part of the so-called NFC Forum - an association for the promotion of this technology.
The first NFC phone was released by Nokia in 2006.
The first Android smartphone with NFC function - Samsung Nexus S - was introduced in 2010.
In May 2011, Google introduced the Google Wallet system, which allows users to link bank cards to their Google account and pay using an Android smartphone.
However, American experts emphasize that, despite the large investments of high-tech companies in the promotion of NFC technology, American retailers are still cautious about the innovation and are not too willing to spend money on equipping their stores with such systems.
Therefore, now observers hope that Apple's entry into this market will still force retailers to accelerate and more actively introduce this technology in their retail outlets.
French Foreign Ministry: Paris' position on the supply of Mistrals to Russia does not change
The official representative of the French Foreign Ministry, Romain Nadal, announced the unchanged position of Paris regarding the supply of Mistral-class helicopter carriers to Russia.
"I can recall the statement of the President of the Republic (Francois Hollande), made by him in an interview with the newspaper Le Monde on August 20: "Today, the level of sanctions does not prevent the delivery.
This is the decision of the Europeans, not France," RIA Novosti quoted Mr. Nadal as saying.
So the representative of the French Foreign Ministry answered the question of whether the deterioration of the situation in Ukraine will affect the change in the position of Paris on the implementation of this contract.

Norwegian Cruise Closes $3 Billion Deal with Prestige Cruises
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL. O, the world's third-largest cruise operator, is in the final stages of negotiations to acquire a similar company, Prestige Cruises International Inc, for about $3 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.
The deal would provide Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, with access to luxury cruise ships and wealthy prestige Cruises customers, as it competes with larger rivals Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL. N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
The agreement could be announced as early as this week, sources said on Sunday, warning that talks could still fail.
Owner of Prestige Cruises, private equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC (APO. N), also owns a 20 percent stake in Norwegian Cruise.
The sources asked to remain anonymous, as the negotiations are not open.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comment, while a representative of Apollo declined to comment on the information.
Norwegian Cruise, based in Miami, operates 13 cruise ships on routes spanning North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its revenue was $2.57 billion in 2013, up 13 percent from 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, operates under the Oceania and Regent brands, which together own eight cruise ships that sail to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported revenue of $1.2 billion in 2013, 6 percent higher than the year before.
The $29 billion cruise industry is expected to be favorably impacted in the coming years by the growth of the middle class in emerging economies such as China and India.
The companies are racing to position themselves as the cruise operators preferred by these new customers.
Prestige Cruises was registered with U.S. regulators for an initial public offering in January 2014.
Apollo became the company's major shareholder after an $850 million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was created as it exists today in 2000 in a merger with a cruise operator owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), an entertainment and casino conglomerate controlled by Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Tay.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise became a public company in January 2013.
Genting held a 28 percent stake, Apollo held a 20 percent stake and private equity firm TPG Capital LP held an 8 percent stake in the company, according to the end of June, according to reports.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise together account for 82 percent of cruise passenger traffic in North America, according to registration documents at prestige Cruises' first public offering.
TV and Radio Company "Crimea" may receive 250 million rubles of subsidies
The Ministry of Communications of Russia proposes to allocate 250 million rubles to the state television and radio company "Crimea" in 2014.
As follows from the draft resolution of the Ministry of Communications, posted on the single portal for disclosing information on the preparation of regulatory acts, subsidies are planned to be spent "to cover the costs of creating conditions for large-scale information coverage of the socio-economic situation and the development of the modern information space in the territory of the Republic of Crimea."
Also, the money will be used to purchase equipment, repair the roof and power supply systems in the building of the television and radio company, founded in 1959, RIA Novosti reports.
Activists of the democratic movement of Hong Kong disrupt the speech of the Chinese representative the day after the decision on the elections
A group of citizens loyal to Beijing stood nearby waving a Chinese flag.
The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on Sunday set out a procedure by which just two or three candidates would be allowed to take part in Hong Kong's 2017 presidential election.
All candidates must first receive the support of a majority of the members of the nomination committee, which is likely to be full of Beijing loyalists.
The decision makes it almost impossible for the democratic opposition to get on the ballot and led pro-democracy activists to renew their promise to stop Hong Kong's financial center with Occupy Central protests.
Political reform is a major source of tension in Hong Kong, as Chinese party leaders fear that the call for democracy will spread to other cities.
Following Beijing's publication of a document describing China's control over Hong Kong, in June, pro-democracy activists held an informal referendum on elections in the special administrative region, and hundreds of thousands took to the business center of the city and staged a sit-in.
Lee's briefing is organized by the Hong Kong government and the Chinese Liaison Office in Hong Kong.
Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Zhang Rongshong and Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Bureau of the State Council Feng Wei were also scheduled to address a series of briefings throughout the day.
Student activists said they would gather outside Hong Kong's prime minister's building in the afternoon.
Britain made no mention of democratic governance for Hong Kong until the final days of 150 years of its colonial rule.
Israeli authorities intend to annex 400 hectares of land belonging to the Palestinian Authority
Israeli authorities have announced that they intend to annex 400 hectares of land in the West Bank belonging to the Palestinian Authority.
According to the BBC, the decision to annex the land of South Bethlehem is connected with the desire to repay for the abduction and murder of three Israeli teenagers in June this year.
The Israeli Defense Ministry announced the seizure of territory on Sunday and instructed the military to establish administrative control in the West Bank.
According to the representative of the Gaza Strip, Saeb Ariqat, the world community should hold Israel accountable for "continued settlement activity in the West Bank and East Jerusalem."
Putin demands that Kiev begin negotiations on the "statehood" of eastern Ukraine
According to Russian news reports of his remarks, Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded on Sunday that the Ukrainian government end fighting separatists in the east of the country and immediately begin talks on the "statehood" of the breakaway region.
His spokesman, Dmytro Peskov, later clarified that Putin did not intend to insinuate that the separatist-controlled eastern Ukrainian territory would become part of Russia, but that its status inside Ukraine needed to be reconsidered to give the Russian-speaking region a chance to protect its rights and interests.
But Putin's call for the Kiev government to negotiate with pro-Russian rebels as equals was consistent with an apparent strategy he has followed since the bloodshed began five months ago: Help the separatists take territory and coerce the Ukrainian government into giving the newly proclaimed territory of Novorossiya de facto independence in order to get closer to Russia, not the West.
In an interview with state-run Channel One Television, Putin denounced the Ukrainian military campaign to regain separatist-held territory in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which were seized in March and April after Moscow annexed Ukraine's Crimea peninsula on March 18.
The Kremlin and separatists recently referred to the occupied territories as Novorossiya, or New Russia, a name that refers to the pre-revolutionary glory days of the Russian Empire.
Putin said anyone who believes peace talks will happen in the near future, when Ukrainian politicians begin campaigning for parliamentary elections on October 26 and while government troops attack peaceful settlements in separatist-held regions, is a "prisoner of illusions," ITAR-TASS reported.
"We must immediately begin meaningful negotiations and not only on technical issues, but also on the political structure of society and the state status of southeastern Ukraine, in order to respect the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskov said Putin's words about statehood were meant in the context of broader autonomy, which has been discussed for months with leaders in Kiev in an attempt to calm fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are in jeopardy.
Only the Ukrainian government can give the eastern regions the necessary autonomy, Peskov said.
This is not a matter for discussion between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because this is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict."
The Kremlin spokesman's intervention to correct the "misinterpretation" of Putin's words underscored the Russian leadership's decision to behave toward the separatist uprising in the east in a way other than the open seizure of Crimea, where the majority of 2 million people are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have to endure a much tougher battle to annex even the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of eastern Ukraine, since most of the 6.5 million residents are not Russian, and polls before the conflict began showed broad support for the desire to stay inside Ukraine.
The autonomy that Russian diplomats have discussed in international forums would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to determine trade agreements and foreign policy themselves, essentially handing over to the Kremlin actual control over territory that would connect Russia's main territory to Crimea.
The Black Sea Peninsula, annexed five months ago, is home to Russia's main navy, as well as commercial maritime establishments and historic seaside resorts.
In the regions between the Russian Rostov region and the Crimea, there are also mines, factories and foundries that produce the necessary equipment for the Russian army.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed during his inaugural speech on June 7 that Ukrainian lawmakers after new elections weigh constitutional amendments that would give the breakaway regions greater control over their finances and the status of languages.
However, his view of autonomy seems to be very different from that of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels that Moscow is accused of arming and inciting.
Putin's latest call for Kiev to negotiate with separatist leaders as equals followed new rebel offensives last week after Russian troops and tanks entered eastern Ukraine from a previously peaceful area along the Sea of Azov.
Russian-backed separatists have taken control of the town of Novoazovsk in an offensive that Ukrainian security officials say they fear is the start of a campaign to seize strategic coastal territory all the way to Crimea.
This has led to a massive civilian and military effort to fortify Mariupol, a steel port of 500,000 inhabitants that lies between Novoazovsk and a narrow passage to the Crimean Peninsula.
Poroshenko on Saturday addressed a gathering of European Union leaders in Brussels to call for measures to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We are approaching the point of no return," Poroshenko warned.
Thousands of foreign soldiers and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not take certain measures; the leaders called for a draft of more severe sanctions against Russia, which will be adopted in the event of any escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovaisk after two columns of Russian armored vehicles and 1,000 troops entered the Donetsk region last week to support struggling separatists, Colonel Andriy Lysenko, a spokesman for Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, told reporters in Kiev on Saturday.
The first of the 63 Ukrainian soldiers reportedly held in Ilovaisk as a result of the Russian invasion were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian airborne troops captured on Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lysenko said on Sunday.
Nude photo scandal grips Australian celebrities and Gaby Greco
Jeffrey Edelsten expressed his disgust at the hackers who may have stolen nude photos of his fiancée Gaby Greco and a whole list of Hollywood stars.
Hollywood is outraged after a series of candid photos depicting a naked Jennifer Lawrence hit the Internet as a result of a large-scale hacker scandal with celebrities.
The hacker responsible for this is said to have about 60 candid photos of "Hunger Games" star Lawrence and superstars, including models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michel and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Australian actors Theresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski and Melbourne-based Greco also allegedly had photos stolen in an iCloud leak.
There are 101 celebrity names on the list.
Edelsten, who proposed to Greco last month, told Confidential: "It's disgusting."
All private correspondence and photographs must remain private.
It's terrible that personal information can be stolen and sent to other people.
Greco, who is based in New York City, reportedly told a news website that the hacking was "shameful" and that those targeted "feel they have been invaded."
The hacker is believed to have 30 photos of Palmer with ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two shots of her lying by the pool with her breasts exposed.
Palmer's film work includes "Love and Honor" alongside Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, "Chuck" star Strakhovsky and "Forbidden Reception" actress Browning did not comment on the stolen photos yesterday.
A spokesperson for Lawrence told TMZ: "This is a brazen invasion of privacy."
Actor Seth Rogen expressed his outrage at the hacker, writing on Twitter: "Posting photos stolen from a mobile phone is actually no different from selling stolen goods."
Just from a legal point of view, you can't tolerate the publication of stolen photos.
A potential way to steal photos of nude celebrities has been discovered
Mass hacking of star accounts may have been made through a vulnerability in the Find My Phone application.
A potential scenario for the development of events was described by the resource The Next Web.
On the resource Github was published a script in Python, which allowed you to select passwords to the service Find My Phone Apple.
This service allows you to track the location of the iPhone.
To access it, the same bundle of login and password Apple ID is used as to access the Apple iCloud cloud, from which photos of celebrities were stolen.
The script allowed you to brute-force to find out the password from Find My Phone.
With this method, all sorts of combinations of characters are sequentially entered, starting with the most commonly used passwords.
The author of the script claimed that in the Find My Phone service, the number of password options entered is unlimited.
With the correct organization of the security system, after several unsuccessful attempts to enter the wrong password, the account should be blocked and inform the user about the hacking attempt.
Due to the vulnerability, users did not receive any messages about trying to guess the password to their account.
Hackers learned the password from the Apple ID and used it to access iCloud.
According to a message by a Hackapp user on Twitter, the vulnerability was discovered two days ago, on Saturday, and a scripting program was written to it to guess passwords.
At the moment, the vulnerability is closed: after five attempts, access to the service is blocked.
The resource contacted the user of Hackapp and he noted that the above-mentioned vulnerability is typical for many services, but noted that he has no evidence that such a vulnerability was used to access the account of the "stars".

On the Twitter of the Prime Minister once again appeared extraneous entries
While there is no solid evidence that a vulnerability in Find My Phone was used to steal photos, there has previously been a wave of malicious activity using the service.
Hackers seized control of the device and demanded a ransom from the owners.
In that case, Apple told the media that in this case, the security of the cloud was not compromised, but did not conduct investigations about how users lost their accounts.
In Russia, the Twitter of Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev was also previously hacked.
If the attackers gained access to iCloud in the manner described above, then the password to the account of the head of government in the microblogging service could be stored there.
The Next Web was unable to get Apple's comments about the vulnerability in Find My Phone.

The ICR stopped the investigation of the Tu-204 crash in Vnukovo
The Investigative Committee of Russia (ICR) terminated the criminal case on the fact of the crash of the Tu-204 aircraft of the Red Wings airline.
This was reported by the press service of the department.
The decision was made in connection with the death of the aircraft commander and flight engineer.
Forensic examination showed that the cause of the disaster was the increased speed of the approach to landing, the failure of the crew to perform standard procedures on landing, as well as the unintentional exit of the engines to increased direct thrust speeds.
The Tu-204 aircraft of Red Wings Airlines, following the flight Prague - Moscow, crashed on December 29, 2012 during landing at Moscow's Vnukovo Airport.
The aircraft rolled out of the runway and caught fire.

There were no passengers on board the aircraft.
After the crash, the transport prosecutor's office conducted an inspection in Red Wings, during which numerous violations were revealed.
In February 2013, the airline's license was suspended.

Anger turned out to be the most universal and functional human emotion.
Angry facial expression is biologically universal for mankind, and each organ and muscle group involved in its creation is not accidental, but is an additional means of expressing power and threat, scientists in Australia and the United States found.
They told about their discoveries in the journal Evolution and Human Behavior, and briefly about them can be read in a press release from the University of California at Santa Barbara.
Angry facial expressions — shifted and lowered eyebrows, outstretched lips, swollen nostrils — are the same in all cultures, and even children blind from birth who have never seen it do so, notes the study's lead author, Aaron Sell.
As part of a major research project on the nature of anger, scientists found that this emotion arose to effectively conduct disputes during conflict.
The more physical damage one person can cause to another, the more opportunities he has to dictate his terms, and he conveys this to the interlocutor with the help of anger.
Researchers have found confirmation of their other hypothesis: physically strong people are more likely to get angry and go to assault, consider themselves entitled to impose unfavorable conditions on others, and also prefer forceful methods of resolving conflicts to peaceful ones.
Starting from the fact that anger is primarily an "emotion of bargaining", scientists decided that the movements of each of the seven muscle groups that create an angry facial expression should present the angry individual as powerful and dangerous in the eyes of the interlocutor - and thereby force him to agree to his conditions as soon as possible in order to avoid conflict.
To test this hypothesis, the researchers simulated on a computer faces where each of the seven elements of the angry face was present or missing, and showed them to informants.
Although lowered eyebrows or a forward chin individually did not make the face angry, the person depicted with such features was recognized by the physically stronger participants in the study unanimously.
Human anger, as in animals, expresses a threat: an exaggerated manifestation of one's own power, forcing one to agree and submit.
A person inflates his nostrils and purses his lips for the same purpose as a frog that inflates or a baboon that shows off its fangs.
"Anger is "triggered" by the interlocutor's refusal to accept the situation, and the person immediately takes a form that most effectively demonstrates to the opposite side the consequences of this refusal.
But the most striking thing is that none of the components of the angry face is arbitrary, they all express the same thing, "said anthropologist John Tooby.
