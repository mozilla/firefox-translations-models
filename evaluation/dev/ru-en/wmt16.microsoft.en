The social card of a resident of the Ivanovo region is recognized as an electronic means of payment.
The amendments provide for the preservation of the privilege for travel in public passenger transport.
From September 24, the procedure for organizing preferential travel for citizens using the social card of a resident of the Ivanovo region is changing.
According to the press service of the Russian government in the Ivanovo region, the changes provide for the preservation of benefits for travel in public passenger transport and bring the scheme of mutual settlements on the social card in line with the requirements of Federal Law No. 161 of the Federal Law "On the National Payment System".
At the same time, the social card of a resident of the Ivanovo region is recognized as an electronic means of payment.
Accordingly, the conditions for its application change.
So, the replenishment limit is now set not in trips, as before, but in the amount of money, with the preservation of winter and summer periods - in winter no more than 400 rubles, in the summer - no more than 800 rubles for the current month.
Now the owners of the social card on the receipts issued in transport will need to track not the number of remaining trips, but the balance of funds.
The cost of preferential travel for citizens will be 1/2 of the tariff in force at the carrier.
The remaining half of the fare is reimbursed by the regional budget.
The schedule of replenishment of the social card with funds remains the same - in the period from the 24th day of the previous month to the 23rd day of the current month.
The new order of travel on a social card will have a number of advantages.
So, it becomes possible to keep detailed records of spending money on a social card with an accuracy of up to a penny.
In addition, it becomes possible to return credited, but unspent funds.
We also add that the scheme of mutual settlements with carriers becomes transparent, since now half of the fare is paid by a citizen, and exactly the same amount is reimbursed to the carrier by the budget.
No commission will be charged when depositing funds on the card.
In turn, Vasily Silkin, Deputy Head of the Department of Road Management and Transport of the Ivanovo Region, said that in 2014 more than 33 million trips were made in the region using a social card, in 2015 - almost 25 million trips.
In the regional budget, more than 470 million rubles are provided for the provision of preferential travel for citizens using a social card.
As of September 1, the amount of compensation for these purposes amounted to more than 312 million rubles.
During a call to 911, a teacher confesses to killing a friend
During the 911 call, almost without trembling, university lecturer Shannon Lamb told police that he had shot and killed his girlfriend and that officers were needed to come to their home.
Lamb stressed that there is a "dog" in the house who is alive but probably upset, and said that the contacts of the deceased's family members can be found in her phone.
Inside the house, officers found amy Prentiss's body and a note casually handwritten on a white piece of lined paper: "I'm sorry if I wanted everything back, I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who has ever loved me," the memo said, according to authorities signed by Lamb.
There was nothing to indicate that Lamb, who taught two online courses at Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had by then traveled 300 miles to the university campus, where police believe he shot and killed respected history professor Ethan Schmidt on the doorstep of his office.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said university staff learned of the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He reported that Lamb made that truthful call to 911 shortly thereafter.
By the end of the day, there will be one more victims: Lamb committed suicide as soon as the police surrounded him.
The day after the school shooting forced students and faculty to hide behind locked doors, law enforcement officers were still trying to put lamba's motives into one picture.
Information shared by investigators at both ends of the state, as well as students and staff who knew him, helped put together a portrait of the talented but possibly concerned teacher.
Students said they were looking forward to his classes.
Police in Gauthier, where Prentisse died, said he had no charges of violence or criminal charges.
Schmidt himself included Lamb in a book he wrote in which he expressed his appreciation for the "wonderful people" with whom he crossed paths in his teaching life.
Both taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences and History, which has 17 faculty members, and many students attended lectures on both.
At the same time, there were some prerequisites for the emergence of problems.
One student who spoke well of Lambe, Brandon Beavers, reported that he also seemed anxious and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Michael Sykes, reported that Lamb at the end of the 2014-15 school year told him about how he struggled with stress.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University to grant him sick leave, saying he had some kind of health problem.
This year, he has only taught two online courses.
Recent changes to university hiring rules meant that the doctoral degree that Lamb had worked so hard to earn would not have guaranteed him an automatic teaching position.
University president William LaForge said he knew nothing about the conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "obviously Mr Lamb had something on his mind."
These are questions that Lamb will no longer be able to answer.
Police attacked Lamb's trail after his escape from campus as he headed back to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb shot himself with a .38-caliber pistol in the backyard of the house, one mile south of his parents' home in the suburbs of Greenville, Mississippi, Washington County coroner Metel Johnson said.
His car with the engine running was still parked on the driveway.
It was unclear why Lamb came to the house, although Johnson said she believed he knew the people who lived in it.
Lamb grew up in those parts.
Lamb began working at the university, which has 3500 students in a city of about 12000, in 2009 and taught geography and pedagogy.
He received his Doctor of Education degree in the spring of the same year.
One of Lamba's longtime friends described him as an intelligent, charismatic and cheerful man.
Carla Harston said she was 15 and Lamba was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was a cool older guy who had been trying to teach her how to play the guitar for several years.
In those years, he enjoyed success with women.
All the girls melted when he was around," says Harston, now 40 and who lives in Jackson, a suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss had apparently been dating for some time at the time of the events.
During a call to 911, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there is no record of their marriage registration.
The couple had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in Gauthier in a brick house with the back of which overlooks the canal.
According to police, the dog is fine.
Prentiss's ex-husband, Sean O'Steen, said they divorced 15 years ago but remained friends, and that they have a daughter, who is now 19.
"She's completely depressed," O'Steen said of her daughter.
She and her mother were good friends.
O'Steen said he had not met Lamb, but had heard from his daughter Abigail that Lambe was interested in music and played the blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both performed at the same summer festival three years ago.
Then they played together from time to time at concerts.
O'Steen said his daughter writes music and sings.
Prentice was a nurse and worked online for various companies.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and part-time entertainment coordinator at the dimly lit bar The Julep Room on the outskirts of Gauthier, said the last time he saw Lambe and Prentisse was on the evening of Sept. 5, when Lamb finished playing guitar and harmonica for a few visitors.
Nothing suspicious was observed.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We had fun and made fun of each other.
I mean, they were both very witty.
Schmidt, the deceased teacher, taught seminars for freshmen and specialized in Native American and colonial American history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English teacher at the same institution.
He was married and had three young children.
He attended Kansas State University in Emporia and was president of the student fraternity and student government.
At the Delta State University campus in Cleveland on Tuesday evening, about 900 people, including university faculty, staff, students and community members, participated in a candlelight memorial ceremony.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the ceremony, during which the university choir sang the Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
Classes will resume on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
Today is the day of recovery.
Amy and Rogelio Solis report from Cleveland, Mississippi.
The report was assisted by Associated Press writers Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans.
The material was redacted in response to a police statement that Lamb's call came to 911 after Schmidt's murder, and because although Lamb spoke of Prentiss as his wife when he called 911, information that they were married was not confirmed.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer employees for the holiday season
Toys R Us says it won't hire as many employees for the holiday season as it did last year, with the toy and children's merchandise retailer saying it will give full-time staff and temporary employees the opportunity to work more hours.
The company says it plans to hire 40,000 people to work in stores and wholesalers across the country, down from the 45,000 who were hired for the 2014 holiday season.
Most jobs will be part-time.
The company said it will begin interviewing applicants this month and will increase headcount from October to December.
Although the holidays are still a few months away, the shopping season is getting closer, and companies are preparing to hire temporary employees in order to have enough staff in stores and on the sale, shipment and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox jokes about "dating" princess Diana
The premiere of the film "Back to the Future" was for Michael J. Smith. Fox is a grand event.
She was also notable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the cinema waiting for the arrival of the royal family, I noticed that the seat next to me was free, and then it dawned on me - Princess Diana would sit next to me," he said in the trailer for the upcoming documentary "Back in Time".
The film begins, and then it occurs to me that I am literally at arm's length and in one fake yawn from a date with the Princess of Wales.
Back in Time, a documentary about Back to the Future, includes interviews with Fox, Leah Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
The premiere of the film "Back to the Future" took place 30 years ago.
"For me," says Spielberg, "this is undoubtedly the greatest time travel movie ever made."
Back in Time will be available on VOD, DVD and select cinemas in October.
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says in response to Russia's military support for Syria that there is "no military solution" for the nearly five-year conflict, and increased armaments will only exacerbate violence and suffering for millions of people.
The UN chief again called on all actors, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban Ki-moon said at a news conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet with the foreign ministers of the council's five permanent members — the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France — during this month's General Assembly ministerial session to discuss Syria.
He expressed regret that disagreements in the council, as well as among Syrians and local authorities, "made the situation insoluble."
Ban Ki-moon called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity that they demonstrated in addressing the issue of the nuclear program on Iran, and in addressing the Syrian crisis.
8 Poll Results That Show Donald Trump Isn't Kidding
Some tried to label him a provocateur.
Others brushed it off, taking it as a joke.
And some demand a scandal.
But no matter how hard some Republicans try to shake Donald Trump's high position in the polls, they haven't (yet).
Ten of the last 11 national polls have shown Donald Trump's double-digit lead, with some starting to seriously ask what that means for the real estate mogul in terms of the chances of winning the nomination.
Of course, this is only the beginning of the election cycle.
None of this means that Trump has a chance to be nominated by the Republican Party.
Experts point out that at this time in 2011, Rick Perry was inferior to the increasingly popular Herman Kane, none of whom won even one state in the nomination process.
And there are plenty of reasons why he would fight in a general election.
But outside groups such as Jeb Bush's Super Committee on Political Engagement and the economic conservative group Growth Club recognize Trump's unrelenting power and begin to pull out their dollars to knock him over.
Here are some poll numbers that suggest that the real estate mogul isn't just an intermediate phase:
Likes ratings for Trump turned 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a Monmouth University poll found that only two in 10 Republicans had a positive view of the real estate mogul.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
In early August, it was 52 percent.
Right now, six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion.
And all these indicators prevail in the initial stages.
A Quinnipiac poll in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans there have a positive view of Trump.
Two-thirds of those who voted for the GOP would suit Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll conducted last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would either be "enthusiastic" or "satisfied" if Trump became a candidate.
Only two in 10 say they would be "upset" if he became a candidate.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they would be "enthusiastic" versus 40 percent of those who say the same thing about Trump).
Next level of delight?
Marco Rubio, who has only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republicans say they will be "dissatisfied" or "upset" if establishment favorite Jeb Bush becomes the candidate.
Most Republicans don't see Trump's temperament as a problem.
While Trump is widely criticized for his bragging and insulting, 52 percent of Republican-leaning voters across the country think the tycoon has the right temperament to be president, an ABC News/Washington Post poll on Monday showed.
The same figure appears at the nation's first closed-door meeting in Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he's the kind of person who could be the commander-in-chief, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Still, 44 percent think he's not the kind of person who can be effective in office, and nearly six in 10 independent voters say his temperament isn't right for the White House, according to the ABC/Post.
Republican voters are getting used to this idea.
When they put on their expert hats, Republican voters think Trump is serious.
Asked who the most likely GOP winner is, four out of 10 said Trump was the favorite, according to a CNN/ORC poll last week.
That's no longer the case when four out of 10 bet on Jeb Bush in late July.
Full Disclosure: GOP voters didn't have the right magic crystal before.
At the same time in the last cycle, four out of 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry as the most likely candidate, while only 28 percent supported possible candidate Mitt Romney.
Still, it shows that plenty of GOP voters find Trump's campaign compelling.
Even if Republicans rallied around another candidate, Trump is still ahead of everyone else.
Some pundits point out that such a spread is likely to play for Trump's advantage, and at the same time those who do not support Trump are evenly distributed among those who support more than a dozen other candidates.
But a monmouth University poll in early September shows that in a hypothetical one-on-one competition between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump almost always gets majority support.
He is 13 points ahead of Carly Fiorina, Marco Rubio by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points and finally Rand Paul, John Cassic and Chris Christie by 33 points.
He has a draw with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who bypasses him?
Ben Carson overtook the businessman by as many as 19 points in a hypothetical one-on-one competition.
Just over half of Donald Trump's supporters say they've changed their minds.
A new CBS/NYT poll conducted Tuesday shows that only more than half of trump-supporting voters say they are confident in their votes.
Obviously, a lot can happen and make a difference, and no one can really say that he will never change his mind.
46 percent say they leave the door open to other candidates.
Still, Trump's fiercest competition so far is with fellow outsider neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they've changed their minds are likely to choose Trump.
Six in 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "rapists" two months ago in his campaign speech, the topic of immigration has become the most relevant in conversations in 2016.
Some worry that Trump's posturing will turn key Hispanic voters away from the Republican Party and prevent rebranding.
But according to an ABC/Post poll conducted Monday, six in 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
So as long as immigration gets everyone's attention, it looks like Donald Trump will remain in the same position.
Frustration with the government is gaining momentum.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now counting on the support of about half of Republican voters, mainly because of their status as outsiders.
A number of 10 Republicans on Monday's new ABC/Post poll say they want a political outsider rather than someone with experience in government.
And they're also resentful of Washington.
A Des Moines Register/Bloomberg poll in Iowa conducted two weeks ago shows that three out of four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated with Republican performance in Congress, with 54 percent "dissatisfied" and 21 percent "furious."
The government will decide the fate of indexation of pensions in October.
Deputy Prime Minister olga Golodets said that the government is now looking for options for implementing the law on indexation of pensions in 2016 to the real level of inflation, RG reports.
She noted that a solution should be found by October 8, by the time the draft budget for next year is submitted to the government.
In addition, the Cabinet of Ministers is discussing the option of prolonging the decision to freeze the funded pension of Russians.
Golodets noted that the amount of pension savings is equal to 350 billion rubles.
Approximately the same is the indexation of pensions in full for the next year.
According to the Deputy Prime Minister, there is no final decision on the issue of who should pay contributions for non-working citizens.
Golodets believes that if a person does not work on his own initiative and does not belong, at the same time, to socially unprotected categories of citizens, it is not entirely fair that society pays for him.
Earlier, the media reported that the Cabinet of Ministers is considering two options for balancing the state budget.
Why are eyelids often irritated and reddened?
Answers ophthalmologist Tatyana Levashova:
Our eyelids are screens that protect the eyeball from the many small particles that settle on them.
Forgetting about the regular cleaning of the eyelids, we often contribute to the development of blepharitis.
The solution is simple:
do not rub your eyes with dirty hands, carry a special wet wipe for the eyelids;
at least 1-2 times a day, clean the edges of the eyelids from harmful substances accumulated in them during the day.
Cleansing procedures are useful to supplement with warm compresses with decoctions of medicinal herbs (sage, chamomile), thinning the thick secretion of the sebaceous glands, and then massage the edges of the eyelids, which should be carried out in a circular motion of the fingertips;
when washing off makeup, do not use alcohol-containing products.
They dry and dehydrate the skin and contribute to an even greater thickening of the secretion of the sebaceous glands.
Pyongyang claims that Korean nuclear scientists have created a nuclear warhead.
North Korean authorities said the country's main nuclear reactor, the Yongbyon nuclear complex, was operating "at full capacity."
A message about this appeared on the website of the Central Telegraph Agency of the country.
It is noted that the DPRK at any time is ready to respond to the "aggression and nuclear threat of the United States," and also that the country has improved its nuclear weapons "both in quantity and quality."
The last test of nuclear weapons was conducted by the North Korean authorities in 2013.
At the same time, plans to resume the full operation of the reactor have not been reported since then.
Pyongyang claims that it managed to create an atomic warhead.
Also, the DPRK has repeatedly tested medium- and short-range missiles, writes polit.ru.
Zhirinovsky demanded to remove from the Russian anthem the mention of fraternal peoples.
LDPR leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky believes that the mention of the union of fraternal peoples should be removed from the national anthem.
He said this during a meeting of the State Duma, the Russian News Service reports.
Who are these peoples now?
Fascists and murderers!
"A very long anthem, the longest in the world, even athletes can't stand it," Zhirinovsky said.
The deputy believes that it is necessary to remove all the quatrain, which contains this line:
In the summer of 2014, Zhirinovsky said that the current anthem should be changed to "God Save the Tsar", and the Russian tricolor should be replaced by an imperial flag, polit.ru writes.
Assad called on all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad called on all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Assad is confident that if Europe wants to cope with the problem of refugees, then they must stop supporting terrorists in the Middle East.
The question is not whether Europe accepts or does not accept refugees, but that the root causes of the problem must be addressed.
If Europeans are concerned about the fate of refugees, let them stop supporting terrorists.
This is our opinion on this issue.
"This is the essence of the refugee issue," he said in an interview with RT.
We must continue the dialogue in order to reach consensus.
However, if we want real success, it is impossible as long as people die, as long as the bloodshed continues and as long as people do not feel completely safe.
"So we can reach a consensus, but we can't implement anything until we defeat terrorism in Syria," Assad said.
Recall that about 500 thousand migrants arrived in the EU countries this year, including from Syria.
The European Commission said that the current migration crisis in the world is the largest since the Second World War.
It is possible that among the migrants arriving in Europe there may be thousands of militants of the extremist group "Islamic state".
Members of a terrorist organization banned in Russia can use the situation to create their own cells in the EU to conduct terrorist activities.
Residents of the German city arranged a holiday for refugees.
Over the past month, Germany has become a leader in hosting refugees, although it has recently stepped up border controls to contain their influx.
Authorities estimate that about 800,000 migrants will arrive in Germany by the end of this year, although some experts cite significantly larger figures.
Since the beginning of September, more than 90,000 refugees have already arrived in the country.
BBC correspondent Jenny Hill visited the city of Darmstadt, whose residents give migrants a very warm welcome.
Jeremy Corbyn will make his debut in the session of questions to the Prime Minister
Following mr Corbyn's election, his debut in the Session of Questions to the Prime Minister is very much awaited.
The new leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, will soon address the Prime Minister's questions session for the first time, facing David Cameron for the first time.
Mr. Corbin will address the first of six questions in the afternoon; his speech is likely to be closely watched by the press and Labour MPs.
He called for "less theater and more facts" at a weekly demonstration speech.
He also said that he could skip some meetings, leaving them to colleagues.
The meeting will be Mr Corbyn's first parliamentary test as a leader; it will come after his appointment of a shadow cabinet and his speech at the annual Trade Unions Congress on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader's decision to stand silent during the performance of the national anthem at the service on Tuesday, during the celebration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain, has drawn criticism from a number of Conservative MPs and has been the subject of several editorials in newspapers.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he had "stood in respectful silence" and recognised the "heroism of the ROYAL AIR Force in the Battle of Britain".
However, Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet member Owen Smith told BBC 2 Newsnight that he would advise the Labour leader to sing the national anthem "regardless of" his belief in the need to abolish the monarchy.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers have refused to play on Mr Corbyn's team, voicing differences over economics, defence and international politics, while less than one-sixth of the parliamentary party's members have backed him as leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says political differences are also "piled up" in labour following Mr Corbyn's appointment to a position in the European Union and the government's restrictions on compensation payments.
Mr Corbyn told a trade union conference that the Labour Party had made amendments aimed at abolishing the very idea of restrictions altogether.
Hours later, Mr Smith, the shadow minister for labour and pensions, said there was "complete clarity" within the party that it had been in opposition only to the government's plans to cut the ceiling from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron will meet at the courier box in the last ten years since becoming leader of the Conservative Party.
The Labour leader, who has promised a different approach to politics, says he has "enlisted collective resources" to recruit ideas for Mr Cameron's questions and has received more than 30,000 proposals.
Islington North MP said the Prime Minister's questions were too confrontational and that he would refrain from witty answers and the exchange of barbs, instead promising to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Mr Corbyn said Angela Eagle, the economy minister in the shadow cabinet, would replace him on prime minister's questions when he was absent – such as when Mr Cameron was abroad.
He also floated the idea of letting other colleagues take the floor whenever possible, saying he had reached out to House of Commons Speaker John Bercow to discuss the issue.
After becoming leader in 2005, Mr Cameron said he wanted to move away from the political style of "fair prank" often associated with the prime minister's questioning procedure, but admitted a few years later that he had failed to do so.
Since the first broadcast in 1990, questions to the prime minister have become a key indicator of a leader's views, their ability to govern the House of Commons and the reputation of other members of Parliament, although critics say this has become a caricature and requires far-reaching reforms.
"Shot in Joburg" Homeless young people trained as photographers
Johannesburg's business hub is a challenging place for the homeless.

Pound sterling grows as wages rise in the UK
The pound rose against the backdrop of rising wages in the UK, while the FTSE 100 index rose thanks to the offer to buy SABMiller.
From May to June, earnings in the UK, net of bonuses, increased by 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
The growth rate was the highest since 2009, and was met as an earlier postponement of forecasts for a possible increase in quotations.
The pound rose more than 1% against the dollar to $1.5505, and 0.84% against the euro to €1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index rose to 6229.21 by 1.49%.
SabMiller shares stood out against the general background, which grew by 20% thanks to a purchase offer received from competitor AB InBev.
The deal would combine the world's two largest brewing companies, bringing together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares rose 0.9% amid encouraging news from rival luxury goods group Richemont.
Richemont's latest sales figures beat all expectations and showed that sales in China – a key market for Burberry – have started to pick up again.
Shares of Glencore rose 5% after the mining giant said it had raised $2.5 billion by offering shares as part of a debt-reduction strategy.
Shares of The Paper and Packaging Materials Group Mondi were the biggest drop in the index - by 4.3% - after Goldman Sachs downgraded the group's rating to "sell".
Shares of JD Sports rose after the sportswear company reported an 83 percent rise in profit before tax in the six months to 46.6 million pounds.
JD Sports chief says higher salaries could hinder expansion
JD Sports chief executive Peter Cowgill says raising the minimum wage for British workers means "more purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers".
But it's unlikely that such purchasing power will outweigh the increase in the cost of labor, he says.
The costs could have weighed on plans to expand JD Sports, he added, which could mean fewer additional vacancies.
Metcash Launches Bottom-Up Initiative Campaign to Fight Aldi Onslaught
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from the onslaught of Aldi in South Australia and Western Australia.
A wholesale food supplier has launched a grassroots initiative campaign to protect the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in light of Aldi's upcoming $700 million infusion.
As Aldi prepares to open two wholesale warehouses and the first of 120 stores in South and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening relationships with local food suppliers and promoting the IGA brand through marketing on leading media and social media and at events such as the Adelaide Show.
The campaign is joined by IGA retailers and suppliers, such as Dunsborough-based ice cream maker Simmo's, which offers tastings in IGA stores, and shopkeepers selling tickets to South Australian Football League matches at a discount to regular customers.
Metcash is expected to reveal more details of its protection strategy on Sept. 29 , the day this wholesale supplier of food, spirits and household goods will hold its annual Investor Strategy Day.
A lot is at stake, as in South Australia and Western Australia, IGA-branded stores make up almost 30% of all Metcash stores and show higher profitability than the Metcash IGA chain in the eastern states.
Shoppers in South and Western Australia are known as sticklers of familiar routes, so the market here is more favorable to IGA retailers than in the states of New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland – more than 30 percent in SA and 24 percent in WA compared to about 14 percent in the eastern states.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will take 5 percent of the food market in these two states within 12 months of opening its first stores, taking sales volume from all players present, but mainly from independent retailers.
In a report released this week, Tom Kirat, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, estimates that IGA retailers could lose $360 million in sales for the year and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
The forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA next year, achieving sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in these markets, respectively.
Loss of revenue and food sales at a high level of Metcash fixed costs could cost the company about 13 million in pre-interest and tax revenues, Mr. Kirat said.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly due to Aldi and Coles, and this despite the fact that a recent study by Morgan Survey found that the IGA has the most loyal buyers.
Morgan Stanley believes Metcash's food sales will fall 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, reducing the company's market share from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, top fund manager Hamish Douglass, founder of Magellan Financial Group, remarked to attendees at a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash "could highly likely disappear within a decade.
Metcash declined to comment publicly on Mr Douglass' comments.
But a member of Metcash's board of directors is believed to have contacted Mr Douglass last week.
IGA's market share has declined from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010, and Metcash's revenues from its food business, which the company supplies to approximately 1200 IGA retailers, fell by 43 percent compared to 2012 due to operating deleveraging and pressure on sales and profitability.
However, the company is not giving up, spending more than $150 million annually to equalize retail prices with prices in Coles and Woolworths on a thousand positions weekly and helping IGA retailers remodel marketplaces, as well as offering a rapidly expanding range of fresh produce and a wider selection of branded food.
Metcash CEO Ian Morris says price equalization and retooling of retail space is gaining momentum, and hopes the company will achieve an increase in net profit in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by Tennis Australia President Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves honor, not criticism for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was indirectly hurt in the recent scandal surrounding his friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves more credit than criticism for his behavior, tennis australia president Steve Healy said.
Kokkinakis, the youngest in the talented duo and often referred to as the "Special Ks," unwittingly found himself in the spotlight due to Kyrgios' embarrassing altercation with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
Shortly thereafter, during a heated qualifying match in Cincinnati, the referee on the tower had to separate Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison twice, with Harrison stating, "Wawrinka should have been laid on Kyrgios' shoulder blades, and I should have laid on this guy's shoulder blades."
Ever since Kokkinakis was last seen breaking a racket after a cramp in his leg saved Richard Gasquet from a possible defeat at the US Open, Healy has been a loyal defender of Kokkinakis.
The youngster is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth for the right to be second to Bernard Tomic in singles in the Davis Cup semi-final against Great Britain.
"I am acutely worried about one thing, namely that Thanasi was dragged into the conflict," Healy said.
He did break his racket when he had his leg in the US Open, but he's not the first player to break a racket when hopes were dashing, and I know Thanasi well enough to be sure he wouldn't be proud of it.
But he actually handled himself very well in some pretty provocative situations on the US, with Harrison, etc., and I'm sure he's trustworthy.
He's surrounded by a great team, he's got a great family, and I just think he's been treated a little bit unfairly.
He's a very mature 19-year-old, he works hard, he fits perfectly into the team, he's never had a problem with other players, he's respected off the court, he trains intensely, he's in great shape, he's a very dedicated and developed young man, and I think he should be appreciated.
Healy also backed the decision to forgive Kyrgios for an important match starting Friday, believing "mutual consent" to be the right way out for everyone but hoping the Canberra guy would return to the team as a long-term player.
"First of all, we want the team to focus entirely on the match and not on the arguments around [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
And I think Nick gained strength very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray prove, he's growing up in front of the public, he's made a number of serious mistakes and deserves all the criticism that he's getting, but we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and it's necessary, I think, to get him out of the spotlight for a while.  so that he can reflect on them, and that's best for the team and best for him.
Migration crisis in Europe: Hungary declares a state of emergency, closes the border, detains migrants
After declaring a state of emergency, Hungary on Tuesday closed its border with Serbia at its southern border and is detaining those trying to enter the country illegally to stem the flow of migrants in.
There were riots at the border - hundreds of migrants gathered in the border area, to which the Serbian authorities reacted sharply negatively.
Stranded indefinitely on a stretch of road between the two countries' checkpoints, people fleeing armed violence in their homeland set up tents and settled in the area.
However, discontent grew.
When a police helicopter circled over them, the migrants shouted "Open the border!" and shouted insults at the Hungarian special police.
Some refused food and water in protest.
Serbia's foreign minister has declared it "unacceptable" to expel migrants back from Hungary as more and more of them arrive from Macedonia and Greece.
Serbia wants to be part of the solution, not collateral damage.
It is necessary to hold talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days," Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The unrest on the Hungarian-Serbian border began a day after a bloc of 28 countries failed to develop a common immigration policy at a joint meeting in Brussels.
The ministers agreed to bear overall responsibility for the 40,000 asylum seekers in overcrowded Italy and Greece, and expressed the hope that in the future (next month or by the end of the year) an agreement will be reached whereby EU member states will accept an additional 120,000 refugees, including refugees from Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday demanded an emergency EU summit next week to discuss the immigration crisis sweeping the continent.
Hungary, however, does not hope for quick action from Brussels or its neighbors.
A state of emergency declared on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more authority to act on the crisis, allowing them to block roads and speed up asylum cases.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjártó said his country was also planning to erect a barbed-wire fence on a section of the border with Romania to block the flow of migrants through the country, now that it had finished the fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie Dagata reported that even prisoners were involved in the urgent work of completing the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
Over the past few months, Hungary has become the main bottleneck and crossing point of the EU border for displaced persons, many of whom are refugees - victims of wars in Syria and the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban insists that the majority of people arriving in the country are economic migrants seeking a better life, and not refugees - victims of hostilities who are entitled to protection, and this view is sharply at odds with the opinions of other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force in Hungary at midnight, now make it a crime to cross or damage a 4-metre (13-foot) barbed-wire fence built by the government along the southern border with Serbia, and also include longer prison sentences for those accused of human trafficking.
"Because of the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government is declaring a state of emergency," government spokesman Zoltán Kovács told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We make it clear: illegal border crossing is a crime.
Formally, parliament is still due to authorize the deployment of military forces, which is expected next week, but Associated Press reporters stationed at the border have been seeing the presence of heavily armed troops with vehicles and dogs for days.
György Bakondi, Orbán's national security adviser, reported the capture of 45 people trying to cross the border at the border itself, and another 15 inside the country.
They crossed the border by breaking down a fence, are currently in police custody and are accused of committing administrative violations under the new laws.
Authorities are quickly rebuilding the fence.
Hungarian authorities on Tuesday morning also closed two of the seven passages on the border with Serbia, bringing in a railway car wrapped in barbed wire to block one of the passages.
Riots broke out on the main passage across the border near the town of Rjoske, Hungary, as Hungarians placed a service room for people to pass inside a metal container and crowds of people crushed each other to break through.
About 20 people managed to get inside, while thousands of people remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway leading from Serbia to Hungary and announced the abandonment of food and water until they were allowed into Hungary.
2016 election: Hillary Clinton's advantage over Bernard Sanders halved in national poll
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for the nomination nationwide, but Sen. Bernie Sanders is catching up.
Clinton now has support at 47 percent among primary Democratic voters (down from 58 percent) and Sanders comes second with 27 percent (up from 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has yet to announce whether he is going to run for president, is receiving the support of 15 percent of primary Democratic voters.
More than five months before the primary rivalry begins, a majority of Democratic voters say it's too early to say they've decided on the candidate they will support.
Clinton supporters are more confident in their choice than those who support other candidates.
Since last month's CBS News poll, Clinton has lost the support of some demographic groups, and Sanders has secured some bonuses.
Clinton holds a large advantage among women and moderates, but that advantage has shrunk.
Her support among men has fallen significantly, and Sanders is only 5 points behind her.
The preference given to Clinton by Democratic voters under the age of 50 has disappeared, and he and Sanders are now on an equal footing.
However, Clinton still has a big advantage among older voters.
Last month, Clinton overtook Sanders by double digits among liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point advantage in that group.
Nearly half of primary Democratic voters across the country say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she became the party's nominee.
A quarter would support her with some reservations, and another 15 percent would support her just because she's a candidate.
Six percent would not support it.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, Clinton's current supporters are likely to be more enthusiastic about her.
Among those who do not currently support Clinton, views are more contradictory — only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48 percent of primary Democratic voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, fewer Republican voters say the same about their leader, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton supporters are asked an open-ended question why they want her as a candidate, the most popular answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), then that it's a time for a female president (13 percent), and that she's the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton supporters also talk about an association linking her to Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Also called a consensus on issues and the chances of being elected.
As the vice president ponders potential election participation, 57 percent of primary Democratic voters would like him to join the race — though a third believe he shouldn't.
When asked who they would like to see in second place among the party's candidates, primary Democratic voters in most cases name Biden.
Among Clinton supporters, more than half say they would choose Biden second, more than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the Democratic Nomination, Hillary Clinton's advantage over Sanders will increase from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the general election; however, that figure is down from 78 percent last month.
By this measure, Biden is in second place, but the percentage of those who consider him the most likely candidate has increased.
However, when asked what matters most about a candidate, Democratic voters choose options other than the chances of being elected.
Similar to last month's situation, none of the Democratic or potential candidates are an unacceptable nominee for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates, or potential candidates, performed well on some key characteristics among their party's primary voters.
Most consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be honest and trustworthy people with good leadership qualities.
Biden leads in honesty out of all three, and Clinton's strength is in her leadership skills.
Thirty percent of primary Democratic voters don't think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many as those who say the same about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent don't have a definite opinion about him.
Primary Democratic voters also generally see the ideological views of Clinton, Sanders and Biden as similar.
By all those standards, about a quarter of Democratic voters don't have any opinion of Sanders.
While questions about Hillary Clinton's email inbox and server continue when she was secretary of state, most democratic primary voters are satisfied with her explanation and believe it hasn't negatively affected their overall opinion of her.
But that's a different story for the American public as a whole.
Half of Americans today are dissatisfied with its explanation, and only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion on the matter was divided back in March, shortly after the story became known.
A majority of Americans say the email controversy hasn't affected their overall opinion of Clinton, though 36 percent say their opinion of her has deteriorated.
It's mostly Republicans, more than six out of every 10 who claim their opinion of Clinton has deteriorated.
Even though Clinton is considered honest and credible by her party's voters, this continues to be a problem for her among registered voters as a whole: only 32 percent consider her honest and trustworthy, eight points lower than last month, and 15 percent lower than in May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters do not consider it honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 registered voters across the country do not consider Trump honest and trustworthy.
Clinton and Trump both, however, get good marks in leadership qualities.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson and Bush are the best performers in honesty.
Most see Sanders as an honest man rather than not, but like Carson, many have no opinion of him.
The margin of error for a sample of 351 primary Democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
According to the results of the national poll, Ben Carson came close to Donald Trump
Ben Carson came close to Donald Trump in the latest CBS/New York Times poll
These two candidates won half the popular vote in the new poll, leaving everyone else in search of support under their feet.
Republican voters across the country continue to support Trump en masse, whose approval rate increased from 23 percent in a recent CBS poll conducted on the eve of last month's Fox News debate to 27 percent in a poll conducted Tuesday.
But Carson soared over the same period from 6% to 23%.
The poll also found that Carson enjoys support across demographics, pushing Trump into the group of College-educated Republican voters.
The rest of the candidates, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, fell back along with Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, whose support has fallen from 10% last month to 2% now.
Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio together come in third with 6%.
The margin of error for a sample of 376 Republican voters in this newest poll is plus or minus 6%, the poll was conducted in September.
A recent CNN/ORC poll released last week showed Carson's rise in the polls — showing 19% support among Republicans, followed by Trump with 32% support.
The latest ABC News/Washington Post poll also found that Trump is well ahead of Carson.
With support for Carson rising last week, Trump made several critical attacks on the former neurosurgeon, even as Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday during the campaign shutdown in Iowa.
Five fraternity members accused of death of Baruch College freshman
About two years after the death of a college student during an initiation ritual in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, a murder charge has been filed against five people.
"Members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity of New York's Baruch College brutally attacked Chan "Michael" Deng during an initiation ceremony in September 2013 and did not take him to the hospital on time, which led to his death," police said.
Officials say the blindfolded student with a 30-pound sand backpack behind his back was pushed several times as he tried to reach the goal while walking on a slippery surface.
Mr. Deng eventually complained that he had a headache and then fell unconscious.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity did not call 911 when Deng lost consciousness and waited for another presumably hour before taking him to the hospital, police said.
They did, however, take the time to change Deng's clothes, google his symptoms and contact Andy Meng, the brotherhood's national president, to ask for advice, police chief Chris Wagner told a news conference.
"At this point, members of the fraternity began to hide personal property, essentially putting the welfare of the fraternity ahead of Michael Deng's," Chief Wagner said.
He could not be saved and died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng suffered several blunt injuries to his head, torso and hips.
"Too many families have suffered as a result of the initiation rituals, as at least one student has died during them every year since 1970," Douglas Fireberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family, said in a statement.
The brotherhoods and their members must be held accountable, and this step on the part of the authorities is very important.
A Monroe County jury has leaned in favor of a third-degree murder charge for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members, including Mr. Meng, will be charged with rookie abuse and criminal conspiracy.
"We want to hold accountable not only individual participants, but if there is an organization that has authorized all this officially or unofficially, then so is it," Wagner said at a news conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned the fraternity, and the nationwide fraternity excluded the local branch from its structure.
What Happens When the Federal Reserve Raises Interest Rates
There will be a rate hike, and the bull market will stumble, bond yields will rise, and the economy will fall into recession.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long it will be before the offensive, and how long it will last.
Specifically for economics, history doesn't explain much about time.
The recession came just 11 months after the first rate hike and for as long as 86 months.
The Federal Reserve's rigidity in raising rates often, though not always, determines the response of the economy and financial assets.
That's why the U.S. central bank administration is so insistent that investors should not focus on when it starts raising rates, but on how long it will take to adapt.
In fact, there are a lot of variables in the game.
In the end, however, market participants may find that all the fuss around rate hikes turns out to be exaggerated.
"The first rate hike by the Federal Reserve with the onset of the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal of the end of the 'cheap money' era," said Julian Jessop, chief international economics officer at Capital Economics, in a commentary to clients.
On the contrary, we do not expect that the gradual return of US interest rates to more normal but still low levels will be the seismic impulse that many fear.
This does not mean, however, that there will be no consequences.
Here's a look at how some areas of the economy might have reacted depending on historical trends:
As the market has seen in the past month or so, expecting rate hikes can lead to volatility for a while.
When the rate is raised, however, the consequences are usually not as dramatic.
"It doesn't look like equity earnings are slowing down 12 to 24 months after the first jump, which again likely reflects a delay in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of the results of the Federal Reserve's rate hikes.
More specifically, the market has more often changed dramatically over the past 35 years — about 14 percent — upward rates, remained fairly flat for 250 days after that (average growth of 2.6 percent), then, after 500 days, returned to normal with an average return of 14.4 percent over the past six cycles, according to a recent analysis by Bob Doll, chief equity strategist at Nuveen Asset Management.  published in Barron's.
Deutsche says the outcome for securities tends not to immediately become more pronounced at the rate hike stage, and stock returns begin to decline.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but rate hikes often play into them.
In this case, the Federal Reserve is put in conditions that did not exist before and could accelerate a recession.
Basically, the gross domestic product will be almost at its lowest point in the entire existence of the increased rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, in 118 cases of rate hikes since 1950, only twice the nominal annual GDP has been below 4.5 percent.
Even though it was 3.6 percent in the second quarter of 2015, few believe it will last, despite holding up just 1.5 percent in the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Raising rates against such an unstable economic backdrop could be risky and raises the question "whether it will be different this time," Deutsche said.
Market participants have been preparing for a Federal Reserve rate hike all year round, with their eyes riveted on the Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve a rate hike at this meeting, futures trading suggests only a 25 percent probability.
"In our study since 1950, all rate hike cycles to date have been in a supercycle of increasing financial leverage at GDP, overlapping the peaks pre-recession very quickly after the recovery begins," the report said.
By contrast, it was an extremely slow recovery from the worst recession in the chosen period.
The current cycle so far is the longest the Federal Reserve has been waiting for since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, a total of 74 months and has not yet ended.
Fixed income has also become volatile while the market expects rate hikes, and this scenario is somewhat similar to the one being implemented for stocks.
The fundamental difference is that for bonds the effect will come faster than for stocks when the Federal System changes its strategic course.
In the case of bonds, it appears that yields change their vector immediately after the first rate hike/decrease in the cycle occurs.
At the end of the cycle of raising rates, bond yields immediately fall," Deutsche said.
Strategists at Charles Schwab believe the rate hike will bring long-term and short-term bond yield levels closer, making the curve flatter.
High-yield bonds often behave better in this climate, though "we're still wary of yield fluctuations," Katie Jones, a fixed-income analyst at Schwab, said in a study.
Interestingly, Jones believes that markets have already adapted to the expected results of federal system policy.
"In addition to the strengthening of the dollar and the fall in inflation expectations, there are signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy," she wrote.
Interest rates on short-term loans have risen, the yield curve is flatter, credit spreads have widened, volatility has increased – all market characteristics as federal system policies tighten.
Generally speaking, companies doing their main business in the U.S. will benefit from higher interest rates, and local products will become more attractive.
International companies with a lot of debt will be in a worse position, as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market space, and their debt more expensive - in the financial one.
"History shows that 'quality' stocks are performing above the market for three months after the initial rate hike," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report to clients.
Companies with a stable financial condition beat companies with unstable condition in the results of each rate increase in 1994, 1999 and 2004 by an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high returns on capital, as well as stocks with low volatility, also performed better than low-quality stocks, by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points), respectively.
Debt will be a big question.
Companies with high-interest floating-rate debt will lose the most, according to Goldman.
Beyond pure exchange trades, consumers will benefit from a rising dollar.
Savers could see returns also through higher returns, although experts differ on how quickly this will happen.
"BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM," says Conservative MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham criticises station for 'lowering standards'
Proves that it is becoming less and less distinguishable from a commercial competitor
Also targeting the BBC Music Awards, saying the award is just ripped off with Brits.
Parliamentary colleague Damien Collins, who lashed out at The Voice with the same criticism, was not original.
"BBC Radio 3 is turning into Classic FM," said the leader of MPs, prompting the broadcaster to prove that it was doing something that commercial companies were not doing.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC that it seems that the public radio station is "stupid" and becoming less and less distinguishable from its commercial competitor.
"Radio 3 seems — I don't like to use the word 'simplification' — but it seems to be turning into Classic FM," he said.
He also set his sights on the BBC Music Awards, launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which kicked off last year, looks like The Brits under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something different, here are the two examples that first came to my mind, in which you're really just copying what's already on the market," Mr. Bingham said.
The BBC's director-general has denied the allegations, arguing that BBC Radio 3 is going far ahead of its commercial rival when it comes to live music and audience education.
What I learn with Radio 3, I don't learn about classical music anywhere else.
And his dedication to live performances and making music doesn't really compare to anyone else.
"It's also really important, I think, radio 3's interest in finding new music and in promoting new works," he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 manager Alan Davey argued that the radio station has to work much harder to attract audiences than in the past because Britons are less educated in classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only brainchild of the BBC to be attacked for stepping on the heels of commercial rivals during hearings by a special Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
Tory MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice, a musical talent show that the BBC bought from Dutch side Talpa Media for an estimated £22 million.
See why this program is often discussed due to its lack of originality and distinctive features?
Lord Hall claims that the BBC 1 show, which features Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges, was made in "typical BBC style".
He added that he wants the Corporation to "find a hit in her own home stable" the next time she launches an entertainment project.
However, he does not consider it necessary to prevent the ordering of new seasons of The Voice in the future or the use of money by those who pay the license fee for other entertainment formats.
The growth of Internet sales slowed down as much as possible in August, and black Friday may be to blame for this.
The first three months of 2015 saw a seven percent increase in online sales.
Last month saw the slowest growth since it began in 2000.
Online sales intensified three years ago due to the use of mobile devices for shopping
Experts are convinced that November's Black Friday could help restrain spending
For about a decade, virtual shopping has been booming, turning many central streets in Britain into ghost towns.
But experts say there are now signs of online sales leveling off, after the latest data showed just a seven percent increase during the first three months of 2015.
Total spending on online shopping in August showed the smallest growth since they began to be recorded in 2000, an increase of only five percent.
Experts say there are now signs of online sales leveling off, after the latest data showed just a seven percent increase during the first three months of 2015.
"If you look at the growth rates in previous years and go back to 2000, they always found a reasonable explanation," Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index, told the Guardian.
He explained that online sales intensified three years ago when shoppers began using their mobile phones to make purchases.
This meant that even more people were able to buy online, and that they could do so in any setting, such as sitting on the couch.
But now it's coming to a plateau and you can see a decline (in growth).
The Black Friday phenomenon, which came from America, is mentioned as one of the reasons for the slowdown in sales.
Experts believe that buyers could refrain from shopping on the eve of the event, which takes place on the last Friday of November.
Last year, five times the average shopper rushed to their computers to take advantage of bargains, bringing down a number of sellers' websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, when buyers enter into a real battle for profitable purchases, could make people refrain from shopping.
According to a study published by the British Retail Consortium, just over £1 out of every 5 is spent online.
As for products such as televisions and washing machines, more than one-third of them are sold through online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online more willingly than in fashion stores on the main streets.
Muslims bury those killed in a crane fall in Mecca, and bin Laden's family has been sanctioned
Muslims carry the bodies of 29 dead through the streets as the first funeral begins in Mecca
At the same time, Saudi Arabia partially blamed the accident on the construction giant Saudi Binladin Group.
The health ministry said a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane collapsed.
Hundreds of Muslims from everywhere flocked to the streets to bury 29 of the victims killed in the crane collapse on Mecca's main mosque.
Dressed mostly in white, those present at the funeral flooded the roadway to pay homage to the first of the dead who set out on their final journey to the Al-Moaissem cemetery.
A sad procession passed by the sacred place, where just a few days earlier a construction crane broke through the ceiling of the mosque and fell on the parishioners.
The bodies were handed over for the funeral, and at the same time the King of Saudi Fined a construction company owned by bin Laden's family for the accident, in which 394 people were also injured.
The bodies of 29 worshippers killed in the collapse of a crane in the Main Mosque were carried through the streets
Among the dead was father-of-four Qasim Akram of Bolton, Greater Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage trip when a crane collapsed.
Mr Akram was at the Main Mosque with his parents before the start of the annual Hajj.
Saudi authorities have already promised that the Hajj to Mecca will continue as thousands of people continue to arrive in the city.
Today, King Salman said that binladin Group should not have left the crane boom raised when the crane was not working.
The Arabic version of the decree, published by the state-run Saudi Press agency, said Binladin Group bore partial blame for the collapse.
The English edition of the news agency did not disclose this detail, but reported that the leaders of the company were forbidden to travel outside the country.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to find out the reason for the fall of a crane in the courtyard of the Main Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims flocked to go on hajj this month.
Binladin Group made no statements about the collapse of the crane, and its representatives were not available for comment.
The royal decree also accused the company of not using modern safety measures and improper coordination of actions with the meteorological service.
Dozens of cranes surround the Main Mosque of Mecca, as part of a large-scale construction work being carried out by binladin Group.
Bin Laden's family has been close associates of Saudi Arabia's ruling family for decades and runs major construction projects.
The late al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was a traitorous son whom the family disowned in the 1990s.
The accident occurred with strong winds and rain just days before millions of people arrived in the kingdom to participate in the pilgrimage, which is mandatory at least once in a lifetime for every able-bodied Muslim.
Officials said 158 people remain in the hospital.
Officials have ordered the payment of one million rials (about £174,000) to the relatives of the victims, and the same amount to the irreversibly crippled.
The rest of the victims will receive half of this amount.
The head of B&Q claims that the trend is explained by the presence of Eastern European masters working for little money.
According to Veronica Laurie, the British are increasingly hiring repair specialists
The number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe is growing
The result is the opening of more than 200 new Screwfix stores for professionals
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q stores across the country
Author: Rupert Steiner, Chief City Correspondent for the Daily Mail
The British are said to put aside hammers and paint brushes, and instead hire qualified Eastern Europeans to do housework.
If you know how to handle a hammer or deftly paint walls, it seems that these days you are in the minority.
Because, according to the company that owns B&Q, the British are increasingly hiring specialist craftsmen to do simple housework.
Veronic Lori, the new CEO of Kingfisher, which owns a network of home improvement services, said that behind this trend is a significant influx of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe, offering services at the lowest prices.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open another 200 Screwfix stores specializing in products for craftsmen, and at the same time close 60 B&Q warehouse stores.
Ms. Lori said she would like to see more women on the staff of B&Q stores, as eight out of ten decisions about in-store purchases are made by the fairer sex.
Currently, the majority of staff are men.
According to her, it is impossible not to notice the latest demographic trends, characterized by the fact that the number of households consisting of single women who are more engaged in the arrangement of their homes than in the past is growing.
Ms Laurie said: "Our stores are still predominantly male.
Steps must be taken to achieve balance.
Overall, half of our customers are women, and 80 percent of the decisions on products purchased are made by women.
Women play an important role in the decision-making process.
Ms Laurie, one of five women at the helm of britain's leading companies whose shares count on the FTSE100 index, has also changed the composition of the top management team, achieving an equal number of men and women among directors.
Kingfisher is almost the only company in which exactly 50 percent of managers are women, including the CEO and CFO.
Ms Lori said: "It was a conscious decision, diversification is an important issue for us.
Finding suitable women on the board of directors was not difficult.
After the group took on the costs of closing stores, Kingfisher showed a decline in profits and sales volumes for six months.
As a result of this trend, Kingfisher, which owns the Screwfix and B&Q brands, opens 200 new stores.
Time to make a decision on the interest rate of the US Federal Reserve
The world is watching the Federal Reserve Bank's meeting, which for two days discusses the adoption of the most important decision - to raise the interest rate for the first time in a decade.
A Reuters poll of 80 economists found that just over half of those who thought the Federal Reserve would do so last week now believe it will wait and keep the rate at the current range of 0-0.25 percent.
This is a historic event, as it has been seven years since the Federal Reserve lowered the rate to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching the fact that the main bank can move from zero and begin the process of normalizing interest rates," said Angel Ubide, a leading fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy is operating efficiently, the economic recovery adds trillions of dollars to the balance sheet, and inflation is low.
However, the Federal Reserve cannot ignore how the decision will affect the global economy.
He warned the markets that they should prepare for changes, but everything suggests their confidence that all chances are against such a step.
The decision will be announced at 20.00 CET on Thursday.
The new Balkan route: refugees go to the EU via Croatia.
"Open it!" chanted hundreds of refugees at the Khorgos checkpoint on the Serbian-Hungarian border.
Since Tuesday, Budapest has closed the border for immigrants.
Asylum seekers are already beginning to probe other routes to the European Union.
One of them bypasses the closed border with Serbia lies through Romania.
The other , via Croatia and Slovenia — to Austria.
According to some reports, buses that carried refugees from Serbia to Hungary are now heading to the town of Šidu on the Croatian border.
Drivers were ordered by authorities to follow non-stop.
Serbian Interior Minister Nebojša Stjepanović assures that his country is doing everything in its power to help refugees, but its options are limited:
Our job is to secure Serbia as much as possible.
On the other hand, we must also help these people, ensure that they are treated humanely.
But this is a pan-European problem.
It is not easy to solve it, no country in Europe alone can cope with this, and even more so such a small country as Serbia.
Belgrade is asking Budapest to open the border to refugees who do not want to stay in Serbia.
But Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán is adamant:
If someone is called a refugee, in Serbia he must fill out the necessary documents for this.
And if he does not do this, then he will not be allowed into our country, because it is quite safe in Serbia.
Hungary has already erected a 175-kilometer fence on the border with Serbia.
But Orban does not intend to stop there: he plans to build the same barrier on the border with Romania.
Bucharest has already stated that this is incompatible with European principles.
Vangelis Meimarakis: "Europe wants to help us."
Vangelis Meimarakis has been a member of center-right governments for a number of years, which the left believes led the country to a financial crisis.
Now, having become the interim leader of the New Democracy party, he is challenging Tsipras.
A few days before the election, he met with a Euronews journalist.
euronews: Mr. Meimarakis, welcome to Euronews!
Vangelis Meimarakis: Thank you for the invitation.
euronews: Nine months ago, your party suffered a crushing defeat, losing to the Syriza coalition, but now, judging by the polls, New Democracy has caught up with it in popularity.
What has changed in that time?
Vangelis Meimarakis: Greece has changed, and so have we.
Mr. Tsipras lied a lot last January.
Nine months ago, Greece had a budget surplus and prospects for economic growth.
Now the country again has a budget deficit and a high unemployment rate.
Investors left because Mr. Tsipras chased them away.
Over the past nine months, Greeks have had the opportunity to assess the situation in which the country was in January and the false promises of Mr. Tsipras.
And now they can easily compare what was promised to what actually happened.
Daily life has become noticeably worse compared to January, when the situation was improving, and this applied to the majority of Greek citizens.
euronews: But you say that if you win the election, you will seek alliances with other parties, including Syriza.
Vangelis Meimarakis: The fact is that, as we have understood in recent years, Greece cannot move forward without understanding and cooperation.
It is no coincidence that in all other countries where rescue programs were or are still in place, political forces and all ruling parties came together to implement the program on which they had reached agreement without relinquishing their political or ideological autonomy.
That is why I firmly believe that, at this stage, only the cooperation of political forces and institutions will allow the country to move forward.
euronews: Your party voted in favour of the agreement between Mr Tsipras and the country's creditors.
If you become the new prime minister on Monday, will you abide by that agreement, or will you try to change it, at least in part?
Vangelis Meimarakis: In fact, we voted for Greece to move along the European path, because we are well aware of the disastrous consequences of the country's exit from the EU.
Now Europe is helping us by providing subsidies to our farmers for their products, we have solidarity funds, a Juncker package and assistance in the banking sector.
All of this would have been lost if there had been no treaty with Europe.
But the current austerity measures were the result of mr. Tsipras negotiating.
I know that Europe does not want to destroy us.
Europe wants to help us.
Thus, if Europe sees that the new Greek government wants to restore order during its first year in power, acts rationally and makes it clear that the country has a strong political will to implement the rescue program, then, I am sure, all the commitments made that cannot be fulfilled due to the fact that they lead to a recession can again become the subject of negotiations.  but only after a certain time.
It would be a mistake to believe that in the first year of the new agreement, we will be able to return to negotiations with our creditors, as they expect the full implementation of the agreement.
If we want to regain their trust, we must continue the privatisation, reforms and structural changes that have been agreed, while continuing to enjoy the benefits of EU funding and the great investment opportunities that we must open up for better understanding and cooperation with Europe.
Unfortunately, during the talks, the Tsipras government did not present any serious arguments on many key political issues, which we found out when discussing these issues with our European colleagues.
I can give an example related to the income of farmers.
We have explained to our European partners that this is not a fixed monthly income and therefore it cannot be fully taxed in advance.
We were told that Tsipras's ministers had never talked about it.
That is, the Greek ministers were not prepared and ill-informed, and therefore unsuccessfully negotiated and concluded an unsuccessful agreement.
euronews: "If you win the election, you will soon find yourself at the same table as Mr Juncker, Hollande, Mrs Merkel and other European leaders.
Will what you tell them be different from what your predecessor Antonis Samaras told them?
Vangelis Meimarakis: First of all, I will explain to them that until the end of 2014, we tried to implement the 2012 agreement in the best possible way, avoiding the sharp corners in it.
We have pushed forward with reforms.
Of course, we lacked the necessary determination and speed, but we acted in extraordinary circumstances.
The market fell, and there were no potential buyers willing to pay the price that suited the Greek government.
I was the speaker of the parliament at that time, I managed to agree on the opinions of the three parliamentary groups that then constituted the government majority.
And despite their serious ideological differences on key bills, we had a working parliament, and this in the presence of populists and extremists, as well as mass demonstrations taking place outside.
And we were able to bring the country into a normal situation that would have continued to improve had the process not been interrupted by the early general elections that resulted from December's presidential elections.
euronews: In recent weeks, a massive flow of refugees has been moving through the territory of Greece.
What do you think about this situation, and about the reaction of european countries to which these people aspire?
Vangelis Meimarakis: The refugee crisis is a ticking time bomb that we have to deal with after winning the election.
And the reason is that the Syriza government did not act in this situation as it should have.
In such matters, you should act proactively, because if the problem overtakes you, then only emergency measures remain.
And that's the situation we're in now.
Even the interim government that replaced Syriza did more in just seven days than Mr. Tsipras did in seven months.
I am confident that these actions of the interim government, which is provided with valuable assistance by the President of the Republic, who called for the EU summit, will make it possible to find a solution.
We need to see how many refugees will be able to leave the country, and note that refugees are not illegal immigrants.
These are the victims of the war in Syria, the victims of some extraordinary events that have happened to them.
There is a deeply humanitarian dimension to this issue, and we will stick to the position that European politicians should take in this new situation.
The corresponding decision should be taken at the EU summit, and the United Nations should also be involved.
We also need better coordination, more effective border controls and refugee reception centres.
We must also make effective use of the economic assistance we receive from the EU in order to be able to cope with this pressing problem.
euronews: Mr. Meimarakis, thank you for the interview.
Vangelis Meimarakis: Thank you.
In the peaceful city of Druzhkivka, Donetsk region, during the day, employees of the criminal investigation department of the Main Police Department of the region, together with military counterintelligence, identified and detained a suspect who turned out to be a 34-year-old Ukrainian soldier from the city of Kryvyi Rih (Dnipropetrovsk region), who the night before in the course of joint consumption of alcoholic beverages, and the conflict that arose in the village of Verkhnetoretske, Yasynuvatsky district of Donetsk region, shot his opponent with a machine gun.
The 22-year-old was reported injured from the hospital, where he was hospitalized with gunshot wounds to his legs.
According to Artem Vasitsky, deputy head of the criminal investigation department of the police headquarters of the region, in the course of operational actions, law enforcement officers proved the involvement of the defendant in another serious criminal offense - the murder of a 41-year-old resident of the same village.
Investigators found that on the same day there was a conflict between the suspect and another local resident, as a result of which he inflicted a fatal gunshot wound to the head of a man.
The Investigation Department of the Druzhkovka Civil Defense Department has opened criminal proceedings under the articles "Intentional murder" and "Intentional infliction of grievous bodily harm" of the Criminal Code of Ukraine.
The detainee faces up to 15 years in prison.
The defendant was detained and placed in a temporary detention center, the press service of the police of the Donetsk region reported.
Two residents of Novosibirsk, who painted several Soviet monuments in the colors of the Ukrainian flag, including two monuments to Vladimir Lenin, were sentenced to imprisonment by a Russian court.
Two more residents of the city were sentenced to restriction of freedom.
Residents of Novosibirsk who received prison terms were sentenced to 2.5 years and 2 years in prison.
Two other convicts received restrictions of liberty for 14 and 18 months.
The Lenin court of Novosibirsk found four citizens guilty of vandalism against lenin monuments, which were located on the territory of the regional committee of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation and on Krikotazhnaya Street, as well as the memorial complex "Monument of Glory".
In the latter case, a Katyusha rocket launcher and a T-34 tank were painted.
Recall that on the night of December 12 in the Russian Novosibirsk, unknown persons painted military equipment on the Monument of Glory in the colors of the Ukrainian flag.
The common-law wife of the popular Russian actor Evgeny Tsyganov Irina Leonova gave birth to her seventh child.
The girl was born in one of the Moscow clinics.
The newborn and her mother are doing well.
Recall that recently Tsyganov and Leonova broke up.
Eugene declines to comment.
Irina blames her husband and his ambitions for everything.
Evgeny Tsyganov is 36 years old.
He is an actor of the Moscow theater "Workshop of Pyotr Fomenko".
He is known for the films "Walk", "Space as a Premonition", "Brest Fortress", the TV series "Thaw" and "Fartsa".
On September 8, Evgeny Tsyganov was recognized as "Actor of the Year" and "Person of the Year" according to the Russian version of the popular GQ magazine.
The man who opened fire at Delta State University left an apology note
After the shooting and murder of his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning — and before he shot and killed his colleague later in the day — Shannon Lamb wrote a note saying he "regretted" the first murder and wanted to "get everything back," commissioners said Tuesday.
Police in Gautier, Mississippi, say a geography and social sciences professor at Delta State University called 911 around 10 a.m.
on Monday and reported that he had shot someone.
Lamb told the dispatcher that police needed to send people to his home.
He said, "I killed my wife last night, and also mentioned that there is a "dog" in the house who "won't touch anyone" but is probably upset.
Police asked for the name of the caller, but he did not name him.
Lamb did not explain why he opened fire.
Arriving at the scene of the crime, police found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note from Lamb, 45, which said: "I regret I would like to bring everything back.
I loved Amy and she was the only one who ever loved me.
After writing the note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a history teacher, and on Monday evening, when he was surrounded by police, committed suicide.
The university's rector, William Laforge, said he was not aware of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "Mr Lamb clearly had something on his mind."
Despite Monday's information that Lamb was implying an affair between Prentiss and Schmidt, official services on Tuesday reported a "lack of any information or evidence" of a "love triangle."
Prentiss was described as a "good man" by Sean O'Steen, who reported that he had been married to her for about seven years.
They divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss have a daughter, who is 19, and that she is "inconsolable."
He added that Prentiss and her daughter were "best friends."
According to Lindsay Knowles, whom the Sun Herald calls a close friend of Princess, the latter worked from home via the Internet.
Knowles said that Prentiss had a hunting dog named Lightning, and that she dated Lamb for about three years.
Knowles said, "She always wanted to help people."
According to police, Lamb on Monday at one point called relatives to say that "he will not go to prison."
That evening, when police overtook him on Highway 1 near Greenville, Lamb stopped the car, jumped out of it, ran into the woods and shot himself there.
According to a resume posted on the university website, in the spring of 2015, Lamb received a doctorate in pedagogy from Delta State University.
Stars who have lost their luck
The actor (left), pictured with his son Redmond (right), has endured several difficult years.
In 2001, he battled leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his longtime life partner, Farah Fawcett, to cancer.
The actor also reportedly suffered from drug addiction, and in 2008 he was arrested for drug possession.
All of this certainly played a role.
Manchester United's Luke Shaw is out for several months due to a double fracture.
Luke Shaw broke his right leg in two places during a Champions League match in which Manchester United lost to PSV in Eindhoven.
While the defender worries about this, which will prevent him from taking the field for at least six months, Louis van Gaal hopes that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The injury occurred during a reckless tackle by Hector Moreno in the 15th minute when the 20-year-old Shaw burst into the PSV penalty area.
He was treated on the field for nine minutes and given oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said: "He has a double fracture and he's in the hospital. "
He will be transported to Manchester tomorrow or a day later and then operated on.
It's terrible - the young man came to Manchester United at the age of 18, overcame great difficulties and began to play fantastically, and then it happened.
He was wearing an oxygen mask in the locker room.
He cried.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it's for six months and the guy won't be able to play in the group stage.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno was lucky that he did not receive a red card and no penalty was awarded.
Referee Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal believes the Italian referee made a mistake.
Judge for yourself when I say it's worth a penalty and a red card.
It was a very bad tackle with two legs.
In his tweet, Shaw writes: "Thank you all for your messages, words cannot describe how devastated I am, my path to recovery begins, I will return even stronger than I was."
More on the subject: Manchester United is experiencing misfortune with Luke Shaw at the defeat in the game with PSV
The English defender will have an extra incentive to recover for the European Championship in France next June.
Phillip Cocu, PSV's coach, said: "It's a very serious injury. "
When any player is eliminated with a similar injury, everyone is very upset about it.
It was never the intention of our players to injure the opponent.
Moreno suffered a broken leg when he played for Mexico against Holland under Van Gaal at the 2014 World Cup.
"It's very difficult for him now because he had no intention of injuring the opponent, and when you hear that it's a very serious injury, you don't feel good," Cocu said.
I couldn't see the moment itself.
The only thing I could see was a ball that was flying in a different direction, so it looked like he (Moreno) had touched it, but I didn't see a tackle under Luke.
Speaking to SBS6, Moreno said: "I know what it is, I know how hard it is to tolerate it.
It's very hard for me, and I'm very sorry.
PSV's Andres Guardado was also taken to hospital after a collision with Chris Smalling.
Does David Cameron know anything else about Lorax?
Every parent learns one thing very quickly: if your child likes a book, it won't be long before you know it almost by heart.
Apparently, unless you're David Cameron.
Answering a question from a representative of a company that organizes children's holidays about his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister chose "Lorax" - a fairy tale with an environmental bias, written by Dr. Seuss in 1971.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron wrote in a commentary posted on the Company's SuperCamps website, and continues: "This hilarious, touching, unusual story with a strong message I like to read to my children because it always reveals some image or message that we miss."
And all would be well, except for the last paragraph, in which Cameron is supposed to retell the contents of the book, but actually tells the plot of the film of the same name, shot in 2012, with new characters and details added to diversify the rather short original narrative.
"In the high-walled city of Vsenujville, where there was no greenery and even the air was sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams, by fulfilling her wish to see a real tree," we read in the text a description of a love story unknown to Dr. Seuss (real name Theodore Seuss Geisel), who died in 1991.
If it doesn't seem suspicious enough, Cameron's text reads almost like a summary of the plot of the movie "Lorax" posted on the Internet Movie Database: "In the high-walled city of Vsenujville, where everything was artificial and even air was sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams."
It seems unlikely that Cameron, admittedly an active parent, is so unfamiliar with the contents of a book in which an unnamed boy learns about how the greedy tree cutter and "all-nuch" knitter Nakhodkins is destroying the environment, despite the protests of Loraks (whose name is in the title of the book), a funny creature with a mustache who "speaks in the name of the trees."
Most likely, such a simple PR task was entrusted to a performer who had never read a book about Loraks to a child 20 times in a row.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said the text was allegedly obtained from Cameron's office in the constituency.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was obtained from Cameron's headquarters, but there was no further comment.
For Adam Leeth, there was clearly a risk of not making it to the England squad, but that's still a tough question.
Defeating Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is no easy task, but if you look at the squad England have selected for this tour, a repeat of the 3-0 loss in the Test Series last time doesn't seem likely to me.
I also wouldn't rule out winning at home.
Alistair Cook's team may be less experienced than it was three years ago, but there are players among the batters who masterfully accept twisted balls and the collective thinking is strong; they won't bring with them the scars from 2012, just youthful positivity.
With the ball, Moen Ali turns into a bowler serving twisted balls, and Adil Rashid, even if he is an unknown figure for the test level, is an attacking option.
More on the subject: Adam Leath dropped out of the England test cricket team and replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to expel Adam Lit is certainly difficult for me, his head coach at Yorkshire.
His seven Test matches have had two good attacks in difficult conditions, and the obvious but brutal reality is that cricketers are judged by referees on the score.
There were no questions about John Root, for example, which led to this announcement, because (and I've said this before) players are the best choices for themselves.
A couple of fifty, and Lita could have had a longer career, but he was at the mercy of his own destiny.
Hopefully if he racks up more wounds for Yorkshire, there will be another opportunity.
England head coach Trevor Bailiss has spoken well of his attitude, even when he hasn't shown what he's capable of, and that doesn't surprise me; he's first of all a team player, and then everything else.
The question of how long it will be before a test cricket batsman leaves an impression on himself is a difficult question.
Lit played in seven games, as did Sam Robson before him, and Nick Compton in nine.
Only Compton got the chance to play on his own and on someone else's field.
The only thing you could complain about is that England chose Jonathan Trott for the Caribbean Premier League when Lite was at his best, but that lost opportunity is in the past.
Alex Hales shows up, and he's a batsman that I rate highly.
He's an unpredictable cricketer, as we saw at the Yorkshire club earlier this season when he earned 236 against us at Trent Bridge, which was something.
He should at least be given the same opportunity as those who came before him, but this will, of course, depend on the composition of the team in the UAE.
The idea of putting Moen next to Cook as an opening batsman, which would give you the opportunity to introduce an extra spinner while keeping four speed bowlers, is being pondered, and I don't mind that at all.
I don't see a reason why a batter can't hit the ball there, and this left-hander has already shown that he's a damn good cricketer.
Moen may not be quite what is needed for his county of Worcestershire, but has become number three for them and there is not much difference here.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 Test games as a "third batsman" before coming out as a discoverer in 2001.
He won three hundred at once and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari comes to the national team as a backup spinner, and with my brief interaction with him, he seemed to me a very promising young man.
People might look at his rough stats — an average of 31 with a bat and 35 with a ball — and think it's a risky bet, but there aren't many spinners voting in favor and the takers have chosen youth.
He's going to learn a lot on this tour.
In addition to the national team, England plans to make a couple of practical additions to the coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayahuordin, a Sri Lankan batsman, as a consultant for test matches could be a masterful move.
He's one of the best guys for the game, who will bring to it a wealth of experience gained under all possible conditions and in any attack.
Paul Collingwood is included in those games where the white ball is used and will provide both energy and a ruthless pace in the set-up.
I always felt that he was born to be involved in international cricket, whether it was playing or coaching, and like Mahela, has considerable intelligence.
Sometimes new voices in the locker room, even if they say something that has already been said before, can give new strength to the team.
Colley's teammate Durham Ben Stokes is left for the fly-by-nights, Ruth is given a similar break due to Australia, and I, for one, have no problem with that.
While not everyone would agree, coaches and player selectors don't set the schedule.
And you have to remember how the players, their positions depend on the results.
Such decisions are never made easily.
The camp of supporters of the UK's exit from the European Union may win if the economy is depressed by 2017
David Cameron's ill-conceived policy of resuming negotiations to keep Britain in the EU is experiencing more and more difficulties every day, even without regard to the election of the brilliant Jeremy - "Is it yes or no?" - Corbyn led Labour or TUC's outrage over Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their own Corbins and Nigel Faraji.
A friendly European diplomat explained the other day that with the EU now in a variety of crises – not all of them of its own making – some member states are fed up with Britain's self-centered agenda of divisive concessions and bargain-undermining changes that they largely do not want.
Gathering in Brighton for its annual meeting, the TUC decided it didn't want them anyway if they destroyed social protection.
We could even call it "Dave and George's selfie program."
The prime minister and finance minister ride summits and bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, take pictures of themselves against a famous local monument, with or without a local celebrity, then come home and say they are attracting allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants Britain interested in maintaining external contacts under the awning of the European Union - "Don't leave us with France", says Berlin - suggests that blinkered ministers and officials in some capitals come to an understanding when they will not care whether we stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, Germany's very cautious chancellor, is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the cabinet before the situation worsens for her, as she has worsened for thatcher (11), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
French President François Hollande is facing re-election or replacement in 2017.
He, too, loses his power.
Poland may soon get a nationalist government of the right, Spain - of the left.
It's hard to see them go out of their way to help the Selfie Brits, whose energy could be spent on preventing Scotland from leaving the UK – something they don't want either, because most have similar separatist tendencies.
So some such ministers may even be planning to issue deliberately useless SNP-style remarks during the UK referendum campaign in 2017 to spur the UK's exit process, my friend suggests.
"The revision was a fixed idea" and "Britain gained nothing of value from the renewed negotiations."
Europeans know what a predator Fleet Street can be, and how skeptical media moguls are about the EU, unlike the referendum launched by Tony Benn in 1975, which supported our entry in 1973 by a 2:1 ratio.
They may vaguely remember Boris Johnson, the hardened Euro-opportunist who became famous for his "straight EU bananas" as a Brussels correspondent in the early '90s.
For all his stupidity, Ed Milliband knew who his enemies were.
These included a motley company of tax-fearing crooks, phone hackers who are outsiders, and pseudo-non-residents who own most of our major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair had exactly the same opinion of them, but was aware that when you are in a cage with a violent gorilla, you have to give her bananas to distract her and prevent her from eating you for lunch and again with tea.
In fact, Milliband was more of a Blair supporter than Blair himself in opposing Cameron's idea of a referendum, as Blair compromised in favor of the repealed EU constitution buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005 who gave him the winning ticket.
The press didn't forgive him for any of this.
But the cutie Jeremy Corbyn who gave me a friendly pat on the back in Westminster on Monday — I told him he no longer had time to spend on me — seems to be at risk of repeating Neil Kinnock's "boycott" strategy from the '80s – a mistake then and now.
It may take time, but he has to develop a coherent strategy for engaging with the press — not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, on whose couch in the BBC he sat on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is what I delicately call evolution.
He says he would like us to stay in a reformed EU.
Indeed, most people outside the traditionalist ukip trend and the wider circle of "Little England supporters" among the Tories can probably say yes to this.
It's the same as Hilary-"Benn, but not Bennit," Benn said on radio and TV this week, with his inner boy scout struggling to admit that Corbyn's appointment of the obnoxious John McDonnell as "shadow" finance minister was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the '70s, when his old father fought tooth and nail on TV for disloyalty to his Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his Cabinet post.
Hilary's battle was more appealing.
But the struggle to stay "under all circumstances" — Benn's phrase — is not what McDonnell said, nor what J.D. Rowling said. K spoke to peers and MPs in a private meeting on Monday night, by all accounts.
Whatever Democrat and "his boyfriend" Corbyn wanted to say — remember, he touched even me — the discipline of messaging remains important in the age of round-the-clock television seven days a week, and especially in the maelstrom of social media, the hotbed of paranoia and betrayal.
It's wise not to let Cameron get away from Europe so easily, allowing him to take for granted Labour's support during the referendum campaign, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins definitely thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's core misconception about EU membership – within the "Bennit" economy of a besieged fortress – is no longer a matter of esoteric debate among left-wing dissidents, for whom narcissism, born of minor difference, is a central principle in dogmatic disputes.
As for his misconceptions about NATO, Tom Watson is adamant that J.K. will not agitate for withdrawal - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to convey this to their leaders at home.
Why would Paris or Berlin spend political capital – they also have suspicious voters – on concessions to Britain when it could all be pointless?
The U.S. is already quite frustrated by the weak British military action in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even as the Tory government cuts spending, as I was reminded on Monday during lunch at a forum called British Influence Security.
Experts criticize the review of electronic cigarettes from Public Health England
The government-funded agency's claims that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking came at a meeting of 12 people, some of whom are linked to the tobacco industry, the researchers said.
Experts published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) together with the Lancet criticized the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in its report on electronic cigarettes.
PHE released an important report, a "turning point," last month, calling it a "comprehensive review of the evidence."
But some researchers have questioned the reliability of the data and pointed to the connection of some experts with the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the Lancet medical journal last month criticized the "extremely shaky argument" on which PHE based its main conclusion.
In the BMJ paper, two more researchers questioned whether these claims have "solid or shaky grounds."
Martin McKee, lecturer in European health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, lecturer in clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of health care – rules must be based on evidence of efficacy. "
According to them, the public expects PHE's claims that "the current best estimate shows that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than tobacco smoking" to be based on detailed analysis of the evidence and modeling.
In fact, this is derived from a single meeting of 12 people gathered to develop a model of multi-criteria decision-making analysis in order to summarize their views on the harm associated with various nicotine-containing products; the results of the meeting are summarized in a scientific publication.
McKee and Capewell said one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO reported that he had previously received funding from British American Tobacco for independent research.
He also confirmed his BAT health certifications in a sustainability report.
One in 12 people at the meeting announced funding from an e-cigarette maker, without mentioning the funding he reportedly previously received from tobacco company Philip Morris.
No reasonable explanation for the selection of board members has been provided, but there are several prominent e-cigarette supporters among them, some of whom have also claimed funding for the industry in the publication.
It is not known whether the other participants in the meeting have experience in tobacco management.
The meeting was also attended by the head of the tobacco business at PHE.
A scientific paper published by the group "elegantly agrees" that there is a lack of "strong evidence of the harmful effects of most foods on most criteria," McKee and Capewell wrote.
However, none of these connections and limitations were addressed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said PHE's claims that "there is currently no evidence that e-cigarettes are expensive, leading children or non-smokers to smoking" are premature.
Prof. Kevin Fenton, head of health and well-being at PHE, said the BMJ's statements had previously been answered.
He said: "E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than tobacco smoking."
One of the two smokers died of his entire life from his addiction.
All the evidence implies that the health threats from e-cigarettes are comparatively small, but we must continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what this evidence proves and does not prove, especially where the public had doubts about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Around 80,000 people a year die from smoking-related diseases, and smoking costs the NHS £2bn a year.
By making the obvious clear – that while e-cigarettes are not safe, they do only do part of the harm caused by smoking – we are fulfilling our objectives to the nation.
Former Head of Channel 4 Believes BBC Should Stop EastEnders Series
Former Channel 4 chief executive Luke Johnson believes the BBC should stop producing programmes such as EastEnders and The Voice, noting that their business rivals would give a lot for such successful shows as the soap opera about Albert Square.
Johnson noted that licensing fees should only be used to create programs that are not produced by other British broadcasters.
He criticized the BBC for putting public broadcasts, which are certainly watched by only a small fraction of the audience, on peak airtime, when competitors have high-rated shows, and on channels such as BBC4.
After BBC Director-General Tony Hall said the corporation would like to do more with other organisations, Johnson remarked that he had been trying unsuccessfully for six years to work with the BBC while working for Channel 4.
"I can't help but think that the BBC is preparing to launch and broadcast programmes that could be shown by competing companies that do not receive subsidies," Johnson told members of the Communications Committee of the House of Lords as part of a search for the future of the BBC.
If you keep the license fee, which I don't think is a good solution in the medium to long term, then the company should only keep on the air those programs that are not released and are not going to be released by other companies.
The Voice show airs on the prime slot because the creators want to get as much support as possible for the future.
The idea that no one else should show it is ridiculous and obviously absurd.
Johnson: "I don't understand why regressive taxes should go toward funding transfers that could be sponsored without subsidies.
The Voice is one such example, EastEnders is another; it is well known that they are of their own production.
Other channels would undoubtedly give a lot for it.
I don't understand how this can be public service broadcasting.
I don't think that would be belittle the BBC in any way.
Serial entrepreneur Johnson, who headed Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, accused the BBC of chasing ratings "because of the ambition of employees and because of their belief that this is the best way to get support for the long term."
His comments on the BBC's most popular shows echo those of Sky chief executive Tony Ball, who in his 2003 McTaggarth memorial lecture in Edinburgh suggested that the BBC sell series like EastEnders.
Johnson noted that the BBC's more niche public broadcasts "continue to go to BBC4, where it is often impossible to assess the audience, but the company's function is fulfilled, and this can be presented as an argument in sanctimonious sermons justifying the income from licensing fees of 4 billion pounds: "Well, yes, of course, we do all these incomprehensible programs that no one watches."
They put them in a slot where no one will ever watch them.
Regarding the licensing fee, Johnson told the committee: "I urge you to find a more regressive system in terms of who will get the most from it.
Of course, you all think, we all think that £150 a year is a huge amount, but for people for whom £150 is a lot of money, I wonder they think so because they don't really watch and listen to the BBC.
Former Sky and Channel 5 chief executive David Elstein, who also addressed the committee on Tuesday, said the BBC should reconsider Rita's mission in favour of "inform, educate and entertain".
He noted that only a small fraction of the BBC's output is now formally classified as educational — he said it was 1 per cent of television content and 0.1 per cent on radio — and that the company should embrace the "inform, educate and entertain" initiative by Australian and Canadian broadcasters.
On partnerships, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas such as Promenade Concerts (only a fraction of which he said are shown on TV) and enter into alliances with commercial broadcasters to make them available for viewing online.
"Sonogenetics" allows you to control brain cells using sound waves
The video shows how nematodes change direction of movement at the moment when they are exposed to sound pulses.
Scientists have bred worms with a genetically modified nervous system that can be controlled using the pulses of sound waves.
Tiny nematodes change direction when they are exposed to sound pulses too high for the human ear to hear.
The pulses exert their effect by activating neurons genetically modified to use membrane channels that respond to ultrasonic waves.
More on the subject: Researchers control brain activity with the help of light
Scientists said that the worms demonstrate the capabilities of a new technique called "sonogenetics", the essence of which is to use ultrasound to excite certain cells of the brain, heart and muscles, while the source of ultrasound is located outside the body.
Srikanth Chalasani, a research fellow at the Salk Institute, La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that the technique could one day replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure in which electrical impulses are sent to the human brain and used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.
Nematode worms don't usually respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they began to react when they were placed in a liquid containing microscopic vesicles.
He found that the vesicles amplify ultrasonic waves, which then penetrate the worms' body.
The amplified ultrasonic waves affect structures called "TRP-4 ion channels" found in the membranes of some worm cells.
Ultrasonic waves cause these ion channels to open and excite the cells that are associated with them, according to a report in Nature Communications.
To create nematodes that can be controlled by ultrasound, Chalasani made genetic modifications of the worms so that their motor neurons used TRP-4 ion channels.
During the application of ultrasound to affect modified organisms, sound waves were amplified by microscopic vesicles and injected into the worms' bodies, activating the modified motor neurons.
This technique is similar to the one used in "optogenetics" - a new direction that allows scientists to turn neurons on and off using light pulses.
Chalasani argues that compared to this technique, sonogenetics may have some advantages.
Unlike light, which is delivered to the desired part of the brain via optical fiber, low-frequency ultrasonic waves pass unhindered through the tissues of the body, so they do not need to pass inside the skull to deliver them.
"We believe that for the treatment of certain neurological diseases in a clinical setting, the use of gene therapy and therapeutic viruses will be able to temporarily make human neurons sensitive to the ultrasound signal," Chalasani said.
He added that, in addition, the technique can be applied to muscle and insulin-producing cells.

Advertisements mock the British arms trade
Watch Amnesty International's video protesting the arms exhibition.
Awesome killer drones!
Shin-destroying iron shackles!
Cluster bombs!
Electric light-noise batons, causing unbearable pain, but leaving no traces!
The cheerful voice and hand-drawn animation leave no doubt that this advertisement for the largest international arms exhibition is a caustic parody prepared by Amnesty International to draw attention to the British government's intention to push weapons to repressive regimes by taking advantage of the Exhibition of Defence And Security Technologies at the ExCeL Centre in Docklands.

But the special campaign also leads to the sudden appearance of many posters at bus stops and subway trains, which require you to look at them again.
"An important announcement travelling on the DLR line from September 15 to 18?" reads one of them in London Underground fonts depicting a DLR line turning into a tank silhouette.
In September of this year, a crowd of arms dealers will come to the DLR line. Passengers are asked to help prevent the exhibition of weapons.
The 300 posters are drawn by artists who exhibited their work at the "Museum of Cruel Design" in Banksy's Dismaland Park.
A collective called the Special Patrol Group helped spread them across London using a "space cracker kit," a 6-pound set of wrenches that claims to "give access to about a third of the advertising space at bus stops on the planet."
London transport workers are not happy with such "vandalism" in the form of unauthorized posters.
One of the parody announcements issued by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of the Cruel Designs exhibition and a lecturer at the University of Essex, artists are becoming more demanding and eager to bring political art to audiences outside the galleries.
Many artists begin to work with activists of protest movements, realizing that they have to go out into the real world for their art if they want to influence society.
Another poster against the arms exhibition greeting passengers on the subway.
Amnesty's video has been viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and created by the pro bono agency VCCP, with the involvement of a graphic designer and voice artist, also working for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was struck by the promotional silence around the arms show — with a pass on the ExCel calendar — and thought, "Let's give them a campaign they're trying to avoid."
They thought about creating a more realistic and ingenious corporate advertisement, but "filling it at home with bright colors and animations turned out to be a more exciting activity."
"They have helped us tremendously draw attention to the sale of illegal torture equipment at the exhibition," said Tom Davis of Amnesty.
What we need now is for the UK government to take action to ensure that this torture equipment is not illegally sold right on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art on the theme of the arms exhibition comes from within ExCeL, where participants sell fantastically euphemestic products.
In a press release, Saab disclosed an order for an "AT4CS RS for shoulder shooting" from the U.S. Army.
It includes "an unparalleled shaped charge that brings unmatched armor action inside the target."

Eight Golden Rules for Living in Student Residences
It's been 11 years since I moved into a college dormitory as a normal 19-year-old still believing in berets and moral relativism, but it's only now that I remember the strained smiles of those I annoyed — and the many, long-running complaints about others.
Basically, what I've learned can be broken down according to eight simple rules.
Moving into a hostel can range from mildly nerve-wracking to downright intimidating.
It encourages chatter: tell people where you're from, whether you took a sabbatical and where you spent it, whether you support Corbyn and why you 'honestly, neither love nor hate Marmite, because, seriously, guys, it's just a yeast extract OF HAHAHA, I'll be at home."
Take a break.
And help others take a break too – ask questions and show interest.
It keeps the conversation going and helps you find people you like, not people you wouldn't even talk to, even if your eyelashes caught fire and they handed out fire extinguishers.
Give people space.
People's rooms often turn into drinking establishments, midnight cinema halls and places of communal gatherings, but they are also a place where people dress up and adjust their underwear.
More on the subject: Do not even think to start studying at the university, being in a relationship
Introverts in universities are treated unfairly.
Your room should be a refuge, however, many hostels form a culture of staggering from one room to another, which promotes friendship, communication and leads to long friendships.
It can be hell for someone who is trying to recuperate.
Nothing in the culture allows you to say, "I like you and I want to continue to be friends with you, but I need you to leave and I can regain the energy I spent communicating with you."
Try to feel when a fellow student is tired of communication - and not knock on his door, but send an SMS.
Speaking of knocking: do it.
One guy in my dorm followed this principle: if the door was not locked, he was invited to enter.
He saw something.
Make friends with baked goods.
Since you start your university life at the peak of the Popularity of the Bake-Off show, knocking on people's door to introduce themselves and present a plate of chocolate chip cookies is no longer such a strange action, not so reminiscent of the 1950s with their "Welcome, we are neighbors, I baked you something, and now smile, and I will ask you personal questions."
Offering homemade treats is a great way to make friends.
Your neighbors will feel obligated to chat with you, and in the end, probably, your face will be associated with them with a pleasant surprise.
Of course, it depends on how good a baker you are.
Poorly molded lumps of flour, sugar, and fat are more likely to make people pretend to be asleep when you knock on their door.
Stealing food is a typical crime in student dormitories.
Of course, appropriating someone's chicken is theft, but is it theft to take some milk for tea?
Get over it with the milk owner.
Most likely, he will offer you not to be shy, even if the inside is boiling with rage.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying, and I sympathize with you — but try to treat it more maturely than my neighbor, who poured dishwashing liquid into her milk to take revenge on those who took it without asking.
She's in jail now.
You shouldn't make noise that will prevent people from sleeping or learning.
Not only to be a decent person, but also because you are the very people from the saying about glass houses.
The girl in my hallway asked the neighbor to reduce the sound of the drum and bass guitar, since it was 3 o'clock in the morning, and she had an exam in the morning.
In response, the neighbor turned up the volume.
When he finally fell silent at 5 a.m., she graciously allowed him to sleep for two hours, and then cut her music and locked the door behind her, going to a three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse settled in the same dormitory as you?
On the contrary, wouldn't it be extremely awkward, to the point of elbow biting, if you mistook a neighbor for your future spouse, got carried away with him, broke off the relationship and had to see him every day, and perhaps watch him pull all your mutual friends to his side?
Of course, you can't command your heart - but if the hot neighbor is definitely not your future spouse, try to cool your own ardor a little.
In that exhilarating moment when you realize that someone has left the keys inside their own locked room, the line between prank and bullying is thinner than it seems.
A good prank is fun, but it turns into its opposite in a matter of seconds.
Teach a valuable and interesting safety lesson by hiding something – but never stain someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock someone else's door and put the keys in a glass of water, which you will then put in the freezer - but do not glue other people's things with Blu-Tack glue to the ceiling more than twice.
iOS 9: How to Install a New Operating System on iPhone After Apple's Update Release
A new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings application, selecting General, and then selecting Software Update.
If it's ready, the phone will allow you to download and install it.
Some have encountered problems after installation, when an error message appears telling them that "The application update failed."
To avoid this, users are advised to either wait until the excitement subsides or try to update through iTunes.
Hints on your phone will allow you to go through the whole process to the end.
The process may involve uninstalling apps to increase free space — but Apple has minimized the likelihood of this action by reducing the size of the update, and has also made it easier to perform with a special utility that offers to uninstall the apps and reinstall them after the process is complete.
It's worth making sure your phone is charged or near the charger when you update to prevent the battery from running out.
If the charge is too low, Apple will stop the update, as discharging the phone in the process may cause the update to fail.

Washington responded to Russia's military activity with a phone call.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, to discuss the situation in Syria.
In his opinion, the military support that Moscow provides to President Assad only leads to an aggravation of the conflict.
At the same time, the head of the White House is not yet going to talk about this with his Russian counterpart, writes PJ Media.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to discuss Russia's military involvement in Syria.
This is reported by the publication PJ Media.
"Secretary Kerry has made it clear that Russia's continued support for President Assad risks an escalation and prolongation of the conflict, as well as a negative impact on our shared goal of fighting extremism — if we also do not continue to focus on finding ways to resolve the Syrian conflict through a direct transfer of power," state Department officials said.
They also noted that Kerry once again stressed the US commitment to fighting the Islamic State as part of a coalition of more than 60 countries.
He also noted that President Assad will never be able to be a member.
In addition, the United States "will be pleased with Russia's constructive role in trying to counter the Islamic State."
On Friday, White House officials said they did not know exactly what actions Russian troops were taking in Syria, but Washington was going to discuss the issue with Moscow.
However, White House press secretary Josh Earnest noted that the time for a telephone conversation between US President Barack Obama and Russian leader Vladimir Putin has not yet come: "When the president decides that a telephone conversation with President Putin will benefit our interests, then he will pick up the phone and try to make this call."
Barack Obama himself considers Russia's decision to increase support for the Assad regime a "losing bet."
I remember our conversation with Mr. Putin four or five years ago, when I told him that it was a mistake, that further support for Assad would only worsen the situation.
"But he did not heed my warnings - and as a result, the situation worsened," the US president said.
Imported yachts will be exempt from customs duties.
The Ministry of Economic Development intends to temporarily exempt imported yachts and other floating facilities for recreation and sports from paying customs duties and taxes.
Relevant changes to the list of preferential goods for temporary duty-free import were prepared by the Ministry on behalf of the Government of the Russian Federation.
This was reported to "Izvestia" by the Assistant minister of economic development Elena Lashkina.
In June 2015, The Prime Minister of the Russian Federation Dmitry Medvedev, following a trip to the Crimea, instructed a number of departments - the Ministry of Economic Development, the Ministry of Transport of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Emergency Situations, the Federal Customs Service, the Federal Agency for Tourism - to prepare proposals for creating favorable conditions for yachting in the coastal zones of the country.
In turn, experts note that the main problem is the complete lack of infrastructure for storage, maintenance and maintenance of yachts.
Owners prefer to keep their ships abroad - about € 200 million annually go to the treasury of European countries for the maintenance, repair and maintenance of yachts.
The Ministry of Economic Development of the Russian Federation has prepared a draft decision of the Council of the Eurasian Economic Commission "On Amendments to the List of Goods Temporarily Imported with Full Conditional Exemption from Payment of Customs Duties and Taxes", providing for the provision of full conditional exemption from payment of customs duties, taxes in respect of imported yachts and other floating facilities for recreation and sports.
According to the ministry, this will certainly contribute to the creation of favorable conditions for the development of yachting in the coastal zones of the country," Lashkina said.
This issue was submitted to the subcommittee on customs and tariff, non-tariff regulation, protective measures in foreign trade of the Government Commission for Economic Development and Integration, which met in September, and following the discussion was also approved by the departments.
As the representative of the Ministry of Economic Development noted, the proposed measure for full conditional release when importing is essentially a benefit.
Therefore, after approving the minutes of the meeting of the subcommittee in the government of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Economic Development will submit a proposal to the Eurasian Economic Commission for discussion with the EAEU member states, Lashkina explained.
The list of imported goods, which are completely exempt from customs duties, taxes, includes goods necessary to promote foreign economic activity and international cooperation, for use in the field of science, culture, cinematography, sports and tourism, to provide international assistance, etc. Among them are service equipment (personal computers, typewriters), control and measuring devices, drilling equipment, stage costumes and scenery,  mobile laboratories and workshops, water skiing, racing cars, motorcycles, sports aircraft, books, newspapers, magazines, musical instruments and objects for religious rites.
The press service of the Ministry of Transport of the Russian Federation told Izvestia that they had prepared mandatory resolutions on the seaports of Kerch, Sevastopol, Yalta, Feodosia and Evpatoria, which provide for a simplified procedure for issuing the entry and exit of small,sport sailing and pleasure vessels to the seaport.
The Ministry of Transport instructed the captains of the seaports of Crimea to ensure the application of a simplified procedure for the entry of small, sports sailing and pleasure craft into the seaport and the exit of the listed vessels from the seaport.
Also, the Ministry of Transport has prepared draft orders of the Government of the Russian Federation on the approval of the boundaries of the water area of the seaports of Crimea.
In relation to Yalta and Feodosia, the orders have already been adopted, the rest are at the stage of coordination, the press service of the department noted.
According to the Ministry of Transport, state supervision, classification and examination, state registration in respect of small vessels used for non-commercial purposes should be carried out by the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol.
The problem is that in Russia it is extremely difficult with yachting precisely because of the poorly developed infrastructure.
If you look at the south of Italy and France, there is a whole constantly developing industry, in which a large number of people are involved.
In Russia, in fact, everything stands still.
Our coast is of little interest, the only piece where you can operate yachts year-round is the Black Sea in the area of Sochi, Gelendzhik, Novorossiysk, Anapa.
But the big difficulty is that in this area there are extremely strict rules of the border service: in order to go for a walk on a yacht, you need to issue a lot of permits.
In addition, inside Russia, the yacht does not even have a place to refuel.
For two days she can go with her fuel, and then the problem arises, where to get it, - says Denis Novikov, sales director of Nordmarine.
As for places for storing yachts, in Moscow and St. Petersburg there are now special hangars for yachts up to 30 m. Also, yachts are sent for storage to Turkey, Finland, Sweden and Germany.
Novikov noted that yacht buyers are rich people, but with the onset of the crisis, the demand for yachts has decreased.
The World Bank has allocated a loan of $500 million to Ukraine.
The World Bank has approved a new loan project for Ukraine in the amount of $ 500 million for the development of the financial sector.
This was reported by the press service of the international organization.
"The new financing will support a number of priority measures to carry out reforms in the banking sector in response to the financial crisis in Ukraine," the report said.
World Bank Country Director for Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine Qimiao Fan said that banking sector reforms will help revive loans in the real economy and will stimulate the recovery of economic growth.
He also noted that the Ukrainian authorities have taken impressive steps to reform the economy and the World Bank is seeing the first signs of stabilization.
But because of the seriousness of the problems, Fan calls on the Ukrainian government to accelerate reforms.
Earlier, the Polish government approved the provision of a loan of € 100 million to Ukraine, RIA Novosti reports.
Prisons are asked to create separate blocks for transgender people.
In October 2015, the Public Council under the Federal Penitentiary Service (FSIN) for the Protection of the Rights of Convicts will discuss, among other issues, the possibility of creating separate blocks for transgender and transvestites in colonies.
About this "Izvestia" told a member of the council Vladislav Grib.
In his opinion, depending on the total number of convicts in Russia who have not decided on their gender, it is possible to provide separate cells, blocks in domestic prisons or even (if there are many such criminals) in the future to create a special colony for transsexuals.
However, Vladislav Hryb emphasizes that it is possible to determine citizens to serve their sentences in such isolated places only after the convicts pass the appropriate medical examinations that will prove that the offender is really a person who identifies himself as a representative of the opposite sex.
Vladislav Hryb is confident that the isolation of transgender people from other prisoners will ensure the safety of those serving sentences.
According to him, the proposed practice is successfully operating abroad: in pre-trial detention centers (where defendants are held until the court decision) there are separate cells for transgender people, and in correctional institutions - special blocks.
Today, this is the only way out when working with such criminals.
Definitely they need to be isolated, since the presence of transvestites and transgenders in ordinary cells is dangerous for them, this is suffering for their families and a sea of problems for FSIN employees.
Humiliation of trance on the part of fellow inmates is guaranteed, - says Vladislav Grib.
Depending on how large the city is, how many criminals with an uncertain gender, you need to calculate where to distribute them.
Separate pre-trial detention centers are definitely not needed - only cells, blocks in prisons.
Yes, a separate colony is possible if there are a lot of transgender people.
As Grib explained, the block can contain 50 or 100 people, and if one specialized corps is created in Russia, then transgender prisoners will be able to go there from any regions to serve their sentences.
Citizens are held in a pre-trial detention center at the place where the crime was committed, so the receipt of transvestites or transgenders from other subjects during the investigation and trial is unrealistic, but to introduce such a practice for those already convicted in a separate colony - yes, - Grib believes.
Recall that on the eve of law enforcement officers could not decide in which detention center - male or female - to determine the 24-year-old transsexual Dmitry Kozhukov (known as Alina Davis), detained for drug possession, because of which a man with a girlish appearance was not arrested.
He was released home on his own recognizance.
This news was widely discussed in social networks and the media, since there really is no mechanism for keeping transgender people in pre-trial detention centers and colonies in Russia.
Russian human rights activist, activist of the LGBT movement (LGBT - lesbian, gay, bisexual, transsexual) Nikolai Alekseev supported the idea of creating special places for transgender people to serve their sentences, noting that abroad it is also possible to determine people in the colony - male or female - depending on their own desire.
Given the atmosphere in Russian prisons, the proposal is correct.
Yes, this is a very small percentage, but there is a problem, as well as the issue of ensuring security for homosexuals in prisons," Alekseev said.
Prisons should be safe, so separate blocks could be made in the name of this and for homosexuals, especially since there are more of them in prisons than transgender people.
At the same time, Alexeyev doubts that there will be many citizens in Russia who are ready to pose as transsexuals in order to get into a different colony from ordinary ones.
Of course, it is possible to introduce a medical examination before placing people in transgender colonies, but not always everything is unambiguous.
For example, in the United States, one of the prisoners Chelsea Manning looked like a man, and already in prison he said that he wanted to change his gender," Alekseev said.
A person can feel like anyone.
But as long as there are no separate places to serve sentences for transgender people, I doubt that prison staff will seriously think about the safety of such people and delve into the intricacies of their orientation or gender identification.
At the same time, Boris Lordkipanidze, an international expert on reproductive health in the territory of the Russian Federation, noted that the introduction of a new system for the distribution of transsexual criminals in the colony could greatly delay the beginning of serving sentences by convicts.
A commission is created - this is a question of sexology, psychiatrists conduct long-term observations, this is not one test, on the basis of which a highly accurate conclusion is made.
Today's psychiatry capabilities allow for this.
Therefore, even before changing sex, potential patients always undergo such examinations - they accurately show whether gender reassignment with surgical intervention is a necessary measure," says Lordkipanidze.
However, it is difficult for me to imagine how to implement this system in relation to convicts, because on average such a survey takes a month.
The doctor, despite the fact that in general the idea of creating separate blocks for transsexuals supported, also doubts that in the current economic conditions it will be advisable to allocate funds for the construction of new premises, medical examinations, - there are only a few transgender people in Russia.
It is difficult to calculate, there are no official statistics, but if we take into account that homosexuals in Russia are about 5%, then we can say that there are even fewer transgender people, and those who have such a deviation and also commit crimes are not at all a small number," Lordkipanidze said.
Now, at the request of the administration of the colony, homosexuals, transgender people can already receive separate conditions of detention.
Mikhail Antipov won the World Junior Chess Championship.
In Khanty-Mansiysk, the World Chess Championship among juniors under 20 years old ended.
The ending of the championship was more than intriguing.
The winner was determined only in the last round, and it was the Russian Mikhail Antipov, who still managed to catch up with the Pole Jan-Krzysztof Duda, who seemed to be confidently going to the title.
For the girls, the victory was celebrated by the Ukrainian chess player Natalia Buksa.
The World Chess Championship, held since the beginning of September in Khanty-Mansiysk, already by the middle of the tournament distance, seemed to have lost almost all intrigue, as the representative of Poland Jan-Krzysztof Duda, who gave a series of four victories (competitions are held according to the Swiss system in 13 rounds), confidently seized the lead.
Given that Duda was the favorite of the championship, and in general is considered one of the most promising young chess players, the likelihood that he would miss the gap seemed very small.
And even when Duda slowed down and allowed Russian Mikhail Antipov to reduce the gap to only 0.5 points, he remained the obvious favorite in the fight for the title.
After all, Antipov, in order to catch up with the leader, had to win in the 13th round.
But even that wouldn't have helped if Duda had won his game.
Plus, this obligation to win, of course, could affect the game of the Russian chess player and lead to unnecessary mistakes.
Fortunately, Mikhail Antipov managed to avoid them.
He confidently coped with Francesco Rambaldi, after which he had to wait for his game to be completed by Duda, who met with Benjamin Bock.
Fortunately for Antipov, the Polish chess player drew the confrontation with the Dutchman.
Thus, Antipov and Duda scored an equal number of points - 10 out of 13 possible, but Antipov had the best additional indicators.
Therefore, it was to him that the leadership of the Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomous Okrug, whose governor Natalia Komarova, traditionally pays great attention to the development of chess in the region, presented the main prize.
But in the girls' competitions, an intriguing ending did not happen.
The leader of the tournament - Natalia Buksa (Ukraine) - to win the title it was enough not to lose in the last round, which she successfully did.
Thus, the victory of the Russian Alina Bivol did not allow her to catch up with Buksa.
The Russian athlete remained second with a gap of 0.5 points behind the champion.
VimpelCom changes the regional structure.
The company unites the Volga and Ural regions into one enlarged Volga-Ural region, Siberia and the Far East - in the East region.
The project will be completed by November 1.
As the general director of VimpelCom Mikhail Slobodin noted, the changes are carried out in order to "remain a strong player in the market", to develop the company "in new, not always favorable external conditions".
In an interview with the TV channel "Russia 24", Mr. Slobodin said that they intend to reduce in Russia "tens of percent" of the staff.
Rospotrebnadzor inspected 78 Moscow Burger King eateries and issued 367 prescriptions.
As a result, the restaurant on the Volokolamsk highway was fined 50 thousand rubles, and the institution on Bolshaya Tulskaya Street was closed for 90 days, but resumed work after all violations were eliminated.
43 eateries violated the requirements for the arrangement of premises.
Among other violations, unsatisfactory sanitary-technical and sanitary-hygienic maintenance of premises, non-compliance with the requirements for the ventilation device, in some institutions bacteria of the E. coli group were found.
The franchise for the Burger King brand belongs to Burger Rus LLC, the owner of the Shokoladnitsa chain, Alexander Kolobov, there are 293 eateries in Russia.
Igor Artemyev, the head of the FAS, said that the agency is against the indexation of tariffs for cargo transportation by 10% and the provision of state subsidies, as requested by Russian Railways.
At first they wanted 17% indexation, now they want 10%, and also multibillion-dollar subsidies from the budget," he says. -
We say: it's wrong, it's too much, reduce your costs, learn to save, give up expensive mansions, football teams, your own TV, stop spending money left and right.
He added that the FAS has its own, "much stricter" proposals, which are now being discussed in the government.

Sumeru has until October 3 to exercise the option or require a surcharge.
Details of the negotiations in Polymetal are not disclosed.
The option was concluded as part of polymetal's purchase of the Kyzyl project in Kazakhstan.

Ministry of Industry and Trade: targeted food aid will not become an analogue of cards in the USSR.
Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade of Russia Viktor Evtukhov said that the program of targeted food aid will not become an analogue of the card system of food distribution that existed in the USSR.
We are talking about modern targeted food aid to the population and support for an effective domestic producer.
I ask you not to speculate on the phrase "ration card".
I would like to especially note that we should not confuse the proposed food cards with an echo of the past times of total shortage, a card distribution system in which the number of products received is rationed.
We have so far proposed a concept, if it is approved, we will propose changes to the legislation," TASS quoted Mr. Evtukhov as saying.
Earlier, "Kommersant" wrote that the program for the introduction of ration cards for the poor was submitted to the government.

This year, the study of the Association of Russian Managers "Top-1000 Russian Managers" is published for the 16th time.
Being a tool for assessing the professional reputation of Russian managers of the highest echelon, the study sums up the results of the work of Russian managers for the year, identifying leaders in industries and functional areas.
The initial pool of candidates consists of the winners of the rating of the previous year.
Last year's winners are invited to confirm their participation as a candidate for the current year's rating and nominate members of their management team.
In addition, each of the candidates included in the initial list is invited to nominate up to ten new managers from other companies, whom it would be advisable to add to the general pool of candidates.
It is possible to nominate the following managers of the functional areas of the company: financial director, commercial director, marketing director, HR director, CIO, director of public and corporate relations, director of relations with authorities, director of corporate governance.
Each manager proposed by experts is sent an invitation to participate in the rating and is given the opportunity to nominate his management team and up to ten new managers from other companies.
Nomination of candidates on the sectoral principle is carried out on the basis of the industry classifier of the Association of Managers: information technology, commercial banks, forestry and timber processing industry, mechanical engineering, media business, metallurgy, diversified holdings, professional services, communications and telecommunications, service and production of consumer goods, insurance, construction, trade, transport, financial sector, pharmaceuticals, chemical industry, energy and fuel complex.
Each participant is provided with a login and password to enter the site www.top1000.amr.ru, where they see information about other participants and can put their scores on the criteria proposed for each functional area.
The methodology for building the rating is based on the principle of "The best choose the best": top managers evaluate top managers, functional managers evaluate functional managers.
Such a principle allows you to get the most authentic assessment of the professional reputation of colleagues.
The final results of the rating are approved at meetings of expert commissions.
All interested candidates of the rating of the current year and multiple candidates of the rating of previous years are invited to face-to-face meetings of expert commissions.
Commissions are organized on a functional basis: a commission for approving the list of top managers and eight commissions for approving heads of functional areas.
At the meetings of the expert commissions, it is proposed to approve the submitted lists in alphabetical order (the places are retained strictly according to the Internet assessment and are classified information until the publication of the rating) or to make updating adjustments to them in accordance with the attached list of reserve candidates.
The names of the companies are given in accordance with the rules of the Russian language and the norms of "Kommersant".
At the time of publication of the rating, changes in the status of managers and companies are possible.
A comfortable rate for investment credit is 10-13%.
According to experts, the lending market for small and medium-sized businesses in January-April of this year sank by 40%.
What, in your opinion, is the situation today?
After the panic sentiments of late 2014 - early 2015, the volume of lending to SMEs decreased significantly.
The reason is clear: a sharp increase in interest rates.
Lending at 25-30% per annum was not beneficial to anyone.
If earlier the bank could put in the increased rate all its possible problems in the future, from delays to non-returns, now it is impossible to do this: the rates are already sky-high.
For business, the current level of interest rates on SME loans is uncomfortable.
For a significant part of investment projects, the current level is unacceptable from the point of view of their payback.
The level of rates of 10-13% would allow businesses to invest in a wide range of projects and form attractive profitability on them.
To what extent, according to your estimates, is the demand of entrepreneurs for loans satisfied?
After the central bank lowered the interest rate, the situation improved slightly.
Credit resources have become more accessible.
However, according to our observations, customers began to apply for loans much less often.
First of all, the business does not understand the prospects for its development and future revenues.
Today, business has one way out: it is necessary to learn how to work, focusing on the current economic situation in the country and the region.
It is necessary to monitor the current results more closely, to control the movement of funds.
At the same time, if financial resources are available, it is worth using new technologies that allow you to modernize equipment, reduce production costs and energy supply.
All this, ultimately, allows the company to make products more competitive and keep the business even in an unstable economic situation.
What are the main trends in the SME lending market that will strengthen and influence its development by the end of 2015?
Will the interest rate change?
The forecast for lowering the average rate will largely depend on the policy of the Central Bank, and now the regulator demonstrates consistency in the issue of lowering the key rate.
However, a radical drop in the price of loans for SMEs should not be expected.
In the current situation, the problem, first of all, is inflation, which makes it necessary to increase the interest rate to obtain real income.
In addition, the cost of money in Russia will remain high even with a reduction in the rates of the Central Bank.
If we talk about the level of delinquency, then traditionally small and medium-sized businesses, limited both in the possibilities of replenishing funds and in the options for correcting economic behavior, will certainly pose a greater risk to creditors.
I would not expect a significant reduction in the share of bad loans.
The main reason is international sanctions and their negative impact on the country's economy.
New Mazda CX-5 and street fashion.
This is how the word Mazda is spelled in Japanese characters.
Beautiful, concise and at the same time quite difficult for those who are accustomed to the Cyrillic or Latin alphabet.
So the new crossover CX-5, as, indeed, any other model of the brand: without pretentiousness is attractive from the outside, technically perfect inside.
Japanese simply by virtue of its "Japaneseness" is able to bring the attachment to the products of the Land of the Rising Sun to a state of complete delight.
You can argue as much as you like in favor of cars from other countries, and a person will even agree with these arguments in principle, but the whole conversation will crumble from the final phrase: "But this is a Japanese car!
There's nothing to argue about!
Such people should probably love not only technology, but everything else Japanese.
Quoting Basse on the fly, flavoring wasabi food, collecting katanas and dressing your girlfriend - no, not in a kimono, of course, but according to the canons of Japanese street fashion: cute, creative and quite unexpected.
Perhaps the Japanese school uniform is the only uniform that girls wear with pleasure after graduation.
It has amazing properties: both sensual and strict.
And the older the girl, the shorter the skirt.
The main change in the exterior of the CX-5 is the grille with five horizontal lines.
But much more strongly changes the appearance of the car new pattern of headlights and taillights, by which the car is instantly recognized in the flow of cars.
As before, the Mazda CX-5 looks very tempting.
The silhouette is harmonious, the forms are sensual, but the appearance has a touch of severity.
You don't have to call the police.
Behind the wheel of the CX-5, one of the safest in the world, you can only experience stoic Japanese calm.
The 2.2-liter diesel engine provides high torque over a wide range of speeds.
At the same time, the fuel consumption of this engine with a capacity of 175 liters. from.- Only 5.9 liters The power unit is equipped exclusively with an automatic transmission and all-wheel drive.
Black shoes, black raincoat, black bag...
To add a little black humor to this image, you can choose leggings with a print from the police tape Not Cross.
However, Mazda made every effort to ensure that behind the wheel of the CX-5 you did not find yourself at the scene of your own accident.
To further increase comfort, while maintaining excellent handling, the suspension has redesigned the design of the front and rear shock absorbers, and also optimized the shape of the bushings of the front lower levers.
The all-wheel drive system is adapted to Russian conditions.
The noise level from the road and the engine at high speeds is reduced by 13%.
A floral or striped swimsuit is as boring as a budget sedan.
Another thing is if the girl flaunts a swimsuit with an original pattern.
For example, from a computer game in the genre of role-playing action.
Then she will get no less attention than the new CX-5!
The new CX-5 has an improved design for both the front and rear seats, which provides optimal space for both wide shoulders and long legs - who has what.
Still long-legged will surely appreciate the fact that the stops in front of the central tunnel are now soft and do not hit the ankles in turns.
The widest range of active safety systems Mazda is offered on the CX-5.
In order to recognize a potential threat, radars, lasers and cameras are used here.
There is adaptive lighting, and a warning about leaving the lane, and monitoring of dead zones, and safe braking.
The Mazda CX-5 has one of the best boots in the class.
Comfortable, having a minimum of protrusions, it accommodates a load of 561 liters. the Rear seats fold in a ratio of 4: 2: 4 - while each section is equipped with a separate remote lever - and increase the luggage compartment to 1560 liters.
The costume of the cartoon hero in Japan is called "kigurumi".
Especially perky is the one-size-fitsse pajamas.
Everything is possible in it!
Sleep, of course.
But also to entertain young children.
Or just walking such an animal down the street...
After all, it is so great when there is an opportunity to choose - cool clothes, a manner of behavior or a car.
Thank you for your help in preparing the material store Kawaicat.
Kiev broke the atomic union.
Kiev has officially formalized Ukraine's refusal to cooperate with Russia on the completion of the Khmelnitsky nuclear power plant.
The Verkhovna Rada on Wednesday on the second attempt still voted to terminate the agreement with Moscow.
Agreements on the completion of the third and fourth units were signed in 2010-2012, but it was not possible to start implementing the project.
On Wednesday, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine adopted a law terminating the agreement concluded in 2010-2012 with the Russian Federation on the construction of the third and fourth units at the Khmelnitsky NPP.
It was possible to pass the bill introduced by the government of the country only from the second vote, the first time it was supported by 210 deputies with the necessary minimum of 226, but then 234 members of parliament voted for the project when re-voting.
According to the original project, the Khmelnitsky NPP, founded under the USSR, was supposed to have four power units of 1 GW each with VVER-type reactors, but only two managed to be built.
Negotiations with Moscow on completion led to the conclusion of an intergovernmental agreement in 2010, in 2011-2012 the Rada adopted the relevant laws.
Since there were no funds in the budget of Ukraine, it was assumed that the blocks would have to be built on a loan from the Russian side, but the funds were never allocated.
After the coup in Kiev in February 2014 and the subsequent cooling in relations between the two countries, Kiev began to curtail relations with Moscow in the nuclear industry, announcing its refusal to cooperate on the Khmelnitsky nuclear power plant and on the project to build a nuclear fuel plant in Ukraine.
The only area where relations were preserved was the purchase of fuel for existing Ukrainian nuclear power plants in the Russian Federation (they provided about half of the country's electricity generation), since so far the Ukrainian NNEGC Energoatom has nothing to replace Russian supplies.
Plans for the completion of the Khmelnitsky nuclear power plant with another contractor in Ukraine have not yet been finally abandoned: back in 2014, Kiev announced negotiations with the Czech Skoda JS.
The UN Secretary-General is against the use of military force in the settlement of the Syrian conflict.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon during a press conference said that it is impossible to resolve the situation in Syria by military means.
"There is no military solution," AP quotes his answer to a question about Russia's military support for Syria.
Ban Ki-moon also said that he would hold a meeting with the foreign ministers of the permanent members of the UN Security Council on the situation in Syria.
I will meet with the foreign ministers of the permanent members of the UN Security Council later this month.
"The meeting will be on Syria," he said.
Earlier today, Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces Nikolai Bogdanovsky said that the General Staff does not exclude the possibility of creating an air force base in Syria in the future.
So far, there are no such plans.
"But anything can happen," Mr. Bogdanovsky said.
Earlier, Kommersant reported that the United States does not trust Russian President Vladimir Putin, who said that military assistance to official Damascus is necessary to combat the Islamic State terrorist group banned in the Russian Federation.

The OSCE PA reports on a possible meeting of parliamentarians of Ukraine and Russia.
The head of the Ukrainian delegation to the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly (PA) Artur Gerasimov announced the possibility of a bilateral meeting this year with Russian colleagues-parliamentarians to discuss the situation in the south-east of Ukraine.
"What I know is that a certain meeting is planned this year, possibly between the Ukrainian and Russian parliamentary delegations," TASS quoted Mr. Gerasimov as saying.
He also called for the implementation of the Minsk agreements and "to return to the normal functioning of our countries."
When asked whether, in his opinion, a dialogue between Ukraine and Russia at the parliamentary level is currently possible - in the "Normandy format" or in the format of a contact group at the OSCE PA - Mr. Gerasimov noted that the dialogue was held, there are Minsk agreements.
At the same time, according to the politician, Kiev supports any kind of dialogue.
Earlier, the representative of Ukraine at the talks, ex-President Leonid Kuchma said that the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Lugansk republics have not yet fundamentally changed their positions in the trilateral negotiations, but the tone of the dialogue has become more positive.
The parties were given mandates.
Yesterday, the election commission of Nizhny Novgorod summed up the results of the elections to the city Duma in the municipal district, distributing 12 deputy mandates played out on party lists.
Traditionally, many complaints about violations during the elections were heard from representatives of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, who accused the electoral commission of "covering up falsifications."
The opposition's comments were not accepted.
At the same time, the electoral commission refused to organize a referendum for the Communists of Russia party regarding the abolition of fees for the overhaul of apartment buildings.
The city election commission officially presented the results of the elections to the City Duma of Nizhny Novgorod in the municipal constituency.
In total, 1.03 million people were included in the voter lists in Nizhny Novgorod, 746.7 thousand ballots were issued for voting in precinct commissions, and 268 thousand voters voted in the elections.
More than 11.7 thousand ballots were declared invalid, and 24 were lost.
Yesterday, 12 seats were distributed among political parties, depending on the votes they received.
According to the lists of "United Russia", six deputy seats in the city duma are due to Dmitry Svatkovsky, Dmitry Krasnov, Vasily Shupranov, Elizaveta Solonchenko, Vyacheslav Rasteryaev and Igor Nagorny.
The only mandate of the LDPR was received by the leader of the party Vladimir Zhirinovsky.
Two mandates of the CpRF are distributed between Vladimir Bulanov and State Duma deputy Alexander Tarnaev.
Three mandates of "Fair Russia" go to Alexander Razumovsky, Igor Bogdanov and Mikhail Shalyugin.
Now, within five days, these candidates must decide whether they will work as deputies in the city Duma: in case of refusal of the mandate, he passes to the next candidate on the party list.
The chairman of the city election commission, Alexander Makeyev, told the members of the commission that he was introducing duty to "send telegrams to Zhirinovsky and others" in order to abandon mandates.
When approving the protocol on the results of the elections, representatives of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation announced multiple violations.
Leonid Krasnokutsky, a member of the city election commission with the right of an advisory vote from the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, proposed not to recognize the results of voting in four districts No. 21-24, recalling that by order of the head of the administration of the Sormovsky district, the entrance to the administration building, where four district commissions were located, was closed.
Neither the deputies of the State Duma, nor the candidates themselves, nor observers could go inside for a long time, and the resonant scandal with the storming of the doors of the district administration was shown on television.
At the meetings of the district commissions, all observers and members of the commissions with the right of advisory vote had the opportunity to attend.
The head of them stopped access only when the voting ended and the precinct commissions had not yet arrived to hand over their ballots.
This was done in order to prevent various provocations.
"Then the head was corrected, and at all meetings interested persons could be present," retorted a member of the city election commission Natalia Andryushina.
The Communists objected that lyudmila Aristova, a deputy of the Regional Legislative Assembly, had been illegally detained in the blocked administration building for more than four hours, about which a statement was sent to the Investigative Committee.
The opposition also complained that a number of polling stations on election day began to seal the ballot boxes at 6-7 o'clock in the morning, posting ballot papers for early voting in them.
At the same time, no one notified the members of the commissions with the right of advisory vote and observers, so they came to the beginning of the elections at 8 am.
Communists are sure that in the morning hours before the opening of polling stations, ballots could be thrown into the ballot boxes uncontrollably.
However, the city election commission, which has already considered more than 124 complaints on various occasions, according to Alexander Makeev, did not find any violations with the stuffing of unaccounted ballots.
The members of the commission also did not support the proposal of their colleague from the "Fair Russia" Maria Popova through the regional election commission to come up with amendments to regional legislation in order to clearly establish the time of opening envelopes with early voting ballots, which then fall into the ballot box.
"As part of your own initiative, please at least contact the CEC," Alexander Makeyev advised Ms Popova.
At the end of the meeting, a member of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, Sergei Samokhin, lashed out at the chairman with loud accusations, shouting that the election commission was ignoring dozens of complaints and covering up falsifications in the elections.
"You are not here at a rally, be careful to declare!" the chairman of the election commission was offended.
As a result, the protocol was approved almost unanimously.
By September 27, the electoral commission must approve the overall results of the elections, after which the first meeting of the Nizhny Novgorod City Duma of the sixth convocation will be scheduled within three weeks.
In addition to determining the results of the elections, the city election commission refused to register the political party "Communists of Russia" as an initiative group for holding a local referendum.
Judging by the documents, the party members were going to bring two questions to the discussion of Nizhny Novgorod residents: whether they agree that fees for the overhaul of apartment buildings should be "immediately canceled", and tariffs for housing and communal services should be "frozen until 2020".
However, Duma lawyer Irina Maslova explained that the appeal of the "Communists of Russia" contradicts the law.
FedEx's revenue is mixed, with lower projections for 2016.
FedEx reported disappointing results for the last quarter, and the delivery service giant reduced its annual profit forecast due to falling demand for trucking services and rising costs in its ground transportation division.
The company also said it plans to hire roughly 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
At the same time last year, FedEx said it would hire 50,000 temporary workers for the holidays.
Its shares fell about 2.5 percent in preliminary trading 45 minutes before the exchange opened on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said it plans to earn between $10.40 and $10.90 in the fiscal year that ends next May, down 20 cents from a previous forecast.
Analysts had expected $10.84 according to the FactSet survey.
The downgrade comes despite an average 4.9 percent rise in rates that will take effect Jan. 4 and rising fees for land transportation of heavy or oversized cargo that begins in November.
The company said it still plans to grow revenue year-over-year thanks to lower costs, higher gross revenue and growth in online commerce.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company "performed steadily given weak, relatively than forecast, economic conditions, particularly in manufacturing and global trade."
Plans to hire labor over the holidays were announced the day after a competitor, UPS, announced that it planned to hire an additional 95,000 employees, about the same number it hired last year.
For the quarter that ended Aug. 31, FedEx earned $692 million, up 6 percent from a year earlier.
Earnings per share were $2.42, close to the forecast of an average of $2.44 per share conducted by Zacks Investment Research in a survey of 12 analysts.
Revenue increased 5% to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts polled by Zacks estimated $12.23 billion.
FedEx has suffered in recent years from a downturn in the international urgent services sector, resulting in a lack of gross revenue growth in its express shipping division.
However, the boom in online shopping has dramatically improved the results at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, ground transportation revenue grew by 29%, but operating income remained broadly unchanged due to increased costs for large shipments and self-insurance.
The Express Division received higher revenue due to higher basic rates, while in the freight sector revenue fell due to higher labour costs.
In preliminary trading, about an hour before the opening of the stock exchange, FedEx shares fell by $ 3.85 or 2.5 percent - to $ 150.15.
They closed Tuesday, falling 11 percent for the year and 17 percent below the Record of June 11.
In the most anticipated meeting in years, Federal Reserve officials will spend two days this week at a 27-foot Honduran mahogany table, deciding whether it's time to raise the key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
At one end of the ornate meeting room, two stories high, a wall image of the United States will loom over them.
This map is a reminder that Federal Reserve Chairman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues should put the country's economic interests above all others.
The central bank received a double instruction from Congress: to maximize employment in the United States and keep prices stable here.
But since the Great Recession, federal leaders have recognized that there is a third, unwritten mandate: financial stability.
And that third assignment may prove to be an unknown factor in the near-projected decision, which will be announced On Thursday, on whether the U.S. economy is ready to break away from the unprecedented stimulus provided by near-zero short-term interest rates since late 2008.
Even though most of the data shows strong growth, the recent turmoil in global financial markets could deter already cautious federal system leaders from adding volatility by raising the benchmark federal funds rate — even by as little as a quarter of a percentage point.
"Clearly, the labor market and inflation will be the first and most important subject of consideration," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"However, I think that if they were looking for a reason not to raise rates, the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough to give them an excuse to wait further," she said.
There is no consensus on what the Federal Reserve will do, which in itself provokes fluctuations in the financial market.
About half of the economists recently surveyed by Bloomberg predicted an increase in interest rates this week.
Financial markets, however, expect the federal system to refrain from doing so, with the key indicator showing only a roughly 30 percent chance of a rapid upswing.
This could lead to a fall in the stock market if the federal system raises the rate, provided that decision-makers do not soften the blow with the promise that the next increase will not be soon.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones rose 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.
The takeoff was triggered by expectations that those defining the federal system's strategy would drop bet this week, said John Lonsky, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research.
"It will be a surprise if the federal system raises rates at this point in time," he said.
If federal reserve officials do so, "they will have to go far in approving their strategy to keep financial markets in their hands so they don't panic."
Other experts countered that a rate hike could calm financial markets as it would remove uncertainty about how the federal system would operate.
Just a month ago, the federal system seems inclined to raise rates by 0.25% this month, taking the first small step in a slow tightening of financial conditions that could confirm the strength of the U.S. recovery.
Yellen said in the spring and early summer that she expected a rate hike this year, despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress was needed.
Although the emergence of new jobs slowed in August, labor market growth has been stable this year.
Unemployment fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest in more than seven years, and nearly at what the federal system considers full-time employment.
Wage growth is showing signs of acceleration.
And, although inflation continues to be below the central bank's annual target of 2%, the leadership of the Federal System said that the key reason was the temporary effect of a sharp drop in oil prices.
The economy "can and does cope with higher rates, and needs them, given the shrinking labor market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, financial markets around the world began to shake late last month, after China devalued its currency.
The Average Dow Jones Industrial Average fell as much as 16% from a record high in May as investors feared a slowdown in the Chinese economy could weigh on global growth.
The market has partially regained its position this month, and the Dow Jones index is now about 10% below the high May value.
For the leadership of the Federal Reserve System, market outrage further complicates the difficult calculations of the timing of the interest rate hike.
"In the absence of information about what has happened in the financial markets and news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the past few weeks, they would have tightened the screws at this meeting," said Stephen D. Ohliner, senior researcher at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former Federal Reserve official.
Now, he predicts, they will wait at least a month to gain more control over the aftermath.
"There's a lot of uncertainty about what the implications might be for the U.S. economy, and they have almost no reliable data after the recent events in China," Ohliner said.
The health of the world economy is not a major concern of the Federal System and should not technically be taken into account in these decisions.
But essentially, the Federal Reserve has become the world's financial power.
The influence of the Central Bank in recent years has been enormous.
The mere hint from then-Chairman Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Federal Reserve might "mute" its monetary expansion caused market turmoil around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, one would expect Federal Reserve executives to not only monitor developments everywhere, but also consult with representatives of other central banks and experts to better understand the global economy.
Their decision-making process is "more of an art than a science," said Zachary Karabell, chief executive at Envestnet Inc, a company that focuses on global wealth management strategies.
Jeffrey Laqueur, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Virginia, noted this month that "there have been instances in the history of the Federal Reserve system of overreactions to financial market movements that do not seem to be related to economic principles."
Laqueur, a voting member of the powerful Federal Open Market Committee who pushed for a rate hike, cited the 1998-99 decisions as an example.
The Asian financial crisis has caused the Federal System to cut its benchmark rate by 0.75% in three meetings, "despite limited identifiable implications for U.S. growth," Laqueur said.
A year later, federal system officials reversed those cuts.
The Federal Reserve should prioritize concerns about stability only in times of big crises, such as the market crash in 2008," said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the interest rate committee at the Bank of England.
The latest panic has come nowhere near that level, he said.
"You certainly wouldn't want to be in a situation where you're scared of rising rates because markets are going through a shock," said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for Global Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still has a dual mandate and doesn't mention financial stability, and until that changes, I don't think they should get ahead of the curve.

State Duma Speaker Sergei Naryshkin admits that the United States is deliberately destabilizing the situation in the Middle East so that waves of refugees pour into Europe.
According to Interfax, he expressed this opinion to journalists in Ulaanbaatar at the autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly.
"I am not a supporter of conspiracy theories, but the question arises by itself: is Europe not the ultimate goal of those who, with such maniacal persistence in recent years, destabilized the situation in the countries of North Africa and the Middle East?" he asked.
"After all, surely someone assumed and knew that the flows of refugees, these unfortunate and destitute people who are fleeing from death, will rush to prosperous EU countries," he added.
Naryshkin asked: "How many political leaders in Europe have spoken frankly about the causes of this crisis, this wave of refugees that is now literally sweeping their countries?"
"No, old Europe, with rare exceptions, prefers to remain silent," he said.
According to Naryshkin, NATO tramples on many European values and norms of international law.
"Europe, unfortunately, has long and impartially looked and is watching how the moral ideals and basic fundamental principles and norms of international law are trampled with a military boot sewn according to NATO standards," the speaker emphasized.
Government troops and paramilitary groups loyal to them are opposed by rebels, consisting mainly of Islamists.
Later, the opponents of the Syrian government were joined by the Islamic State terrorist group banned in Russia.
The U.S. supports rebels who oppose both Assad and ISIS.
Official Damascus considers such rebels terrorists.
The Syrian president named the reason for the West's hostility to Russia.
The West's claims to countries such as Syria, Russia and Iran are really that they are sovereign states.
This opinion was expressed by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in an interview with RT, Channel One, Rossiya 24, NTV, Rossiya Segodnya, TASS, Interfax and Rossiyskaya Gazeta.
According to Assad, the West does not perceive partners and sovereign states.
In these countries, he would like to remove one person and put in his place another who will act in the interests of Western countries, and not in the interests of his homeland, he said.
Assad drew attention to the sharp reversal of the Western media with the beginning of the coup in Ukraine.
According to him, for them, Russian President Vladimir Putin "turned from a friend of the West into an enemy, a tsar, a dictator who suppresses the Russian opposition, who came to power in an undemocratic way, despite the fact that he was elected as a result of democratic elections recognized in the West."
Putin called on the world community to join forces with Assad to fight against the Islamic State.
Commenting on the constant statements of the West that Assad himself must go, he noted that the president comes to power with the consent of the people, through elections, and if he leaves, it is at the request of the people, and not by decision of the United States, the UN Security Council, the Geneva Conference or the Geneva Communiqué.
"If the people want them to stay, the president stays, otherwise he should leave immediately," he stressed.
Assad called Russia and Iran friendly countries and recalled that cooperation is carried out with them.
Syria is also fighting terrorism together with neighboring Iraq.
Speaking about military support from Iran, the Syrian leader noted that this country supports the Syrian state in politics, in the economy and in the military sphere.
He denied allegations that Iranian military units were being sent to Syria.
Tehran supplies us with military equipment.
"Naturally, there is an exchange of military specialists between Syria and Iran, but this exchange has always been carried out," he explained.
As for the rest of the States, we are open to cooperation with any of them if there is a serious desire to combat terrorism.
"We do not see this in the case of the so-called anti-terrorist and anti-ISIS coalition, led by the United States," Assad said.
The death toll exceeded 230 thousand people, the number of refugees - 11.5 million.
Part of the territory was seized by the terrorist group "Islamic State", banned in Russia.
The international coalition led by the United States is carrying out air strikes on IS positions.

Lavrov and Kerry discussed the situation in Syria: Politics: Peace: Lenta.ru
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry had a telephone conversation with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.
It is reported by Reuters with reference to the representative of the State Department John Kirby.
It is noted that the topic of the conversation was the conflict in Syria.
However, Kirby did not provide further details.
At the same time, he said that the United States has the tools to "further isolate Russia" if it supports Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, RIA Novosti reports.
According to the Russian Foreign Ministry, Lavrov, during a conversation with Kerry, again stressed the need to create a united front against terrorist groups operating in this country.
They also discussed ways to resolve the Ukrainian crisis, possible steps to reduce tensions on the Korean Peninsula.
In addition, some issues of a bilateral nature were raised.
Earlier, U.S. officials said Russia was building up its military presence in Syria and expressed concern about Moscow's increased support for Assad.
Washington said that if Russia continues to support Assad, it will be even more isolated from the international community.
In response, the press secretary of the President of Russia Dmitry Peskov said that the country will not fall into international isolation.
The rebels are advocating the overthrow of the Assad regime.
Part of the territory was seized by the terrorist organization "Islamic State".
The international coalition led by the United States exposes IS positions to air strikes.
Borodai called the information of the American newspaper a slander against Strelkov.
The former chairman of the government of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, Alexander Borodai, denied the information that was published in the American newspaper The Washington Post.
He said this in a telephone interview with the correspondent of "Lenta.ru".
The Article in the Washington Post is beautiful because everything there is completely misrepresented.
Former DPR Defense Minister Igor Strelkov, of course, was not tied up and he "left" the territory of the Donbass republics in a very high mood, without ropes, without three truckloads of money that are attributed to him by different characters," he said.
According to Borodai, it was really about Strelkov in a conversation with a reporter for an American newspaper.
"Yes, I said that Strelkov urgently needed to be removed from the territory of the Donetsk People's Republic," the former head of the DPR government said.
Borodai stressed that he did not know why the correspondent of the American edition decided to write that Strelkov was taken to the territory of Russia "bound".
I suspect this is a provocation.
If this is not a provocation, then these are surprisingly misunderstood words, since I stressed that Strelkov left himself," Borodai said.
"This is a slander against me and Strelkov," he concluded.
Earlier, an article appeared on the pages of The Washington Post, in which Borodai said that he took Strelkov to the territory of Russia in a forced manner.
According to the publication, Borodai noted that he was forced to tie up his associate.
The Polish authorities began to search for a train with Nazi gold.
Polish loggers have begun to cut down trees above the underground tunnel, where, according to some reports, there is a train with gold from the Third Reich.
Work began on Tuesday, September 15, reports Reuters.
According to military experts, it is necessary to clear the forest in order to verify the reliability of rumors about the railway train with treasures.
Inside the train can be weapons and valuable minerals.
On August 31, the governor of the Lower Silesian Voivodeship of Poland, Tomasz Smolarz, suggested that the new evidence for the existence of a train with gold is no more convincing than the previous ones.
However, the authorities decided to cordon off the search area.
Three days earlier, Poland's deputy culture minister, Piotr Zzuchowski, said that local treasure hunters with a "99 percent probability" had found the same train with the gold of the Third Reich, which is mentioned in legends.
Zhukhovsky noted that if the assumptions are confirmed and the jewels are discovered, they will become the property of the state treasury, while the treasures will not be transferred to Russia.
In mid-August, two clients of the law firm appealed to the authorities of the Polish city of Wałbrzych with the message that they had found a train in a walled-up tunnel at a depth of 70 meters.
The chief narcologist of the Russian Federation proposed to ban the sale of tobacco to persons under 21 years of age.
The chief narcologist of Russia proposed to ban the sale of tobacco until the age of 21.
Evgeny Brun noted that until this age, "any psychoactive substance - tobacco, alcohol, drug - acts especially harmfully."
So he said on the air of the radio station "Moscow Speaks", commenting on the information that the speaker of the Federation Council Valentina Matvienko supported the idea of banning the sale of alcohol to citizens under 21 years of age.
A person matures unevenly.
You can serve in the army from the age of 18, a person is physically ready for this.
Mentally, he is ready for a full life in society from the age of 21.
"It is known from scientific evidence that the brain, its biochemistry, finally matures only by the age of 21," said Brune.
Earlier, a member of the Public Chamber and the head of the sober Russia project, Sultan Khamzaev, told Izvestia that Matvienko supported the initiative to raise the age limit for the sale of alcohol and "agreed, together with the Civic Chamber, to raise this issue again at the site of the upper house of parliament."
According to the activist, a working group will soon be created in the Federation Council to develop a bill under the leadership of Matvienko.
The Bible was asked to check for compliance with the law on information protection of children
A resident of Novosibirsk appealed to the regional prosecutor's office with a request to check the Bible for compliance with the federal law "On the protection of children from information harmful to their health and development", the correspondent of Sib.fm got acquainted with the statement on September 16.
The author of the appeal stated that on August 26, 2015, he purchased a Bible published in 2013 by the Russian Bible Society from the Chitai-Gorod store on Krasny Prospekt.
In the text of the book, he found fragments that, in his opinion, violate the Federal Law "On the Protection of Children from Information Harmful to Their Health and Development".
On September 16, the application was accepted for consideration by the Prosecutor's Office of the city of Novosibirsk.
The response to the appeal of a resident of Novosibirsk will be received within 30 days.
The point is far from banning the book.
It is much more interesting to show the absurdity of the law itself," the applicant commented to Sib.fm.
In addition, this is quite a solid problem that will stir up society.
It will also begin to re-read the Bible, which it has not done before.
Brazilian Union of Pediatricians Rio Grande promotes a healthy diet for breastfeeding women
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS has come up with a scandalous method by which it is going to convince women of the need for proper nutrition during breastfeeding: the method involves the demonstration of images of babies sucking breasts, painted with images of junk food.
The composition of breast milk includes various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, from which children receive all the nutrients they need to form a strong immune system.
Due to the high energy needs, pregnant and women who have given birth are advised to increase the daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day.
However, a recent study suggests that one calorie increase is not the only diet change that mothers should make.
A recent study by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, found that eating healthy in pregnant women actually affects gene expression in children and prevents them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, the negative impact of an unhealthy diet on a child's immune system has been identified.
Near Hamburg, a train rammed a school bus.
Near Hamburg, a train crashed into a school bus that got stuck on the train track.
The 23-year-old female driver, realizing she could not get off the rails, ordered 60 students to leave the vehicle.
And a minute after that, they had a collision in front of their eyes.
It was captured on video by one of the students.
Due to the emergency situation, panic arose among the students.
Some children began to cry and run along the side of the road.
The route still remains blocked.
According to police, miraculously, no one was injured, except for one passenger of the train, who received minor injuries.
The damage from the accident was estimated at 300 thousand euros.
Doctors are calling for a ban on boxing.
The leadership of the Australian Medical Association (AMA) called for a ban on boxing in the country after the death of local athlete David Brown Jr.
On Monday, 28-year-old Brown died from injuries sustained in a fight with Filipino Carlo Magali.
The fight for one of the regional titles according to the International Boxing Federation (IBF) in the weight category up to 57.15 kg, held on Friday, ended with the victory of Magali by knockout in the 12th round.
Brown was hospitalized with a traumatic brain injury.
His condition was assessed as critical and he was put on life support.
In the professional ring, Brown won 22 victories, suffered only two defeats and one fight ended in a draw.
He is survived by two children.
This is the second death among Australian boxers in the last six months.
In March, 23-year-old student Bradon Smith died of injuries sustained in the ring.
Now the AMA recommends not to engage in this sport, and it is better, from its point of view, to ban it altogether.
I understand that this is happening unintentionally," said Steven Parnis, vice president of the organization. -
But in the form in which boxing now exists, there will always be such situations when an athlete receives a hemorrhage or brain injury, which leads either to death or to severe damage.
For this reason, the AMA believes that we cannot continue to live with this.
The Australian Medical Association is an independent professional structure that brings together medical practitioners and medical students.
Sergei Naryshkin called on the OSCE PA to lift sanctions against Russian parliamentarians.
Speaker of the State Duma of the Russian Federation Sergei Naryshkin called the introduction of sanctions against parliamentarians unacceptable.
He stated this while speaking at the session of the OSCE PA in Ulaanbaatar.
We assess this as unacceptable actions, as an attack on the values of parliamentary diplomacy.
"And this should not be repeated, because this is a manifestation of political shamelessness and disregard for the principles of open international dialogue," the politician said.
In addition, Naryshkin called on the participants of the OSCE PA to restore the partnership between Russia and the EU.
Let's bring morality back to politics.
Let us return dialogue and law to the practice of international communication.
Let us return humanistic ideals to the democratic world order.
"Duplicity has never ended well," he said.
Speaking from the rostrum of the Parliamentary Assembly, the Speaker of the Russian State Duma called on parliamentarians to convene an inter-parliamentary contact group on Ukraine.
I urge members to focus on the following specific security tasks.
"First, on the resolution of the Ukrainian crisis through negotiations and the immediate convening of our inter-parliamentary group," Naryshkin said.
He also noted that it is necessary to pay tribute to the OSCE.
"This is almost the only common platform where they are still discussing how to normalize the situation in Ukraine," the politician stressed.
Recall that the autumn session of the Parliamentary Assembly opened on Tuesday, September 15, in Ulaanbaatar and will last until September 18.
I enjoyed the victory for a couple of days.
World champion in athletics Sergey Shubenkov.
This season can be called triumphant for the 24-year-old athlete from Barnaul Sergey Shubenkov.
He managed to win the European Team Championship at his crown distance of 110 meters with hurdles, set several records, and most importantly - become the world champion, and the first in the history of the domestic barrier sprint.
In addition, the athlete recently won the final stage of the Diamond League, taking third place in the overall standings.
"Novye Izvestia" asked Shubenkov to share his impressions of the outgoing season.
Sergey, the season is not over for you yet?
Yes, I am going to perform at the World Military Games, which will be held in October in Korea, and then I will think about rest.
True, I will prepare now at home, in Barnaul, and being at home is still a completely different state.
It's easier than wandering around the world every week.
You once said that autumn is your favorite time of year.
Late August, early September is a great time.
Passions after the main start of the season boiled over, the burden of responsibility no longer presses.
You can compete in pleasure, on the "relaxation".
Plus, you know that the vacation is very soon...
Is there fatigue?
Still, the season is special, a lot of positive emotions ...
Fatigue by the end of the season always accumulates.
And it does not matter what he did more - winning or losing.
Every competition is stressful.
Constant flights, moves - all this does not pass for the body without a trace.
You get tired physically and emotionally.
But now, of course, my emotions are on the rise.
Yeah, I'm just happy!
By the time you finished at the World Championships in Beijing, do you come back often?
Happens.
And you journalists don't let me forget about it.
But in general, I believe that the athlete who lives by old victories, scrolls through his successful races again and again, is bad.
I enjoyed the victory for a couple of days - and we need to move on.
Was the preparation for this wonderful season very different from the usual one?
I can't say there was anything so special.
We started preparing in December, but I missed the winter competitive season.
He trained first at home in Barnaul, then at training camp, then again at home.
It's business as usual.
But with the coach, the task was set: to try to reach a new level, which I had not yet been to.
Almost all of the winter time was spent laying the base.
We ran a bunch of crosses, did exercises on general physical training, which included a deadlift, a squat, and a back we pumped.
Then we started barrier training, we did a lot of equipment.
Have you been watching how the opponents are performing?
I always try to do this, fortunately in the age of the Internet there is no problem with this.
I watched the Winter European Championships, and there in the barrier sprint the whole podium was occupied by the French!
I thought again: we need to do something, dilute this company.
With every start this season, you've improved and added to the results.
Did that give you confidence?
For me, all the last seasons have been formed according to approximately the same pattern.
It's not like I run 13.20 first and then 13.50.
I always unwind my form gradually.
The main thing I wanted to do was run out of 13 seconds.
All work was aimed primarily at this result.
But the paradox is that you seem to feel that you are ready for feats, and at competitions it is not always possible to show your readiness.
How was it, for example, at the Olympics in London?
To be honest, I tried to forget that semifinal race (Shubenkov could not qualify for the final. - "NI") immediately.
I was ready very well, I could really run out of 13 seconds.
Yes, even if he repeated his best result at that time, he would have become a bronze medalist of the Games.
But no luck.
Do you remember your first World Cup?
How about this?
In Daegu it was.
I really wanted to get into the final, there was such a program-maximum.
And fell right off the morning, in the preliminary races.
Then I realized that to vomit and rush headlong means not to run anywhere at all.
Two years later, at the World Championships in Moscow, he reached the final with the best time.
I remember well my feelings before the decisive race: I really wanted to win the "gold" even then!
How is it possible, developing a decent speed, not to lose your head, not to disconnect?
And that's the hardest part.
You need to be very careful, focused on technique, so as not to knock down barriers.
I noticed that when you tune in not to the result, but to the process, it is much easier.
And the most high is when you have a feeling that you are running and everything seems to work out by itself!
Honestly, it's worth it.
Many of our athletes from the hinterland, after the first serious successes, strive to move closer to the capital.
Never had such thoughts?
Houses are still better.
And I have no idea where I am without my coach, who needs me?
Maybe it would be nice to have better conditions, but I try to be happy with what I have.
Have you been together with Klevtsov for a long time?
From the age of 12, ever since he came to athletics.
More precisely, first I trained with his wife, who worked with children, and then she handed me over.
I started with a sprint, then I jumped in the long jump, triple.
Children's all-around was - this is when they throw a ball, jump in the long jump from a place ...
At 14 I tried hurdles and I loved it.
From the very first race it was possible to fulfill the standard of the second adult category.
And so it stayed.
Was there never a fear of barriers?
Somehow I immediately managed to negotiate with them.
But we always had to work very the technique.
Out over one acceleration how much I suffered!
But there's no getting away from that routine.
The technique must be honed constantly - so that at night I can be woken up, I would immediately get up and run over the barriers.
Everyone who has seen your race in Beijing claims that it was a very beautiful run.
Thank you.
I liked it myself.
I don't usually revise my runs, but I couldn't resist.
But we need to continue to work on efficiency - there are no limits to perfection.
Are you not afraid now that the victory a year before the Olympic Games will fall on your shoulders as a heavy burden?
As they say in such cases, I will try to meet expectations.
Once he has chosen this road, then he must go to the end.
My coach likes to say: if you are not a weakling, you should not feel any additional burden.
And I absolutely agree with him on that.
Otar Kushanashvilli
Well, I am not so naïve that I was amazed by the reaction to the interview that happened in Ukraine.
People are angry, I understand, do not feed them bread - give, throw up the enemy.
And although I didn't wrap myself around the flag, and I said exactly the same thing a million times here, and didn't directly call anyone a bastard, I was hurt by something else.
All my pseudo-friends instantly evaporated somewhere in a second.
The pressure I am subjected to is so strong that even I, who have seen the types of boys, think that people have eaten white.
It's like walking, walking, and you were attacked by a mob and well, muddy with rods.
But you need to know me, I'm not a room eagle, I'm a fist, I'm going to get out of a howitzer, I'm old guys to be afraid.
Another thing is no support.
I had no illusions, but now...
The best thing about me has always been self-sufficiency, so take a bite.
And only assholes can give passports to freaks like Fred Durst or Monson.
I, the best journalist, would rather have an unashamed job.
A week ago in Kiev, Otar Kushanashvili sharply described the Crimean events:
What was done to the Crimean peninsula is a crime.
This is what is called annexation.
I believe that the reference to how a drunken Khrushchev tried to sign something in no way fits into the general picture of human coexistence.
It's like coming to a neighbor and taking his living space...
The war from the Kremlin has gone, and it will end only there.
I am almost 100% sure that, like the summer of 2008, it began with a call from some bastard from the Kremlin dungeon.
I have guesses who it could have been...
Kobzon does not have much left to live.
I don't understand, he's the greatest entertainer, why he needs to lick Putin's hands.
Will he lose his apartment?
Well, they demolished a monument to him.
Of course, people remembered him as insulting his small homeland.
And reconciliation now depends only on Vladimir Vladimirovich.
Sunrise seventh leads the rankings despite Ninth's attempts to highlight the leaders' loss on the Today Show
The foray of Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberra to cover the consequences of the Liberal Party's statement to vacate the leadership seat failed to boost Today's ratings much.
The morning show of the Ninth was broadcast from the capital of the state after malcolm Turnbull's defeat of Tony Abbott.
Rival Sunrise – with presenters David Koch and Samantha Armitage – stuck in London as part of a week-long series of international broadcasting that also includes Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This distance torture didn't seem to matter much to Australian viewers, with Sunrise's audience numbering 397,000 viewers in the five biggest cities, compared to Today's audience of 339,000.
Today scored slightly more compared to its rankings on Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its figure was worse than last Thursday (343,000).
Today has been closing the gap with Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today had 318,000 compared to Sunrise's 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the gap hovered between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise has 349,000 viewers versus Today's 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that happened all morning.
The winds of change are affecting more than Parliament this morning, folks!
Carl and Lisa are fine, thanks for the clarification!
Published today on Monday, September 14, 2015
Big news for Seventh was 800 Words' stunning debut with former Packed to the Rafters star Eric Thomson.
The new drama about the recently widowed father of the family, who decides to move to New Zealand on the coast with his two children, gathered an impressive audience of 1.219 million viewers.
Critics speculated whether Thomson could handle the popular show alone, without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's result was a resounding yes.
The Seventh's X Factor remained in a strong position with an audience of 1.136 million viewers, easily beating The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
For the Seventh, luck and failure on the second evening of Chase Australia were mixed.
The first half hour (from 17:00 to 17:30) of the new TV quiz, which was hosted by Andrew O'Keefe, gathered 446,000 spectators.
For the second half hour (5:30 p.m. to 6 p.m.), the figure jumped to 623,000 viewers — enough for a small win over Eddie McGuire's Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday night, Chase Australia gathered 520,000 spectators for the first half hour and an overwhelming 720,000 for the second half hour.
Hot Seat raised 620,000.
Chase Australia's drop in ratings on the second night will force ninth to quietly acknowledge that Hot Seat will still dominate at 5.30am.
Chase Australia is a replacement for Million Dollar Minute, which failed to beat McGwire's show.

The three finalists agree that "The Bachelor" Sam Wood is the perfect guy, but who will he choose?
Secret revealed? ...
Lana Jevon-Fellowes, Sarah McKay and Snezhana Marcoski may have accidentally made it clear which of them would win In The Bachelor.
The woman with whom Sam Wood will eventually remain in "The Bachelor" is surrounded by a veil of secrecy.
And the three girls who reached the final, of course, remain silent about which of them received his last rose.
But when we met Sarah McKay, Snezhana Marcoski and Lana Jevons-Fellowes on the eve of the day when two of the three girls should be left, they may have inadvertently given a clue about the winner.
Sam Wood has steadfastly remained silent until Thursday's finale.
All three women come into a lyrical mood, telling why Wood is an ideal man, while mentioning his sense of humor, dedication, family values, cheerfulness as reasons why each of them would be happy to become his companion.
However, with their answers to the question "If not you, then who should get Wood's last rose?" they could unwittingly tell you which of them really won the heart of "The Bachelor".
Jevons-Fellowes and Marcoski did not hesitate to call McKay the perfect couple for Wood.
Sarah and Sam had a good relationship from day one.
"From the moment I joined the contestants, I felt the energy of (Sarah) and the energy of Sam and knew they were very suitable for each other, and throughout the show I had no doubt about that," Jevons-Fellowes said.
"Sarah is a very open person, it's easy and fun with her," Marcoski added.
I saw them together, there really is an attraction between them.
They feel great and comfortable with each other.
Sarah McKay thinks she and Sam Wood will make a great pairing.
McKay herself said that thanks to home visits last week, she realized that Wood may be "the same person."
"As soon as I saw him among my friends and family, I realized that this was definitely not just a game - I believed him with all my heart," she says.
When asked who to choose Voodoo if it wasn't her, she answered cryptically.
"I don't know if I can talk about it," she said.
I like both girls equally, and Snezhana and Lana deserve it equally.
The Bachelor shows airs on Wednesdays at 7:30 p.m. on Ten.

Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle became very interested in him after his move to the U.S. — as did a host of other clubs that sent in requests after an impressive open training day late last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsul and it seems to have been a wise decision.
Some coaches would have left Hayn on the bench for the rest of the game for the loss of the ball, which the former Australian Rugby League player made on the first return of the pant in a 20-3 win over Minnesota.
But Tomsula believed in his player and gave Hayne another opportunity to get his pantry back, as well as using him in the game after Reggie Bush's injury.
Tomsula showed his best side after the game, in the dressing room.
Instead of smashing the newcomers in the presence of the team, he cheered them up.
Thomsula also publicly backed Hayn at the post-match press conference.
49ers special reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne also received support from special teams coordinator Thomas McGoy, who advised him to forget about the lost ball and think about the next game.
Jarryd Hayne lost the ball on the return of the antlers by the Minnesota Vikings during the first quarter.
Hayne and his numerous Australian fans clearly did not count on such a start to his NHL debut.
Hayne was seen swearing as he walked off the pitch after losing the ball, and he later told the hosts of "Hamish and Andy" on Australian radio station 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not have imagined a more misguided start to his NFL career.
"It happens, you just think about the next game and that's it," Hayne said.
Hayne compared his miss to his debut in the Origin series of games in 2007, when throwing the ball in his own scoring zone brought a try to Queensland.
In the end, this experience turned out to be very useful for the 27-year-old player.
Hayne took a picture with the Australian flag and fans after the game and posted the picture on Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia's richest man, was arrested at gunpoint at a Siberian airport.
Openly challenging President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company, Yukos, was confiscated, and his attempts to develop democracy were thwarted.
On the border of Hungary there were clashes between migrants and the police.
Refugees staged protests on the border of Serbia near the Hungarian village of Reske, which escalated into clashes with law enforcement officers.
As a result, the Hungarian police used water cannons and tear gas, reports Reuters.
Migrants throw stones at the police and try to demolish the fence installed at the border.
Reinforcements have been sent to the site of the clashes, and the police are taking action in response to aggressive actions by migrants and their attempts to violate the border.
According to Agence France-Presse, the refugees managed to break through the police cordon, after which dozens of migrants fled to the territory of Hungary.
Some refugees leave the Serbian-Hungarian border by bus in the direction of Belgrade and the border with Croatia, the BBC reports.
The authorities of the country allowed migrants to arrive on Croatian territory and ensure their transportation from there to the desired country.
According to the Hungarian authorities, 20 police officers were injured.
On September 15, the Hungarian parliament tightened its legislation on migration and border protection.
The amendments provide for the participation of the army in the protection of state borders, the criminal prosecution of those who illegally cross the border, as well as an accelerated procedure for the consideration of asylum requests.
A Hungarian court has already found one migrant guilty of illegally crossing the Hungarian-Serbian border, in connection with which he will be deported and will not be able to return to Hungary for one year.
Also, the Hungarian parliament in the near future intends to consider the transfer to the Hungarian armed forces of the functions of protecting the border of the country's parliament.
At the end of June, the Hungarian authorities began construction of a barbed-wire fence with a length of 175 km on the border with Serbia to curb the flow of migrants and refugees into the country.
The Russian admitted to committing the largest cyber attack in the history of the United States.
Accused in the largest cyber attack in the history of the United States, Russian Vladimir Drinkman admitted to stealing more than 160 million credit card numbers, reports Reuters.
During the trial in Federal Court in New Jersey, Drinkman pleaded to conspiracy to gain unauthorized access to computer systems and to commit fraud.
During the meeting, the Russian spoke about collusion with three Russian citizens and a citizen of Ukraine, who are accused of cyber attacks on 15 companies.
The total damage from the actions of the accused was estimated at $ 300 million.
"Defendants like Vladimir Drinkman, who have the skills to hack into our computer networks, pose a threat to our economic well-being, privacy and national security," U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman said in a statement.
Drinkman faces 30 years in prison, as well as a fine of one million dollars.
When sentencing, the court will take into account the confessions of the Russian and, possibly, reduce his sentence.
Drinkman's sentence will be announced on January 15.
Vladimir Drinkman was arrested in the Netherlands in 2012.
At the same time, another suspect, Dmitry Smilyanets, was taken into custody.
The latter denies his guilt in the crimes charged to him.
Kerry warned Lavrov of the risk with Russia's support for Bashar al-Assad's regime.
During a telephone conversation with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, US Secretary of State John Kerry warned that Russia's support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is exacerbating the conflict in the country.
"Secretary Kerry has made it clear that Russia's support for President Assad risks exacerbating and expanding the conflict, as well as undermining our shared goal of countering extremism, if we do not focus on finding a solution to the conflict in Syria through an effective political transition of power," the U.S. State Department said in a statement posted on its website.
Kerry reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to fighting the Islamic State group (which is banned in Russia by the Supreme Court) as part of a coalition of more than 60 states.
According to the Secretary of State, Assad "can never be a reliable member" of the coalition.
Also during the telephone conversation, Kerry stressed that the conflict in Syria can be resolved only through a political transition from Assad.
The White House threatened Russia with isolation because of its support for the Assad regime.
The day before, White House press secretary Joshua Earnest threatened Russia with isolation if it did not stop supporting Assad.
As an alternative, Earnest offered to join the international coalition, which is conducting an anti-terrorist operation against the Islamic State.
Recently, the media have often reported on the presence of Russian servicemen in Syria.
To which the head of the Russian Foreign Ministry, Sergei Lavrov, said that Russian soldiers have been in Syria for many years and are helping the Syrians to master the technique in order to use it against Islamists.
Four were killed when police opened fire with rubber bullets on protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal when police fired rubber bullets at a crowd protesting the country's proposed new constitution, a spokesman said Wednesday.
The violence occurred on Tuesday night in Rupandei District, about 175 miles west of Kathmandu, the country's capital.
Bishnu Prasad Dakal, the head of the district police, said more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside one of the police stations, some throwing stones and firebombs.
Mr Dakal said police used tear gas, then fired in the air before firing rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were wounded, he said.
It's not clear why rubber bullets, which are known to kill but have traditionally been used as a less lethal alternative, have caused such a high mortality rate.
The clash was the latest in weeks of violent protests in southern, lowland Nepal, where Madezi claim the new provinces formed under the new constitution would reduce their political influence.
Protests also took place in western Nepal, among the Taru people who want to have their own state.
At least 40 people, including eleven police officers, have been killed in violent clashes, starting with 10.
August, when the four main political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces, a crucial step towards a new constitution, but a highly contentious issue in Nepal that had been centrally governed for several centuries.
Work on a new constitution has been underway since 2008, but lawmakers have accelerated the process after a devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
Lawmakers voted on articles of the draft constitution in Kathmandu this week, and officials said a new chapter would be signed by Sunday.
Sayansk plans to create an enterprise for 900 jobs.
Sayansk is the youngest city in the Irkutsk region.
It was built in the 70s of the last century as a center of the chemical industry, has a developed infrastructure that requires system support.
A year ago, Sayansk was headed by a new mayor - Oleg Borovsky.
He told the correspondent of the "Regional" about the results of the first year of work, about new projects and prospects.
Oleg Valeryevich, how did you start your work as mayor?
First of all, I got acquainted with the results of inspections of financial and economic activities, initiated an independent audit examination of the expenditure of local budget funds.
Then an audit of municipal property was carried out.
One of the first practical steps was to reduce the workflow to five days.
Previously, papers on the authorities could go for months.
Measures were developed to increase the revenue base and optimize costs.
In November last year, a visiting meeting of the government was held in Sayansk, where issues of socio-economic development of the territory were considered.
The city did not have design and estimate documentation (DED) for any object.
Without this, Sayansk could not take part in federal programs.
We started with the preparation of a DED for roads, a kindergarten, a northern sewer collector and a water pipeline.
Now road works on two sections are already underway.
How is the decree of the President of the Russian Federation on the construction of kindergartens being implemented in the city?
In July of this year, 105 babies were born in Sayansk.
Such a positive demography in the city has not been observed in the last 27 years.
So the issue of providing places in kindergartens today is one of the most urgent.
Since September 1, kindergarten No. 10, designed for 320 places, has been closed for major repairs.
The estimated cost of repairs is 86 million rubles.
The city has never received such funds so far.
Last year, after repairs, kindergarten No. 23 was opened, which is now attended by 200 children.
The repair was made on the terms of co-financing from the regional and local budgets, its cost amounted to more than 67 million rubles.
Thanks to the efforts of the administration and the assistance of the regional government, funds were found for the purchase of furniture and equipment, and the "People's Initiatives" program also helped.
There are plans to start construction of a new kindergarten in 2016.
With its introduction, we plan to eliminate the queue of children aged one and a half to three years.
We do not have queues for children from three to seven years old.
Are investors interested in the Territory?
We have a clear understanding that construction in the city should be carried out, first of all, by Sayan enterprises, it is they who need to be provided with work.
Already in October, a 60-apartment building for orphans in the Leningradsky microdistrict will be put into operation.
As for construction, I will add that Sayansk is one of the four cities of the Angara region, which was included in the program for the construction of economy-class housing.
All the necessary documentation has been prepared.
The construction of 90 block sections will begin in the near future.
In total, we announced the construction of 10 thousand square meters. m of housing There are a lot of people who want to participate in the program.
One of the conditions is that housing should not be more expensive than 30 thousand rubles per square meter, this cost includes turnkey finishing.
If we cope with the specified volumes, we will continue to participate in the program.
As for investors, we have other interesting projects.
At one time, the Sayan pig complex was built on the territory, which in 2004 was sold for a pittance.
We are working with the prosecutor's office to appeal against this transaction.
Moreover, the land under the object is federally owned.
Work is underway with Moscow, the issue of transferring 88 hectares to regional ownership, with the subsequent transfer of land to the municipality, is being resolved.
There is a potential investor who is ready to invest 1.5 billion rubles in the reconstruction and launch of the project.
With the launch of the pig farm, we will have 900 jobs, which will be of great help to the city.
Is the institute of social partnership developed in Sayansk?
We have concluded about 140 contracts of socio-economic partnership.
Many projects were implemented thanks to the active social position of business representatives.
Tangible support is provided by such enterprises as CJSC "Vostok-Center", Novo-Ziminskaya CHPP, LLC "Sayan Broiler", LLC "PC MDF", the management of these enterprises responds to all appeals.
Directly for the Day of the City, Sayan Broiler LLC presented the city with a children's town, the Vostok-Center company repaired the equestrian courtyard, where specialists are engaged in children and patherapy, spending more than 1 million rubles on this.
Thanks to sponsorship funds, it was possible to improve the territory of the city registry office.
Sponsors helped to colorfully celebrate the City Day.
As in the good old days, a parade was held with the participation of city collectives and organizations.
A chronicle of the city, a book of Sayan poets was published.
The first builders and people who made a serious labor contribution to the development of Sayansk were awarded commemorative medals.
Patrons also participate in the work of the city charitable foundation.
The very first step was to purchase instruments for young talented musicians.
For nine months, more than 800 thousand rubles were allocated to support talented children, to help children in need of expensive treatment, to support children from low-income families.
How are personnel problems in the social sphere solved in Sayansk?
The city lacks doctors and subject teachers.
To solve the personnel issue, it is of great importance to provide specialists with housing.
Over the past year, we have allocated five apartments for doctors, four teachers have received service housing.
We have a program for the allocation of housing with the possibility of privatizing it in five years.
The plans include the redevelopment of the building, in which eight more apartments for teachers will be built.
Also, teachers and doctors participate in the program "Housing for the Russian family".
In the future - the construction of a house for public sector workers.
The most important thing is that the city has a workable team with which I can solve the most difficult issues.
It is important to draw the right conclusions from all crises, and life will not stop.
The potential of Sayansk and our region is great.
A bill on the indexation of social pensions taking into account price increases has been submitted to the Duma.
A bill has been submitted to the State Duma providing for the indexation of social pensions annually from February 1, taking into account price increases.
The author of the document - a deputy from the "Fair Russia" Alexander Lomakin-Rumyantsev - also proposes to conduct additional indexation of pensions on April 1, if the growth rate of the subsistence minimum exceeds the growth rate of prices for goods and services.
Indexation of social pensions, according to the current legislation, is carried out annually from April 1, taking into account the growth rate of the subsistence minimum of a pensioner in the Russian Federation over the past year.
The draft law submitted to the lower house provides for the introduction of indexation of social pensions taking into account the growth rate of consumer prices.
At the same time, the first indexation is postponed to February 1, and the second is held on April 1.
The head of the OSCE PA said Mogherini about the inadmissibility of imposing sanctions against parliamentarians.
In an official letter to the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs Federica Mogherini, the OSCE PA Speaker Ilkka Kanerva stated the inadmissibility of sanctions against legislators participating in the events of the Assembly.
This was reported to journalists by a member of the Russian delegation at the autumn session of the OSCE PA in Ulaanbaatar Nikolai Kovalev.
According to TASS, in support of Kanerva's position, signatures of European parliamentarians, including representatives of Germany, France, Italy, Cyprus, and Greece, were collected.
"Quite strong support has already been formed," Kovalev said.
Earlier, he stated that the head of the OSCE PA spoke with the intention of collecting signatures of deputies who pointed out the inadmissibility of imposing sanctions against parliamentarians.
In particular, Kovalev noted, Kanerva promised to raise this problem to the level of the eu leadership structures and "send an appropriate petition."
The NHC reports that the probability of a cyclone south of the Cape Verde Islands is 60 percent.
A wide front of a low-pressure area about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southern tip of the Cape Verde Islands has a 60 percent chance of turning into a tropical cyclone over the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said Tuesday.
Another well-defined area of low pressure roughly halfway between the Cape Verde Islands and the Lesser Antilles also has a 60 percent chance of a tropical cyclone forming in the next two days, forecasters from Miami said.
Google Launches Doubling Donation Campaign to Raise $11 Million for Refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL. O) announced a doubling campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations helping refugees fleeing war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google took an uncharacteristic personal approach when announcing a fundraising campaign on its blog.
Instead of being made by one of the executives, Google employee Rita Masood, who fled with her family from Kabul when she was seven years old, described her personal experience.
"We traveled on dubious trains and buses, endured hunger, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.
I was lucky.
But as Europe's refugee and migrant crisis has intensified, many people like my family are in desperate need of help.
Donations will be donated to four non-profit organizations working to help refugees and migrants: Médecins Sans Frontières, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said it will double the first $5.5 million in donations until the amount on the google.com/refugeerelief page reaches $11 million.
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since World War II, caused largely by Syria's four-year civil war, which has displaced more than 4 million people this year.
Many are also fleeing war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Diabetics with mild obesity may be helped by obesity surgery
The beneficial effect after obesity surgery in people with mild obesity with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is too early to say that low-obese diabetics live longer after obesity surgery than those who receive nonsurgical treatment.
"Mortality statistics don't show up right away," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in obesity surgery who wrote about the new study in a column by the editor of JAMA Surgery.
Obesity surgery, or bariatric surgery, uses a variety of techniques to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the ability of organis to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has proven effective for treating type 2 diabetes, but major studies have been conducted among people with morbid obesity who have a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a measure of weight relative to height, is considered normal at a value between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or higher indicates that a person is overweight, and people with a BMI above 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers at Taiwan's Min-Sheng General Hospital used data collected from 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery — gastric bypass surgery and sleeve gastrectomy — with medical treatment for type 2 diabetes in people with mild obesity.
The average BMI of those who underwent surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of their participation in the study.
At the same time, the BMI of those who have received nonsurgical treatment for diabetes remains at about 29.
Among those who underwent surgery, 36% were completely cured of diabetes, and 28% were partially cured.
In the group receiving medical treatment, for comparison, a complete cure for diabetes was observed in only 1%, and partial - only in about 2%.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides, and "bad" LDL cholesterol "were generally better in the surgical group," the authors state.
The researchers also monitored hemoglobin A1c levels in the blood, which reflect blood sugar levels in dynamics.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7%, the researchers wrote.
After surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c level decreased from about 9% to about 6%.
In the therapeutic group, however, it remained stable, at about 8%.
But better glycemic control scores, reflected by good hemoglobin A1c levels, did not reduce the mortality rate over five years, according to study leader Dr Chi-Cheng Soo and colleagues.
The research team also compared the average outcomes of the two types of surgical treatment.
In the fifth year, compared with the group that had a sleeve gastrectomy, the bypass group lost more weight (18.7 kg vs. 14.2 kg), achieved a greater reduction in BMI (by 7.4 vs. 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1%), and was closer to complete remission of diabetes (46.9% vs. 16.7%).
Although the new study does not demonstrate the benefits of the surgical method in terms of life expectancy after five years, there is evidence from a study of overweight people in Sweden that surgical treatment does lead to an increase in life expectancy, as reported by Blackstone from the College of Medicine in Phoenix, University of Arizona.
According to a Swedish study for obese people who chose bariatric intervention, the likelihood of dying over 15 years was about 29% lower compared to the group that used more traditional methods.
Although the new study did not show an increase in life expectancy, Blackstone noted that it encourages people with a BMI below 35 interested in such a procedure.
"Here, the report is very important because it argues that such surgery is safe in the low BMI group, where there is no increased risk of mortality or kidney disease," she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once a patient's BMI falls between 27 and 30.
"I think we're waiting too long to get people to take this seriously," she said.
It seems to me that once they accumulate the genetic changes that trigger obesity and diabetes in their bodies, it is very difficult to reverse this.
In Mytishchi, robbers took fur coats and 9 million rubles from the house.
In Mytishchi, robbers attacked residents of a house near Moscow and stole 9 million rubles and three women's fur coats from them.
This is reported by "Interfax" with reference to the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation.
The incident occurred on Tuesday morning.
Two unknown persons through the open front door entered the house located on Gorky Street, tied up the 20-year-old son of the owner of the house and, threatening both with a knife, stole 9 million rubles and three fur coats.
According to preliminary data, the amount of damage amounted to 9 million 265 thousand rubles, a criminal case was initiated under the article "Robbery".
Fans from Europe are at risk of becoming homeless.
Only 23 St. Petersburg hotels have the right to accommodate tourists who will come to see the World Cup in 2018.
The rest of the hotels are in no hurry to get the appropriate permission.
According to experts, this is a very alarming sign.
On the eve of the world championship, the authorities will urgently have to figure out how to resettle all the guests of the city.
The interlocutors of Rosbalt believe that because of the tournament, the cost of renting rented apartments will increase by 10-30%, and even after the championship for rented housing will have to be overpaid.
The World Cup forced the authorities to pay attention to the condition of Russian hotels.
According to the law written specifically for the championship, each hotel in St. Petersburg must undergo a classification procedure and prove that it corresponds to the declared number of stars and the level of service.
It is already clear that not everyone will be able to do this: hoteliers are so afraid of inspections that they often do not even send documents to the requests of the Federal Antimonopoly Service for St. Petersburg.
According to the head of the UFAS Vadim Vladimirov, the department studied 138 hotels and now plans to open 34 cases against hotels, many of which simply did not respond to the anti-monopoly activists.
There are signs that the management of three dozen companies deceived citizens by placing one or another number of stars in advertising, Vladimirov said.
The problem is that now literally every number counts, none can be lost before 2018.
Officials suspect that during the football championship, fans will occupy all St. Petersburg hotels.
Now in the city tourists can count on 30.5 thousand rooms.
According to Smolny, in St. Petersburg there are 17 five-star hotels, 51 four-star hotels, 100 - two- and three-star, 550 - one-star.
According to the First Deputy of the Committee for Tourism Development Nana Gvichia, at the moment only 23 hotels have passed the classification - so many inspections have been carried out by companies accredited in St. Petersburg.
But whether any hotel ordered a similar procedure from regional enterprises, Smolny by an amazing coincidence is unknown.
That is, there may be more who have passed the classification, but no one knows about it.
"Over the past six months, hotels have not been very eager to pass the classification," said Ekaterina Shadskaya, director of the North-West branch of the Russian Union of Travel Industry.
This is due to the high season, during which hoteliers earn the most money and do not want to do other things.
Another reason is the budgets, in which the costs of inspections were not laid, while the procedure can cost the hotel, depending on the status, from 30 to 100 thousand rubles or more.
But still, recently, hotel managers have stepped up and began to apply for classification, Shadskaya assured.
Hotels must have time before July 1, 2016, otherwise they will not only pay a fine, but also will not receive the right to work at the World Cup.
It is already known that, depending on the star rating, a fixed fee for a hotel room for the duration of the tournament will be developed.
The formulas by which the cost will be calculated will be promulgated next year.
This is done in order to prevent prices from soaring by 200-300%, as it happens, for example, during the St. Petersburg Economic Forum.
You need to have a conscience and prevent a two- or three-fold increase, but hotels also need to be allowed to earn.
"I think the growth will be up to 50%," explained Gennady Lamshin, president of the Russian Hotel Association.
In turn, Vadim Vladimirov is not sure that price fixation corresponds to the understanding of a market economy.
I do not know how this fits into the framework of economic theory, but I hope that this measure is justified.
"This is better than a rampant rise in price," he said.
It's unclear what will happen to the popular cheap hostels.
State Duma deputies introduced a bill according to which hostels should be banned in residential buildings.
We very much hope that this law will not be adopted or will not concern St. Petersburg.
"We will defend the point of view that hostels should be preserved," Nana Gvachia said.
However, according to her, the owners of mini-hotels in any case should be prepared for the tightening of the Housing Code.
If the State Duma still approves the bill, then about 80% of hostels will be closed in St. Petersburg, and at the moment there are 1.5 thousand rooms in them.
According to leonid Garbar, President of the Federation of Restaurateurs and Hoteliers of the North-West, there are not enough two- and three-star hotels in St. Petersburg, which are just in demand by football fans, but there is a bias towards hotels with four and five stars.
This state of affairs is similar to the situation when "75,000 VIPs sit in an 80,000-seat stadium."
This can be corrected just at the expense of mini-hotels.
The expert considers their possible ban "idiocy": "It seems strange to me that some people can live in apartments, but for some reason visitors cannot."
If a hostel is used as a hostel, then I agree that this is wrong.
But if it's like a hotel where guests come for a short time, then why not?
Inns are at risk of missing the World Cup because of their sluggishness.
As many as hundreds of small hotels simply will not have time to pass the classification, and the hole is dug by themselves.
By the summer of 2016, all hotels in the city will order works.
"There are not so many companies that can carry out this procedure, so they will refuse less paid orders from mini-hotels, and will choose those that are more expensive," said Gennady Lamshin, adding that in a number of cities, for example, Moscow and Volgograd, the indicators of passed inspections are currently much higher than in St. Petersburg.
The reason for the St. Petersburg delay is connected, among other things, with the constant reshuffle in the tourist block of the government, which does not contribute to coordinated work.
According to experts, if st. Petersburg hotels are not enough for everyone, that most likely you will have to pay attention to regional hotels and rest homes.
Following the example of the celebration of the 300th anniversary of St. Petersburg, the river fleet can be mobilized to the city, that is, the guests of the tournament will be able to live in cabins.
In addition, many fans will arrive in vans in which it will be possible to spend the night.
"The main thing is not to set up so many hotels so that later they are empty," Gennady Lamshin is sure.
Also, rented housing will be very popular during the football championship.
Most likely, the city will create a reserve of rented apartments.
Rental rates will increase by 10-30%.
"From the obvious - the housing near the stadium will be the first to leave," said Larisa Bragina, a rental specialist at the Agency for Development and Research in Real Estate.
Moreover, the rental price may not return to its previous level after the championship, especially in residential areas.
This will be facilitated by the construction of new transport interchanges on the outskirts of the city, she stressed.
Do not forget about the human qualities of citizens.
For example, Leonid Garbar is sure that St. Petersburg has always been a hospitable city in which people not only suggest the way, but can also conduct a mini-tour.
There are complications.
In 1970, my father met a family from Murmansk in the yard - a father, a mother and two children.
They had nowhere to spend the night: it was difficult with hotels then, it was difficult to sleep at the station.
"And dad brought them to our communal apartment to sleep," the interlocutor recalled.
True, he added that now there is no such feature left in the residents of the city - calling to your home is fraught with consequences and is scary.
But maybe in 2018, after the unsuccessful decisions of the State Duma, the mistakes of hoteliers and governments, we will have to remember the past?
Zhirinovsky "merged" the Amur Region.
Today I looked with admiration at Zhirinovsky's clowning in the State Duma.
He did these things when our generation was just learning how to sell newspapers, and is still in great shape.
The topic of the speech, it seems, is "the protest of the LDPR against the results of the elections in the Amur Region."
Protocols do not shake - for there is nothing; The LDPR apparently has no other protocols, except for those signed by the election commissions.
Here he is picking up second-place Finisher Ivan Abramov and shouting something like, "Here's the winner of the election!"
And immediately he attacks Rodnina from nothing, and then, after an altercation with the chairman, leads the faction out of the meeting room, shouting literally "You are all with the fronts your crooks and thieves."
The press, of course, focuses not on Abramov, but on the scandal and demarche of the faction as a consequence of this scandal and insult.
In fact, Volfovich beautifully and elegantly merged the Amur Region together with Abramov.
For the whole country, this is another trick of Zhirinovsky in the style of "Scum!", and not at all a protest of a political party against the results of specific elections.
And the faction formally scandalized, and the elections, according to the party's website and Ivan Abramov's Facebook, are not recognized, but the leader is obviously getting off the topic.
He leaves the dead on the Amur River to bury their dead themselves, and he preaches the gospel against United Russia as a whole and the innocent Rodnina.
An elegant solution, so as not to lose face, and not to go into a real, not ostentatious scandal.
Another thing is that now Abramov himself finds himself in a strange situation.
In addition to screams from his superiors, he did not wait for anything, there are no alternative protocols on his hands.
He is not in the focus of public attention, on the one hand, and on the other - for a narrow circle, it was he who became a formal reason for insulting the respected champion, and, even cooler, boorish attacks against the UR and the ONF.
And then, of course, he needs to think seriously about what to do.
Because from the main beneficiary of the elections, the no. 2 politician of the region and the no. 1 candidate for the only regional single-mandate constituency, he can turn into a pariah, which was successfully used by his own party leadership and a super-irritant for the very ONF and the party leadership of a stranger.
That's for sure - if there were no Zhirinovsky, he should have been invented and respectfully watched.
Trump still has to grow and grow before him.
There was news that the LDPR will return to the hall during the next plenar.
That is, the bath fell from nothing at all.
The only thing is that Abramov's topic is buried under her.
Beautiful really.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe cannot accept all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The leader of the Tibetan Buddhists called for an end to violence in the countries that are the birthplace of refugees.
The Dalai Lama touched on the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama's Ethics Research Centre for Compassion at Oxford at the start of his 10-day visit to the UK.
He stated that in the current circumstances, the interests of humanity should be higher than the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that, although it is admirable, the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is not adequate to the situation.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised the actions taken by Germany and Austria in response to the crisis, he stressed that this is only a temporary solution.
"Caring for thousands of refugees is fine, but at the same time you have to think about durable solutions, how to bring real peace and real development, mainly through education, to these Muslim countries," he stressed.
At the end of the day, we have to think about how to reduce the number of murders in their countries.
We must reduce the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
Speaking about violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George W. Bush's actions after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, saying that the harsh US reaction triggered a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him that the solution to this problem was possible through non-violence.
I know his intentions were good, but he used force and it caused unexpected consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
Fourfold increase in the number of children who swallow hand sanitizer in the last 4 years
Poison control centers in the United States have reported a nearly 400 percent increase since 2010 in the number of children under the age of 12 who have ingested a high-alcohol hand sanitizer, according to the Georgia Poison Control Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Control Center, cases of children under the age of 12 ingesting hand sanitizers reported to poison control centers increased from 3266 in 2010 to 16117 in 2014.
"Children come into contact with these substances more often, and unfortunately, some percentage of them are sent to the emergency room," Lopez told CNN.
He said some children drink the disinfectant liquid on purpose, and some do it to impress their friends, or to argue for social media.
Videos on Youtube show teenagers drinking a disinfectant liquid as cheap booze.
The teens reportedly mixed a disinfectant liquid with an alcohol-containing mouthwash to get a stronger drink.
Younger children may be attracted to the pleasant smells of disinfectant liquid.
"The child doesn't think it could hurt him," Lopez said.
Many of the most attractive (hand sanitizing liquids) are those that are flavored.
There are disinfectant hand liquids with the smell of strawberries, grapes, orange, which are very attractive for children.
Hand sanitizer contains anywhere from 45 to 95 percent alcohol.
In young children, in particular, just a few sprays can cause alcohol poisoning.
"It's a high-concentration alcohol," Dr. Stephen Thornton, chief medical officer at the Poison Control Center at Kansas University Hospital, told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
You wouldn't just leave a glass of whiskey, but people keep these hand sanitizers in plain sight, and if kids get to them, it's a quick way to consume large amounts of alcohol.
Naija Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently swallowed a strawberry-scented hand sanitizer at school in the amount of about four sprays, was sent to the emergency room for treatment.
Her blood alcohol level was 179, twice that of an adult who is legally considered intoxicated, according to Dr. Chris Ritchie, an emergency room doctor who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center near Atlanta.
Naija confused the words and could not walk when she was taken to the emergency room.
Doctors observed her throughout the night in a separate children's clinic to avoid missing any signs of brain injury, as the girl fell and hit her head due to alcohol, Ritchie said.
"It was very scary," Ortoria Scott, Naigi's mother, told CNN.
It could very well have been deadly for my child.
Lopez recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcohol substances or disinfectant wipes, in addition to removing hand sanitizers from children's reach.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectant liquids have been linked to deaths.
In 2013, two women from Ontario died after swallowing a disinfectant containing a toxic undeclared ingredient.
Health officials suspect the product contained methanol, a deadly agent rather than ethyl alcohol, which was listed as active.
In January, three fourth-graders in upstate New York conspired to poison their "nasty" teacher by "spreading antibacterial substances in the classroom," according to a police report.
The teacher was severely allergic to hand sanitizers and forbade keeping them in her classroom.
Police believe the failed plan was "empty talk" and are addressing discipline issues to the school district.
As the oldest children's library in Barnaul became a family club.
On the back of the bench at the entrance to the regional children's library named after N.K. Krupskaya is sad cast iron owl.
Kids who come for books try to feed her candy.
For several generations he has been going to this library for 95 years.
The very first readers in the twenties of the last century arranged loud readings here, staged performances based on Mayakovsky's poems, conducted literary quizzes and corresponded with Lenin's wife.
The correspondence lasted four years, and, as the newspaper "Young Stalinets" wrote in 1939, every day "the friendship between Nadezhda Konstantinovna Krupskaya and friends of the children's library of the city of Barnaul" became stronger.
Nadezhda Konstantinovna even once sent her childhood photo to distant Barnaul friends.
And when Barnaul residents asked if Nadezhda Konstantinovna objected to the library being given her name, she wrote that no, she did not object.
Letters have long been gathering dust in the museum, and the grandchildren and great-grandchildren of the first readers have to explain whose harsh profile adorns the bas-relief on the library building.
During the years of perestroika, different people often called, indignant: why is the children's library not renamed?
Let there be a library named after some good children's writer, without political overtones!
The library staff sat down, thought, and decided to leave everything as it was.
"Krupskaya" is perhaps the most famous and beloved library in Barnaul, as the "Leninka" in Moscow.
On the floor in the library lobby is a yellow brick walkway.
"The Wizard of the Emerald City" is a favorite theme of the artist Olya Moskovka.
Previously, Olya was a manager in a law firm, came to work at eight, left at five, and differed from all other managers only in her love of drawing.
And then I found an ad on the Internet: "An illustrator is needed for a book."
The book was written by a little American girl, and it was called "My Cancer Mommy".
Olya made illustrations, and thought: life can end at any time, and there will be no miracles in it if you do not create them yourself.
Now she works in the library, illustrates children's books by writers around the world and writes fairy tales herself.
Traditionally, it is believed that children lose interest in the book, that they increasingly live in some kind of virtual space ...
But children who read come to us, and their parents understand the importance of reading, - the director of the library Tatyana Kushvid tells "Russian Planet".
In recent years, we have even had such a moment of confidence that the children's library is needed, and it will live - the kids are coming here!
I think the interest in reading is returning.
In the lobby of the library hangs a large exhibition stained glass window with an updated photo exposition.
Once a quarter, new photos of readers who go to the library with the whole family are posted: mom, dad and children.
The library is happy that dads began to come with children more and more often.
If at the age of two the child read the whole of Chukovsky, then at an older age he needs books more complicated.
But now there is a law according to which an eight-year-old prodigy is forbidden to issue books from the category of 12+.
To get such a book, the child must bring his parents with him - they come, then return again, and gradually "Krupskaya" becomes something like a family club for them.
In the library there are treasures - a pre-revolutionary collection of epics with yats and yers, Korolenko's novels in the appendix to the magazine "Niva", a binder of "Murzilka" for 1936.
After all, we are now not only the conceptual space "temple of the book", we are now open to movement, we are trying to become a special place: not a home, not a job, not a school, - explains Tatiana Kushvid.
You can come to us to read, play, draw together.
We made a play area for kids - the child comes just to play, and the hand still reaches for the book!
Some of our readers are carried away by their parents, and they are resting their feet, they do not want to leave.
Mothers often come with strollers - and we are pleased that they put the library in the first place among all the other places where you need to come with babies.
Tatyana Kushvid says: modern children, just like we once did, love classic children's literature:
"Publishing is now evolving, and a lot of attention is paid to authors who are the link between generations."
And if we talk about small children, then it is important for them that there is some kind of hero who travels from one book to another.
Children do not like to part with their heroes.
The library constantly publishes booklets for parents, in which it tells what is happening in modern children's literature, which books are worth paying attention to and why.
The booklets are so fascinating and intriguing that adults are interested, but this library is still not for them.
It is forbidden for adults to take books outside the reading room.
Only children have this magical privilege.
... In the farthest room of the library there is a square hatch with an ancient wooden staircase to the basement, to the book depository.
The steps will creak under your steps - this is already a very old time machine.
You meet the book of your childhood like an old friend: hello, it's good that you and I are not changing.
Ellie still cheerfully walks along the road paved with yellow bricks, lazy Tolya Ryzhikov steals magic matches, and Malchish-Kibalchish never told the cursed bourgeois of the Military Secret - such is his firm word.
Such books are like passwords, you can recognize your own anywhere by them.
There are also real book rarities in the repository - for example, a pre-revolutionary collection of epics with yats and yers.
Or the story of Korolenko in the famous supplement to the magazine "Niva".
Or the binder of "Murzilka" for 1936.
Time has aged the pages, painted them in tea color.
These publications are no longer issued to readers.
These are fragments of our future collection, I all dream - I will retire and deal with rare children's books.
But children will not be led to this, so to speak: the colors in old books are not very bright, and the themes ... you open the first page, and there - Lenin, the party, the Komsomol.
Now it seems: why did we all write out this "Pioneer Truth?"
But it was still interesting, - Galina Ilyasova, head of the book depository, tells "Russian Planet".
The pages of Murzilka have darkened with time.
Galina Vasilyevna has been in charge of the book depository all her life.
She knows what color Pinocchio's cap is, in what school year Harry Potter became the captain of Gryffindor's team at the Quidditch Championship, in what situations Carlson uses a silencer for a motor, and who Alice Selezneva's father works for.
There is little pay for the work of a librarian, and everyone who can live without these book series very quickly finds another profession.
Only the most convinced remain: educators, teachers, ministers of the cult of the book.
They can also be recognized by their smile - it is believed that this is a professional trait of a children's librarian.
If he smiled at you in the first minute of the conversation, that's a professional.
In general, I love children's books: as a librarian, I like them to be, to stand evenly and beautifully on the shelves, and I also love to read them, - says Galina Vasilyevna.
I read everything: military, historical novels, fairy tales, fiction.
I read contemporary Russian authors, fresh translations...
Of course, I think things were different in my childhood.
The books were the most interesting and exciting thing that happened to me then.
And since I was madly in love with them, it seemed to me that the library was a magical place.
And I wanted to work where everyone sits and reads.
I hope there will always be books, despite the readers.
And I rejoice when our former readers bring children, and even grandchildren...
Rumour Mill: There is no controversy at Celtic
Griffiths has denied talk of disagreement at Celtic after Dale's admission that Hoopes are in a bad position, but he will fix it.
Hearts will protest the Scottish Football Association's claim to Neilson, and Warburton fears signing contracts in January that could upset the unity of the team.
The Dons increased their advantage over Celtic to five points
Adam Rooney's penalty in the first half gave Aberdeen a slight advantage over Hamilton at Pittodry, allowing the Dons to pull away from Celtic by five points.
Griffiths refutes talk of disagreement
This sparked rumours of controversy at Celtic, which were thwarted by Griffiths, who said he and his team-mates were not suffering from any heightened criticism as they prepared to meet dutch league leaders.
I don't think we feel the tension, I think the players are striving for it.
The Dutch are bored because the Scots are not in the fight for the title - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Netherlands international Ronald de Boer has said Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic as he is not competing for the title with Rangers.
De Boer, currently an Ajax spokesman, said: "Holland is no longer showing Celtic's most attractive moments, but why?"
That's because there are no Rangers.
People here aren't just talking about the Return of the Rangers.
They're talking about the "Old Firm."
They talk about both teams together, and that's what interests them.
There's a lot of tension in the Old Firm's games, and it's not just people in Scotland who want to see these games.
"I'm going to change everything," Dale said.
Ronnie Dale admitted that Celtic were struggling, but the Norwegian coach vowed to change everything.
The defeat to Malmo and, as a result, the exit from the Champions League was soon followed by a loss to 10 players to Aberdeen, which now, having broken away by five points, occupies the top of the table.
However, Dale said: "Selitka have had bad periods before and we will come out again."
Now we want to get out of this as quickly as possible.
I understand that this is very annoying, and a lot of people are very, very angry or upset about what's going on.
And so do we, but we have to keep going.
And we really, really need Celtic's support because it makes the players so much better.
Staying together now is so important.
Warburton await January transfers in disbelief
Despite opinions emerging just a couple of weeks ago suggesting that he has identified some of the goals for January transfers, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is suspicious of the January campaign, arguing that he does not want to destroy the unity of the team.
The former Brentford striker said: "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window. "
As for the players who come in the summer, you have a period before the start of the season to adapt them, which is what you saw in our own group this season.
The team is working really well.
Sometimes more harm is done by adding unnecessary players to the ones you really need.
Michu, who is interested in Celtic, hinted at the end of his career
Swansea striker Michu, who has been linked to Celtic during the transfer window, has hinted that he could leave football after his contract with the Swans expires.
The 29-year-old has suffered from ankle problems for two years, and has failed to leave Wales this summer.
Hearts are set to confront the SFA over Neilson's statements
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was sent off and began to lose 3-2, but the defender's red card was later canceled; this is collum's third red card to be cancelled in eight months.
Neilson doesn't retract his words, saying, "I didn't question ethics, I didn't comment on the game."
Griffiths vowed to avoid Tynecastle.
A stubborn Hibernian player was reprimanded after admitting to singing a song with offensive words about former Hearts player Rudy Scatzel.
The incident occurred in a pub in the Roseburn district of Edinburgh before the start of the Edinburgh derby on Tynecastle in March 2014.
"It was a derby and it was hot," the striker said, adding: "I can say with confidence that I wasn't going to go back to Tynecastle if he didn't play for Celtic.
Donnelly: Tannadis council confident in Dundee United management
Simon Donnelly argues that Dundee United's board of directors remains confident that the management team will change the situation for the better, but agrees that the deterioration of the situation on the pitch must end.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We'll get the guys out again," Donnelly said.
McInnes is delighted to have "ugly" beaten Hamilton
Derek McInness admitted that his Aberdeen team had to fight desperately against Hamilton Assis to secure a seventh straight league title win, which put them five points above Celtic, at the top of the standings, thanks to Adam Rooney's penalty in the first half.
McInness said: "There is no team here that has won anything – the cup, or the league championship – that has not won meetings in this way."
The unemployment rate among Scots does not change, while in the United Kingdom as a whole it is growing.
Unemployment in Scotland remained at 164,000 between May and July, while the number of unemployed in the United Kingdom as a whole increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million over the same period.
Scotland's unemployment rate, 5.9%, was higher than the United Kingdom's 5.5%, figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed.
At the same time, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 people in three months, with the number of employees now standing at 2,612,000.
Scotland's employment rate fell to 74.0% over the quarter , above the 73.5% average for the United Kingdom.
Scottish Affairs Secretary David Mundell, commenting on the most recent figures, said: "The Government's long-term plan has laid the foundations for strengthening the economy. "
It has been almost exactly one year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
Over these 12 months, we have seen a further improvement in the Scottish labour market, with employment rising and unemployment decreasing.
Why I Witness an Execution in Oklahoma
Today, dodging legal intervention at a late stage, I will watch a person be executed.
If that happens, and I hope not, I'll be sitting on the observation deck of death row at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed by lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
The first time this request was made back in January, through a close friend of his, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As that day approached, I became afraid.
So why would you do that?
I agreed, as I thought it was a good way to tell a detailed story of the death penalty.
That would offer a unique perspective.
Yes, journalists are allowed to attend executions in America, and since there are often more applicants than seats, the results of a grim lottery decide who will be chosen.
In Oklahoma, the number of seats for the press was reduced from 12 to five.
Whoever is chosen will look at it without emotion.
I can't do that.
I'll be sitting with Richard Glossip's closest friends, and he and I have a relationship of our own after months of phone calls and one visit lasting two and a half hours.
I like this guy.
We often laugh when we talk to him.
The prison administration claims that I cannot be both a witness and a journalist, so I will not be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to write down what I see.
I'll have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of sacrificing my impartiality.
It's a lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner the way he likes, get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she herself "could have formulated better," but still believes that I am wrong about what I am doing.
Richard Glossip disagreed with some of what I said and wrote.
He didn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't even if he did.
I told him that he could cross me off his witness list at any time.
But he wants an international journalist to be there to write about it.
If he dies, he believes that glasnost will help the movement to abolish the death penalty.
Kim Bellver, a reporter for the Huffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to learn more about this case, listen to the podcasts I've recorded.
I'm not going to go into too much detail here again.
I can't say with certainty that Richard Glossip is not to blame.
His actions after the murder of Barry van Treese make him guilty of aiding and abetting the crime.
But I believe there's a good chance he's not guilty of murder.
I firmly believe that the evidence for the death sentence was not enough.
I believe that his execution is wrong.
And from that angle, I'll watch him die.
I cannot state that I will be completely objective.
There will be other reporters to turn to for that.
From me you will learn what it's like to watch a person I like die unnecessarily.
A man pursued by the police was persuaded to climb out of the Canning River
Constable from the town of Canning Vale managed to persuade a man to climb out of the Canning River, and himself to stay dry.
A resident of Perth intended to get away from the police, but failed, getting stuck in dirty water in shallow water a few meters from a police officer trying to "gently persuade him to go ashore."
Canning Vale police were called tuesday into illegal entry into foreign territory in Buckingham.
When police spotted the suspect, he tried to get away from them by rushing to Canning.
But he didn't go far.
"He was standing in the water and saying, 'I'm not going to go out, come on, grab me,'" Said Staff Sgt. Shandell Castledine.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec did not really want to wet his uniform, so he used a safer technique - "negotiations with a good policeman."
"Sometimes people do weird things to try to escape," says Staff Sgt. Castledine.
Champion footballer Ben Cousins is what he remembered for.
In 2006, Cousins drove into a ditch to avoid meeting with a police patrol for an alcohol test, and tried to swim across Swan.
His efforts were in vain, but prompted the locals to invent a comic "Ben Cousins biathlon".
Peter Moody accuses stewards of attempted espionage and threatens to retire from equestrian sports
Peter Moody accused Racing Victoria stewards of trying to infiltrate a spy into his stable last year and threatened to immediately leave equestrian sports.
He was targeted by stewards and ethics officers at Racing Victoria, whom he accused of organizing a campaign against him personally, and the dismissal of Lady Tatai from the start due to a violation of the rules for the use of medicines on the day of the start, wednesday, was the last straw.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he always goes out of his way when participating in horse racing, and he found himself in a difficult situation when it came to the positive result of Lydari's test for cobalt, which he cannot explain.
He held his tongue about suspicions of espionage for a year and a half and didn't want it to "look like green grapes."
"I wasn't going to say anything about it, and I endured it for a long time, but sometimes it knocks you out so much that you can't hold back," Moody said.
They know it went on.
Sometimes you react, and then you have to go through the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
Today I will go home and sleep soundly.
I want to walk with my head held high and I want my owners to know that I am doing my best for them.
When they start thinking that's not the case, then I'll need to stop being a coach.
Then I'll have to think about what to do with my license.
Earlier, Moody sensationally stated during an interview on the racing.com that the ethics department tried to spy in his stable.
"A year and a half ago, Terry Bailey, Dale Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat down in a room with a man I would name if asked and offered him a job in my stable to pass on information about what I was doing in my stable," Moody said at a Racing.com.
They clearly think I'm a scammer.
If that's the case, they should all certainly apply, as they failed in trying to catch me.
Robert Rolston, the former chairman of RVL, David Moody, the current chairman of RVL, and Bernard Sondry, the current chief executive of RVL, have known this all along and know this now.
Shouldn't that make me think the case is becoming personal?
Shouldn't RVL have the courage to hold other people besides coaches accountable for what's going on in this business?
Am I bad for this profession?
Am I that bad for this profession?
Maybe people there think that's the case.
Maybe they should take my license away from me and push me away, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying here might make them think about it.
But I've gotten to the point where I don't care, and that saddens me.
I'm really sad about it.
I will put pressure on them and hold them accountable for making a decision.
I have support from my family and I can leave.
The coach's frustration only grew during the long investigation of the cobalt and Lidari cases, and the latest withdrawal of the horse from the start led him to declare that he could "throw his license on the table."
Moody, best known for grooming the invincible champion Black Caviar, called the requirements for the use of medications on competition day "ridiculous" after a clay compress was applied to the horse's legs, which is a violation of the rules.
This is a violation of the rules in horse racing.
"I have to take full responsibility for that," he said.
One of my employees mistakenly gave her a compress on her leg.
She could have gotten a compress last night.
She could have gotten it yesterday, as she did.
She was with him on the day of the race.
Moody could be disqualified for three months under the rules on the use of medications on the day of the competition for the use of a compress, about which the stewards opened an investigation.
It's a joke.
The people who create these rules know nothing about horses.
"We all understand that we need rules, but it's gone too far," Moody said.
The driver who hit and fled the scene in Kobram has been arrested
Police arrested a man who over the weekend hit a motorcyclist in Kobram and fled the scene.
The motorcyclist was taken by helicopter to Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after he was hit by a car on the Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
Police said the driver drove away without stopping to help the injured motorcyclist.
On Monday, Natalia, a 50-year-old resident of the city, surrendered to police in Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged with abandoning the scene, failing to provide assistance and violating other traffic rules.
The motorcyclist, a 40-year-old resident of Cobram, remains in hospital in a stable condition.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy parries accusations of opponents of using tough power plays.
Melbourne Storm manager Craig Bellamy described his team's criticism of the interception of the ball as "imposing an agenda" on the part of the two NRL championship favourites.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said referees allowed Storm to "fight" his side during Storm's surprise victory in the final of qualifying in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos manager Wayne Bennett made a clear allusion to storm after his side won the qualifying final against the Northern Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night, when he called the game "typical" of the rugby league and said two queensland had not been "too successful" in hand-to-hand combat.
Bellamy defended his team's interception of the ball and stated that they were just focused on "contact" by intercepting the ball.
Bellamy added that he was emboldened by the criticism of his team from the two top coaches, as it meant they were worried about a possible defeat to Storm.
"It keeps popping up — I haven't heard Trent Robinson talk about tough moves when they beat us 24-2," Bellamy said Wednesday.
I can vouch that we haven't changed anything for a whole year in our systems or defensive techniques, it's just that in the last six weeks we paid special attention to contacts when intercepting the ball, and this was a turning point for us.
Trent has been there for three years now and he's clearly coaching a great team, so he's probably not used to losing, and it's been a bit of a shock for him.
It's funny how it always manifests itself at this time of year.
Bellamy challenged Bennett's idea of "impressive football" by reminding his teacher that Bennett's St. George Illawarra Dragons won the league in 2010 by playing "boring" football.
Wayne talks about exciting football.
He decided to compare his saturday night game to ours on Friday night and see how impressive their game was," Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010, St. George was criticized a lot, calling it a boring team, and Wayne said that he did not care at all.
But now he has a team that can show what he considers impressive football, especially his young midfielders with their speed.
It's the kind of football you'd want to play when you have players like that.
He made that remark in 2010, and now he wants everyone to play football in his style – not every team has two midfielders like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt to play like that.
It gives me more confidence because they say these things because they're a bit bothered by playing with us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us when they got to the big games.
Bellamy also noted that the Game of Storm and The Roosters was a contest with more points than the game of the Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos' game was probably good, I haven't seen it yet, but what was the score? 16-12?
In our game it was 20:18, there were two more attempts - and is this an impressive football?
Or should breaks and failed attempts be considered impressive?
It's a chore for me.
If they mention us, it means that at some stage we can meet with them there.
The Storm have a day off later this week as they won the right to host either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronalla Sharks next Saturday night at the preliminary final at AAMI Park Stadium, with tickets going on sale next Tuesday morning.
Accused of drug possession Serb released on bail of 200 thousand dollars
A man facing life in prison for trying to appropriate 40kg of cocaine smuggled into Queensland has been released on $200,000 bail.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, is one of five people arrested last month after federal police found 100 kilograms of drugs on the yacht Solay, sailing from South America via Vanuatu and moored in Coomer in August.
Throughout the morning, Maksimovich and his accomplices were seen at the pier, and later he met with them at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe, where police found 40 kg of the drug in a Toyota Echo car.
Despite the fact that Maksimovich faces a life sentence for attempting to appropriate drugs in quantities sufficient for sale, Maksimovich's lawyer argues that there is no evidence that the latter tried to get the whole batch, and that the man could be in the cafe without any intent.
Supreme Court Justice Peter Flanagan doubted that Maksimovich should have been released on bail.
The latter has links with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he told the court on Wednesday.
During the criminal proceedings, he lied to the police about his whereabouts.
Maksimovich's mother and stepfather were asked to post a joint bail of $200,000 for his release.
"It is clear from the testimony of both that the bail amount of $200,000 is too much of a financial burden for them," Judge Flanagan said.
But that measure alone is not enough to ensure it doesn't disappear, the judge added.
Maksimović was allowed to be released on bail on the condition that he surrender both his Australian and Serbian passports, report to the police daily and observe a curfew from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Fotis Katsikaris: "I am proud of the Greek national team, which fought until the last seconds."
The head coach of the Greek national team Fotis Katsikaris paid tribute to his team after the match 1/4 of the final of EuroBasket 2015 with Spain (71:73).
According to him, the fate of the game was decided by individual mistakes.
It was a big game," AFP quoted Katsikaris as saying.
We were preparing for a great game performed by the Spaniards.
We tried to work on defense, but mistakes in defense determined the fate of the game.
It's sad, but I'm proud of my guys.
They fought until the last second.
Joel Freeland: "In CSKA, I will be entrusted with the functions of Kaun."
CSKA newcomer Joel Freeland said that he does not believe in the curse of the army men.
The Briton also expressed confidence that his new club will be able to reverse the negative trend and finally win the Euroleague next season.
I have spoken to coach Dimitris Itoudis several times this summer and, of course, after I joined the team," R-Sport quoted Freeland as saying. - In fact, I will be entrusted with the functions of Sasha Kaun, who left the team, both in defensive formations and in attack from a three-second zone, and I think that I can cope with this.
Yes, it will take me some time to rebuild to the position of center, after all, in the NBA I played more as a forward.
Now we will need to face the big centers of the opponent more, but I have already done this before, so I think I will cope now.
The Army men last won the EuroLeague in 2008.
Since then, they've made it to the Final Four six times, but they haven't been able to play their best basketball there each time.
There is an opinion that someone jinxed the team.
That's the whole game, you can't win forever.
Of course, it is difficult, I understand all the disappointment of the club and its fans.
But we have a great team now, and if we show the best we can do, then we have a good chance of winning the EuroLeague, I really think so.
I always wanted to win this title, the Muscovites have already won the tournament, and I think this year will be the year of CSKA.
As for the evil eye, I am not a superstitious person and do not believe in any curses.
I believe in hard work and determination, if you combine these two things, then anything is possible.
I don't have any specific rituals before games, I just listen to music and try to relax as much as possible.
Luis Enrique: "For me, the match against Roma will be special."

I returned to Rome after a few years, during which I gained some experience. - UEFA's official website quotes Luis Enrique as saying. -
I have exceptionally fond memories of Rome.
It's going to be a special game for me, but it's not that important.
The main thing is to start in the Champions League with a victory.
The August meeting at the Joan Gamper Cup will not affect the actions of the teams in the next match.
I expect Roma to play in Serie A against Juventus.
This is a strong team that knows how to press and knows what to do with the ball.

How we will play with Krasnodar, we will see, - the official website of Ural quotes the words of Skripchenko.
We have a whole week of preparation ahead of us.
This team has different options for attacking actions, conducts its attacks in a variety of ways, at the same time we are not a slow team, so I believe that it will be a very interesting game.
On the eve of this game, given that Krasnodar is holding a Europa League match against Borussia Dortmund, we will try to prepare very well to win.
Roher Cañas: "At home, Astana can take points away from anyone."
Midfielder of "Astana" Roher Cañas after the match of the 1st round of the group tournament of the Champions League with "Benfica" (0:2) expressed confidence in improving the quality of his team's game in the future.

Despite the fact that the match turned out to be difficult for us, I can say that we played well, - the official website of UEFA quotes the words of Cañas. - We lacked a bit of courage in attack.
Benfica are above class, but in the home match, I think we can count on taking away points from them.
It's very real.
But first you need to think about Galatasaray and then Atletico.
In home games, we can take points away from anyone.
Rafael Benitez: "I will repeat as many times as I want: Cristiano Ronaldo is the best in the world."
Real Madrid head coach Rafael Benitez expressed satisfaction with the big victory in the match of the 1st round of the Champions League group stage with Shakhtar (4:0).

The match was not easy, because Shakhtar know how to have the ball, - the official website of UEFA quotes Benitez.
The opponents did not have many chances, but their counterattacks are always fraught with danger.
I won't say that Real Madrid played perfectly, but we had plenty of scoring opportunities.
I'm happy that we didn't concede a goal and scored four.
Cristiano Ronaldo confirmed his level.
He's the best player in the world, I'll repeat that as many times as I want.
Jordi Alba: "Cristiano Ronaldo can't compare to Messi."
Barcelona defender Jordi Alba believes that no one can compare with his teammate Lionel Messi.
According to the Spaniard, Real Madrid forward Cristiano Ronaldo also cannot do this.

Even Cristiano Ronaldo.
With Leo on the pitch, everything changes, I can't compare him to anyone.

Recall, "SE" will conduct its text broadcast.
"Barcelona is a special opponent, a good team with excellent players," De Rossi was quoted as saying by UEFA's official website. -
It is difficult to play with blue-garnets, because they have not only a unique style, but also bright personalities.
To keep them, we will have to plow throughout the match and insure each other.
Messi is almost always successful when he goes into the stroke, so we need to stay compact and organized.
Yezhov hopes to start SKA in the match against Slovan.

The team will play its next match away against Slovan.
I hope that I will come out in the next match in the starting lineup, - quotes "R-Sport" the words of Yezhov.
I'm not an expert on goalkeepers, I'm a goalkeeper myself, we do not show replays of goals conceded, so it is difficult to track.
Dynamo played well, everyone has bad matches.
The team lost anyway.
I'd rather miss more, but the team won.
Shafarzhova was hospitalized with a viral infection.
Lucy Shafarzhova is hospitalized with a bacterial infection, reports AFP.

Stivan Hogg used the girl's phone to force pedophiles to send photos
A pedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to beg for images of child abuse.
Stivan Hogg took the girl's phone while she slept, registered with the Internet messaging service, where he received a number of obscene images of children sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up, found the phone missing and found it in the hand of a sleeping Hogg.
She checked it and found shocking photos, after which she immediately drew the attention of her mother.
Police arrived and saw five images, then examined the computers found at that address and found "relevant" queries in a search engine using words to detect obscene images of children.
Hogg then told police that he did it because it could "attract pedophiles" and then he would "pretend he was a cop to scare them."
Commissioner Eileed Robertson told the Dundee Sheriff's Court: "He said it was an addiction, he was addicted to scaring people.
He admitted to making the queries on the computer, but stated that it was because he wanted to pretend to be a policeman to scare pedophiles.
He was interviewed about a conversation with an unknown person who sent him the images and that he asked for more photos.
He said he did it to lure them in.
He said he had problems with his head when he drinks and stated that he wanted to see images of rape and murder.
Ms Robertson added: "When the girl found the photos on her phone, she called her mother, trembling and crying.
She saw obscene images on her phone, and then a face-to-face confrontation was held with the accused.
The girl was interviewed and reported that the accused used a computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hogg, 23, of Ward Road in Dundee, pleaded guilty to charges of making obscene photographs of children on June 14 last year, breaching bail conditions on Jan. 25 this year and failing to appear in court for a hearing on March 24 this year.
The defendant's lawyer, Gregor Sim, requested that Hogg not be added to the list of sex offenders because it could be shown that there was no "significant sexual element" in the crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael has postponed the sentence until October, pending receipt of certificates from social services.
Hogg was released on bail in the case, but he was taken into custody pending hearings in the other remaining cases.
He was included in the list of persons who committed crimes of a sexual nature even before the date of sentencing.
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe gives the wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mugabe, Africa's oldest state leader, earlier this year fell down a staircase leading from a podium.
He was not injured, but the video with the scene of the fall instantly spread on social networks.
The opening of parliament was also overshadowed by statements by parliamentary opposition figures that they had received anonymous threats warning them against booing Mugabe while delivering the address.
A month ago, they booed the president during his address to the nation in parliament; it was this speech that Mugabe repeated on Tuesday.
Innocent Gonese, a member of parliament from the Movement for Democratic Change, said seven opposition politicians had received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to interrupt Mugabe's speech.
"The message came from a number that is not displayed, but it is entitled 'Death,'" he told reporters after Mugabe's speech.
It warned noted members of parliament that immunity ends in the parliament building, and once they leave, parliamentary immunity does not apply.
The MP said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, was "concerned" about threats to its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will reduce to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard expects to cut between 25,000 and 30,000 jobs as part of its restructuring and cost-cutting program for service delivery.
In the same year, Hewlett-Packard split into two listed companies, separating the production of computers and printers from the more rapidly developing hardware and service sectors.
Deductions from the estimated job cuts will be approximately $2.7 billion starting in the fourth quarter, Hewlett-Packard said in a statement.
"This restructuring will provide a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, chairman and CEO of Hewlett Packard, who will lead the organization after the separation.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than Hewlett-Packard is currently, and its portfolio of business lines will be broader and deeper, helping the company transition to a new style of business," Whitman said.
As a stand-alone company, we are in a better position than before to respond to the growing demands of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have annual revenues of more than $50 billion and "will focus on providing previously unattainable end-to-end technology solutions" to companies, the company said in a statement.
This is how the company formed in the 1930s by Stanford University alumni Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to produce electrical equipment is split; their garage in Palo Alto has been nicknamed "the birthplace of Silicon Valley."
Hewlett Packard is in the process of a massive reorganization to move from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
The move by HP, the world's second-largest personal computer maker and one of the largest tech companies in the U.S., is the latest development in the sector, based on the belief that highly specialized companies are performing better.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says his team-mates should support injured Jack Wilshire ahead of the game against Dinamo Zagreb
Speaking to Wilshere, Wenger also stressed that it was only September and that if Wilshire's recovery went according to plan, there would be nothing to stop him from returning to the game by Christmas.
In the most favorable scenario, Wilshere will definitely miss at least the next four games in England and, given what happened, his participation in the European Championship next summer remains in doubt.
The most frustrating thing about this recent issue is that Wilshire confidently finished the previous season with a single ankle injury and was about to return to his usual aggressive style of play during pre-season.
Wenger: "This injury doesn't threaten his career."
It's just a bone that's not fully healed.
Nothing serious.
It's just a fluke.
It's not related to his ankles or the injuries he's had before.
These may be medically related things, but as Wenger also admitted, there is a risk of additional injury for any player returning to play in the middle of the season.
There is also an unfavorable trend.
According to Premier Injuries Ltd, Wilshire has recorded 23 different injuries that have happened to him in the six years since his debut.
He has also played in only 65 of Arsenal's 157 league games in the last five seasons.
If you look at the bigger picture for Arsenal, you can see that in six of the eight seasons since 2007-08, Arsenal were one of the two Premier League clubs with the most days missed due to injuries.
Wenger admits the possibility of getting stuck in a vicious cycle, but Arsenal believe that the improvement in injury statistics in the last season will continue.
"Sometimes, when you get back on track after an injury, you're vulnerable for a while — during that time you need to recuperate and gain a competitive advantage," Wenger said.
Jack is young enough to cope.
I hope he recovers physically, I'm sure of that, as well as that his career will be the one he deserves.
Arsenal kick off their Champions League campaign on Wednesday with a clash against Dinamo Zagreb and will continue it on Saturday with games against Chelsea and next Wednesday with Tottenham Hotspur, with Wenger set to rotate the squad.
Hector Bellerin and Aaron Ramsey did not come to Croatia, so most likely Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta will play in the starting lineup.
Perhaps Wenger will also introduce Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud in place of Nacho Moreal and Theo Walcott.
"I try to keep the balance and give a little breathing room to those players who need it," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal are the clear favourites in Group F, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is among the most depressing in Europe.
Dynamo have not lost any of their 41 matches since they managed to spend last season as the Invincibles.
On Tuesday evening, the stadium was affected by an earthquake measuring 3.2 on the Richter scale.
It was the 10th in Zagreb this year.
Wenger is confident that Arsenal have learned the lesson learned last season when the team was defeated in a Champions League game against Monaco and remain with little hope of leading the club to victory in the Champions Cup final.
"It's an incredible drive," Wenger said.
Arsenal have never done that before.
We were very close to the goal in 2006, but on the other hand, I am a realist with experience.
We have ambitions, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: A Comedy Show That Taught Us Serious Lessons in Male Friendship
The lack of such stories is glaring, especially when you consider how desperate men's need for candor has become, now more than ever, with suicide rates among young men peaking in 15 years.
In 2013, it became the single biggest cause of death for men aged between 20 and 45 in the United Kingdom, and is three times more likely to happen to men than women.
In an effort to get to the bottom of the problem, the Campaign Against Unhappy Life has declared 2015 the Year of Men to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the center of this battle to take on this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 university students showing symptoms of depression found that if a patient has a large enough number of friends "in a normal mood," the chances of a cure are doubled.
Equally, for those who are not depressed, the circle of mentally healthy friends halves the chance of mental disorders.
But, of course, in order for friendship to work, first of all, it is necessary that it be.
In an age where communications are driven by social media, where style is preferred to content, responsiveness is often valued more than meaningful contact.
Our digital lives double the need to appear strong, fun-loving, and successful, even if the reality is loneliness.
Such superficial success depends on what psychologists call external values - money, image, social status, entirely due to internal values, our inner desire for personal growth and friendship, which has a stronger impact on our mental health.
And, as one billionaire video game creator recently observed, money can't buy more happiness.
The advantage of Friends is that they draw attention to it.
Each of the characters was not defined through their work, but rather through a personality that manifested itself in communication with friends.
Joey's humor and Chandler's constant hugs, the moments of watching football in comfortable chairs, Ross's sigh for Rachel - all come from the understanding that men can feel this, even if they often refrain from fully exploring their feelings.
As a Samaritans employee told me, "... my role as a listener for people who feel depressed and suicidal stresses how even the smallest communication of friends can be beneficial."
Often, those men who turn to us feel unable to talk to friends.
The old admonition of "live with it" is strong, as is the feeling that talking frankly about problems can be perceived as weakness."
Friends is one of those shows that comes to mind when I'm trying to offer longer lasting coping mechanisms.
It highlighted subtle moments of male friendship.
As for my task, the status of an outsider talking on the phone helps people in moments of despair, while long-term support comes from the inner circle of family and friends.
So, if you're visiting FriendsFest at Comedy Central this weekend, where the scenery has been completely restored for the holiday, why not take your friends for a drink at Central Perk.
Or better yet, if you see a lonely person on Starbucks, smile and say "Hi."
It is impossible to guess in advance what benefits friendship can bring.
The series Friends is shown on Comedy Central from beginning to end, all 236 episodes, tagged #FriendsFest
Di Maria scores a goal to help PSG defeat Malmo
Angel di Maria, along with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani, celebrates the goals scored against Malmo.
Angel di Maria, making his debut in the Champions League, scored a goal that allowed PSG to easily bypass Malmo on Tuesday.
Here's the match report and the reaction to the game.
Angel di Maria and Edinson Cavani did their job when Paris Saint-Germain began their Champions League game with a very comfortable 2-0 win against Malmo at the Parc des Princes stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored less than four minutes after his first Champions League game as a PSG player began to set the direction for the French champions, but they missed a number of opportunities before finally extending their lead when Cavani scored a goal in the 61st minute.
Along with Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk in Group A, Paris needed to make a good start against the Swedish champions, as they were not aiming for qualifying for the play-offs, but for continuing a series of successful games of the last three seasons, where they reached the quarter-finals.
They scored points, but at the same time it was not the best decision on the part of Laurent Blanc to consider Zlatan Ibrahimovic useless in attack and later replace him on the field in a game against a team from his hometown and the club where he began his brilliant career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or away in the Champions League, so to win 2-0, cause problems for opponents and play great defensively is a good start, even if there are still moments that we will need to refine during the season," Blanc said.
It's promising.
We wanted to win and we did it, although I regret that we didn't score one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned from an injury in one of the substitutions for the Paris team, which brought them a 2-2 draw against Bordeaux in the First League at the weekend, but he was pushed to the background by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine striker has been hailed as a player capable of taking PSG to a new level in Europe, after being bought out from Manchester United last month and proved why when he ran to a pass from Marco Verratti behind the Malmo defence and finished the attack beautifully, sending the ball past Johan Willand into the far corner of the net.
However, if anyone expected an easy and big victory from PSG then, they had to be disappointed.
Malmo, who beat Celtic in the play-offs to reach this stage, with nine world-class players on the pitch at the start of the game, five defenders and two defensive midfielders in midfield, were serious opponents.
But, with the exception of Nikola Djurdzic's shot, in which the ball flew past the far post of Kevin Trapp's goal in the 34th minute, they attacked quite a bit.
But PSG at times let themselves down with inconclusive passes and weak attacks, especially from Ibrahimovic, who in the first half alone failed to convert at least five attempts, and then failed to process the goal scored by Cavani immediately after the resumption of play.
However, he proved much more adept at accurate passes, and it was a pass from Ibrahimovic, receiving which, Di Maria sent the ball with a twisted shot that went against the post past Wieland in the 52nd minute.
The second goal was finally scored after an hour mark thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan scored his sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic tweaked a ball sent to midfield from the left flank by Maxwell.
This put an end to any ideas Malmo had for a return to the game, and only Wieland's interception of the ball from close range prevented David Luiz from increasing the final score before substitute Ezequiel Lavezzi was credited with a goal at the very end of the match.
Malmo coach Age Hareide later admitted that PSG were a class above his team, with the Norwegian revealing: "Our last Game in the Champions League was last December. "
Since then, we've only played in the Swedish league, and that's not the level.
Qualifications are not enough.
Glory to "Pari"!
It was a wonderful match against them.

White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
The White House on Tuesday confirmed in an official statement that Chinese President Xi Jinping will arrive on an official visit to the United States later this month.
That visit — Xi Qinping's first visit to Washington — will take place on Sept. 25 and will be a return visit to President Barack Obama's visit to Beijing last November, the statement said.
U.S. President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi Jinping and his wife Peng Liyuan at a government dinner later that evening after the two leaders hold bilateral talks.
"President Xi Jinping's visit will provide an opportunity to expand cooperation between the U.S. and China on general, regional and bilateral issues of interest to both sides, and will also allow the presidents of the United States and China to constructively approach the consideration of controversial topics," the report said.
Xi Jinping, whose visit was first announced in February, is expected to stop in Seattle to meet with executives from several leading U.S. tech companies en route to Washington, before heading to New York for the U.N. General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi Jingping are expected to discuss a number of contentious issues, including Washington's concerns about alleged cyber espionage from China and China's growing categorical nature on the issue of the disputed waters of the South China Sea.

A man born in 1989 died from his injuries on the spot.
Friends of the deceased in social networks reported that the driver of the BMW was driving at high speed and before the accident drove into the oncoming lane.
Fearing that the driver would try to evade responsibility, the bikers organized a motorcycle rally from the Sparrow Hills to the building of the Moscow Ministry of Internal Affairs at Petrovka, 38.

More than 40 resolutions and orders were signed by the Governor of the Tyumen region Vladimir Yakushev at a meeting of the presidium of the regional government.
Some of them concerned the allocation of funds for educational and medical institutions in the municipalities of the region.
In particular, funds were allocated for the purchase of a bus for one of the schools of the Nizhnetavdinsky district, for the overhaul of the regional hospital in the Kazan district.
As stated in the accompanying documents, the money will be used to complete the overhaul of the second floor of the therapeutic department.
Hot and cold water supply networks, water disposal, electrical networks and electrical equipment, ventilation systems will be repaired, the facade of the building will be put in order, the premises will be repaired, a set of measures for fire safety and energy saving will be implemented.
The second forum of the regions of Russia and Belarus will be held in Sochi.
On September 17-18, the second forum of the regions of Russia and Belarus will be held in Sochi, in which the Tyumen delegation headed by the governor will take part.
Honorary Consul General of the Republic of Belarus in Tyumen Vladimir Shugla, who became part of the official delegation, tells about the upcoming event in Sochi and the interim results of cooperation.
Vladimir Fedorovich, what tasks does the Sochi Forum set?
The large-scale event in Sochi reflects the industrial policy of the Union State.
It is based on fruitful cooperation between the regions - important links in relations between the two states.
It is planned that the plenary session will be attended by Russian President Vladimir Putin and President of the Republic of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko.
Within the framework of plenary and breakout sessions, the experience of regional and local authorities of Russia and Belarus in the implementation of industrial policy, regulatory and legal support and programs of the Union State will be discussed.
The Governor of the Tyumen Region will speak at the forum.
I think that this testifies to the successful, sustainable interregional cooperation between the region and Belarus.
Representatives of relevant ministries and departments, Russian and Belarusian entrepreneurs will also arrive at the forum.
There will be trade fairs and specialized exhibitions, including from the Tyumen region.
I hope that the forum will help to conclude new profitable contracts and agreements.
I would like to add that the first such meeting took place in Minsk in June last year.
More than two hundred delegates took part in its work, including from 19 regions of Russia.
At the same time, a very important cooperation agreement was signed between the Tyumen and Minsk regions.
The significance of our developments is also evidenced by the fact that a meeting of the permanent seminar at the parliamentary assembly of the Union of Russia and Belarus was held in Tyumen.
In addition, the delegation of the agro-industrial complex of the Tyumen region visited the Republic of Belarus in order to study the experience of Belarusians in training personnel for agriculture, identify additional points of contact and organize new investment projects in the field of the agro-industrial complex.
Recently, you met with the head of the region and the head of the city administration.
What topics were discussed?
During the meeting with the Governor of the Tyumen region Vladimir Yakushev, the cooperation of the region with the Republic of Belarus in modern difficult conditions was discussed.
The issue of supplies of Belarusian agricultural machinery and the use of financial mechanisms will be touched upon - they are needed to reduce the cost of machines for the end user.
Problems in the work of the Tyumen trading house "Belshina" and options for preventing losses were discussed.
The issues are important, since investment projects should work clearly and bring profit to the region.
They talked about further deliveries of passenger and cargo equipment of JSC "MAZ", the development of the service center of JSC "MAZ", which was created in Tyumen on the basis of JSC "TPATP".
The conversation also touched upon the preparation of the trip of the working delegation of the region to the Republic of Belarus by the end of this year.
Another topic of the conversation was the completion of the coordination and signing of the agreement on trade, economic, scientific, technical and cultural cooperation between the Tyumen region and the Republic of Belarus.
Thus, the dynamics of the relationship promises to reach a new level.
These questions also concerned the regional center.
During the meeting with the head of the administration of the city of Tyumen Alexander Moor, we talked about the renewal of the Tyumen bus fleet.
About 100 buses are already "breathing on incense", so a new batch of cars from Belarus is required, which will run on gas, environmentally friendly fuel.
Another aspect: Tyumen Elevator Plant cooperates with one of the leading manufacturers of elevator products JSC "Mogilevliftmash", receiving components.
In my opinion, this activity could become more active, given the programs for the installation of new elevators in the regional center.
I will add that within the framework of the expanded powers of the consul, a meeting was held with the Governor of the Kurgan Region Alexei Kokorin, during which the issue of increasing trade turnover and supplying modern Belarusian equipment to the Trans-Urals was discussed.
A meeting with the Omsk governor is scheduled for the end of September.
The expanded consular district includes five subjects of the Russian Federation, but Tyumen can be called a kind of district headquarters.
The region is a testing ground for many promising projects, including the work of the Honorary Consul General.
In general, such meetings are significant and good because they allow you to directly and quickly solve many problems, removing their severity and developing mutually beneficial cooperation.
In the current conditions, it is extremely important not to destroy the reserve, continuing to work for the future.
Matt Damon is against focusing on the ethnic diversity of people involved in filmmaking.
Matt Damon argued with African-American producer Effie Brown, saying behind the scenes that it was not necessary to take into account the ethnic composition.
During the Sunday edition of the HBO show Project Greenlight, the famous actor interrupted Brown when she tried to emphasize the need for alternative points of view on the main black heroine in the script chosen for the project.
"Diversity is appropriate when you're casting for the film itself, not for the show," Damon insisted.
Dumbfounded, Brown, not believing her ears, resentfully exclaimed "Wow! Wow. Well, the whole time the "Martian" actor was giving live commentary.
To discuss the finalists of the show, Damon and Brown were joined by fellow producers Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers.
"I'd like the participants — no matter who the director is — to think about what interpretation of Harmony's character they're going to stick to," Brown said at the beginning of the discussion.
The only black character is a prostitute who is beaten by a white pimp.
Dear White People's producer advocated for Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio to direct the film; Damon was strongly opposed, saying that "in the end, we may not get what we want."
After the discussion was televised, social media exploded with disapproving comments about Damon.
Twitter user MrPooni angrily commented on what was shown in the video: "Matt Damon's explanation of diversity to the only black person in the room IS SO WHITE that it hurts."
The tweet garnered more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 "likes."
Damon's remarks come at a time when competent media coverage of race is the most pressing issue on the agenda of public debate.
After a teenager named Michael Brown was shot dead by a police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement gained popularity across the country, calling on lawmakers and governments to stop discriminatory practices against people of color.
In February, singer Prince mentioned this movement during the presentation of the contenders in the nomination "Album of the Year" at the Grammy Awards ceremony.
"Albums still matter," he said.
Like books and the lives of blacks, albums still matter.
Most recently, leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement issued an official statement in response to a question from Fox News employee Elizabeth Hasselbeck about whether the group would be considered a group of haters.
"The Black Lives Matter network is a love group," the movement's leaders said.
It was recently announced that Damon is on a list of showbiz figures, producers and media moguls invited to visit the Pope to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is not known whether the actor accepted the invitation and met with the Pope.
"American Ninja Warrior" awards the first champion
Professional rock climber and waiter's assistant Isaac Caldiero on Monday night became the first winner of the show "American Ninja Warrior", taking home a prize of $ 1 million.
At this sports show, the 7th season of which has just ended, none of the participants has yet managed to pass all the stages of the obstacle course.
In the season finale, two contestants, Caldiero and cinematographer Jeff Britten, made it to the final round.
The final task involved lifting a 75-foot-long rope in 30 seconds.
Britten completed the task first and met the set time, becoming the first athlete in the history of "American Ninja Warrior" to pass the grueling stage 4, but Caldiero coped with the task by a full three seconds faster, which made him the winner.
After winning with incredible difficulty, Caldiero, who was shocked to win a million dollars, gave an interview to "E! News".
"It's incredible to think about it, I've never made or lived on more than $10,000 a year," Isaac told E! such a serious jump in their income.
And all of a sudden... I never even imagined how it was... the future is unknown.
Executive producer Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to talk about the final and why Britten, who was the first to go through the track, won't receive any cash prize.
According to the rules, the fastest participant receives money.
"If there is more than one player who finishes, the prize goes to the fastest of them," Weed said.
Although money is a wonderful reward and changes lives, he still gets great satisfaction.
I don't think he feels offended about it.
He's happy with what he's done.
He received tons of rave reviews from fans.
He is a wonderful man and a family man.
He is a hero to his children and wife.
Jeff told me, "If I was destined to lose to someone, I'm glad it was Isaac."
And I think Isaac would feel the same way if we switched roles.
The show "America Ninja Warrior" will return with the eighth season, which will begin filming in the spring of 2016.
The Detrot Tigers quietly bypass the Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS — The second half of the season hasn't been particularly fun for the Detroit Tigers.
One of the best baseball teams of the day, the Tigers now sit in last place in the Central Division of the American League.
Claiming just to be a hindrance, the Tigers brilliantly beat the Minnesota Twins 5-4 at Target Field on Tuesday.
The Twins missed a chance to cut the gap to the Houston Astros by half a game and finish second in the playoffs in points behind the winners.
For Detroiters, even for one night, it was the return of the F word that eluded them for most of the second half of the season.
"All wins are fun, no matter how they turn out," Tigers manager Brad Osmus said.
Tigers pitcher Alfredo Simon did his part to support the offense, resulting in Detroit scoring three points in the first two innings, then adding another in sixth and one in ninth.
Simon (13-9) was a pitcher in 6 1/3 innings and missed three runs.
It was only his third quality start in nine appearances.
"I just want to end the year with a good record," Simon said.
Substitute pitchers don't manage to throw in every game and so I want to go deeper into the game.
Tigers' designated batter, Victor Martinez, managed to deflect three shots and secured two wounds — the first RBI since mid-August.
It was the first day with three shots since four strikes in a game against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"It worked well with a bat," Osmus said.
He performed well in (batter quality), noticeably better at bat work and retained that quality for the game.
With three runs in the second half of the seventh inning, the Twins got their best chance of getting back into the game.
Centre-back Byron Buxton opened the inning with a double on the left side of the pitch.
Reitfilder Aaron Hicks made a bow to take the first base, and second baseman Brian Dozier received a strikeout on a swipe from Simon before his place was taken by left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy passed Moer, the only player on the way, before the newly appointed batter Miguel Sano, who knocked out a two-shot single to the left of right-handed Drew Verhagen.
With a pair of runners out and a comparison wound at the second base, VerHagen managed to lead third baseman Trevor Pluff to a double-play back.
It was the 27th time for a major league leading player this season that Pluff knocked the ball out in a double play.
After Detroit added a safety net in the first half of the ninth inning, Moer earned the RBI a double in the space between the outfielders against closing Tigers pitcher Bruce Rondon, and the score became 5-4.
However, the right-handed player knocked out Sano after three strikes and received his fifth save.
Detroit took advantage of temporarily unfit Phil Hughes early in the game.
The Tigers earned three wounds in the first two innings against an honored pitcher who was on the injured list until the game, having been absent for more than a month due to lower back inflammation.
"Definitely not the start I would have wanted," Hughes said, "but as the game progressed, I started to feel more comfortable and so I was able to make some pretty good shots in the third inning."
After the first batter made it to the first base, Hughes threw the single to second baseman Ian Kinsler.
Walk with two outs of the rightfielder J. S. D. Martinez led Victor Martinez, who made a single in the middle for the first run in the game.
Victor Martinez finished his series "0 for 21" with the runners in the scoring position.
Third baseman Nick Castellanos next made a "single", bringing another wound, but Victor Martinez was knocked out in an attempt to approach the third base, thereby eliminating the threat.
The Tigers increased their lead in the second inning, receiving a one-out double from catcher James McCann and a two-out single from center scorer Anthony Goose, to make it 3-0.
"It was a massive hit," twins manager Paul Molitor said.
He didn't hit particularly well, but he hit the right point.
Hughes, whose shots were considered, threw in a non-pointing third inning, after which he was replaced by a right-handed retainer by A.J. Williams. Achter.
Hughes counted three runs on six hits and a walk with four strikeouts.
NOTES: Tigers right-handed pitcher Aníbal Sanchez was eliminated due to a right shoulder sprain.
He will be examined by Dr. James Andrews, who performed shoulder surgery on Sanchez back in 2007.
Sanchez, who has been on the injured list since mid-August, is scheduled to start on Wednesday.
In Sanchez's absence, left-handed pitcher Daniel Norris will leave the injured list and come out against the Twins.
Norris, who has been with the Tigers in four starts since his acquisition in exchange for left-handed pitcher David Price on July 30, has 1 win and 1 loss.
He has not played since August 20 due to a sprained oblique muscle.
The Tigers and Twins will wrap up a three-game series at Target Field on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2, ERA 4.43) will be played by right-handed pitcher Erwin Santana (5-4, ERA 4.73).
The original complaint of Kadyrov on the book "Prayer to God" was received by the Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk court.
The Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk City Court received the original appeal of the representative of the President of Chechnya Ramzan Kadyrov against the decision to recognize the book "Prayer to God: Its Meaning and Place in Islam" as "extremist material", Interfax reports with reference to the chairman of the city court Alexander Chukhrai.
Now the court is waiting for possible objections of the participants in the process.
Chukhrai refused to comment on the statements of some deputies of the State Duma of the Russian Federation about the need to check the city court for possible cooperation with foreign special services and ISIS.
"Let them comment on such nonsense," he said.
On September 11, the Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk City Prosecutor's Office filed an appeal against Judge Natalia Perchenko's decision to recognize the book as "extremist material."
An appeal came from the prosecutor's office of Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk on Friday evening.
There are nuances: the prosecutor's office believes that they asked the court to recognize only the opinion of the author of this book as extremist, and not the verses from the Koran.
According to the prosecutor's office, the judge made the wrong decision," Chukhrai said.
The decision to recognize the book as "extremist material" was made on August 12, 2015.
In particular, quotes from the Koran were called "extremist" - "We worship you and we beg you for help", "Do not appeal to anyone along with Allah".
Kadyrov called those who made the decision on the book "shaitans and provocateurs."
He called on State Duma deputies to legally prohibit court decisions concerning the texts of the holy scriptures.
"I am firmly convinced that the State Duma should adopt a law according to which it is forbidden to make decisions in court relating directly to the texts of the Koran and other Divine Scriptures," Kadyrov wrote on his Instagram.
Facebook will remove comments insulting migrants and refugees
Facebook employees intend to delete posts and comments that give a negative assessment of migrants and refugees.
In addition, the social network will provide financial support to organizations that collect user complaints about illegal content.
To combat manifestations of xenophobia and racism on the network, the leadership of Facebook intends together with the Ministry of Justice of Germany.
So, on the eve of the head of the department Heiko Maas said that currently the Ministry of Justice, together with specialists of the social network, is engaged in the creation of a special group of moderators.
Its participants are obliged to monitor and delete comments that are incorrect in relation to migrants and refugees.
According to Heiko Maas, it is assumed that the authors of intolerant posts will receive notifications indicating the reason for deleting their record.
Organizations whose specialists are engaged in collecting complaints from users of the social network about offensive posts should also contribute to the prompt blocking of illegal content.
The management of Facebook intends to provide them with the necessary financial support.
The decision to delete posts containing negative statements about migrants and refugees, the leadership of the social network and the Ministry of Justice of Germany was made after xenophobic sentiments sharply increased in the German segment of Facebook.
One of the most obvious reasons for them was the unprecedented migration crisis that swept the EU countries some time ago.
So, in Germany, all the points intended for the accommodation of refugees are already overcrowded.
On the eve of the country's authorities decided to temporarily settle migrants on the territory of the former Buchenwald concentration camp.
Internally displaced persons from the Middle East and Africa are housed in barracks where prisoners and prisoners of war were held under the Nazi regime.
In Moscow cemeteries there will be areas for relaxation.
In the near future, several metropolitan cemeteries will be equipped with specialized areas for relaxation and psychological rest.
Among the first will be Butovskoye, Domodedovskoye, and Shcherbinskoye cemetery.
The first zone for psychological recreation has already appeared at the Troyekurovskoye cemetery in Moscow.
In the future, similar sites will appear in other areas of the city.
This was told to the portal m24.ru Artem Ekimov, who holds the post of head of the State Budgetary Institution "Ritual".
Relaxation areas will be small green areas resembling parks.
According to experts, in such "corners" visitors to cemeteries will be able to relax, be alone with themselves and restore psychological strength.
In the near future, relaxation zones will be built in the Domodedovo, Butovsky and Shcherbinsk cemeteries, and then in other districts of the capital.
According to the head of the State Budgetary Institution "Ritual", if there is a need to expand the area of the cemetery, the builders will try to preserve the existing forest areas as much as possible.
Green spaces will serve as a living fence that will separate recreation areas and areas reserved directly for burial places.
Experts of the State Budgetary Institution "Ritual" also announced their intention to make a proposal to abandon the hedges in the graves.
New cemeteries can indeed become barrier-free.
In addition, the GBU "Ritual" told about the readiness to install electronic terminals, with the help of which visitors to cemeteries will be able to find out GPS-coordinates and license plates of burials.
In June of this year, the State Budgetary Institution "Ritual" also proposed to adjust the cost of burial services depending on the time of year.
So, digging a grave in the summer will cost a thousand rubles cheaper, weeks in winter, when the ground is frozen.
It should be noted that over the past year, prices for all types of funeral services have risen in price by an average of 10 percent.
Five days later, a lost mushroom picker was found in the forests of Yelny.
The elderly man was alive, although he spent more than a hundred hours in the forest without provisions.
It was possible to find the unfortunate mushroom picker thanks to the joint efforts of rescuers and volunteers.
Alexander Blinnikov, correspondent: "A 79-year-old pensioner from the Tambov region spent five days in the forest."
No food or water.
Relatives, rescuers, volunteers were looking for him.
There were even dog handlers with dogs, but there was no result.
It was possible to find the man after a helicopter joined the search operations.
On that day, vitaly Alexandrovich, as usual, went to the forest for oats and birch trees, but did not return by the evening.
Relatives immediately asked for help, and the very next day rescuers and caring residents from a neighboring village - about 30 people in total - were raised to search for the mushroom picker.
On the fifth day, they were joined by a helicopter of the fire and rescue center.
Andrei Seletkov, head of the search and rescue group of the Fire and Rescue Center of the Smolensk Region, said: "The helicopter was attracted, the man was found."
Gone very far, in a completely different place.
It was about 12 km from the search site.
He has traveled a great distance at his age.
Miraculously, he survived.
The mushroom picker was taken to the Yelny Central District Hospital unconscious, in extremely serious condition.
Doctors diagnosed him with pneumonia, as well as severe dehydration and hypothermia of the body.
How an elderly man was able to stay alive after five days spent in the forest, doctors have absolutely no idea.
Valentina Nepsha, head of the therapeutic department of the Yelny CRH: "An examination of the patient, treatment is prescribed."
Infusion therapy, antibacterial.
Considering all his chronic diseases.
The patient's condition improved in the morning, remains severe, but with positive dynamics.
Pensioner Vitaly Alexandrovich comes to Smolensk region from the Tambov region every year.
His grandson says his grandfather had gone mushroom picking before, but never went far into the woods.
Alexey Spitchenko, the grandson of the found mushroom picker, shared: "The forest is not far from the road, itself is not local in principle."
Just a few years I came to visit, to visit relatives.
Well, I went for mushrooms.
Apparently, he went far and got lost.
With the beginning of the mushroom season, people are regularly lost in all districts of the Smolensk region.
In the last few days alone, there have been five similar cases.
Rescuers remind: you need to go to the forest in bright clothes, with a small supply of food, matches and a compass.
In addition, it is advisable to leave traces behind you, so that later you can go back.
The emergency An-2 landed on a clearing in the fraternal taiga.
An emergency An-2 landed right on the clearing in Siberia.
The plane of the Krasnoyarsk airline "Yenisei" made an emergency landing 68 kilometers from Bratsk.
There were no fatalities or injuries, but the plane itself received significant damage during landing.
The An-2 was making a service flight.
On board were three crew members - the commander, the co-pilot and the flight mechanic, Interfax reports.
The emergency aircraft flew on the route Zheleznogorsk-Ilimsky - Achinsk, where the airline is based.
The crew of the aircraft has already been delivered to Bratsk.
After the emergency landing of the An-2, the Bratsk Transport Prosecutor's Office began checking compliance with the legislation on flight safety.
An investigative team of the East Siberian Transport Prosecutor's Office went to the scene.
In September 2010, the crew of the Tu-154 landed their plane with passengers due to a technical malfunction at an abandoned taiga airfield in Komi.
On the liner, the engines and on-board electronics failed, but the crew did the impossible.
On board the aircraft were 10 crew members and 72 passengers.
No one was injured in the emergency landing of the aircraft.
Vesti Ekonomika ― Nobel Laureate: Globalization
The processes of globalization were supposed to help reduce inequality in the world.
In fact, the situation looks different, the difference in incomes of the population in developing economies, on the contrary, is growing.
Eric Maskin.
To correct this, it is necessary to increase the level of education of low-skilled workers, says Eric Maskin, Chief Researcher at the HSE International Laboratory for Analysis and Decision Selection, winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2007.
In the last twenty years, the world has experienced unprecedented growth in global markets.
Trade borders between countries became increasingly open.
Proponents of globalization predicted great benefits for emerging economies.
"And these forecasts have largely come true," Maskin emphasizes.
For example, China and India received a serious increase in GDP per capita.
However, not everything is so rosy.
Globalization was expected to narrow the gap between the "haves" and "have-nots" in poor countries, which manifests itself in large inequalities in income, or rather wages.
But in fact, this inequality has only increased, notes Eric Maskin in her article "Why Global Markets Have Not Reduced Inequality in Developing Economies", published in The World Bank Economic Review, which was translated and quoted by the HSE.
Together with the economist, Professor of Harvard University Michael Kremer, Eric Maskin developed an alternative theory that demonstrates why the income gap in poor countries increases with the growth of globalization.
In the new global market, specific processes are taking place.
To demonstrate them, Maskin distinguishes four levels of qualification of specialists - A and B for rich countries, C and D - for poor countries.
After globalization, specialist D from poor countries lacks the level of qualification to cooperate with specialists A and B from rich countries.
And if the wages of level C workers from poor countries grow due to cooperation with employees B from the rich, then workers D do not feel growth or their salaries fall altogether.
The bottom line is that the internationalization of production will contribute to a widening of the wage gap between the two categories of professionals in poor countries and, consequently, to an increase in inequality.
Kremer and E. Maskin proposed a surprisingly beautiful model, an alternative to the Ricardian theory of comparative advantage.
It helps to explain why globalization has led to inequality in incomes," says Fuad Aleskerov, Ordinary Professor, Head of the International Laboratory for Analysis and Decision Selection, Head of the Department of Mathematics at the Higher School of Economics.
And like any powerful theory, I'm sure it will lead to a surge of empirical work in this area.
The solution to the problem, according to Eric Maskin, is to increase the level of education of low-skilled workers.
However, the workers themselves, as the scientist notes, do not have the means to do this, and it is unprofitable for companies to pay for their training.
In such a situation, governments, international agencies, NGOs and private foundations can play a significant role, Maskin believes.
The scientist notes that the developed theory in no way calls for stopping the process of globalization, which has brought and is bearing fruit in the form of GDP growth in countries.
Derbent: a living connection of times.
Derbent - one of the most ancient cities in Russia - celebrates its 2000th anniversary in September.
The program of festive events includes a festival of national cultures of the peoples of Dagestan and a fair in the style of past times, an exhibition of Derbent carpets and the Day of Open Churches, a historical and musical show "2000 years in two hours" and excursions to the reconstructed museum of Peter the Great.
Medieval stones of the Naryn-Kala fortress, ancient Arabic inscriptions on the walls, narrow streets and palace gardens - all this seems to have come down from the pages of "One Thousand and One Nights".
Derbent is the only city in Russia that has survived in its place from ancient times.
Although it was claimed by the Roman Empire, Byzantium, the Khazar Khaganate and the Golden Horde.
The age of the eastern plane trees, which grow in the courtyard of the Derbent Juma Mosque, is equal to several centuries.
These powerful plants are under the protection of the All-Russian program "Trees - monuments of wildlife".
The shade of the sprawling crowns saves pilgrims and tourists during the summer heat.
A visitor to the mosque will be poured with fragrant tea and treated with Dagestani delicacies - honey figs, persimmons, medlar, chudu cakes, ayran and sweets.
In Derbent, from time immemorial, large samovars have been used to drink tea to numerous guests at a time.
An inscription above the entrance to the Juma Mosque says that the building was built in 115 AH.
That is, in 733 according to the Gregorian calendar.
This is the oldest mosque in Russia.
The interior impresses with its scope and solemnity: the arcades of the domes and vaults rest on square columns and are illuminated by the rays of the sun from tiny windows.
Keeping and breeding pigeons is a traditional hobby of the inhabitants of Derbent.
Poultry owners put dovecotes in yards, under trees, in attics.
A breathtaking sight is the soaring into the sky of flocks of white pigeons, similar to the flashes of festive fireworks.
In order to defend against the enemy, the ancient Persians blocked the Caspian Gate with a double stone wall.
Going 500 meters into the sea, this structure locked the harbor of Derbent.
In 2003, the fortress walls of Derbent were included in the UNESCO World Heritage List as the best preserved monument of ancient Persian fortification architecture.
Carpets in Derbent were woven in the V century, and to this day the technology of this unique craft has survived almost unchanged.
On one of the streets adjacent to the city market, carpets are sold for every taste - palas made of wool, cotton or felt of all colors and shades, with or without a pile, with a complex ornament and a bizarre border.
The development of the city began with magals - quarters with one-story stone buildings.
Over the years, the magals have not changed much.
Only satellite dishes, air conditioning on the walls and street lights remind you that you are not in a medieval, but in a modern city.
In the old part of the city, details of the water pipeline built by the Persians about a thousand years ago have been preserved.
Ancient springs have survived to this day, in which local residents still collect water today.
Many Derbent residents prefer water from the taps to water from proven historical fountains.
In Derbent there was one of the centers of pottery.
Irrigated and painted vases, dishes, jugs, cups were valued throughout the Caucasus.
The hands of potters still make wonderful ceramic products for both practical and souvenir purposes.
On the days of holidays and festivals, crowds of spectators gather under a tightrope, on which students of the Republican School of Circus Art perform.
The history of amazing and risky craftsmanship dates back several centuries.
A new trend - among tightrope walkers you can increasingly see girls.
In the premises of the former Maiden Bath today there is a museum "Culture and Life of Ancient Derbent".
Previously, unmarried girls and brides accompanied by friends bathed here, and now anyone can see the vaulted-domed hall, hot and cold pools, past bathing accessories.
Most houses in Derbent have hot water, but baths and steam rooms are as popular these days as they were in the old days.
The benefits of warming up the body with steam are written in old books.
After the bath, the blood improves, the muscles lose fatigue, the body acquires flexibility and lightness.
The festival "Commonwealth", which takes place on the territory of the Naryn-Kala fortress, is attended by ethnic compounds of many districts of Dagestan.
Participants in national costumes dance, play folk melodies, perform songs of the peoples of the Caucasus and treat visitors to delicious homemade cheese.
Kırkhlar is the burial place of forty martyrs who laid down their heads for Islam.
This is one of the most revered complexes for Muslims of the North Caucasus.
Yellowed by time, the sarcophagi are carved from solid stone blocks and are oriented, as is customary among the Arabs, along the west-east axis.
Brothers Gavril and Albert Yakubov cut and shave customers in a small salon near the Upper Bazaar.
A hairdresser on this site has been located for many years.
The techniques of the barber's craft are passed down from generation to generation.
At the same time, the Yakubov brothers can make not only a traditional, but also the most modern hairstyle.
On one of the streets of the Old Town, the house in which the Decembrist writer Alexander Bestuzhev-Marlinsky, exiled to the Caucasus, lived, has been preserved.
Having learned the Turkic language and collected ethnographic material, he described Derbent in the first third of the XIX century with its ancient monuments, life and way of life of the townspeople.
Teahouse is a traditional club of the East, where only tea and homemade cakes are served.
Men come here to quench their thirst, chat with friends and solve some work problems.
As in past times, women are not recommended to cross the threshold of the teahouse.
The Derbent dance ensemble "Caspiy" was created three years ago, but has already managed to take part in the events of the republican and Russian levels.
Soloists of the ensemble rehearse every day, learning to perfection the folk Avar, Dargin, Tat, Armenian dances.
With the onset of the evening, when the noise subsides and street lamps are lit, local residents sit on benches near houses with protruding terraces.
As a rule, Derbent residents discuss everyday issues.
But on the eve of the anniversary, they increasingly recall episodes of the unique history of their city, which influenced the fate of the entire Black Sea-Caspian region.
A business "airport game" was held in Domodedovo.
A new form of education is being tested in the capital.
Four hundred students tried themselves in the role of airport employees.
To do this, models of three air harbors were mounted in Domodedovo.
Young people not only inspected and registered passengers, but also serviced the planes.
All this is in the form of a business game, but in terms of complexity it was not inferior to reality.
Late flights, two passengers with fractures on board, the ladder was lost somewhere on the way to the plane.
For a real airport, it's hell.
For the one that settled in the Domodedovo hangar - a standard set of tasks that beginners have to solve.
Three major airports from around the world fit in one hangar at once.
Today they employ four hundred students from the capital's colleges and universities.
An unprecedented chance to learn all about the inner world of the air harbor.
Passenger registration, aircraft service, luggage turnover - they were entrusted even with buses on the airfield, ladders and passenger inspection.
And the passengers are completely problematic.
One is in trouble with documents, another missed the flight, the third filled the bag with suspicious items.
And you need to deal with all this, as in life - in the shortest possible time.
For each of these completed tasks, they are charged a certain amount, virtual cash, as if the airline paid them the appropriate amounts for servicing the flight.
"For failure to fulfill the relevant tasks, a fine is collected from them," explains Dmitry Khilko, a financial analyst of the game, in an interview with the Vesti-Moscow program.
Officials from the Ministry of Education are closely monitoring what is happening.
For them, this exam is an attempt to try out a new form of education.
She has already found a place in the course of secondary vocational education.
"Six interregional competence centers will be formed, which will become, in fact, new models for the activities of modern colleges with a modern management system, with highly qualified personnel, with modern equipment," says Natalia Zolotareva, director of the Department of State Policy in the Field of Worker Training and Additional Professional Education of the Ministry of Education and Science of Russia.
But students are not up to global plans.
After three days of such training, they seem to need a day off.
But the grades for this exam had quite a material expression.
The newest smart glasses, the best I've ever seen!
"I received them for responding in a timely manner to the claim to our airport on Instagram," sergey Shuvalov, a participant of the game, PR manager of the Frankfurt Airport team, is satisfied.
The best judges, as they say, were taken on a pencil in order to invite them to work by the time they completed their studies.
The U.S. Embassy regrets the closure of the American Center in Moscow.
The U.S. Embassy in Russia expressed regret over the closure of the U.S. Center for Foreign Literature at the Library of Foreign Literature.
The center has been working in Moscow for more than 22 years.
The U.S. Embassy in Moscow deeply regrets the Russian government's unilateral decision to close the U.S. Embassy Center at the Rudomino All-Russian State Library in Moscow.
"The unilateral steps taken by the Russian Federation recently call into question the commitment of the Russian government to ties between the Russian and American peoples, which were not interrupted even during the Cold War and at other difficult moments in the long history of relations between our countries," US Ambassador John Tefft said in a statement to Interfax.
The American Center created deep and strong ties between the people and culture of Russia and the United States.
It was the center of American culture, history, and literature in the Russian capital, and also served as a venue for meetings with numerous American prominent figures, among whom were astronauts, artists, athletes, scientists, politicians and writers.
"Last year alone, the American Center held more than 400 cultural and educational events and received more than 50,000 Russian visitors," the diplomat stressed.
Tefft recalled that about a year ago it was decided to close another joint Russian-American project - the FLEX (Future Leaders Exchange Program) educational exchange program.
The Green Tribunal was quick to be slaughtered.
A typical situation: four officials stand in front of the table of Judge Swatanter Kumar, listening to his complaints about the work done.
The court is not at all satisfied with the quality of your work.
We didn't give you a 110-page order to make fun of," Kumar says. -
If at least one more brick is laid, we will order the demolition of all existing buildings.
Kumar heads the National Green Tribunal (NRT), a judicial body established in 2010 to stop the rapid pollution of the environment that has accompanied the rapid economic growth of recent decades.
During this time, the Tribunal managed to consider more than 10 thousand claims related to air pollution, garbage collection, geological development, toxic waste and the construction of dams.
In two of the three cases, the court decides to stop construction leading to pollution.
The stakes are incredibly high: in the less than 60 years since the declaration of independence of enhanced industrial development, India has transformed itself from a land of virgin jungle into one of the most overpopulated and polluted countries in the world.
The problem is particularly acute in large metropolitan areas, where infrastructure development has not kept pace with rapid urbanization: cities are covered with dense smog, rivers are filled with pesticides and waste from enterprises and households, and the few remaining residential areas are cut down for construction with new residential quarters.
Despite the formal support of the green movement from the state, NRT is regularly criticized by the government of Narendra Modi, as it often becomes the main reason for the cancellation of major investment projects.
In May this year, for example, the environment minister called the court's decisions "extreme" and "unenforceable."
Sometimes court decisions are indeed impossible to enforce within the deadline set by the court, confirms environmental lawyer Raj Panjwani.
However, impossible deadlines have a positive side: at least, they make those responsible move.
"His main goal is to shake up this system," the lawyer adds.
The Green Tribunal has repeatedly canceled major construction projects: on its account the termination of the construction of an airport, a power plant and hundreds of smaller structures.
At the same time, people are also trying not to forget: for example, during a discussion of the fate of a pharmaceutical company in the state of Telagnan, which polluted the local river with fluoride.
We can close your factory, but we are also responsible for the economic consequences.
"People will lose their jobs," Kumar commented on his decision.
However, such explanations are not always understood by ordinary people, whose lives can change thanks to one stroke of a judge's pen.
Thus, in April, the Tribunal decided to ban all vehicles over 10 years of age from entering the capital, which caused popular indignation.
Despite a sharp drop in popularity and a flurry of criticism, Swatanter Kumar refused to reverse the decision.
Instead, he ordered statistics from the Delhi government on incoming and outgoing vehicles, and also made a proposal to purchase 10,000 additional buses, having previously learned from the factories whether they were able to fulfill such an order.
As sources of pollution such as landfills, fuel quality and even traffic incidents began to fall within the scope of the court's attention, popular anger began to gradually subside.
But the most painful topic of the principal judge was the program to clean up the Ganges River, announced with fanfare by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year.
When it comes to the Ganges, a sacred river for Hindus, the judge often stops holding back his emotions and switches to shouting.

Xi Jinping calls for making the economy more open to the world
The economy must become more open to the world to spur growth, President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday in an address to the group tasked with leading reforms.
"China should focus on attracting foreign investors and experts and develop an opening-up policy," he said, addressing participants in the 16th meeting of the Central Leading Group Committee on Deepening Reforms Comprehensively.
According to him, the expansion of openness and deepening of reforms will give the economy a new impetus and vitality and provide a new space for economic development.
The lead group adopted a number of directives, including the introduction of regulation of investor access to the market, the amendment of border control rules, the promotion of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) attracting private capital and the revision of the resident registration system.
According to the statement, a list of sectors of the economy and production that are not available for investment will be compiled.
The system will be gradually debugged through trial programs.
This is an important step as it will give the market a more significant role in allocating resources, ensuring the rule of law in the business sphere and increasing openness, the statement said.
The government will also loosen control over the powers given to them to companies, thereby ensuring that companies conduct their own business.
The statement also said that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to strengthen local growth.
Even more areas will be available to private investors in order to increase the openness of state-controlled sectors of the economy.
"The government will not change its policy towards foreign investors and will protect the legitimate interests of companies with foreign financing, as well as provide them with better conditions," the statement said.
In addition, the procedure for applying for a permanent residence permit for foreigners, or "green card", will be facilitated by optimizing the requirements and simplifying the filing process itself.
The meeting also discussed ensuring the rights of lawyers and training professional judges and prosecutors.
According to an official report released after the meeting, it was also attended by Premier Li Keqiang and ministers Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli.
