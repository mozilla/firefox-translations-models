This was stated on Friday by the official representative of the Office of the State Council of China for Taiwan Affairs Ma Xiaoguang.

TikTok hides undesirable videos from users
According to TikTok, the number of its users in the world exceeds 500 million, 40% of which are under 18 years of age.
Imagine China / Reuters
The Chinese social network TikTok censor videos that mention Tiananmen Square, the independence of Tibet or the banned religious group Falun Gong, tells The Guardian.
The documents that were at the publication say that the owner of TikTok (the company ByteDance) with the help of the application promotes the goals of China's foreign policy abroad.
Most of the violations regarding China's policy fall under "incitement to hatred."
In each case, TikTok places undesirable publications in a context suitable for general rules so that the actions of the social network do not seem censored.
For example, the ban on criticism of China's socialist system falls under the general ban "criticism or attacks on the policies and social rules of any country, such as the constitutional monarchy, the parliamentary system, etc. ."
The ban on the mention of incidents in Tiananmen Square or the genocide in Cambodia falls under the "distortion of the history of China or other countries."
The document also lists the banned names of twenty "foreign leaders or statesmen," including North Korean leaders Kim Jong-il, Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-un, Indian politician Mahatma Gandhi, American presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, South Korean President Park Kyn Hee, Indonesian President Joko Viddo and Indian Prime Minister Nadra.
The prohibited material is divided into two categories, the document says.
Publications from the first category are deleted by the administrators of the social network and may entail blocking the user.
Not too strict violations belong to the second category: such publications remain on the site, but their distribution is limited to TikTok algorithms.
ByteDance told The Guardian that these rules are outdated and no longer applied: "Now we use a localized approach for moderation, as well as involve independent local specialists."
Russian users of TikTok have no specific restrictions on publications, says the co-founder of the "Producer Center" Rustem Bogdanov.
"Producer Center" is one Russian media company that officially cooperates with TikTok.
All advertising materials of bloggers "Producer Center" is coordinated with representatives of the social network, but user materials can be placed without approval, Bogdanov reports.
Asked whether it is possible to speak about politics or Putin in TikTok, Bogdanov answers in the affirmative and says that he saw such publications.
The founder of the agency Our Didgit Roman Zaripov agrees with Bogdanov: "The basic rules for users of TikTok list in the user agreement: you can not put shocking content that discriminate against statements and so on."
But under these rules you can bring any content that moderators do not like, says Zaripov.
Zaripov Agency is another Russian partner of TikTok.
According to TikTok, the number of its users in the world exceeds 500 million, 40% of which are under the age of 18.
Under the user agreement, only persons over the age of 13 can use TikTok.
The administrators of the social network check their age with the help of artificial intelligence: the neural network analyzes the faces and determines how many years a person looks, says Bogdanov.
If the neural network decides that the user is younger, his account can be deleted, he adds.
According to RBC, in September 2019. ByteDance opened an office in Moscow on the territory of the coworking WeWork.

This is reported by "Kommersant" with reference to the data of the Central Bank.
In the summer of 2019, the regulator gave telecom operators information about more than 2.5 thousand numbers, from which customers of various financial organizations called.

Deputy head of the Department of information security of the Central Bank Artem Sychev said that a wide range of Russian banks faced the substitution of the number.

As reported in the press service of "Beeline," part of the information about the fraudulent calls, which was transmitted to the Central Bank, was incorrect: the lists included numbers that are really used by banks to communicate with customers.
Their blocking would cause failures in the work of the organization.

He explained that the establishment of such a base would require amendments to the legislation.

Barcelona are blackmailing Neymar
The Spanish "Barcelona" and its former footballer Brazilian Neymar are trying to resolve the financial dispute that arose after the transfer of the striker to the French "Paris Saint-Germain."
The case almost reached the court, but the Catalans offered the player to resolve the dispute without the intervention of Themis.
Otherwise, they refuse him to return.
Neymar and his clever father, who is also an agent of the Brazilian, started an interesting trick: by agreement with Barca, which the player signed in 2016, he had to receive 40 million euros.
However, literally a year later, the forward was in PSG for a record 222 million euros.
However, he received 22 million from the Catalans and now wants to pick up the remaining 18.
Moreover, the Brazilian lawyers insist that the club owes him interest for the late payment.
When Neymar was announced in the capital of Catalonia, Barcelona sent a counterclaim.
"Blue-Grenade" insist that the bonus was relied on for the execution of the entire contract - from 2016 to 2022.
Accordingly, the club believes that the player was only owed a quarter of 40 million euros and demand a return of the proportional part of the first payment.
But the most interesting thing is that in the summer Neymar and Barsa almost agreed on the return of the "prodigest" player in the womb of Catalonia.
True, the deal has failed, but the hope for the reverse transition of the forward remains.
And so, as reported by Sports.Ru with reference to insiders, the lawyers of the club told the representatives of the player that if the issue of financial claims is not resolved in the pre-trial order, this will exclude the possibility of returning the Brazilian.
Neymar himself so wants to return that he asked for guarantees that the Catalans would buy him back.

The Russians have nothing to put off for retirement - B. Matvienko, Minnesota
The speaker of the Federation Council Valentina Matvienko believes that the Russians do not have enough savings to fully work in the country bill on a guaranteed pension product.
The practice of increasing pensions due to personal savings in the world is quite common.
The other thing is how timely we have its introduction.
"In my opinion, now a significant part of the population has incomes, of which they simply have nothing to allocate to increase pensions in the future," - said. Matvienko.
The Russians, in the opinion of the speaker, cannot understand the mechanisms of formation and accrual of pensions, since "the constant changes in this area have finally confused them."
This does not mean that I am against improving the pension system governing its legislation.
"Russia is a social state, and we have to do everything to ensure that the size of pensions, social protection of citizens improve.
But the steps in this direction should be thoughtful, responsible, taking into account domestic realities," - said V. Matvienko "RIA Novosti."
The head of the Federation Council stressed that if this initiative (the bill on a guaranteed pension product) will develop, then several basic principles should be provided, including voluntariness, tax preferences for citizens and employers and strict guarantees and the responsibility of the state for ensuring the preservation of pension savings.
On September 6, the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation announced the sending for approval of the bill on a guaranteed pension product (GPP).
Among its main elements are the voluntary procedure for citizens joining the savings system, guaranteeing the preservation of long-term pension savings of citizens by the state, registration of accumulative accounts of citizens by the central administrator, tax benefits for business and tax deductions for citizens.

The news about the departure of the beloved superhero from the Marvel Cinematic Universe sparked anger among many loyal fans
One of the most famous comic book characters - Spider-Man - will remain in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige said he was thrilled.
It's amazing that Spidey [Spider-Man's journey] in the Cinematic Universe will continue.
"We're all at Marvel Studios very excited that we can continue to work on it.
Spider-Man is an iconic figure.
This is a hero whose story affects all generations and audiences around the world," he said.
At the same time, Feigi recalled that Sony is creating its own cinematic universe, built just around Spider-Man.
"It so happened that he is the only superpowered hero who found himself in different canine universes.
So, while Sony continues to develop its own Spydy universe, the future could present unexpected surprises," he said.
Tom Holland, who played Spider-Man in five films, apparently commenting on the news, posted in his Instagram account an excerpt from the film "The Wolf of Wall Street," in which the hero Leonardo diCaprio shouts "I'm not leaving!"
Information about the contradictions between the companies appeared in August.

But it didn't suit Sony.
The news of the possible departure of the beloved superhero from the Marvel Cinematic Universe caused anger among many loyal fans.
Details of the new conditions have not yet been disclosed.
Sony declined to comment on the agreement, but said: "We have cooperated well over the past four years, and our shared desire to continue working together has been commensurate with the wishes of many fans.
We are happy to be able to go forward together."

According to the agronomist, the consumer can not get reliable information about the composition of the baged tea - the manufacturer can add ingredients that will not be indicated on the package.
Sawdust is not thrown away at the end of the season, so they can end up in tea.
"Moreover, tea plants are not always included in the bags," Tikhonova said.
According to her, it is better to abandon the use of such a drink in favor of tea for the weight, which is sold in specialized stores.

It's time to build interregional ties
The Committee of the Federation Council on Economic Policy summarized information received from the regions on the existing programs for the development of business and legalization of self-employed, as well as the results of such programs.
In their letters, the regions told the senators about the problems of the development of SMEs and sent proposals to improve the current legislation.
"To date, communication between the regions is not sufficiently established, as a result of which the business community in all regions of the visit by senators was identified the issue of the lack of information about regional entrepreneurship development programs in the country as a whole," said Andrey Kutepov.
In the annex to the letter, which was sent to the Government, he presented a set of positive developments of the regions on the legalization of self-employment and summary data from the regions with proposals and problems (available at the disposal of the editorial board).
In addition to the relevant ministries, the summary data from the regions were also sent to the heads of regional executive bodies.
The exchange of information on positively implemented developments in the regions could give impetus to the development of entrepreneurship in general.
The first step to such an exchange will be the direction of information available to the Committee on Economic Policy," the senator told the Parliament newspaper.
Useful experience

And in a number of other regions, special support measures are being taken for youth entrepreneurship.
Self-employed continue to get out of the shadows
According to the regional authorities, a number of changes to the current legislation should be made to more effectively support for small and medium-sized businesses.
For example, the Arkhangelsk region proposed to replace the term "self-employment" with "entrepreneurial activity," since this "most corresponds to the content of the state service to promote the self-employment of unemployed citizens."
In the Ivanovo region, it is necessary to make amendments to expand the list of activities provided by self-employed citizens, including activities for the finishing and repair of residential premises, country buildings, physical training.
The Bryansk region considers it important to strengthen control over unscrupulous dairy producers with the help of the veterinary system "Mercury."
And in the Kostroma and Magadan regions, they advocate the consolidation in the regulatory and legal field of the concept of "social entrepreneurship" and areas of support for social entrepreneurship.
All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of state programs to support small and medium-sized businesses, and the most important will be developed in the form of specific bills.
