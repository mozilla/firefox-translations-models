That's how they tracked my whereabouts.
I note that I was not restricted in my movements.

China strongly opposes US passage of "Taipei Bill"
China strongly opposes the adoption by the US of the so-called "Taipei Bill", which seriously violates the one-China principle and the principles of the three China-US joint communiqu√©s.
This was stated on Friday by the official representative of the Office of the State Council of the People's Republic of China for Taiwan Affairs Ma Xiaoguang.
The approval by the US Senate Committee on Foreign Relations of this bill is also a serious violation of international law and the basic principles of international relations and a gross interference in China's internal affairs, Ma Xiaoguang said.
According to him, Taiwan is part of China, and related issues relate to China's internal affairs.
"We urge the US side to clarify the situation, immediately stop pushing the relevant negative bills, and immediately stop interfering in the Taiwan issue to avoid further damage to China-US relations as well as peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait," he said.
China must and will be reunited.
This historical trend cannot be stopped by anyone and no forces, Ma Xiaoguang stressed.
TikTok hides unwanted videos from users
According to TikTok, the number of its users in the world exceeds 500 million, 40% of whom are under 18 years old.
Imagine China / Reuters
Chinese social network TikTok censors videos that mention Tiananmen Square, Tibetan independence, or the banned religious group Falun Gong, The Guardian reports.
In the documents that were in the possession of the publication, it is said that the owner of TikTok (ByteDance company) with the help of the application promotes the goals of China's foreign policy abroad.
The bulk of the violations regarding China's policies fall under "hate speech."
In each case, TikTok places unwanted publications in a context that fits the general rules, so that the actions of the social network do not look censorship.
For example, the ban on criticism of China's socialist system falls under the general prohibition of "criticizing or attacking the policies and social rules of any country, such as a constitutional monarchy, a parliamentary system, etc."
The ban on mentioning incidents in Tiananmen Square or the genocide in Cambodia falls under the "distortion of the history of China or other countries."
The document also lists the banned names of twenty "foreign leaders or statesmen," including North Korean leaders Kim Jong Il, Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong Un, Indian politician Mahatma Gandhi, U.S. Presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, South Korean President Park Geun-hee, Indonesian President Joko Widodo, and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.  is stated in the document.
Prohibited material is divided into two categories, the document says.
Publications from the first category are deleted by the administrators of the social network and may entail the blocking of the user.
Not too strict violations belong to the second category: such publications remain on the site, but their distribution is limited by TikTok algorithms.
Representatives of ByteDance told The Guardian that these rules are outdated and no longer apply: "Now we use a localized approach for moderation, and also attract independent local specialists."
Russian users of TikTok have no specific restrictions on publications, says Rustem Bogdanov, co-founder of the Production Center.
"Production Center" is one of the Russian media companies that officially cooperates with TikTok.
All advertising materials of bloggers "Production Center" coordinates with representatives of the social network, but user materials can be posted without approval, bogdanov reports.
When asked whether it is possible to speak on TikTok about politics or Putin, Bogdanov answers in the affirmative and says that he has seen such publications.
Roman Zaripov, the founder of Our Didgital, agrees with Bogdanov: "TikTok lists the basic rules for users in the user agreement: you can not post shocking content, discriminatory statements, and so on."
But under these rules you can bring any content that moderators do not like, Zaripov notes.
Zaripov Agency is another Russian partner of TikTok.
According to TikTok, the number of its users in the world exceeds 500 million, 40% of whom are under 18 years old.
According to the user agreement, only persons over 13 years of age can use TikTok.
Administrators of the social network check their age with the help of artificial intelligence: the neural network analyzes faces and determines how many years a person looks like, says Bogdanov.
If the neural network decides that the user is younger, his account can be deleted, he adds.
According to RBC, in September 2019. ByteDance has opened an office in Moscow on the territory of the WeWork coworking space.

In Russia, the number of calls from scammers who replace the phone number of the bank has increased.
It is reported by "Kommersant" with reference to the data of the Central Bank.
In the summer of 2019, the regulator transferred to telecom operators information about more than 2.5 thousand numbers from which customers of various financial organizations were called.
In 189 cases, operators found a number spoofing.
Another 218 rooms were blocked, and in 59 cases a restriction was imposed on the use of financial services.
Deputy Head of the Information Security Department of the Central Bank Artem Sychev said that a wide range of Russian banks faced with the substitution of the number.
He explained that operators do not always respond to the warnings of the Central Bank about fraudulent calls, referring to the absence of such an obligation in the law "On Communications".
Otkritie Bank, Rosbank and Alfa-Bank confirmed the information about the increase in the number of fraudulent calls with the substitution of the number.
According to the press service of Beeline, some of the information about fraudulent calls, which was transferred by the Central Bank, was incorrect: the lists included numbers that are really used by banks to communicate with customers.
Blocking them would lead to disruptions in the work of the organization.
Artem Sychev said that the Central Bank plans to create a database of fraud numbers, which the telecom operator will contact with each call to check the number.
He explained that in order to create such a base, it would be necessary to amend the legislation.

The Secretary General said this during a speech at Columbia University in New York.
Answering the question whether the relevant topic was raised during the meeting, Stoltenberg said that they really discussed this issue, and also stressed that in his response he did not name the timing of Ukraine's accession to NATO.

Barcelona blackmail Neymar
The Spanish "Barcelona" and its former football player Brazilian Neymar are trying to settle the financial dispute that arose after the transfer of the striker to the French "Paris Saint-Germain".
The case almost reached the court, but the Catalans offered the player to resolve the dispute without the intervention of Themis.
Otherwise, they refuse to return him.
Neymar and his cunning father, who is also the agent of the Brazilian, started an interesting trick: according to the agreement with Barca, which the player signed in 2016, he was supposed to receive 40 million euros.
However, just a year later, the forward found himself at PSG for a record 222 million euros.
However, he received 22 million from the Catalans and now wants to take the remaining 18.
Moreover, the lawyers of the Brazilian insist that the club also owes him interest for late payment.
When the Catalan capital became aware of Neymar's claims, Barcelona sent a counterclaim.
The Blues insist the bonus was for the entire contract from 2016 to 2022.
Accordingly, the club believes that the player was entitled to only a quarter of 40 million euros and demand the return of the proportional part of the first payment.
But the most interesting thing is that in the summer Neymar and Barca almost agreed on the return of the "prodigal" player to the bosom of Catalonia.
True, the deal fell through, but the hope for the forward's return transfer remains.
And here, according to Sports. Ru, citing insiders, the club's lawyers told the player's representatives that if the issue of financial claims is not settled pre-trial, this will exclude the possibility of the Brazilian's return.
Neymar himself wants to return so much that he asked for guarantees that the Catalans will buy him back.

The former midfielder of this club in the near future can sign a contract with FC Rostov, - reports the portal "Championship".
According to the publication, negotiations between representatives of Rostov and Mamaev are now in the final stage.
Presumably, the contract with the 31-year-old football player will be signed for two years with the possibility of extending for another season.
"Sport-Express" writes that a day earlier Pavel Mamaev was supposed to undergo a medical examination in the Moscow "Dynamo", but the check did not take place because of the "uncertain situation in the club".

A man with a samurai sword tried to defend a cart found in a garbage heap
A resident of the American city of Oakland Park, Florida, was arrested on charges of attempted murder after he swung a samurai sword at his opponent in an argument over a cart found in the garbage.
Curtis Miller, 54, was digging through a pile of garbage near an empty house.
This was noticed by Todd Beavers, who went for an evening walk.
The latter decided to join the search and found a black cart among the garbage.
Miller saw Beavers' find and was upset.
He believed that he could claim the trolley, as he was the first to start digging in the garbage.
The men began to argue.
Suddenly, Beavers grabbed the cart and ran with it towards his house.
Then Miller took the samurai sword he found in the same pile and began to pursue his opponent.
He caught up with Beavers near his house.
Miller drew the sword from his scabbard and began waving it in the direction of the thief of the cart.
Beaver informed Miller that what was happening was being recorded on video.
Noticing the video camera, Miller fled, but threatened to return.
Beavers left the cart in the yard and entered the house.
Soon after, he saw that a strange woman had entered his yard and taken the cart, shouting insults.
Police were already looking for Miller for driving without a license.
The man was detained, he was charged with attempted murder.
In September, it was reported that in the American city of Hardiston, New Jersey, a hedge fund manager attacked a strange woman and wounded her with a sword.
In this way, he reacted to the fact that guests at the wedding, which was celebrated in the same hotel where he was staying, did not allow him to light a cigarette.
Riots for three
The "Moscow case" against the participants of the summer protests, the further it goes, the more noticeably it breaks up into separate fragments and loses its political content.
Evidence of the very fact of "mass riots" does not stand up to scrutiny, but in the absence of a political decision to let the case slide, a weak evidence base would not necessarily lead to the dropping of charges.
The collapse of the case should inspire society, but it will certainly leave the security forces in extreme irritation, whose efforts to fill the case with defendants and evidence were in vain.
On Thursday, September 26, one of the three remaining defendants in the case under Art. 212 of the Criminal Code (mass riots) - Alexei Minyailo was unexpectedly released from custody without any obligations, and a few hours later he was completely rehabilitated: the ICR dropped the charges against him.
Minyailo sat under arrest for almost two months, several professional communities stood up for him at once: historians, priests, writers.
After that, only two accused of participating in mass riots remained in the case (initially there were 13 defendants): Sergei Fomin, who was transferred to house arrest on September 3, and Samariddin Radjabov, to whom the court extended his arrest until the end of December (he is also accused of using violence against a representative of the authorities, Article 318 of the Criminal Code).
The court sentenced the author of a comic petition on the accession of Latvia to the United States
The court of the Vidzeme suburb of Riga sentenced the author of a comic petition on the accession of Latvia to the United States of America, Denis Bartetsky.
It is noted that the man was assigned 80 hours of correctional labor and one year of probation.
"Common sense is not the strongest side of our system," Bartecki commented on the court's decision.
He also added that usually the punishment is less than requested.
The collection of signatures on the accession of Latvia to the United States was organized in 2016.
Meanwhile, simultaneously with this petition, the site collected signatures on the accession of Latvia to the "Galactic Empire" and on the country's exit from the solar system and the Milky Way.
It is noted that a criminal case was initiated against Bartetsky under the first paragraph of the 82nd article of the Criminal Law of the country - "Public call to undermine the territorial integrity of the Republic of Latvia".
Before that, in 2016, the author of an online petition on the accession of Latvia to Russia received six months in prison.
In Khabarovsk made an emergency landing Japanese airliner

The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia proposes to punish for insulting police officers on the Internet
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia has prepared amendments to the law "On the Police" in order to protect law enforcement officers from the dissemination of slanderous and defamatory information on the Internet.
On Friday, an application for public discussion of the bill appeared on the federal portal of regulatory legal acts, the draft document itself has not yet been published.
The explanatory note to the document notes that it is being developed in connection with the need to protect the honor and dignity of a police officer from "the dissemination in information and communication networks, including the Internet, of information of a defamatory nature, including that of a defamatory nature."
How exactly it is supposed to protect police officers from libel on the network is not specified.
At the same time, the explanatory note to the document notes that the provisions of the amendments will be applied "by individualization of the mechanism" already foreseen by the law on blocking posts that insult government officials, and the law on fines for such posts.
Both laws came into force in March this year.
The final text of the bill will be published after public discussions and independent anti-corruption expertise.
According to the explanatory memorandum, the amendments to the law "On the Police" should come into force in January 2020.
On March 18, President Vladimir Putin signed a law punishing "blatant disrespect for the state" online.
According to this document, Roskomnadzor warns the resource about the violation and gives it a day to eliminate it.
For the first violation of the prohibitions, a fine of 30 to 300 thousand rubles is provided, and for a repeated violation - administrative arrest for up to 15 days.
On April 12, Roskomnadzor applied this rule to the media for the first time, blocking the Yaroslavl edition of 76.ru.
Soon after, the Chudovsky District Court of the Novgorod Region fined a local resident 30,000 rubles for posting on the network "two records with information in an indecent form that offends human dignity and public morality and expresses a clear disrespect for society, the state, and the bodies exercising state power in the Russian Federation."
Named the period of reduction of mortgage rates
Rates on housing loans in Russia will decrease until the end of 2019.

As Plutnik noted at the board under the Ministry of Construction of Russia, most banks in the remaining months of the year will conduct another cycle of reducing mortgage rates, and the market average will reach 8.9 percent - the level provided for by the national project "Housing and Urban Environment".
According to the project passport, in 2019, the average mortgage rate should be 8.9 percent, in 2021 - 8.5 percent, by 2024 - 7.9 percent.
The program provides for "providing affordable housing for families with average incomes, including the creation of opportunities for the acquisition (construction of housing by them using a mortgage loan, the rate of which should be less than 8 percent)."
Earlier in September, it became known that one of the largest players in the Russian mortgage market - Sberbank - plans to carry out another reduction in rates on housing loans by the end of 2019.
Will phytoestrogens and phytoandrogens help prolong youth?
The topic of phytoandrogens is poorly studied.
Of the most famous is pine pollen.
But phytoestrogens have been studied well and have a positive effect on the body.
They reduce the risks of certain diseases associated with age (among them cardiovascular, some types of cancer).
Known sources of phytoestrogens are all legumes (the most popular is soybeans), hops, flax seeds.
However, many experts believe that such dietary supplements can not act as a full-fledged replacement for natural hormones.
It is impossible to exclude the possible harm from such additives.
For example, against the background of their reception, the production of their own hormones may decrease due to the fact that too many analogues from the outside enter the body.
Veretennikov called for the revival of Kazakhstan's Zhenis.
Former striker of Rotor and the Russian national team Oleg Veretennikov joined the action to revive Kazakhstan's Zhenis.
The club from Astana, which in different years was called "Dynamo", "Tselinnik", "Astana" and "Zhenis", was disbanded in 2014.
Veretennikov defended his colors in 2004 and 2008.
"I learned about the action on the revival of the football club "Zhenis", organized by its fans.
And I couldn't stay away!
I spent a season and a half at this club.
It wasn't the best of times in terms of results and funding, but I'll never forget this club and its loyal fans who have always been with the team!
The Munaitpasov Stadium, where I scored my 200th goal in my career, will always remain in my memory!
"Zhenis" should be reborn!
He has a huge history and great fans.
I wish them all the best and believe that the city authorities will return their native club!" wrote Veretennikov on Instagram.
The Bastion complex launched the Onyx rocket in Chukotka
The Ministry of Defense for the first time launched a cruise missile from the Bastion complex in Chukotka.
Onyx launched at a distance of 350 kilometers from the target, and 200 of them flew over land, which is a record for this type of missile.
The safety of firing was provided by about 10 warships and vessels of the Pacific Fleet, as well as naval aviation aircraft, the Department of Information and Mass Communications of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation reported.
Previously, bastion complexes were never used in Chukotka.
Hydrometeorological Center called the right folk signs
In Russia, there are many folk signs by which people try to predict the weather.
Unfortunately, not all of them work.
The Hydrometeorological Center checked all the signs that supposedly work.
Meteorologists came to the conclusion that only two of them can really be trusted, however, in the short term.
As the scientific director of the Hydrometeorological Center of Russia Roman Vilfand said, if the sun is red during sunset, then the next day will really be fine, as our ancestors noticed.
And if the celestial body is whitish, then the next day it will rain.
The second working omen is based on bird watching.
More often they talk about swallows, if they fly low, then it is usually for the rain.
This is explained simply - when the humidity of the air is high, then the wings of the midge get wet and the birds are forced to decline in order to hunt insects, writes TASS.
Different continents have their own folk signs.
Groundhog Day is a traditional folk holiday in the United States and Canada, celebrated annually on February 2.
It is believed that on this day you need to watch the groundhog climbing out of its burrow to determine the time of arrival of spring.
On the beaches of the north-east of Brazil found unidentified oil slicks
Oil slicks of unknown origin were found on 99 beaches in northeastern Brazil.
Pockets of pollution were scattered over two thousand kilometers of coastline.
Reports of the first discovered oil spills began to arrive on the second of September.
However, every day until Thursday, their number, as well as territorial coverage, continued to increase.
The Brazilian Institute of the Environment conducted a chemical analysis of the identified samples.
It turned out that all of them are identical and we are talking about crude oil.
The state oil corporation Petrobras, to which the samples found were transferred for analysis, said that in their composition they do not correspond to the oil extracted from the fields in Brazil.
"It's thick oil.
It can be dropped from one of the ships after cleaning the tanks.
Many continue to do so.
And most likely it got into the ocean current," Rogerio Almeida, coordinator of the union of oil workers of the states of Pernambuco and Para√≠ba, told the Brazilian news portal G1.
He also added that despite the prohibition of this practice, many ships continue to dump waste on the high seas.
On the beaches of four of the eight affected states of the northeast of the country, environmentalists found nine sea turtles completely covered with oil film.
And only two of them were saved.
In the coming days, the Brazilian Institute of the Environment, together with Petrobras, will begin cleaning up polluted beaches.
In the meantime, the institute's specialists recommend that tourists and local residents avoid oil spills and notify about all detected foci of pollution.
Medvedev instructed to revise the norms of work of catering enterprises
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev instructed Rospotrebnadzor, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Economy and the Ministry of Industry and Trade, together with the business ombudsman and the business community, to revise sanitary and epidemiological rules and norms for catering organizations.
They will also have to study the issue of transition to the application in the organization of catering of the requirements established by the technical regulations of the Eurasian Economic Union.
The departments should submit their proposals to the government no later than October 15, according to the list of instructions from Mr. Medvedev following the results of the September 11 program "Dialogue" on the TV channel "Russia 24".
By the same date, Mr. Medvedev instructed all these departments, in addition to the Ministry of Justice, to submit proposals for conducting an experiment from January 1, 2020 to limit control measures for catering organizations in a number of regions, including Moscow, Tatarstan and the Kaliningrad Region.
By November 11, the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Economy were instructed to submit to the government a bill with amendments to the Code of Administrative Offenses on the application of administrative suspension of activities for violation of the requirements for the organization of catering, due to which harm to health was caused.
In addition, the Ministry of Labor, the Ministry of Economy, Rospotrebnadzor and the Ministry of Finance need to work out the issue of a gradual transition from 2021 to the formation of a consumer basket based on the basic set of products that allows you to form a full-fledged diet of healthy eating.
Recall that the business community started talking about outdated norms of requirements after one cafe from the Anderson chain was closed.
The business community demanded to cancel the existing SanPiNy, Rospotrebnadzor announced the joint development of new ones.
The list includes 33 departments.
Meanwhile, Rospotrebnadzor intends to reduce the number of sanitary norms and rules by 40 times by 2021.
Currently, the operatives have information about three thefts in which the detainee was involved.
A man operated in the Skuratovsky microdistrict of Tula.
He stole batteries and car radios from cars.
Of the two cars - VAZ-2106 and VAZ-2107 - the kidnapper took the batteries, presumably for the purpose of further sale.
"And from another VAZ-2107 car, for the same purpose, the attacker took a car radio and a subwoofer," the Tula Region Department of Internal Affairs reported.
The stolen attacker probably intended to resell.
Currently, a 26-year-old unemployed man is detained.
Russians have nothing to save for retirement - V. Matvienko
Speaker of the Federation Council Valentina Matvienko believes that Russians do not have sufficient savings in order for the bill on the guaranteed pension product to work in full force in the country.
The practice of increasing the pension at the expense of personal savings in the world is quite common.
Another thing is how timely its introduction is in our country.
"In my opinion, now a significant part of the population has incomes, from which they simply have nothing to allocate to increase pension provision in the future," Matvienko said.
Russians, according to the speaker, cannot understand the mechanisms for the formation and accrual of pensions, since "constant changes in this area have completely confused them."
This does not mean that I am against the improvement of the pension system and the legislation regulating it.
"Russia is a social state, and we must do everything to ensure that the size of pensions and social protection of citizens improve.
But steps in this direction should be thoughtful, responsible, taking into account domestic realities," Matvienko told RIA Novosti.
The head of the Federation Council stressed that if this initiative (the draft law on the guaranteed pension product) develops, then several basic principles should be provided, including voluntariness, tax preferences for citizens and employers and strict guarantees and responsibility of the state for ensuring the safety of pension savings.
On September 6, the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation announced the sending for approval of the draft law on the guaranteed pension product (GPP).
Among its main elements are an exclusively voluntary procedure for citizens to join the savings system, guaranteeing the safety of long-term pension savings of citizens by the state, registration of citizens' savings accounts by the central administrator, tax benefits for business and tax deductions for citizens.
Spider-Man remains in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
Sony and Disney agreed
Getty Images Image caption The news of the departure of his beloved superhero from the Marvel Cinematic Universe caused the wrath of many loyal fans
One of the most famous comic book heroes - Spider-Man - will remain in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
Disney and Sony Pictures managed to agree on the rights to use it in the films of the franchise.
This became known from a press release from Sony, which states that the third part of "Spider-Man" with Tom Holland will be released on July 16, 2021.
Earlier it was reported that Disney and Sony Pictures could not come to a consensus on revenue sharing, because of which "Spider-Man" will leave the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
The rights to the film hero are owned by Sony.
She rented them out for Marvel movies, which is owned by Disney.
As a result, Sony received revenues from revenues in movie cash registers, and Disney - from souvenirs and toys.
As reported, at some point this situation ceased to suit Disney, and the company wanted to revise the agreement.
Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige said he was thrilled.
It's amazing that Spidey [Spider-Man's] journey to the Marvel Cinematic Universe will continue.
"All of us at Marvel Studios are thrilled to be able to continue working on it.
Spider-Man is an iconic figure.
This is a hero whose story touches all generations and audiences around the world," he said in a press release.
At the same time, Feige recalled that Sony is creating its own cinematic universe, built just around Spider-Man.
"It so happened that he is the only hero endowed with superpower, who found himself in different cinematic universes.
So, while Sony continues to develop its own Spidey universe, the future may present unexpected surprises," he said.
Tom Holland, who played Spider-Man in five films, apparently commenting on the news, posted on his Instagram account an excerpt from the movie "The Wolf of Wall Street", in which Leonardo DiCaprio's character shouts "I'm not leaving!"
Information about the contradictions between the companies appeared in August.
As reported by the media, Disney wanted to receive half of the box office revenue from the Spider-Man films, provided that both companies would pay half of the cost of producing the pictures.
But that didn't sit well with Sony.
The news of the possible departure of the beloved superhero from the Marvel Cinematic Universe caused the wrath of many loyal fans.
Details of the new conditions have not yet been disclosed.
According to CNBC, Sony declined to comment on the agreement, but said: "We have worked well together for the past four years, and our joint desire to continue working together has been commensurate with the wishes of many [Spider-Man] fans.
We're excited to be able to move forward together."
The film "Avengers: Endgame", which united Spider-Man, Thor, the Hulk and other Marvel superheroes, became the highest-grossing in the history of world cinema, displacing "Avatar" from the first place.

In Congress, in the conversation between Trump and Zelensky, they saw a "Russian trace"
In the lower house of the US Congress, the Russian Federation was accused of involvement in the scandal caused by a telephone conversation between the head of the White House Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky.
The assumption that the "Russians" may somehow stand behind this story was expressed by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, reports MSNBC News.
"I believe Russia had a hand in this," the Democrat said, but did not comment further.

The White House had to provide congressmen and the public with a transcript of the scandalous conversation.

The expert told why you should give up tea bags
A group of scientists from Canada, representing McGill University, found that when brewing a tea bag, more than ten billion particles of microplastics enter a cup in five minutes.
Sawdust particles can also be added to a packaged beverage, Food Safety Expert Elizaveta Tikhonova told Nation News.
According to the agronomist, the consumer cannot get reliable information about the composition of packaged tea - the manufacturer can add ingredients that will not be indicated on the package.
Sawdust is not thrown away at the end of the season, so it can end up in tea.
"Moreover, tea plants are not always included in the bags," Tikhonova said.
According to her, it is better to abandon the use of such a drink in favor of tea by weight, which is sold in specialized stores.
In addition, she stressed that the danger of packaged tea lies not only in the composition, but also in the method of its production - microparticles are heated to high temperatures, because of which they can begin to emit harmful substances.
"It is best to purchase pure green or black tea - in such a drink there will be the least additives," the expert said.

Regions were invited to share the secrets of business support
As it became known to the "Parliamentary Gazette", on September 27, the Chairman of the Federation Council Committee on Economic Policy Andrei Kutepov sent a letter to the Minister of Economic Development Maxim Oreshkin and the Minister of Finance Anton Siluanov with a proposal to express a position on the initiatives of the subjects of the Federation to improve legislation in the field of supporting small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs).
It's time to establish interregional ties
The Federation Council Committee on Economic Policy summarized the information received from the regions about the current programs for business development and legalization of the self-employed, as well as about the results of such programs.
In their letters, the regions told the senators about the problems of SME development and sent proposals for improving the current legislation.
"To date, communication between the regions is not sufficiently established, as a result of which the business community in all regions of the visit of senators identified the issue of the lack of information on regional programs for the development of entrepreneurship in the whole country," Andrei Kutepov stated.
In the annex to the letter sent to the Government, he presented a set of positive developments of the regions on the legalization of self-employment and summary data from the regions with proposals and problems (available to the editorial board).
In addition to the relevant ministries, summary data from the regions were also sent to the heads of regional executive bodies.
The exchange of information on positively implemented developments in the regions could give impetus to the development of entrepreneurship as a whole.
The first step towards such an exchange will be to send the information available to the Committee on Economic Policy," the senator told the Parliamentary Gazette.
Useful experience
Today, in many regions of the country, programs to support small and medium-sized businesses have been adopted and are successfully operating.
For example, in the Vologda region there is a Center for Entrepreneurship Support, which, in addition to financial support measures, assists businessmen in certifying finished products.
In the Ivanovo region, a business support system has been developed, providing for the implementation of the principle of one window through multifunctional centers.
In the Krasnodar Territory, start-up agricultural consumer cooperatives are provided with grants from the regional budget.
In the Oryol region, there is a center for cluster development.
The Amur Region within the framework of the federal project "Acceleration of Small and Medium-Sized Businesses" provides for the possibility of subsidizing business incubators created on the basis of existing non-state coworking centers at the expense of the federal budget.
And in a number of other regions, special support measures are being taken for youth entrepreneurship.
The self-employed continue to be brought out of the shadows
According to the regional authorities, in order to more effectively support small and medium-sized businesses, a number of changes should be made to the current legislation.
For example, the Arkhangelsk region proposed to replace the term "self-employment" with "entrepreneurial activity", since this "most corresponds to the content of the state service to promote self-employment of unemployed citizens."
In the Ivanovo region, it is considered necessary to make amendments providing for the expansion of the list of activities provided by self-employed citizens, including the types of activities for the decoration and repair of residential premises, dacha buildings, and physical training classes.
The Bryansk region considers it important to strengthen control over unscrupulous dairy producers with the help of the Mercury veterinary system.
And in the Kostroma and Magadan regions, they advocate for fixing the concept of "social entrepreneurship" in the regulatory and legal field and the directions of support for social entrepreneurship.
All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of state programs to support small and medium-sized businesses, and the most important ones will be developed in the form of specific bills.
"All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of state programs to support small and medium-sized businesses, and the most important ones will be developed in the form of specific bills," Andrei Kutepov assured.
The airline helped passengers avoid the neighborhood with crying children

Now, if you want, the neighborhood with them can be avoided.
Passengers of the Japanese airline Japan Airlines (JAL) got the opportunity to take advantage of the new option and avoid unwanted neighborhood with young children.

When selecting seats in the cabin during the booking of tickets, passengers will be able to see an image of the child's head in seats that are occupied by children aged eight days to two years.
Thus, those who do not want to fly next to babies because of the possible inconvenience associated with their crying can stay as far away from them as possible.
Internet users who use the services of the airline were delighted with the innovation.
Some of them thanked the carrier, noting that other airlines should do the same.
One of the users complained that a few weeks ago he was flying from New York to Doha, and three crying children were sitting next to him at once.
Another commentator suggested introducing "flights only for adults", expressing readiness to pay extra for such a flight.
Many tourists noted that now they will always try to choose Japan Airlines for their movements, because they do not see anything pleasant in flying next to a crying child in a closed space.
Earlier, a woman traveling with an infant tried to appease fellow travelers during the seoul-San Francisco flight.
She prepared a bag of sweets for each of the 200 passengers, each of which contained a note with an apology.

Deliveries of "sanctions" to Russia fell 100 times
The Russian government estimated that the supply of agricultural products and food to Russia from countries subject to the Russian food embargo has decreased by more than 100 times since 2013.
According to a report sent to Russian President Vladimir Putin, in the first half of 2019, 31 thousand tons of products were imported from sanctioned countries against 3 million 442.2 thousand tons for the same period in 2013, Interfax reports.
At the same time, the cost of imported products decreased to $ 226.5 million from $ 4 billion 975.5 million, respectively.
We are talking about the supply of goods that are not subject to the embargo.
As indicated in the report, the dropped volumes of prohibited products were compensated by an increase in imports from the CIS countries, Africa, Southeast Asia, and Serbia.
Recall that at the end of August, the government extended until December 31, 2020, the validity of the rules for the destruction of agricultural products, raw materials and food, which are prohibited for import into Russia as part of counter-sanctions.
In a document posted on the official portal of legal information, it was noted that the validity of the rules was extended for another year - from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020.
Initially, the decree on the destruction of sanctions applied to products from the USA, THE EU, Australia, Norway and Canada.
Later, from August 13, 2015, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland, Liechtenstein "joined" this list, from January 1, 2016 - Ukraine.
A decree signed by Putin on the destruction of illegally imported into the country "sanctions" (products that fell under the food embargo, which Moscow imposed in response to anti-Russian sanctions of the West) came into force in 2015.
In turn, the government allowed the destruction of "sanctioned" food by any legal means.
As Western sanctions persisted, Russia also extended its retaliatory measures.
At the same time, this measure does not apply to products that citizens import for personal use.
The ban does not apply to the import of goods for personal consumption weighing up to 5 kilograms.
However, the head of the Presidential Council for the Development of Civil Society and Human Rights, Mikhail Fedotov, previously called the destruction of food products "simply immoral", and this, according to him, negatively affects the education of people.
Moreover, the initiative to prohibit the destruction of food products suitable for consumption was made by Rospotrebnadzor in early June.
After that, a similar recommendation to the government was given by the Human Rights Council under the President of the Russian Federation.
And Deputy Prime Minister Alexei Gordeev said that it is wrong to destroy food, and we need to think about how they can be used for their intended purpose, assessing the quality.

In Chile, began to build a telescope worth 1 billion euros
It is reported by TASS with reference to the press service of the European Southern Observatory (ESO).
According to ESO, this week the construction of the dome of the building where the E-ELT (European Extremely Large Telescope) telescope will be located, so far the most expensive and ambitious ground-based astronomical project, has officially begun.
Its total value, according to ESO estimates, will exceed one billion euros.
Most of this money will be spent on the manufacture of equipment and the construction of the observatory building.
The most expensive and complex component of the telescope is its record-breaking large mirror, whose diameter will be about 39 meters.
It will be assembled from 798 hexagonal segments measuring 1.4 meters.
This huge mirror, as well as two auxiliary reflective surfaces with a diameter of 4.2 and 3.75 meters, will help E-ELT to obtain the first detailed photographs of planets outside the solar system, stars in other galaxies, as well as to search for Earth's twins.
In addition, scientists will try to use this observatory to observe the vicinity of Sgr A *, a supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way.
Despite the fact that the construction of the dome has just begun, scientists, engineers and other specialists have been developing mirrors, scientific instruments and other components of the observatory for three years - since the announcement of the first plans for the construction of the E-ELT.
The contract for the production of the main mirror, whose total cost was about 400 million euros, was received by the German company SCHOTT and the French company Safran Reosc.
