According to him, in this way, Kiev plans "albehind to somehow staff the units."
"The unwillingness of citizens of Ukraine to serve in the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, mass dismissals led to low staffing units," - said Marochko, quoted by RIA Novosti.
He also did not rule out that the real figures of Ukrainians drafted into the army can be increased if necessary.
In 2014-2017, Kiev launched the so-called anti-terrorist operation (ATO), which was later replaced by a joint force (JFO).
It was assumed that this measure will strengthen the role of the Ukrainian security forces in the settlement of the situation.

The DPR authorities qualified the incident as a terrorist attack.
During the investigation of the criminal case, several people involved in the explosion were detained.

The British Foreign Minister compared the EU with the Soviet Union and the prison
British Foreign Minister Jeremy Hunt compared the European Union to the Soviet Union and accused Brussels of capturing the member countries of the community.
Such a statement was made by the diplomat at the congress of the ruling Conservative Party in Birmingham, which opened on Sunday, September 30.
As noted by the Daily Mail, Hunt commented on the difficulties in the negotiation process on Brexit.
What happened to the belief in the European dream and its ideals?
The EU was created to protect freedom, and the Soviet Union did not allow anyone to leave.
The lesson of history is obvious: if you turn the EU from a community to a prison, the desire to leave it will not decrease, but only grow, and we will not be the only prisoner who will want to escape from captivity," he said.
He also added that attempts to punish Britain for the decision to leave the European Union will only exacerbate the crisis, notes "Gazeta.ru."
In mid-September, British Prime Minister Theresa May said Brexit talks had stalled.

The United Kingdom is expected to be released by April 2019, but negotiations with Brussels on this issue are complicated by many factors.
In particular, there is still no clear agreement on how the parties will interact after London leaves the community.
The question of the Irish border remains open.

Elon Musk forced to leave the post of head of the board of directors of Tesla
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Tesla founder Elon Musk have settled their dispute over the fraud.
This is reported by CNBC News.
According to the channel, within the framework of the agreements reached, Musk will have to leave the post of head of the board of directors of Tesla.

"Holiness is the most important value of my life, and the facts will prove that I have not in any way violated it," the businessman said in an interview with CNBC.
At the same time, in August, a group of Tesla shareholders filed a collective lawsuit against Musk, complaining of financial losses.
The plaintiffs claimed that the businessman's posts had brought them losses.

Other plaintiffs also noted that the careless statements of Elon Musk led to sharp fluctuations in the course.
In September, Elon Musk was accused of exchange machinations by the head of the research company Citron Research.
Meanwhile, if Musk had not been able to settle his dispute with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, he would be threatened with suspension from the company's management and even a prison.
This, in particular, was stated to the CNBC TV channel by the former chairman of the commission Harvey Pitt.

On September 30, 1928, exactly 90 years ago, the British bacteriologist Alexander Fleming announced an unprecedented discovery.
The discovery of penicillin marked the beginning of the era of modern antibiotics, brought Fleming world fame and made him a Nobel laureate.
By the way, the release of penicillin from mold mushrooms was not the first discovery of Fleming.

Almost as accidentally, penicillin was also found.
Fleming's name was included in the list of the 100 most prominent personalities in the history of mankind.

When, shortly after receiving the Nobel Prize, Fleming arrived in the French capital in 1945, the Parisian newspapers wrote: "To defeat fascism and the liberation of France, he did more than dozens of divisions."
According to experts, Fleming's discovery of the world's first antibiotic saved the lives of more than 200 million inhabitants of the Earth.
Alexander Fleming died at his home in London in 1955 from a heart attack.
He was cremated, and a week later his ashes were buried in the famous London Cathedral of St. Paul.
Where, by the way, our wife's attention to this was paid by a lustful Russian-speaking guide.

There, next to the main arena for the bullfighting of the Plaza de Toros de Las Ventas, the most famous Spanish mataders erected a monument to a man whose efforts were, in their opinion, the lives of hundreds of outstanding cordread masters.
By the way, this, in my opinion, very interesting porcelain work was found there, in Madrid, but at other times and not at all.

For example, in neighboring Poland, according to her, earlier Russian speech was widely used on television and radio, but in the public space it is practically not left.

"Such a difficult game turned out, in the break they had a serious men's conversation, and this brought its fruits: they scored two goals and did not miss.
"You missed a few matches due to the damage he got at the beginning of the month.
How did you feel today?"
"If you've had 90 minutes, it's okay.
Actually, I felt good.
Maybe at the end a little shore of the force, so that nothing happens.
And so, doctors and physiotherapist Vladimir Anatolyevich Gashnev led me to this game, for which they are grateful!
"What about the atmosphere on the team?"
"It's no secret that after the victories and recovering is easier, and the mood in the team is good.
Now we have a white stripe, although at first it was black.
We need to continue in the same spirit and please the fans."
"Is you missed the game in the time that you didn't come out on the field?"
"There is such a thing, I missed a little, because the really, unpleasant situation came out.
But I repeat, thank you to the physiotherapist and doctors for putting on my feet.
The most important thing is that we won and pleased the fans.
The rest is secondary."

Kosachev: At the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly, the topic of Russia in a negative way was practically absent
The head of the Federation Council Committee on International Affairs Konstantin Kosachev considers the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly successful for Russia and does not exclude that it will be able to become a turning point in the perception of the Russian Federation as an integral participant in the solution of global problems.
"The peculiarity of the current 73rd session, in my opinion, is that the rhetoric to which we have almost become accustomed to in recent years in relation to Russia has now been more muted," the senator said in an interview published Sunday by the Russian Newspaper.
He explained that in previous years, the Russian Federation was sometimes "designated as one of the three main threats to humanity, along with Ebola, then along with climate change or terrorism, Russia was in this row, in any case, in the presentation of a group of Western countries, which expressed quite unanimously in this regard."
At the 73rd session, Kosachev stressed, "Russia's topic in a negative way was practically absent."
"If you carefully analyze the speech of the President of the United States, the President of France, the speech of the Minister of foreign Affairs of Germany, I do not take Ukraine, Georgia, or the British, in any case, the choir was not exactly," - said the politician, noting that Russia "no longer a wall, which is being trained by a tennis ball."
The head of the relevant committee of the Federation Council does not rule out that this indicates a certain trend, which, in his opinion, "will allocate the current session [the UN General Assembly], although this trend may manifest in a year, in two, three."
"I do not rule out that the current session in a sense can be pivotal," - admitted Kosachev, explaining that "too many examples of how Russia manages to move forward in international affairs."
As an example, he cited the situation in Syria, around Iran and North Korea.
"Unfortunately, this is not Ukraine, but I have no doubt that the Russian vision of the Ukrainian crisis will also be in demand over time," the parliamentarian added.
This is due to the fact that "adequate, sound perception of Russia as not just possible - an integral participant in solving the global problems of modernity" appears.
"I don't want to be wrong, but I have a feeling that we're somewhere passing a point beyond which the movement will no longer be a backbone movement, it will be moving forward," he added.
In this context, Kosachev called "a request for a Russian vision of how the modern world should develop another "interesting and important feeling."
"I attended a very many meetings of the head of the Russian delegation [at the session of the General Assembly] of Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, I held my own meetings, and I was very pleased to see that if the Russian opinion, the Russian view, by the Russian vision of what is happening in the world, by and large, no one was interested, now the situation is different," - said the Chairman of the Committee of the Federation.
"The so-called new liberal order, which is personified with the West, has no answers to the questions of how to solve world problems due to the obvious shortage of ideas in the global space, a shortage of ideas on how to solve the problems of the Middle East, the problems of terrorism, the problems of nuclear weapons, the problems of nuclear weapons, migration problems."
"And here the request for the Russian vision is becoming more and more obvious," Kosachev expressed confidence, stressing that he considers in this sense "the current session successful for the work of the Russian delegation, successful for Russia."

She also expressed confidence that the tests will temper every Ukrainian, doing us "a lot more difficult to protect the national interests of Ukraine, in the defense of every Ukrainian, in understanding what is good and what evil is."

AfD became the second most popular in Germany
The anti-immigrant "Alternative for Germany" beats another record of popularity, and Angela Merkel's ratings are falling.
Apparently, the Germans began to seriously get tired of the immigration policy of Angela Merkel, thanks to which the country became a desirable target for millions of refugees from the Middle East.
Most clearly, this is evidenced by the latest polls, according to which the anti-immigrant party "Alternative for Germany" is becoming more popular, and the positions of the ruling block of Merkel and Seehofer are weakening.
This week, the AfD broke another record, rising to the second line in the ranking of popular sympathies.
The right-wing conservatives, with 17 percent of their popularity, managed to bypass the Social Democrats, who had about 16 percent.
The gap of one percentage point can be attributed to statistical error, but it is impossible to note the fact that the AfD from a small group of economists-Evskeptics managed to turn into a serious political force.
Leadership in the overall standings continues to be held by the ruling CSU/CDU bloc, which has about 30 percent.
However, there is a tendency to lose points - in April, the support of the Angela Merkel bloc was four percentage points higher.
The personal rating of the German Chancellor, who heads the German government for the fourth consecutive term, is also decreasing.
Today, 48 percent of Germans are in support of Angela Merkel, which is 7 percent lower than last year.
Next to the Social Democrats are green (15%), left (11%) and liberals (10%).
Evolution of "Alternatives"
The "Alternative for Germany" party was established in September 2012 on the basis of the group "Alternative Choice 2013," which included immigrants from the Christian Democratic Union.
The group initially stood in opposition to the government course, but at first it dealt only with economic issues, including the problems of the euro and cooperation within the EU.
At the same time, the group opposed the "sponsoring" Germany of the weak economies of the EU, did not rule out the possibility of returning to the German mark and the complete withdrawal of the country from the European Union.
Against the backdrop of the deepening immigration crisis, the AfD's political platform has expanded.
In 2013, the group formed a full-fledged party that occupied a niche of Euroskeptics and began to harshly criticize the government for the failure of immigration policy.
In the last parliamentary elections in 2017, the AfD managed to make its way to the Bundestag for the first time, receiving 94 seats (out of 709).
Two representatives of the "Alternatives for Germany" will get seats in the European Parliament.

The Roshel Senator APC is designed for 12 passengers, which are not comfortable, but are safely accommodated in all-barrel armored capsule.
This bunker, otherwise the design will not be called, since the level of its reservation meets the standard B7, is installed on the chassis of the powerful Ford Super Duty pickup truck.

Named the death of the universe
The universe will last about 140 billion years, ten times the age of the world, equal to about 13.8 billion years.
The study of the international team of scientists is published in the library of electronic preprints arXiv.org and is aimed at the publication in the journal Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan, according to the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun.
To such conclusions, experts came, observing with the help of the camera HSC (Hyper Suprime-Cam) telescope Subaru for about ten million galaxies.
Having tracked the distribution of dark matter and dark energy, which accounts for more than 95 percent of the energy-mass of the observed world, scientists working as part of the standard cosmological model CDM (Cold Dark Matter), evaluated the rate of expansion of the Universe, which was a little slower than previously thought.
In a press release, the Subaru Observatory notes that the observations allowed to obtain a detailed three-dimensional map of the distribution of matter in the Universe, and the records of the data of the European Space Telescope Planck clarified the restrictions imposed on the parameters of the CDM.
In July, scientists simulated the possible death of the universe.
Three years earlier, their colleagues presented new arguments that the world will cease to exist in 22 billion years as a result of the Great Gap.
Another attempt to unite the initiators of the pension referendum failed
The opportunity to get the opinion of the people on pension reform is postponed indefinitely
A meeting of the federal referendum initiative group against raising the retirement age was held in Moscow on Saturday.
It was attended by representatives of 13 subgroups that registered different wording of the issues (in total, the Central Election Commission registered five formulations).
They decided to apply to the CEC with a request to register a single initiative group and ask the Russians a question: "You are for the fact that the pension legislation established on July 1, 2018. The age when Russia's citizens receive the right to assign an old-age pension has not been raised?"
This formulation was registered by the Vologda subgroup, whose representatives did not participate in the meeting, but it was the simplest and legally confinement.
Most of the participants of the meeting were supporters of the member of "Fair Russia" Ilya Sviridov (six subgroups) and the Communist Party (four subgroups).
They were joined by three independent subgroups - from Nizhny Novgorod, Voronezh and Orenburg.
Earlier, Sviridov told Vedomosti that the invitations were sent to all the initiators, and representatives of about 40 subgroups expressed their consent to come.
But, for example, Marina Semenova, who heads the Vologda subgroup (its formulation was supported by another 15 subgroups), told Vedomosti that she did not receive invitations and did not plan to come: "We did not understand who is a friend and who is the enemy."

In the match "Loko" - "Akhmat" the mistakes of Turbine fell, as from the horn of abundance
Former judge of the all-Union category Vladimir Levitin commented on the work of the referee Evgeny Turbina in the match of the 9th round of the Russian championship "Lokomotiv" - "Akhmat" and dismantled the controversial episodes of the game.
- How do you assess the judging of Evgeny Turbin in the match "Lokomotiv" - "Akhmat"?
- I believe that this arbiter has confirmed its unsuitability for the refereeing of the matches of the Russian Premier League.
I am surprised that the pressures in the meeting of the fifth round of "Spartak" - "Dynamo," neither Turbin, nor the leaders of the DSI did not make serious conclusions about his low qualification.
The result did not slow down to the ninth round: errors in his actions, private skips of rough techniques fell like an horn of abundance.
For example, in the 50th minute of the railwayman Eder is flooded with the help of hands in his penalty area defender "Akhmat" Rodolfo.
From the gate is eight meters, but Turbin does not put a penalty.
- How do you assess the episode with the participation of Idov, who was in the 82nd minute, when it seemed that the ball hit him in the hand?
- I believe that there was a deliberate game by the hand of the defender in his penalty area.
The turbine was near the moment, sees this episode well and his first assistant on the right.
This moment should have been seen by the reserve judge Sergey Karasev.
However, all three slept, and the penalty was not assigned.
Therefore, the score in the match is distorted, and sports justice was trampled.
This was the case when the refereeing by concepts supplanted and buried the sports spirit of the game.
- In the 52nd minute, Turbin did not dare to remove the defender of the guests Oleg Ivanov, who violated the rules in the fight against Krykhovyak, and when the judge showed him a yellow card, demonstratively applauded him.
What do you think of this episode?
Should I have shown the second handcuffer?
- At this point, Turbin and the first yellow card did not show quite on the case.
The second one would be illogical.
- Oleg Ivanov said after the match about the double standards of refereeing that some teams are put penalties for such violations as in the episode with Idova, and some are not.
What do you think of the footballer's words?
Depends on what we understand by double standards.
It was a penalty.
They didn't give it.
So, the arbiter does not give the second penalty in the opposite gate.
This is the principle that is used.
And the second point of double standards that the judge is watching, who is playing.
Here he played on Saturday, Lokomotiv and Akhmat have serious claims to Turbin's work, because the team was infringed.
Matt Damon played accused of rape Judge Kavanaugh at the start of SNL
American actor Matt Damon played the candidate for the US Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, who is accused of rape.
Damon appeared in the first release of the new Saturday Night Live season on NBC.
During a small sketch, the actor played Kavanaugh at a hearing in the Senate on charges of rape.
The U.S. Supreme Court candidate has previously drawn attention to his emotionality and detail of his stories during a conversation with Senator Amy Klobuchar.
So, Kavanano repeatedly confessed his love for beer, but said that he never got drunk to the point of oblivion.
In addition, in an attempt to justify himself on charges of rape, Kavanano stated that he was a virgin in those years.
These moments also beat Damon.
I was just doing that I drank a lot and didn't think about sex at all.
I was the proudest, drunkt virgin anyone ever seen.
Everyone knows that," said the judge, performed by Matt Damon.

American singer Barbra Streisand said that the clones of her dead dog behave differently than the original pet.
"They are not like that.
In fact, [clones] look like her, but it is impossible to clone the soul," - said the 76-year-old singer.
At the end of 2017, Streisand ordered two clones of his 14-year-old coton de-tulear dog named Samantha, who had to be put to sleep due to health problems.
In July 2018, it was reported that the dog of the Chihuahua breed named Miracle Milly (Miracle Milly), who was called the smallest dog in the world, was cloned for the 49th time.
Specialists are engaged in the cloning of a six-year-old animal in an attempt to understand why it is so miniature.
The United States is thinking about the naval blockade of Russia because of the supply of oil and gas
In the United States, a naval blockade of Russia can begin to gain an advantage in the global energy market.
The US authorities have so zealously taken up the fight for success in the global hydrocarbon market that they are ready to resort to a naval blockade of Russia, which remains one of the world's main suppliers of energy.
About the possibility of a naval blockade the day before was told by the head of the US Interior Ministry Ryan Zinke.
Contrary to world practice, the U.S. Department of the Interior performs civil functions, including natural resource policies.
Therefore, Zinke's statement was quite within the competence of the department headed by him, although it was not deprived of political color.
Speaking at an industrial event in Pittsburgh, Zinck said that thanks to the US Navy, the US Navy controls the sea routes in the Middle East and could block them if necessary.
From the words of Zinke it follows that the need may be associated with Washington's desire to interfere with Russian supplies to the global energy market.
Zinke reminded that Russia still receives the lion's share of its revenues from supplies to the world oil and gas market.
The desire to distribute energy supplies in the Middle East as well as in Eastern Europe was the main motive for Moscow's revitalization in the region, Zinke said.
The minister made it clear that the United States continues to hope to ensure leadership in the global energy market, becoming the largest supplier of oil and gas.
To do this, Washington will have to oust Russia both Iran and the naval blockade of trade routes - an acceptable measure on this path, Zinke believes.

The translator compared the mentality of the Russians and Germans
The mentality of the Russian and German peoples is different, but few differences between them do not play a big role for mutual understanding.
On the International Translator's Day, September 30, said a professional synchronist Lover Sable Sax.
She has been engaged in translations from Russian and English for over 30 years.
"The Germans like to calmly plan events, and the Russians, as the proverb say, "weak for a long time, but quickly go."
But it seems to me that for mutual understanding between the peoples and for the work of the translator, this does not play a significant role," the expert said in a commentary to RIA Novosti.
According to the translator, to understand that the two countries can not do without each other, "it is enough to know history."
And in the future, said Saxe, it makes no sense for Germany to ignore Russia.
Russia is a natural part of Europe, it makes no sense to try to ignore it.
We need Russian gas, oil, there are many things that determine our common destiny," she said.
A day earlier, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that the country is trying to "tie relations" with Russia and maintain them.
According to her, for Berlin mania, the project of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which is being built from the Russian coast to Germany along the bottom of the Baltic Sea, is especially important.

The head coach of "Vityaz" Valery Belov - about the defeat from "Siberia" (3:4) in the match of the regular championship of the KHL.
"The colleague talked about the fans of "Siberia," and I want to mark our fans," - quotes the words of Belov, the official website of "Vityaz."
"I hope they will also support, because now almost every game is a full stadium, a great atmosphere.
In the game, probably, the Lord today helped "Siberia," because they were very rudely mistaken, especially our leaders.
In general, we lost the micro - the match is 0: 3 our leading leaders, so it was difficult for us to pull out this match, although there were moments.
But I'll still take the blame.
Because, apparently, they missed something in the preparation.
It was a different team compared to last match."
"It's an ugly neat."
Spectators are outraged by the choice of Agutin on the show "Voice"
Viewers of the show "Voice 60+" accuse the mentor Leonid Agutin of "imagined neatism and brazen rigging."
When in blind auditions he learned from the first notes the voice of his father Nikolai Agutin many hoped that he would remain neutral and will not turn to the performer.
But the sons' senses prevailed, and he chose a relative in his team.
Then many considered it a joke, but forgave the mentor bias at the first stage.
But the "joke" was delayed, and the father of the star absolutely unjustified took the place of more worthy performers.
And now the audience is not ready to forgive Agutin such injustice.
Yesterday, we, the audience of the show, resented the nepotism of the ugly and frank dragging of their close relatives to the final staircase.
I even doubted that Agutin would have enough strength and conscience not to drag my father to the end to the first place," - said Irina Petrovskaya and Ksenia Larina in the program "Man from the TV."
Meanwhile, for the sake of his father, Leonid Agutin "left" the excellent performers who really sang, while Nikolai Petrovich whispered a touching song about his mother, explaining it by the fact that the audiences continue to see his father in the show.
But, as it turned out, this is not at all, the audience wants an objective assessment and see in the finals really talented performers, and now Agutin has discredited the show.
"I sympathize with the participants of the "Voice" from the team of Agutin - they were doomed."
"Last time, Agutin showed how he loves his dad, and today he had to show himself as a professional."
"The contest has lost its meaning."
"To remove two talented people from the project and leave in the project his father who does not sing and whispers, how can you call the mentor after that?"
"Like like Daddy sings, organize a concert in the Kremlin for your money and see how many people come to this concert."
This is the show "Voice," not the show "Cool relatives."
"On the side of Agutin it was unprofessional."
"Then you have to offer to the dad on your own show, not the show that is done for the money of the 1st Channel."
"It was a real chance for someone, and he took someone's place.
And I don't understand why a voiceless dad should make me more aware than any other participant with real vocal data.
Why was the worker from Surgut with a great voice and chimble merged, and Agutin's dad was brought to the final?
And then we all complain that on stage and from the screens the same faces for decades!
"Because you don't break through nepotism!"

Russian pilot of "Williams" Sergey Sirotkin commented on the result of the race of the Russian Grand Prix.
"Honestly, I don't really want to say that I'm in my head.
I had a good start, and in the second turn I was between two cars, which immediately clamped me.
I lost all the positions I played at the start, the moment, right away.
He was in a very bad position.
Stuck in traffic.
We hoped that after the others came to the pit stop, we would get into the "clean air," and the pace will return, but the tires were no longer there.
Plus, he fought with his partner, he was also in contact.
I think he was a little mistaken.
We were in such a situation on the most unrivaled track of the season, I could not do anything, and it was very painful, to be honest.
I don't want to talk about it anymore," Sirotkin said.

Carrera's actions were absolutely absurd.
To pay attention to such things is unsubmissive stupidity.
I totally disagree with what Carrera is doing.
It only deepens the breakdown in the team.
First of all, it's poetry, you can read and perceive them as you like.
I wouldn't have reacted to Carrera's seat on this.
Everyone has their own opinion.
Secondly, everyone wants to choke.
If Glushakov and Athenko put likes, it does not mean that they have something against the coach.
I think the Italian lacks the flexibility to perceive the situation.
And it does not serve the normal climate in the team.
Today, Spartak does not have a game, so this situation did not need to be inflated at all.
Maybe you should have laughed at it together.
"Spartak" a lot is not in order in different lines, there is an infinity after the introduction of young people.
The relationship within the team does not seem to add optimism before this match," Tarpishchev said.
The game of the two teams will take place on September 30 and will begin at 7 p.m. Moscow time.
Previously, John Terry, who refused to Spartacus, headed the youth team of Chelsea.
The pupils of "Sirius" discussed with scientists natural-like technologies
Students of the Sirius Educational Center in Sochi, participants of the School of Agrobiology and Plant Genetics, attended a lecture by scientists of the national research center "Kurchatov Institute."
The speech of the researchers took place within the framework of the program of the Global International Forum of Convergent and Nature-like Technologies, organized in Sochi on behalf of Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to the website of the educational center on September 29.
The lecture was opened by the documentary "Kurchatov Codes," during which the president of the Kurchatov Institute, corresponding member of the RAS Mikhail Kovalchuk spoke about global challenges as the driving force for the development of civilization.
The lecture of the scientist was published on the website of "Sirius."
Schoolchildren have learned that modern technology needs a huge amount of energy.
Alternative energy is not yet able to develop such volumes.
To solve this problem, according to the organizers of the forum, will help natural-like technologies, which young scientists are working on today.
In addition, Kovalchuk raised the topic of responsibility for the development of natural-like technologies, and also spoke about the risks that inevitably arise when creating such technologies.
"The arrival of such technologies is a unique thing, it is a huge good thing.
This is the explosive growth of medical technology, it is an improvement in the quality of life and infrastructure.
But there is a second side.
The development of natural-like technologies is actually a technological reproduction of wildlife systems.
There is a flip side - purposeful interference in human life.
There are always risks.
There was a car - people began to die under the wheels.
Cars are still used.
The dual nature of technology at once.
I am creating a new medical technology, and at the same time I can create weapons of mass destruction," - quotes the scientist REN TV.
After watching the film and discussing modern scientific breakthroughs, the students were able to ask questions to the participants of the meeting.
Speakers were the candidate of physical and mathematical sciences, the head of the Kurchatov complex NBICS-NTBS-pre-prejucabial technologies of the NC "Kurchatov Institute" Yulia Dyakova and the head of the Kurchatov complex of NBICS-technologies Vyacheslav Demin.
The educational center "Sirius" in Sochi was created by the educational fund "Talent and Success" on the basis of the Olympic infrastructure at the initiative of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The purpose of the educational center is to identify, develop and continue professional support for gifted children.
Earlier in September, it was reported that the winners of the all-Russian online Olympics on information security "Cybervoz" will be sent to study at Sirius.

Macedonia: referendum not held due to low turnout
The referendum was intended to approve the agreement of the authorities in Athens and Skopje on the renaming of the Balkan country as "North Macedonia."

But, as the EFE news agency reports, only 34% of the turnout on the Sunday plebiscite "did not reach" the constitutional threshold of 50%.
However, since the referendum was only consultative, it is possible that the authorities in Skopje will decide not to refuse renaming.
Speaking shortly after the closure of the polling stations, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, a supporter of the change of the name of the republic, said that if there are more "yes" among the votes submitted, then Macedonia will change its name, despite the unfinished quorum.

Kemerov residents angered a herd of sheep in the cemetery
On September 30, a message appeared on the well-known Kemerovo page on the social network from an eyewitness that horned animals were walking freely on one of the local cemeteries.
The animals walked a considerable herd between the fences and plucked the grass.
Commentators expressed different opinions: one of the locals noted that in the presence of small cattle there is no harm in the presence of small cattle, and their appetite can even help in clearing the territory of weeds and thickets of grass, but some of the inhabitants of the city's behavior did not have to like:
"These are graves, not pastures.
There's nothing for the rams to do there.
Of course, you can't say that they blaspheme, but it's none of a business." (the style is preserved) - said in her message an indignant Kemerovchanka.
One way or another, one of the eyewitnesses noted that the problem in the form of animals in the middle of the cemetery is already known, and soon the necessary measures will be taken.
Pressure and dot - how right?
Words do not exist to press.
That's right, to do it.
The word "pressure" in the meaning "pull, influence, influence" exists only phonetically, because we hear the sound [and] instead of [o] in the word "suck."
We use this word, believing that it comes from the word "pressure."
But the "pressure" and "suck" are etymologically not only not close, but even in some sense opposite.
Make sure of it yourself.
To dowise (church-book, outdated) means "pretty, full, enough to be sufficient for someone or anything, to satisfy."
To be satisfied, pleasure is related words.
Previously, he still had the meaning "not to depend on anything, to have a self-sufficient meaning" - to "suck yourself."
Old Slavonic "dovintti" is related to the words "to veil" and "will."
To pressure, to suppress are completely different.
These words have truly frightening "relatives": daos - "wolf" (pressing sheep), deyja - "dirreate" and dvaid - "to oppress."
A similar phonetic appearance of the words "pressure" and "sucked," as well as the imminent obsolescence of the latter, forced them to enter into contamination.
So we have this very "d[a]wage," which is also used in the letter through "a," which, in a way, is wrong and impossible in terms of the processes of the emergence and development of these words.
So, right, to do it.
But this word is outdated, in its correct meaning no longer used.
If you want to note that any circumstances/people have a negative impact on you from above, use the word "curve."
You can also use the "pressure" design, but remember that it is the office.

Metropolitan Hilarion compared the decision of Kiev to rename the UOC with the actions of the fascists
The head of the Synodal Department of External Church Relations of the Russian Orthodox Church, Metropolitan Hilarion compared the renaming of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate to the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of the fascists against Jews.
"It's like in fascist Germany to put a yellow pointed star on a Jew, it means to mark the Church as an enemy organization, and it was for this purpose that this bill was created," the metropolitan said on the air of the TV channel "Russia-24."
In his opinion, this step will have the most serious consequences right now, when the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is in an acute stage.
Kiev thus hopes to gain full control of the UOC and "put it outlawed," the clergyman believes.
"This is the Ukrainian church, and the believers of this church consider themselves Ukrainians, they are patriots of their country," he added.
Earlier it became known that the deputies of the Verkhovna Rada are working on the implementation of bills No. 4128 (on changing the subordination of religious communities), No. 4511 (about the special status of religious organizations) and No. 5309 (on the change of the name of religious organizations).

At different times of history, our predecessors and relatives, according to faith and spirit, Christians had to profess their faith and defend their shrines.
Given the situation that has developed, and according to the information we have, and on the threats of massacres, which is spreading, it is clear that we will have to experience something," - said the metropolitan.
He asked for support - prayerful, moral.
Also, the viceroy of the Lavra stressed that it is likely "to allow your physical presence."
The clergyman added: "Lenin's grandchildren - in spirit, threaten with repentance, and therefore we will protect our shrine."
Who does not indifferent the fate of the Pochaev Lavra - the Orthodox Ukrainian and world shrine, it is necessary to be ready to protect it, the appeal says.
The Metropolitan urged not to go on about those who lead the believers astray.
The UOC has a canonical status, determined by the Tomos of October 29, 1990 from the Mother Church.
And now someone wants to depend on the news patriarch and friend of the Catholic Pope Bartholomew.
A new style with its consequences is unacceptable to us Orthodox.
And we are pleased with the status that our church has," - said the viceroy of the Lavra.
He recalled that since October 1990, the UOC has been canonically independent and fully independent in its management.
There is no administrative and financial accountability of the Moscow Patriarchate.
In fact, our church already has a tomos.
"What other Tomos do we need?" - said Metropolitan Vladimir Pochaevsky, urging believers and all citizens to wonder whether other denominations Tomos have, are they independent from the Vatican?
The believers sorted out to some extent and decided which temple to go to them.
However, someone wants to sow enmity and strife again.

A lot was said in Tehran about the sharp escalation of the situation in Afghanistan on September 26.
There were multilateral consultations with the participation of Iran, India, China, Afghanistan and Russia, which was represented by the Secretary of the Security Council Nikolai Patrushev.
In fact, on the Afghan territory, militants unleashed a real terrorist war against the state authorities and the civilian population of the country.
The current year was a record in the number of bloody terrorist attacks, as a result of which thousands of ordinary Afghans were killed," Patrushev said.
The troubles of Afghanistan did not begin yesterday.
After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the main enemy of the United States was declared the terrorist group "Al-Qaeda" (banned in the Russian Federation), which settled in Afghanistan.
Less than a month later, America and NATO allies launched the military operation "Indestructible Freedom."
It's been 17 years.
Thousands of American troops and now on Afghan soil.
And the life of peace is even more phantom than in the time.
American troops are driven by the fences of dozens of bases.
As they can, they are bought from militants for money - if only they are not touched.
The government of Afghanistan controls a smaller part of the country's territory - 40%, according to Patrushev.
50% - the Taliban (banned in the Russian Federation).
Another 10% - for terrorists of ISIS (banned in the Russian Federation).
But they grow there quickly.
The goal is to create a barbaric pseudo-calcifacial in Central Asia - exactly what they did not have in Iraq and Syria.
America seems to be awake.
As it is also satisfied that in 17 years of the American presence, the production of drugs (opiats) in Afghanistan has increased at least 40 times.

Macedonians are preparing to vote in a referendum on joining the EU and NATO, subject to a change in the name of the country.
The agreement to rename the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to the Republic of North Macedonia was reached on 17 June as a result of long negotiations with neighboring Greece, which refused to recognize its northern neighbor the right to be called Macedonia, seeing in such a name an attempt on the Greek province of the same name and Greek history.
Lupko Petkovsky, political scientist: "Thanks to this agreement, Macedonia or North Macedonia gets the right to a better future, hope for social change.
And Greece will secure the right to its past.
There are no perfect agreements.
They arise as a result of difficult compromises can not be the luck of absolutely everyone."
The renaming of the country is the ruling Social Democrats led by Prime Minister Zoran Zayev.
Against - conservative opposition and the country's President Gheorghe Ivanov.
According to journalist Tsvetina Chilimanov, Macedonia does not make sense to join the EU - it is enough to have a partnership with him: "Many of those who do not like the agreement believe that the current socialist government led by Zayev is imposed from outside in order to change the name of the country.
But this decision will have negative consequences.
First, the loss of sovereignty.
Obviously, there are countries that do not want Macedonia to remain one of the sovereign countries in the Balkans."
Fai Dulgeri, Euronews: "The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia faces the biggest challenge in its history.
The country was at a crossroads.
The choice that the citizens of Macedonia will make will determine the future not only of the Balkans, but also of Europe as a whole.
