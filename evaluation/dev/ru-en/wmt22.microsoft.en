From my point of view, the literature program was formed by ladies of Balzac's age on the basis of their interests.
Of the Russian literature of the 19th century, we preferred Danilevsky and Volkonsky.
They wrote fiction, of course, from the point of view of those same ladies of Balzac's age.
And the psychology and torment of the heroines of Tolstoy and Turgenev for teenagers is not so interesting.
Teenagers are rarely interested in the psychology of the characters.
Thank you very much, very interesting.

Mattress Promtex Micropacket Prestige 105x195.
Model "Micropackage Prestige": comfort and natural composition.
The mattress has different side stiffness: the medium-hard surface is formed by latex coconut fiber and natural latex, moderately soft - by a plate of natural latex.
The spring unit with 1000 springs per square meter quickly adapts to the body of the sleeper, preventing the appearance of the effect of "wave" or "hammock".
Among the advantages of the model should be identified breathable materials.
Latex, perforated for breathability, is perfectly ventilated naturally, as is coconut coir.
Thanks to this, a healthy microclimate of the bed is preserved.
Also, the mattress is covered by an extended warranty period.
The term of the official warranty from the manufacturer is 5 years, in fact, the service life of the mattress is longer.
Protection against dust and dirt is provided on a removable jacquard cover supplied in the kit.
Purchase an orthopedic pillow paired with the mattress - it is recommended to maintain the optimal position of the spine during sleep.
The filler determines the purpose of the parties - coconut serves as an anatomical support for the back, latex relaxes the muscles.

I remember with horror these feasts and guests in my parents' house.
Guests are on the doorstep, and more cutlets are roasted on the stove, Mom is squirming the floor.
Lord, yes, I sat down at the table without strength.
And then we wash the dishes, clean the house.
A week before the holiday you carry food, two days of cooking, a day of cleaning after.
And the guests what?
They feel good, and the cake is sure to come with them.
Since then, I do not like holidays, guests.
Even for my family, I set the table at a minimum.
And I cook delicacies for them, I bake very often just like that.
Germany: Fourth coronavirus vaccine inevitable
A fourth vaccination will be required in the summer or fall of 2022.
According to the expert, the current vaccination in Germany will not be the final, but will continue with renewed vigor.
Despite the active vaccination campaign in Germany, neither two nor three doses of coronavirus vaccine will probably be enough for complete protection.
The head of the Association of General Practitioners, Ulrich Weigeldt, is convinced of this.
On Saturday, December 11, reports Die Welt.
"We expect that the fourth vaccination will be required in the summer, at the latest in the autumn," the expert said.
In addition, Weigeldt hopes that the fourth vaccination against coronavirus can be carried out "in combination with vaccination against influenza."
This will help to achieve the best results.
In addition, increased vaccination can help in the fight against the spread of a new strain of coronavirus "Omicron".
And the new version is especially dangerous.
Thus, the probability of re-infection with Omicron is three times higher than that of Delta or Beta strains.
This is evidenced by the results of a preliminary study conducted in South Africa.
Based on this, the manufacturers of BioNTech / Pfizer plan to provide a vaccine adapted for Omikron by March 2022.
The companies emphasize that two doses of the vaccine do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the new variant of the omicron coronavirus.
A study by BioNTech and Pfizer showed that at two doses of the vaccine, the effectiveness is significantly lower: "the neutralizing potential is reduced by more than 25 times."
"This indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the omicron strain," BioNTech and Pfizer emphasized.
Therefore, a third dose is necessary.
Experts insist on accelerating the pace of vaccination in the country.
For example, the chairman of the German Society for Infectious Diseases, Bernd Salzberger, advocates a reduction in the interval between the second and third vaccination.
Moreover, according to Salzberger, accelerated vaccination will have an impact on the spread of both the delta virus and the omicron variant of the coronavirus.
"The experience of Israel shows this very convincingly," the expert stressed.
Pontoon21 Lure, Bet-A Vib, 54 Silent, 54 mm, 8.5 g.
The Bet-A-Vib series is a special branch of the Bet-A family from Pontoon21®.
It (like the Kalikana Vib series) differs from many other vibs in that it was originally created with its use in mind for ice fishing, and not just for cast fishing.
These vibes have a larger specific gravity than those of similar analogues, which undoubtedly has a positive effect on the nuances of the use of these interesting baits.
Another recognizable feature is the upper fin made of durable and elastic plastic, creating additional shades of vibration during vertical and horizontal wiring.
As a "winter vib" when fishing in the plumb, Bet-A-Vib demonstrates a rather aggressive game.
Often the most subtle is a simple monotonous animation, that is, moving the angler up and down almost without pauses.
When planning, the deviation from the vertical axis is not very large, which is convenient when fishing in a limited space, cluttered with underwater vegetation, snags and other obstacles for which a hook is possible.
In addition, a slight deviation is relevant when fishing for walleye and large bass in winter, and especially in the middle of winter, when a pinpoint and aggressive bait feed is required.
Upon reaching the extreme point of the trajectory, Bet-A-Vib instantly turns around and returns to the original vertical.
No less successfully Bet-A-Vib is used for winter fishing of pond trout.
To please its whims, you can choose from two modifications: with a noise capsule (NS - NanoSound) or without it (SL - Silent).
It is also noted that Bet-A-Vib by playing plumb line can tease passive pike, which does not even react to live bait.
When fishing backcast, Bet-A-Vib demonstrates range and accuracy.
This wobbler is understandable and not capricious, it goes well with fishing line and braided cords of even large diameters.
For catching pike, walleye, ruff or perch, in addition to a uniform one, a "step" is also relevant, sometimes with a "chirp" along the bottom.
If you fish in anchored areas, you can change the front tee to a double, which will reduce the likelihood of hooks.
Among the lures of its class, Bet-A-Vib is among the most stable in operation and, as a result, one of the most catchable.
With equal success it can be used both in relatively shallow and in fairly deep areas.
All models are equipped with Owner ST-36 hooks.

In Libya, said about 7 thousand Russian mercenaries
In Libya there are more than 7 thousand mercenaries of the private military company (PMC) "Wagner".
This was stated on Sunday, December 12, by the Chairman of the Supreme State Council of the Republic Khaled al-Mishri.
"Currently, there are more than 7,000 mercenaries of the Wagner PMC in Libya.
They also have airplanes.
They also dig trenches in Sirte and Kufra.
They have 30 jets at Gardabia Air Bases (also used as a civilian airport in Sirte)," Anadolu News Agency quoted him as saying.
Khaled al-Mishri also pointed out that Russian mercenaries are "trying to seize" the central part of Libya, stretching from Chad to the Mediterranean Sea, after "bringing their man to power" in the Central African Republic.
Maintain presence
According to the interlocutor of the publication, Moscow was looking for a country to maintain its presence in North Africa and "settled in Libya."
Wagner has been in Libya since 2019, using the air base and port in Sirte, as well as the air base in Jufra, the agency's publication notes.
The Russian authorities officially deny that the Wagner PMC enjoys the support of the Kremlin.
Where else can mercenaries be
According to the agency, Wagner allegedly operates in nine African countries - the CENTRAL African Republic, Libya, Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe and Angola.
The company provides military training to local forces, personal protection of leaders and protection of energy facilities.
In exchange for these services, Wagner's subsidiaries receive certain privileges and licenses to use minerals and natural resources, as well as to supply weapons, technology and military services to these countries.
According to the media, the "Wagnerians" allegedly fought in the Donbass, Syria, Mozambique, Sudan and the Central African Republic.
This group is not listed either in law enforcement agencies or in the register of legal entities, and its fighters are absent in the form lists of personnel.
This company is under US sanctions.
Earlier, the permanent representatives of 27 EU countries approved restrictions against Wagner.
It is expected that this decision will be approved by the Council of the European Union on December 13.
The situation in Libya
The Supreme Council of State of Libya is de facto the second chamber of parliament with advisory functions with dominant Islamists in it, writes TASS.
This body has repeatedly called for the postponement of a single voting day for the election of deputies to parliament and the head of state from December 24 to at least February 2022.
"Less than two weeks remain before the elections, and the chances that they will be held on time are rapidly decreasing," the material says.
Against this background, the Supreme Electoral Commission of Libya postponed indefinitely the announcement of the final list of candidates, reports Sky News Arabia.
Foreign policy through the eyes of Russians
38% of Russians see more successes than failures in the country's foreign policy, 29% believe that failures prevail.
"Examples of successes are "in Syria, they protected, restored peace there", "the decision on Nord Stream-2", "the whole world was intimidated that it was cool weapons", "We squeezed Crimea".
The main failures are "conflict with Ukraine", "confrontation with Western countries", "isolation from the world", - the study of the Public Opinion Foundation says.
The government of Dubai has completely abandoned paperwork - all public services have also become only digital
The government of Dubai announced a complete rejection of paperwork and the transition to digital technologies.
All public services to the population will also be provided exclusively in electronic form.
This is reported by the Emirati news agency WAM.
"Today marks the beginning of a new phase of digitalization of all aspects of Dubai's life – we have completed the transition to a completely paperless government," Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of the Emirate and Chairman of the Executive Council of Dubai, said on Saturday.
Now the internal and external document flow in all state institutions of Dubai will be carried out only in digital form through special information platforms.
The innovation affected all industries without exception: healthcare, housing and communal services, police, municipal bodies, courts, etc. Many commercial structures also joined the government's initiative.
The transition to e-government and digitalization of document management began in Dubai in 2018.
During this time, according to the authorities, 336 million paper sheets were saved, which is 14 million hours of human labor and 353.8 million dollars in monetary terms.
Earlier, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said that electronic services save citizens 2 days a year.

Turkey's car production and exports fell below 2020 levels
Turkey's car production and exports fell sharply in November amid the lira's depreciation.
As a result, the industry's performance for the first 11 months was worse than last year's result, Bloomberg reports, citing data from the Association of Automobile Manufacturers of Turkey.
According to the association, in November, 115 thousand cars were produced from factories in Turkey, which is 20% less than a year earlier.
About 75.9 thousand cars were exported, which is more than 25% lower than last year's figure.
And if according to the results of the first 10 months of this year, the automotive sector of Turkey showed a positive trend compared to last year, then by the end of 11 months of 2021, the production of cars was already 0.3% worse than last year's figure.
The reason for this fall was the sharp weakening of the Turkish lira, which in November fell by 29% against the dollar.
This led to a drop in economic activity in all sectors.
More than 500 SMEs received a deferral of loan payments in 2021
First Deputy Prime Minister Alikhan Smailov spoke about the situation on the provision of benefits for small and medium-sized businesses, Kazinform correspondent reports.
"According to the Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan for Regulation and Development of the Financial Market, this year, in pursuance of the instruction of the Head of State dated April 1, 2021, the Order of the Chairman of the Agency dated April 9, 2021 No. 127 "On Approving the Procedure for Granting Deferred Payments on Loans to Small and Medium-Sized Businesses" was adopted," Alikhan Smailov wrote in his response to the deputy's request.
He recalled that the procedure for granting a deferral of payments on loans provided for the provision by banks and organizations engaged in microfinance activities of deferral of payments on loans issued until April 1, 2021 to SMEs, including individual entrepreneurs, in the period from April 1 to June 30, 2021.
The deferral period ranged from 30 to 90 days at the choice of the SME entity.
In the application of the borrower, a different period of deferral of payments could be indicated.
During the deferral period, claim and lawsuit work, notification of the need to repay overdue debts, as well as the collection of commissions and other payments by the lender were suspended," the deputy prime minister said.
In 2021, second-tier banks received applications for deferred payments on loans of 603 borrowers-subjects of SMEs, of which 553 SMEs received a deferral in the amount of 9.7 billion tenge.
131 SMEs submitted applications for deferral to MFIs, of which the deferral was granted to 95 subjects in the amount of 105.8 million tenge," Smailov concluded.
Pulmonologist Puryasev suggested that people with weak immunity are able to easily tolerate the strain of "okmiron"
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity can tolerate it more easily than those who have a strong protective reaction of the body.
Pulmonologist Sergey Puryasev explained why the strain of coronavirus "okmiron" can be dangerous.
The reason should be sought in the conditions of the origin of the virus.
Scientists believe that "okmiron" originated in the body of an HIV-infected or immunodeficient person.
That is, with the mutation, he did not meet any resistance from immunity.
Due to this, he is more aggressive.
Due to the fact that there was no answer from immunity, it became very fast.
Apparently, there he has these spike proteins, spikes, maybe more than expected, their antibodies were not cut during mutations, - comments pulmonologist Sergey Puryasev.
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity can tolerate "okmiron" more easily than those who have a strong protective reaction of the body.
It turns out that a strong response of the body to anything, to any infection, is not always good.
In such cases, the body can kill itself.
So it happens with pneumococcal infections, when 30-year-old young people die, and 60-year-old people in the form of a sneeze tolerate it.
The immune response is rabid in a young man, it is completely inadequate: where it was possible only to threaten with a finger, he hits sparrows like a cannon, " concluded Sergey Puryasev.
The doctor also recalled that the coronavirus has dangerous side effects and the most unpleasant of them is pneumonia.
Pneumonia can be bacterial and viral.
If the first is treated very successfully and quickly, in the second case, you can often stop only the symptoms - all hope for the body.
The first sign of developing pneumonia will be the onset of intoxication of the body - this is temperature, weakness, malaise.
Then there are respiratory symptoms: difficulty breathing, sore throat, cough.
Pain on the right or left, abdominal pain can also indicate a developing problem.
Meanwhile, in Russia, by the end of the year, they can begin to vaccinate the younger generation from 12 to 18 years old.
Pavel Volchkov, a virologist and head of the MIPT Laboratory of Genome Engineering, noted that this category is very actively affected by COVID.
In adolescents who go to school, the number of contacts is maximum.
This is the most socially active stratum, as well as pupils of kindergartens," Pavel Volchkov, a virologist and head of the MIPT Laboratory of Genome Engineering, told Moscow 24.

Immunologists have hypothesized why obese people fall victim to COVID
The authors studied the adipose tissue left over from bariatric surgeries and found that fat cells known as adipocytes can become infected with the coronavirus.
Immune cells located in adipose tissue, macrophages, also became infected, and showed a strong inflammatory response.
The scientists also examined the adipose tissue of patients who died of COVID and found coronavirus particles in the fat surrounding various organs.
It is known that HIV and influenza viruses can hide in adipose tissue, using it as a reservoir, in an attempt to avoid an immune system response.
SARS-CoV-2 is probably capable of this as well.
The biologist spoke about the causes of dementia
Candidate of Biological Sciences Semyon Golosheykin named the causes of dementia and spoke about ways to prevent it in an interview with Sputnik radio.
According to WHO, this disease affects more than 55 million people.
The syndrome is manifested by a gradual loss of cognitive functions - over time, a person has difficulty navigating even in a familiar environment.
Golosheykin noted that most often neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders and lack of certain vitamins lead to dementia.
Some factors increase the risk of developing the disease.
This includes hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity, depression and alcoholism.
At the behavioral level, the role of factors such as social isolation and lack of active cognitive activity is possible," he said.
The development of dementia is also affected by addictions - smoking, alcohol abuse, sleep disorders and a sedentary lifestyle.
Among the first signs, the expert noted forgetfulness, inability to concentrate and a decrease in the level of abstract thinking.
"There is debate that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and one of the risk factors for its occurrence," the biologist added.
To prevent the occurrence of the disease, WHO recommends maintaining the necessary level of physical activity, training cognitive skills and abilities that require the involvement of memory and logic.
Formerly Professor of the Department of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Medical Genetics of the Federal State Budgetary Educational Institution of Higher Education of the Russian National Research University.

Egypt returned about 30 thousand illegally exported artifacts from the country
Over the past 10 years, the Cairo government has managed to return to its homeland about 30 thousand artifacts that were smuggled out of the country.
This was announced on Saturday, December 11, on the air of the Al-Hayat TV channel, the chief inspector of the Department of Returned Antiquities of the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities of Egypt Shaaban Abdel Gauad.
Since 2011, the Egyptian state has managed to return 29,300 artifacts.
This year alone, 5300 monuments of ancient Egyptian civilization were discovered at the Museum of the Bible in Washington," he said.
Abdel Gauad said that all the artifacts smuggled out are registered in the archives.
Now the staff of the department is working on their return to Egypt.
In particular, experts "track auctions around the world and sales on the Internet" through foreign and Egyptian sites, as well as social networks.
The chief inspector said that upon return, cultural values are restored, and then exhibited in museums.
According to him, one of the returned artifacts was an ancient human skeleton discovered in Belgium, which is now part of the exposition of the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, the Egyptian authorities appealed to Interpol with a request to help find the bust of Pharaoh Tutankhamun sold at auction in London.
Auction house Christie's on July 4 held an auction, at which a bust over 3 thousand years old was sold for $ 5.97 million (about 680 million rubles).
This caused discontent on the part of Egypt.
The Egyptian side also claims that the art object was illegally removed in the 1970s from the Karnak Temple in Luxor.
Tutankhamun's head, depicted as the sun god Amun, has been kept in a private collection and has not been put up for auction since 1985.
How the relic got to Europe is unknown.
In recent years, Egypt has been actively seeking the repatriation of ancient monuments illegally exported from the country at different times.
According to the authorities, 95% of the smuggled antiquities are the result of archaeological research by "black diggers".
"Crimean Tatars are not taken into account" - and this is correct, since the Crimean Tatars (232 thousand) are an independent people (close to the Turks).
If you want to add, then only 42 thousand people - so many Tatars (Kazan) live in the Crimea (see census).
Crimean Tatars are a separate people, and the name of this people consists of two words!
They are united only by the Turkic language group.
FT: Credit Suisse wants to access employees' personal mobile devices
Credit Suisse requires its employees to provide the bank with access to their personal mobile devices, writes the Financial Times.
The fact is that in Europe and the United States, a Swiss bank does not issue corporate communication devices to its employees, instead offering a discount on the purchase of a mobile phone or smartphone from a partner telecommunications operator.
Under the current rules, the bank can view information on corporate devices issued to its employees, as they are used to solve business issues with colleagues or customers.
The bank enjoys the right to inspect mobile devices in extreme cases - for example, if an employee used it to hold a meeting with a customer that was not approved by Credit Suisse.
Now, after many employees have switched to remote work, the bank wants to extend this rule to all devices that were used to solve work issues.
According to the newspaper, the bank's management has set a deadline until which employees can familiarize themselves with the new rule.
Officially, Credit Suisse does not comment on the information about the new requirement.

Part 4
The last year of Sergei Yesenin's life - 1925 - was fruitful in terms of creativity, but the most difficult for the earthly existence of the poet and his "ego".
He is already outside of any literary associations, spitting with Imagism, he is on his own, but he is known, in demand, at times firmly scolded by critics, even maliciously, but the reading public is ready to carry him in their arms.
During the year, more than 60 poems were written, many of them are real masterpieces, the cycle "Persian Motifs" was completed, the poem "Anna Snegina" was written, 8 books were published, the collection "Soviet Rus" was published.
And the main success - at the end of June of the 25th year, Gosizdat concluded a contract with Yesenin for the publication of his works in 3 volumes.
None of the contemporary poets of Sergei Alexandrovich was awarded such an honor, he is the first!
In addition, it promised very good money - under the contract, the fee was 1000 rubles monthly for 20 months (the director of the plant, for example, received 300 rubles. per month, the engineer - 200).
Funds in that year were needed more than ever.
Yesenin married Leo Tolstoy's granddaughter Sofia Tolstoy, it was necessary to equip family life, to support sisters Katya and Sasha, as well as his mother.
It seems that life was getting better, there is something to rejoice, but for him everything is painted mainly in dark colors, as if the nightmare from the poem "The Black Man" (written in November 1925 and published after Yesenin's death) materialized:
My friend, my friend,
I'm very, very sick.
I don't know where this pain came from.
Whether the wind whistles
Over an empty and deserted field,
That is like a grove in September,
Alcohol showers the brains.
Many acquaintances noted that Yesenin gave up a lot, looks bad, is obviously sick.
More and more often repetitive binges, nervous breakdowns.
And the reason is probably not only in alcoholism ...
However, if such a diagnosis - alcoholism - was made to Sergei Alexandrovich by someone, there are no reliable documents left.
For example, dating back to May 1923, when Yesenin, at the insistence of his fourth wife, the American Isadora Duncan, was recovering his health in a clinic near Paris with Professor Pyotr Gannushkin (Yesenin would come to him again two years later, already in Moscow).
But there is plenty of evidence of the poet's binges, scandals on this basis, drives to the police - scattered over dozens of memoirs.
Since the beginning of the 20s, the poet's terrible romance with the green serpent has been developing rapidly.
At the end of the summer of 1923, Yesenin briefly settled with a friend, the Imagist Ivan Startsev.
Surprisingly, Yesenin, with his very good incomes, never had his own housing either in Moscow or in St. Petersburg, he was found in rented apartments, in hotels or with friends.
Startsev recalls:
"I came only to spend the night, and in most cases in a deranged, drunken state.
One day, returning at four o'clock in the morning, Yesenin fell on the staircase ...
Falling, he scratched his face and wheezed.
After regaining a little consciousness, he incessantly began to cough, spraying the entire sheet with blood..."
Yes, and Yesenin himself after a voyage to Europe and the United States (in the States then there was a dry law, but Duncan took with her a decent supply of alcohol) admitted:
"I didn't see anything there except taverns and streets ...
I was about to finish and people stopped remembering...
Well, and drank, of course...
And I drank because the longing gnawed."

A father takes care of his young daughter.
And he loves, as Lermontov wrote, "with a strange love."
Why did the girl cry at the exam when she hadn't failed yet?
Why didn't he tell his daughter it wasn't a school.
Well, she'll have a tail.
So what?
Re-pass.
Millions of students know this.

Polish Foreign Ministry believes that Belarus uses migrants as a "weapon" against the EU
Polish Foreign Ministry believes that Belarus uses migrants as a "weapon"
Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Pawel Jabłoński expressed the opinion that Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko used refugees as a "weapon" against the European Union and intends to return to such an "operation" next year.
The corresponding statement was made by the Deputy Foreign Minister in an interview with the Australian Financial Review newspaper.
According to Yablonsky, sanctions against Belarus temporarily "stopped Lukashenka," but he is "actively looking for new ways."
Also, the Polish official is confident that now illegal migrants will be used as weapons "in many parts of the world."
As the kp.ru website wrote, earlier the European Union introduced the fifth package of sanctions against Belarus.
It affected 17 individuals and 11 organizations.
In Europe, they declared their readiness to further expand restrictive measures against the republic, "if the situation in the country does not improve."
In response, Minsk imposed a food embargo on a wide range of goods from countries that had previously decided to impose sanctions against Belarus.

"Not according to Senka hat": when a velvet jacket makes a laughing stock out of a man
The social events of 2021 were dominated by velvet jackets.
Perhaps the first to announce his new fashion solution was Daniel Craig.
Back in September, at the premiere of the film "No Time to Die", he appeared in a velvet crimson jacket and a traditional "Bond" butterfly.
His example was twice followed by Prince William, who first wore a green velvet jacket to the award ceremony of The Earthshot Prize, which does not comply with the royal dress code, and then chose a more classic option for an event in support of the Royal Variety Charitable Foundation.
A couple of weeks ago, lionel Messiah tried on the trend.
The footballer came to pick up the seventh Ballon d'Or in a velvet Dolce & Gabbana jacket.
By the way, his sons were dressed in the same.
AliExpress already notes the growing demand for velvet men's jackets in Russia.
According to analysts of the service, received in the "Gazeta. Ru", they began to buy 1.4 times more often.
The most popular are warm velvet jackets with a lining and a fitted silhouette, the main colors are dark beige, burgundy, dark blue and, of course, black.
The average price of such models is from 3 to 6 thousand rubles, while men prefer to buy only jackets - they choose sets of velvet suits less often.
You can buy them not only from online retailers.
Budget options are available in H&M, Mango, Next and Zara.
In the luxury segment, velvet jackets are presented in almost all brands this season - Brioni, Paul Smith, Etro, and Saint Laurent.
The most desirable is the Gucci model, in which the brand ambassador Jared Leto went to one of the premieres of the film "Gucci House".
Choosing jackets of expensive brands, you can be sure that the velvet is made of silk.
Thanks to the special technology of weaving threads, a dense fabric with a lint external texture and a smooth inner side is obtained.
More budget options are made of cotton or polyamide, but, accordingly, serve less.
Lamoda fashion expert Ilya Vakhoshkin, warns that in the case of a velvet jacket, the main thing is not its model or style, but appropriateness.
"Velvet requires evening light, so this jacket is ideal if you are going to a party or a solemn event," vakhoshkin explains. - It is also suitable for those cases if the dress code "Black Tie" or "Creative Black Tie" is indicated in the invitation.
Another important criterion, the observance of which allows you to make a choice in favor of a velvet jacket, is the status of its buyer.
"A man in a velvet jacket, first of all, should get the right advanced party with prosperity," the authors of the Telegram channel about men's fashion "Handsome Brammell" believe. - Holders of velvet jackets, as a rule, belong to the caste of those people who rarely buy tickets.
They are simply invited to timed social events, where the dress code is always indicated.
Ilya Vakhoshkin suggests combining a velvet jacket with the same elegant things: classic trousers with arrows, plain shirts, silk ties, loafers with tassels, cufflinks.
Too simple and everyday things will look out of place.
Fashion experts from "Handsome Brammell" are sure: it will be inappropriate to appear in a velvet jacket of an ordinary employee at a corporate party, but if we are talking about "a leader from among those who manage this event, then - "yes", he has such a thing in the topic."
If the employee is of a lower rank, and his goal is to move higher in the complex hierarchy of the company or knock out financial bonuses, then it is better not to wear a velvet jacket.
The management will definitely appreciate this with the phrase "not according to Senka hat", - the editors of the Telegram channel about men's fashion believe.
Very mixed feelings from the voice.
It's an unnatural timbre, so tortured pulls.
And it is not associated at all with the cute face of a young girl.
To be honest, I don't understand the admiration of others.
But from the bottom of my heart I wish you good luck in life!
It's all about money - alternative energy is well lobbied, that is, paid.
Billions of dollars of investment.
Are they sad?
No, the price of electricity has gone up.
Traditional energy is also not in the overhead - gas, oil, and coal were bought cheaper than they are now selling.
There is a wild demand for fuel.
A penny is dripping.
And then who's in the flyby?
As usual - an ordinary buyer.
Do the problems of the Indians touch the sheriff?
Therefore, Western politicians should not be considered idiots who "slept through" the energy crisis.
They did their job.
For a good bribe.
I did not see a single beautiful person in the photos in the article.
Just mediocrity within the average passengers.
Perhaps, if such characters are so confident in their beauty that they decide to show it to the whole car, then they will not get to them, most likely.
But only because of the mental disorder and ignorance of such "beauties (-itz)", but certainly not because of their appearance.

A slave who drools when he smugly describes the delights of slave life and admires a good and good master is a slave, a boor."
Immunologist said that revaccination in 4-5 months will help protect against the strain of coronavirus "omicron"
Revaccination in four to five months can protect against a new strain of coronavirus infection "omicrone".
This statement was made by immunologist Nikolai Kryuchkov, who called the vaccination in six months, taking into account the emergence of a new strain, "a very long period"
"With previous strains, such a period was normal, but now it is best to carry out the procedure in five months, and for people with chronic diseases - in four," the expert said, urging in parallel with the vaccination campaign, to engage in revaccination.
Kryuchkov also noted that early revaccination provides a good titer of neutralizing antibodies.
"If a person was given two vaccinations and a booster, or he was sick and vaccinated, or vaccinated and ill, then he received "hybrid immunity", that is, there are a lot of antibodies and neutralizing enough," the expert said.
"Group of Seven" warned Russia of "large-scale consequences" in the event of an invasion of Ukraine
The countries of the "Big Seven" (Great Britain, Germany, Italy, Canada, the United States, France and Japan) issued a statement following the meeting of foreign ministers in Liverpool.
It stresses that Russia's "military aggression" against Ukraine "will have huge consequences and will cost Moscow dearly," but the document does not describe specific measures.
"We, the foreign ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America and the High Representative of the European Union, are united in our condemnation of Russia's military buildup and aggressive rhetoric against Ukraine," the statement said.
The ministers further call on Russia to "ease escalation, use diplomatic channels and abide by its international obligations regarding transparency of military activities," as U.S. President Biden said during a video call to Russian President Putin on Dec. 7.
"We reaffirm our support for the efforts of France and Germany in the Normandy format to achieve the full implementation of the Minsk agreements in order to resolve the conflict in eastern Ukraine," the G7 foreign ministers said.
Any use of force to change borders is strictly prohibited by international law.
Russia should have no doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have huge consequences and a serious price to pay in return," they warned.
We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, as well as the right of any sovereign state to determine its future.
We welcome Ukraine's restrained stance.
We will intensify our cooperation on our common and comprehensive response," the statement said.
Earlier in the day, british foreign policy chief Elizabeth Truss said Russia would suffer "serious consequences" in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
According to her, this meeting showed "the united voice of the countries of the Group of Seven, which account for 50% of world GDP, and which made it very clear that the invasion of Ukraine will have huge consequences for Russia."
The Pfizer vaccine was found to be 32 times less effective against the omicron strain
The effectiveness of the vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech against the omicron strain of coronavirus is 32 times lower in comparison with other types of the disease.
This conclusion was made by scientists from the University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University of Hong Kong, reports the South China Morning Post (SCMP).
The vaccine was considered less effective based on a study of antiviral activity in citizens who received two doses of the drug for COVID-19.
"We see that most people had a high level of antiviral activity against the original variant of Sars-CoV-2, however, this ability was significantly reduced against the omicron variety," said Professor Malik Peiris.
At the same time, scientists stressed that vaccination remains the most reliable way to protect against the severe course of the disease when infected with coronavirus.
Earlier, scientists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted the development of the coronavirus pandemic, taking into account the influence of the omicron strain on it.
The authors of the study concluded that the omicron strain can cause a new wave of viral circulation and increased mortality if additional measures are not taken.
The head of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine accused Germany of blocking the supply of NATO weapons to Kiev
The head of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, Alexei Reznikov, accused the government of former German Chancellor Angela Merkel of blocking Kiev's acquisition of deadly weapons within NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times on December 12, Reznikov recalled that last month Germany vetoed Ukraine's purchase of anti-sniper systems and rifles to defeat drones.
At the same time, it is noted that later Berlin softened its position on rifles, recognizing them as non-lethal weapons.
According to the Minister of Defense, Kiev intends to seek the acquisition of the above-mentioned weapons within the framework of bilateral agreements with allies.
In particular, we are talking about the United States, Great Britain, Lithuania and France.
Meanwhile, the FT notes that the position of the new German government under the leadership of Chancellor Olaf Scholz on the permission of arms supplies to Ukraine remains unclear.
Earlier on Sunday, Ukraine's ambassador to Germany, Andriy Melnyk, expressed the opinion that Kiev should not expect Berlin to supply weapons under Chancellor Scholz.
According to him, the previous leadership of Germany explained its refusal to provide weapons by the risk of developing a military escalation of the conflict in the Donbass, despite the "occupation by Russia" of part of the Ukrainian territory.
The diplomat is sure that Germany will maintain the same "illogical" position under the new chancellor.
In August, Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky said that Kiev expects help from Berlin in equipping the navy.
Ukraine expects that Germany "will be a partner of Ukraine in the technical sense," the president added.
It was also noted that in the spring of this year, the co-chairman of the Green Party of Germany, Robert Habeck, visited the republic, where he advocated the sale of defensive weapons to Kiev.

The foreign ministers of the G7 countries warned of "serious consequences" for Russia if it continues its military aggression against Ukraine, the parties said in the final statement.
The participants of the meeting also noted that they condemn the strengthening of the Russian armed forces near the borders of the country.

The G7 ministers and the EU High Representative noted that they were "united in their condemnation of Russia's armed strengthening and aggressive rhetoric against Ukraine."
British Foreign Minister Elizabeth Truss at a press conference in Liverpool warned of "big consequences" for Russia in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
We have made it clear that any invasion will have significant consequences...
The G7 wants Russia to abandon aggression against Ukraine," she said (quoted by TASS).

Revealed ways to return stolen money through online stores
There are several ways to get back money stolen through online stores and not become a victim of fraud in the future.
They were revealed by information security experts in an interview with RBC.
So, to reduce the risk of major losses when bank card data falls into the hands of intruders, it is recommended to store fixed assets on a card or bank account that are not used in online shopping.
Part of the savings can be deposited in a savings account and withdrawn as needed.
Experts also recommend having a separate card for online purchases.
If the money was stolen during purchases in stores that do not use 3D Secure security technology, you can start the refund procedure.
"Within the framework of the rules established by payment systems, for unauthorized transactions conducted without the use of 3D Secure, the responsibility is assigned to the participant in the settlement chain who does not use this service," the representative of Promsvyazbank said.
Artur Zaremba, an expert from the international payment provider Ecommpay, stressed that the buyer has the right to submit an application to the bank to challenge the fraudulent transaction no later than 120 days after the purchase.
In addition, if the criminal used the card on online resources that do not require two-factor authentication, the transaction can be protested and the money returned.
It is noted that in some cases, online stores themselves return funds to the client if the order has not yet been sent for delivery.
On November 19, Ekaterina Mizulina, a member of the Public Chamber, Director of the Safe Internet League, reported that in 2021 alone, 11,000 appeals were received on various cases of fraud: from the sale of forged documents to identity theft.
According to her, an effective solution in the current circumstances can be the creation of a single window for complaints about online fraudsters.
Scholz arrives in Poland to discuss Nord Stream 2 and EU law
Newly elected German Chancellor Olaf Scholz arrived in Warsaw for talks on the migrant crisis on the border with Belarus, the independence of the judiciary in Poland, the build-up of Russian troops near the borders of Ukraine and the situation with the Russian gas pipeline Nord Stream 2.
Although Scholz has stated his desire to maintain good relations between Germany and Poland for years to come, the leaders of the two countries expressed unequivocal expectations of each other.
Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said that he would call on Scholz to oppose Nord Stream 2, which is supposed to deliver Russian gas to Germany bypassing Ukraine.
According to Morawiecki, Russia can use the gas pipeline against Europe as a means of political pressure.
In turn, Germany supported Poland's efforts to stop the flow of migrants trying to enter the country from Belarus.
Berlin said it would help Warsaw and Brussels resolve the crisis.
Poland's judicial system, however, remains one of the reasons for disagreement.
The European Court of Justice fined Poland, finding that the judicial reforms carried out by the right-wing Law and Justice party violate EU law.
Poland refused to pay the fine, and its highest court ruled that national legislation took precedence over EU rules.
Germany's new government, sworn in on Wednesday despite demands from Poland and the United States, has made no public commitment to halt Nord Stream 2 in the event of a Russian invasion of Ukraine.
U.S. officials told members of Congress that they had reached an understanding with Germany about shutting down the pipeline if Russia invaded Ukraine, a senior U.S. congressional official said Tuesday.
German officials have not confirmed the reports, but Scholz on Wednesday warned of the consequences if Russia violates Ukraine's border, a position confirmed sunday by the Group of Seven.
Dmitry, look more closely.

You wash them once a year at Easter, whatever, that you have to wash them.
Just don't get dirty.

A plumber who found money in the wall of the church will be paid 20 thousand dollars
A plumber who found money in the wall of a church in the U.S. state of Texas will be rewarded.
This is reported in a press release from the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston.
The incident occurred in the large evangelical church of Lakewood, where Pastor Joel Austin preaches, promising that wealth and prosperity await devout Christians.
In November 2021, plumber Justin Cowley was renovating one of the church's restrooms and found thousands of bags of money and checks under insulation.
He gave the find to the church and, according to him, did not receive even gratitude from Austin.
"I wanted to hear him say, 'You know, Justin, you did the right thing.
We understand what you have done and what you could have done," KPRC-TV quoted him as saying.
Apparently, the find is related to a theft that occurred in lakewood Church seven years ago.
Then about 200 thousand dollars in cash and 400 thousand dollars in the form of checks, which were stored in the church safe, disappeared.
The money was insured, so the church did not suffer losses.
Nevertheless, for information about the criminals, a reward was announced, amounting to 25 thousand dollars.
Justin Cowley could not claim this amount, as the reward has already expired.
Despite this, the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston, which at one time allocated five thousand dollars for the award and later received another 20 thousand dollars as a gift from lakewood Church, decided to reward the honesty of the plumber.
He'll get $20,000.
Earlier it was reported that the police questioned Pastor Joel Austin about the money found in the wall of Lakewood Church.
Tanya, her statements, her actions - this is her characterization "as a real person."
Therefore, the attitude towards it is so negative.
And it's not that "she's financially much richer than all the scribblers", as they write here.
There are people who are richer, but not everyone behaves as brazenly, as defiantly as this madam.

Since then, the number of such cases in the country has reached 53.
In Brazil, citizens were obliged to present vaccination passports when entering the country
In Brazil, it was obliged to demand Covid passports from those entering the territory of the state, the corresponding decision was made by the judge of the Federal Supreme Court of Brazil (STF) Luiz Roberto Barroso.
It is reported by CNN Brasil.
Citizens who have contraindications to vaccination are exempt from presenting a certificate from vaccination.
Also on the list of exceptions are persons who arrived from countries where the absence of a vaccine has been proven.
"The situation is even more serious when you consider that Brazil is a popular tourist destination for New Year's, pre-carnival and carnival parties, as well as other events, which implies an increase in tourist flow," Barroso said.
Earlier, the Brazilian authorities obliged tourists unvaccinated against coronavirus infection to observe a five-day quarantine.
Full protection against COVID-19 revealed
Virologist, Doctor of Medical Sciences, Honored Scientist of Russia Anatoly Altstein in an interview with Ura.ru revealed a scheme of complete protection against coronavirus infection.
According to him, this can be achieved by administering an injection and the use of a nasal vaccine.
With internasal use, a large number of immunoglobulins A. When the vaccine is administered by injection, this does not happen.
Immunoglobulins A protect the mucous membrane, so the virus cannot enter the body.
And inside, after vaccination, we have the most immunoglobulins G (antibodies).
And if you administer both vaccines, you will get a lot of immunoglobulins A and G. But so far there is no decision on double vaccination, "the doctor said.
The chief prophylactologist of the Ural Federal District, Doctor of Medical Sciences Sergey Tokarev, in turn, said that the main advantage of using nasal vaccination in conjunction with injection is the ability to stop being a carrier of COVID-19.
He added that this will help with the fact that in this case, the body's protection, presumably, should become maximum.
Earlier, the Minister of Health of the Nizhny Novgorod region, David Melik-Huseynov, said that the spread of a new coronavirus infection among children would lead to a new surge in the COVID-19 pandemic.
According to him, this is the picture observed in other countries, where the next wave of the pandemic came earlier.
Inna, hmm...
I talked to the male (who died a long time ago) like this - if you are ready to exchange a warm house, feeding, affection, love and games for a flowing, then go ahead.
But the pesel was trained and generally smart.
He chose my company and went home.
On video, a method that works 90% of the time.
Not taken from the ceiling, believe me.
I slowed down many owners so as not to run after the dog, although they lamented that out, 200 thousand run away (pomski), directly took his hand and led him in the other direction.
As a result, "200 thousand" chose the owner, and not the dog that ran somewhere there.
Mass protests of opponents of vaccination do not stop in Europe
In the Austrian capital of Vienna, more than forty thousand demonstrators took to the streets.
They expressed dissatisfaction with the restrictive measures and plans of the authorities to make vaccination against COVID mandatory.
From February next year, unvaccinated people will have to pay a fine of 3600 euros.
Spaniards, outraged by the policy of the authorities in the field of health, held a peaceful march in Madrid.
Some held signs reading "This is a false pandemic" and "I will not be vaccinated."
A major protest against sanitary passports took place in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia.
In the autonomous community, a covid certificate is required for access to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes and nightlife venues.
The decision to introduce sanitary passports was made by the authorities of a number of regions of the country against the background of an increase in the number of cases of coronavirus infection.
In Luxembourg, more than a thousand demonstrators protested against the tightening of restrictive measures and QR codes.
The action began peacefully, but then escalated into clashes with law enforcement officers.
A group of demonstrators began throwing stones at the police.
In response, law enforcement officers used water cannons.
Nicholas S., even on Wikipedia there is no consensus on this.
Kashevarova-Rudneva is also designated as "the first Russian doctor, Doctor of Medicine", probably because she began to study earlier.
Let's just not argue, I believe they both deserve this title.
But I agree with zakharova with only one thing: the Americans brought only death and looting to any country, wherever they appeared.

WHO has detected "omicrone" in six dozen states
The World Health Organization (WHO) said that a new strain of coronavirus "omicrone" has already been identified in 63 countries.
A number of experts are already saying that the spread of the new strain could have disastrous consequences.
The rate of spread of the strain was told in the message of the WHO.
According to the organization, as of December 9, the strain has already been identified in 63 countries, in all six WHO regions.
This is despite the fact that it began to actively spread only from the end of November.
WHO is also concerned about the high rate of spread of the novel variant of the coronavirus.
WHO experts express concern that the new strain, according to preliminary data, can bypass the delta strain, aka the Indian variant of the coronavirus, which is now leading in all countries without exception.
Prior to this, the Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said that the omicron strain could have a significant impact on the course of the coronavirus pandemic.
Similar conclusions were also reached in the UK.
Experts at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that "omicrone" in the coming months will displace the "delta".
And the number of cases only in Britain will be about 1 million, despite the fact that officially "omicron" at the moment in the Kingdom are sick several hundred people, and according to estimates up to 10 thousand.
British experts predict tens of thousands of deaths from the omicron strain, and at the peak, more than 2,000 people will be taken to hospitals daily.
What the British health care system will not be able to cope with.
The situation is complicated by the fact that according to recent studies, the effectiveness of the vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech against the strain of "omicrone" is 32 times lower in comparison with other types of the disease.
About how the Russian "Sputnik V" reacts to the "omicron" is still unknown - it will become clear in the next few weeks.
The Gamaleya Center has just begun testing the Russian vaccine on the omicron strain.
Why should we see the stages of aging?

Curious Squirrel, you are right, communication on the Internet is completely different, they communicate easily and at ease, and in person there is nothing to say.
And to see a person live, perhaps this is not what you expected, did not catch - hence the attitude.
When he meets his man, then the views will change.
And again, the Soviet time is called the "time of demons".
Back then, people believed in God much more honestly than they do today.
And they were brought up almost according to God's laws (love for your neighbor, do not steal, etc.).
What is the ideology today - money at any cost.
Talkers like Globa have little faith (and there is none at all), but even if so, the time of demons came in the 90s ...
Our St. Petersburg, or rather Leningrad communal apartment with Bolshaya Zelenina still maintains communication.
Of course, we are not the closest friends, but we try to preserve the warmth of the relations of the older generation.
Maybe this is due to the fact that there were no visitors in the apartment, rooms were not rented, and no one canceled the blockade brotherhood.
Unfortunately, we see each other more and more often at funerals.

And for what?
Brother pushed, not calculating the strength?
And you are always so clever that you have never accidentally hurt anyone and have never injured yourself?

Russians warned about a new scheme of scammers
Attackers began to look for new maneuvers for fraud in video messages.
This is written by "Izvestia" with reference to experts.
According to Zaur Abutalimov, product director of Ivideon, the main danger associated with the spread of video communication tools is deepfakes.
In this case, fraudsters create a fake video based on real recordings with the participation of the victim.
Thanks to this, the neural network manages to accurately reproduce the features of the behavior of a person.
Abutalimov added that using a deepfake, attackers can call the victim's friends via video link or create a video with the participation of a copy of a person for mailing for the purpose of blackmail.
"Such fakes can easily provoke bullying, since a savvy attacker can put people in ridiculous, dangerous or compromising pseudo-scripts," the expert said.
Varonis Lead Systems Engineer Alexander Vetkol, in turn, noted that psychologically, people trust others more when they see them.
He stressed that this can create specific risks when it comes to technologies using video.
David, I'll add.
In what I wrote above, I emphasized that I bought all this in a small town, where the local mentality did not allow me to make up and walk in short skirts, show stockings and tights on legs.
It's a province, but the store HAD such a product.

Listed five actions that will help to avoid diabetes
Problems with blood sugar levels are among the most common in the world.
However, some do not attach much importance to this, and in vain.
Diabetes can lead to severe complications and even death over time.
Preventive measures play a major role in preventing the formation of diseases.
So, doctors recommend changing the drinking regime - reducing the number of various drinks and switching to ordinary water have a positive effect on metabolism.
Sugary foods raise blood sugar levels to a dangerous level when consumed in excess.
Therefore, the first step towards a healthy lifestyle is to stop buying sweets and store them at home.
The appearance of the disease is affected not only by malnutrition, but also by habits.
To reduce the risks of diabetes, you need to move a lot.
Experts advise to adhere to a low-carbohydrate diet.
Such a diet will not only help reduce weight, but also protect against sharp fluctuations in sugar levels.
To protect against diabetes, you need to eat a lot of fiber.
Dietary fiber fills the stomach and thus contributes to the emergence of a feeling of satiety, the release of digestive juices and increased absorption of food.

Dr. Pavlova told about the "weekend migraine" in workaholics
Several factors can lead to a deterioration in well-being on the weekend.
The reason for the deterioration of well-being after working days is often a "weekend migraine", said a well-known endocrinologist, candidate of medical sciences, senior researcher at the Faculty of Fundamental Medicine of Moscow State University, scientific director of the System Medicine Clinic Zukhra Pavlova in her telegram channel.
According to her, workaholics suffer especially often from this, who have a headache, weakness and weakness on weekends.
Dr. Pavlova noted that in addition to the fatigue accumulated over a week, there are many objective reasons for the negative reaction of the body to changing conditions.
On the weekends, our lives change dramatically.
"We sleep for a long time, we lie on the couch all day, most likely we eat more, and we drink less," the doctor argued. - Due to the lack of coffee, a slight breakdown begins.
Because of overeating and lack of water , heaviness and weakness."
An additional role is played by a late rise.
So, if you get up three hours later than usual, then a reaction will occur, which is called jet lag.
It occurs in travelers who cross multiple time zones.
To determine which of the factors plays a decisive role in the deterioration of well-being, Pavlova recommended to trace what changes the most over the weekend.

South African scientists said about the low effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine against "omicron"
In South Africa, announced the low effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine against "omicron"
Scientists in the Republic of South Africa conducted a study and reported on the low effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine against the omicron strain of coronavirus infection.
It is estimated that it (the level of neutralization of "omicron") corresponds to the (level of) effectiveness of the vaccine of 22.5% against infection with symptoms, because of which ... the vaccine's ability to protect against infection is being questioned, according to the text of the study, published on the MedRxiv portal.
At the same time, experts clarified that the drug can save from the severe course of the disease.
Earlier, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted that the omicron strain of the coronavirus could cause a new wave of the pandemic in the UK with more frequent hospitalizations than a year ago.
How much hidden sugar in the usual products?
Sugar is not the best source of beneficial nutrients.
Its excess in the diet can lead to type II diabetes, as well as cause cardiovascular and oncological diseases.
Consumers should take into account that under an unfamiliar word in the composition of the product can be indicated hidden sugar - an ingredient similar to sugar in calorie content, composition and glycemic index.
On the label can be presented several dozen names, in fact, denoting sugar.
Some of the most common and common names are glucose and fructose.
There may also be other hidden sugars such as dextrose (a sugar derived from corn), levulose (fruit sugar), molasses (black molasses), agave syrup, etc.
These are all simple carbohydrates that belong to mono- and disaccharides, and they can be not only in confectionery, but also in ketchup, in doctor's sausage, bread, etc.
As stated in Roskachestvo, the most effective way to reduce sugar intake is to eat whole and unprocessed foods, as well as pay attention to the label and to many different names for sugar.
Different types of sugar differ in taste, but no matter what the ingredient in the product is called - syrup or nectar, processed or unprocessed, brown or white - it is still sugar.
It is not easy to calculate the exact amount of sugar, since it is necessary to take into account not only the amount of sugar indicated by the manufacturer on the package, but also the fact that vegetables, fruits, etc. initially contain a certain amount of sugar.
Thus, the total amount of sugar can be significantly higher than indicated on the label.
German Chancellor Scholz: gas will lose importance for Germany in 25 years
The new Chancellor of Germany Olaf Scholz said that gas imports are losing importance for Germany, as the country continues the transition to decarbonization of the economy.
According to him, Germany plans to completely abandon gas, oil and coal by 2045, becoming a climate-neutral country.
"That is, in 25 years the world will be such that the issue of gas transportation to Germany and Europe will play a different role," the chancellor said.
Scholz noted that Germany continues to be committed to Ukraine transporting Russian natural gas in the future, as at the moment this resource is important for the energy transition.
He recalled that Germany and the United States made a statement in which Berlin's support for the energy transformation of Ukraine was recorded.
Earlier, German Foreign Minister Annalena Berbok said that the certification process of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline continues.
According to the minister, within the framework of coalition negotiations and discussion of the coalition agreement, it was stated that European energy law should be applied to energy projects.
The diplomat also pointed out that the pipeline does not yet "comply with the regulations" of the European Union.

Hackers hacked twitter of the Prime Minister of India
Hackers broke into the Twitter account of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The attackers managed to publish a fake message.
It was reported that India allegedly recognized bitcoin as legal tender, and also that the country has already purchased cryptocurrency.

Representatives of the prime minister said that Twitter quickly reacted - access to the account was restored.
The page of the Prime Minister of India has already been hacked in 2020 and called for donations to the fund using cryptocurrency.
In a referendum in New Caledonia, a majority voted against independence
In New Caledonia, the third referendum, held on 12 December, ended with the same result as the previous two.
According to the first partial results, announced on Sunday, December 12, at noon, the majority of New Caledonia residents voted in a referendum against the independence of their territory.
At the same time, the level of participation in this third vote has become significantly lower than in the previous two.
According to preliminary results published by local authorities, 3.51% (2,755 people) voted "for" the independence of New Caledonia from France, while 96.49% (75,762) voted "against".
Turnout was 43.90%, in total, more than 80 thousand residents of New Caledonia took part in the elections.
As France-Presse comments on these interim results, "the outcome of these elections left no room for doubt," as supporters of independence urged voters not to participate in the vote.
Being the initiators of the referendum, they opposed its holding on December 12, believing that the new outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic in the archipelago prevents a full-fledged and "honest" election campaign.
Thus, this non-participation paved the way for a third victory for supporters of French New Caledonia, following the referendums held in November 2018 and October 2020.
In 2018, 56.7% of residents voted against independence, in 2020 - 53.3%.
As stated by the separatists, they do not recognize the results of the last vote and will challenge them at the UN.
As reported on Sunday, December 12, in the Elysee Palace, French President Emmanuel Macron should speak on the results of this referendum.
The theme of New Caledonia's independence has largely revived the final weeks of France's presidential campaign.
Several presidential candidates have spoken in favor of the territory remaining part of France, as it is "the last region of the European Union's presence in the Pacific."
"New Caledonia must remain French," Eric Zemmour repeatedly repeated.
The same statement was made by the Republican candidate Valérie Pecresse, who in late October published a column in Le Figaro, urging Caledonians to remain French.
For his part, Emmanuel Macron announced in May 2018 that he would not take a position "because it is not his responsibility."
However, the president added: "France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia."
Prime Minister Jean Castex, for his part, expressed "a strong desire that the choice of caledonians be the choice of France."
Sveta, oh, hello!
I'll tell you a little bit... A lot of rude, still embarrassing, ashamed.
Thank you for not turning your back on my channel.

WSJ readers criticized the article about relations between Russia and the United States
Readers of The Wall Street Journal criticized an article by Professor Christopher Hartwell, in which he described his vision of relations between Russia and the United States.
The author of the material expressed concern that the West allegedly sacrifices Ukraine to Russia.
In his article, he convinces readers of the danger that comes from Moscow, and made a number of offensive statements about Russian President Vladimir Putin.
In the end, Hartwell called on Western countries to "present a united front against Russia."
Readers of the WSJ expressed their disagreement with the position of the American professor.
"There is quite a lot of false information in this article," RIA Novosti quoted one reader as saying.
"Europe is not ours to 'lose' it, and Ukraine is not our land.
The U.S. and NATO allies will never go to nuclear war with Russia for Ukraine," another said.
Patches can also be applied to the lips.
Used in the production of Patches Dearboo Peach & Hibiscus Brightening Hydrogel Eye Patch, the hydrogel is a high-tech polymer that provides increased absorption and transfer to the skin of highly concentrated natural plant essence, fits snugly to the skin and gives a feeling of freshness.
When transferring nutrients to the skin, the hydrogel minimizes the concomitant loss of moisture and causes the essence to penetrate into the deeper layers of the skin.

An earthquake of magnitude 5.2 occurred in the area of the Kuril Islands
An earthquake of magnitude 5.2 occurred near the Kuril island of Shikotan.
It is noted that the epicenter of the earthquake was located 231.8 km north-east of the city of Severo-Kurilsk.
The focus lay at a depth of 92.5 km.
Earlier, seismologists recorded an earthquake of magnitude 7.5 in Peru, during which ten people were injured.

Ukraine will begin to produce jet drones of a new generation
The new Ukrainian-Turkish plant will begin to create jet unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) of the ANKA type.
This was announced on December 11 by a freelance adviser to the head of the office of the Ukrainian president, Oleksiy Arestovich.
That is, they are able to act against air objects, against other drones.
Even against manned aviation.
They will have Ukrainian engines and the rest of the Turkish avionics: the hull and the like," Dialog.ua quoted him as saying.
Commenting on the main features of the ANKA devices, Arestovich said that we are talking about jet, not piston UAVs.
According to him, this is a new generation of drones after Bayraktar, which exceed it "in all characteristics."
The first batch of UAVs should be produced by the plant at the end of next year, Arestovich concluded.
The ANKA aircraft was created by the Turkish Aerospace Agency in February 2014 of the year.
The development of the drone has been carried out by the Turkish authorities in cooperation with a number of private companies since 2010.
On the eve of the Ukrainian General Staff classified data on the use of Bayraktar drones and Javelin missile systems during military operations of the joint forces in the Donbass.
On December 6, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that the construction of a plant for the manufacture of modern military drones had begun in the country.
According to him, Ukraine intends to use drones.
On September 29, Bayraktar Savunma and the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense signed an agreement on the construction of a center in the Kyiv region, which will conduct personnel training, as well as testing and maintenance of Turkish Bayraktar UAVs.
The press service of the office of the Ukrainian leader called this memorandum "a big real step forward."
At the airport, two lions escaped from a container
Lions escaped at Singapore's Changi Airport.
This is reported by The Straits Times.
Two predators managed to get out of the container with seven lions, which arrived on one of the planes.
The publication notes that it remains unknown from which country they were brought to Singapore, and where they were going.
One of the runaway lions lay down on the roof of the container.
The animals could not move away from it because of the protective net installed nearby.
The confrontation ended after the arrival at the airport of employees of the organization Mandai Wildlife Group, which manages all Singapore zoos.
They have immobilized the lions with the help of darts with a tranquilizer and plan to take them to a quarantine facility.
Earlier it was reported that in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, the lion ran away from the owner and walked through the streets of the city.
On the same day, the animal voluntarily returned home, people were not injured.
Experts warned about the threat of cancer due to vitamin B9
Research suggests that excess vitamin B9, also known as folic acid, can lead to cancer.
This was warned by the Daily Express.
According to experts, there is strong evidence that people who do not lack folic acid are less likely to develop certain types of cancer, in particular, colorectal.
However, exceeding the required dose, on the contrary, contributes to the growth of cancer cells.
Professor of the University of Alabama at Birmingham, nutritionist Beth Kitchin advises to monitor the amount of folic acid consumed during the day.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms per day.
The threat of cancer increases only if you significantly deviate from this figure upwards or downwards.
Kitchin recommends not taking vitamin B9 tablets without a doctor's recommendation, be sure to monitor the dosage and avoid flakes with milk and other foods that contain folic acid.
Earlier, nutrition consultant Rachel Fine called folic acid a substance that slows down aging.
Since it is, among other things, found in avocados, Fine recommended that men after 50 years of age eat this fruit more often.
In the UK, by April, about 75 thousand people could die because of the omicron strain
Forecasts of British scientists show that due to the spread of the omicron strain of coronavirus in the next five months in England, up to 75 thousand people may die, if restrictive measures are not tightened in the winter.
This was reported by the newspaper The Guardian, citing a study by experts of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), reports TASS.
According to the most optimistic forecast of specialists who are part of the scientific advisory group on emergency situations under the British Cabinet of Ministers, by April 2022 at least 25 thousand deaths due to the omicron strain will be recorded in the country, and about 175 thousand patients will be hospitalized in total.
At the same time, at the peak of the incidence, hospitals will receive more than 2 thousand infected daily.
"Serious measures to combat the coronavirus may be needed to prevent the NHS from being overwhelmed if the omicron strain proves to be more contagious than the delta variant and current vaccines fail to rule out infections," said mathematician Rosanna Barnard of LSHTM.
Earlier, the UK Health Safety Agency informed that if the rate of spread of the omicron strain continues at the current level, then by the end of the year about 1 million cases of infection will be detected in the country.
At the same time, by mid-December, the omicron strain may become dominant in the United Kingdom.
At the moment, 1898 cases of infection with the omicron strain of coronavirus have been detected in the UK, of which 633 have been identified over the past day.
At the same time, on December 9, the head of the British Ministry of Health, Sajid Javid, indicated that in reality this figure could already reach 10 thousand cases.
I wanted to write some clever comment, but I read it to this point:
"A fur coat obtained as a result of the incredible suffering of an unfortunate animal and his employment for a second job."
And it fell under the table!
It turns out that the "unfortunate animal" is the husband, and I thought it was a chinchilla!

Demand for superyachts increased in the world by a quarter
The construction of superyachts this year and orders for next year are breaking all records in the world, despite calls to reduce the hydrocarbon footprint and combat climate change.
In the world register of ships, the number of yachts ordered amounted to 1200 units - a quarter more than last year.
In the era of fighting the effects of climate change for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, it is difficult to imagine that the number of people who have the desire and money for a floating fortress for $ 50 million pounds and above will not decrease, writes "Guardian".
However, there are more and more of them.
This year, 25% more vessels were ordered than in the previous year.
Brokers say there hasn't been such a rush in the market in 20 years.
The first reason is that many who can afford a yacht fear infection on land and prefer to hide from the pandemic aboard their own vessel.
The second reason is also related to the coronavirus.
If earlier all these people went to the office and met with business partners in person, now the vast majority of them work remotely, and negotiations are conducted via Zoom.
Broker Will Christie told the newspaper that shipyards are taking orders for new yachts for 2025 and beyond.
This means that customers are willing to pay more, if only their yacht was ready at least a year or two earlier.
"People just crave freedom, and the super-rich could afford it," he says.
In Western society, many criticize this behavior of the rich and call it decadent.
The rich, sociologists say, do not want to understand that in times of deprivation, traveling to space, living on yachts or flying on their own planes cause irritation in society, since the elite does not want to share responsibility for climate change with the rest of humanity.
Economists are calling on governments to act and proposing new taxes and regulations for the super-rich, although they understand that with such money mobility, it will be extremely difficult to implement.
Meanwhile, only the number of super-yachts ordered is impressive, but also their characteristics.
Of the 1200 vessels, 27 have a stern length above 100 meters.
Norwegian billionaire Rekke is building a yacht REV Ocean with a length of 183 meters.
After launching, it will be the largest yacht in the world.
The yacht has a "lunar pool", as well as a submarine designed to study the depths of the sea.
On existing super-yachts, helicopter sites, open-air cinemas have become commonplace, and on some of them, such as on the yacht of the wrestler McGregor - a platform for martial arts.Professor of Economic Anthropology at the American University in Indiana Richard Wilk says that compared to the total number of greenhouse gas selections, the carbon footprint produced by the super-rich is insignificant.
But it has a symbolic meaning when you consider that there are just over 2,000 multi-billionaires in the world.
This is just another example of overconsumption by a very small group of people.
Scientists have found that the emission trail of billionaires is thousands of times greater than the footprint of the average inhabitant of the planet.
If one person produces an average of 5 tons of CO2 per year, then the largest polluter of the planet Roman Abramovich is responsible for 33.9 tons of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere in 2018.
At the same time, two-thirds of the emission trail fell on his yacht Eclipse with a length of 162.5 meters.
Even if the owner is not on board the yacht, the team continues to poison the planet.
The owner can call the captain and give the command to drive the yacht, for example, from the Mediterranean Sea to the Caribbean.
Superyacht owners don't elicit other people's sympathy when they, like Australia's richest woman, Gina Reinhard, who owns mines on the continent, complain via YouTube that there is no mooring space for their giant ships.
It's also hard to understand her call to build marinas for 50-meter-old vessels.
A dangerous weekly dose of alcohol leading to the development of bowel cancer has been determined
American scientists have determined how much alcoholic beverages per week increases the risk of developing cancer.
This is written by the Daily Express.
Experts came to the conclusion that the use of four or more servings of alcoholic beverages per week is associated with an increased risk of developing oncology.
In this case, the likelihood of developing the disease increases with an increase in the amount of alcohol consumed.
Moreover, moderate drinkers have a higher risk of bowel cancer than women.
The exact reason for the development of this type of oncology, scientists can not determine, noting only that certain factors lead to a detrimental process for the body.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at the level of a two-year-old
Many, or rather all dog lovers are sure that these creatures are very intelligent.
But even they do not realize how four-legged pets are actually developed.
Over the years, biologists have conducted various experiments to find out for sure how developed intelligence in animals is.
Although a dog's vocabulary is not as extensive as a human's, a new study proves that a dog can consistently respond to 89 words or phrases.
The works of scientists were published in the publication Sciencealert.
Dogs cannot play chess or compose poems, do not understand anything about politics, economics and art, meanwhile they often manage to fool their owners.
Representatives of some breeds, experts say, show better results in understanding the words of human language, but statistical data for accurate conclusions are not yet enough.
So, some breeds are traditionally considered dog geniuses - for example, Labradors.
Scientists came to the conclusion that dogs are capable of logical thinking, and the ability to learn is not inferior to a two-year-old child.

In Ukraine, prepared for bargaining the United States and Russia
The United States and Russia will "bargain" over Ukraine's entry into NATO, analyst Alexander Kochetkov said in his article for Glavred.
In his opinion, Washington and Moscow in the near future plan to continue negotiations on the guarantees of the United States that Ukraine will not join the North Atlantic Alliance, despite the words of the American leader Joe Biden about the right of countries to "go anywhere."
If you are offered something obviously unacceptable, well, for example, to sell a close relative into sexual slavery, you will not bargain, but simply send an offerer.
And in relation to Ukraine, bargaining is planned," the analyst wrote.
Kochetkov added that Russia does not plan to attack Ukraine, but seeks dialogue with Kiev.
"Preparations are carried out secretly, quickly and immediately move to offensive actions, and do not wait until the group is detected and deployed by counteraction forces," he said.
China stimulates the development of the railway transport industry
Advanced Chinese technology attracted the attention of companies from the UNITED STATES, Germany, France and other countries at the China International Rail Transport and Equipment Manufacturing Exhibition 2021, held in Zhuzhou, Hunan Province (Central China).
The main technologies developed by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd. allow trains to automatically identify and diagnose technical malfunctions, said Hou Zhaowen, a representative of the company.
High-speed trains running on the China-Laos railway line, which was put into operation earlier this month, are already equipped with these technologies, which will ensure increased reliability and operability of rolling stock.
Over the past six months, China has significantly increased exports of rail vehicles and many countries in Asia and Europe are witnessing "Chinese speed".
In May of this year, the first double-decker high-speed electric trains developed in China, intended for export to Europe, came off the production line of CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd.
With a maximum operating speed of 200 kilometers per hour, these trains will run on the railways of Austria, Germany, Hungary and other European countries.
In November, the trial operation of the metro train developed by the above-mentioned company for Turkey began.
The train will follow the metro line connecting the center of Istanbul with the city's airport.
Traffic on this metro line will be opened next year.
It will be the fastest metro line in Turkey at a speed of 120 kilometers per hour.
"China's railway equipment manufacturing industry is one of the industries with the highest level of innovation and the strongest international innovation competitiveness," said Feng Yaoxiang, head of the Trade and Investment Department of the China International Trade Promotion Committee (ICSRMT).
"This industry is the main competitive advantage of China's production of high-end equipment in the global market," Feng Yaoxiang said.
After more than 60 years of hard work, having conducted a number of independent research and development, China has established an advanced system for the production of equipment for railway transport, with a full range of auxiliary means and with large-scale production activities.
According to Feng Yaoxiang, the country ranks first in terms of the level of electrification of railways and in terms of operational mileage on high-speed and urban railways.
The biologist listed the early signs of dementia
Candidate of Biological Sciences Semyon Golosheikin in an interview with Sputnik radio listed the early signs of dementia.
According to him, signs of future dementia can be forgetfulness, as well as a number of mild cognitive impairments, such as inability to concentrate, plan, a decrease in the level of abstract thinking.
There is currently a debate that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and one of the risk factors for its occurrence, the specialist said.
Golosheykin stressed that the causes of dementia can be neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders, lack of certain vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer's disease and atherosclerosis of the cerebral vessels are the most common causes of this syndrome.
The biologist noted that today doctors do not know effective ways to treat dementia.
Therefore, it is necessary to start its prevention in time.
According to him, learning foreign languages and active communication will help reduce the risk of developing dementia.
WHO also recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regularly training cognitive skills through games and hobbies that require intensive involvement of memory and logic of thinking.
"There are recommendations for the use of various dietary supplements, but their effectiveness and expediency are still being discussed in the scientific community," Golosheikin said.
"The World Health Organization recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regular training of cognitive skills and abilities through games and hobbies that require intensive involvement of memory and the logic of thinking," Golosheikin said.
Earlier, the dementia research charity in the UK said the disease was increasingly affecting people in their 40s.
Doctors called the early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.
The first alarming sign can be considered vision problems, because of which the patient acquires difficulties in recognizing objects.
Another sign of developing dementia, experts called aphasia - a condition when a person cannot find the right words to convey what he wants to say.
Neurologist demanded to send Saakashvili for treatment abroad
Former Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili needs psycho-nervous treatment and rehabilitation abroad, neurologist Otar Toidze, who is part of the council of doctors established under the Georgian Ombudsman, told reporters.
His [Saakashvili's] neurological status is leading in his disease.
Stable problems are problems with movement, coordination, variability of character," the specialist said, noting that this does not go beyond the regulatory framework and now the ex-president needs to be sent to special rehabilitation.
"We call this neurorehabilitation and psychonervous rehabilitation, the possibility of which we did not find in Georgia," Toidze said, demanding that Saakashvili be treated in a special institution that does not exist in Georgia.
On the evening of December 7, Saakashvili began to sabotage the receipt of medical care after prison officers subjected him to disciplinary punishment.
The Georgian politician quickly managed to abolish the punishment and restore himself to his former rights.

Or are we so holy that we eat prana?

These people are parasites on the body of society.
They do not work, do not pay taxes, live on benefits and at the expense of their relatives.
At the same time, they receive full medical care.

We feed all alcoholics, drug addicts, who also lost their health because of their stupidity.
Then we are surprised by the extension of the retirement age.
These amounts could be spent on the treatment of really sick people.

Protests against COVID passports held in Spain
In the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Valencia, protests were held against the mandatory certificate of vaccination against COVID-19, reports Europa Press.
In the Catalan capital, the number of participants in the action was approximately 3 thousand people.
In Barcelona, COVID passports have become mandatory for going to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes and nightlife venues.
Many demonstrators came to the rally without masks.
With slogans on their posters, they accused the state of totalitarianism and called for respect for the choice of citizens.
In Valencia, vaccination passports will also be required to enter entertainment venues and restaurants with a capacity of more than 50 people.
Protesters in this city declared a medical dictatorship, and vaccination was called an experiment.
In Spain, since the beginning of the pandemic, more than 5.2 million cases of coronavirus infection have been identified, more than 88 thousand patients have died.
In Russia, it is also planned to introduce restrictions for the unvaccinated.
The government submitted bills on a unified system of QR codes to the State Duma on November 12.
It is assumed that Russians will be able to visit the venues of mass events, cultural institutions, catering and retail facilities with the presentation of either a certificate of vaccination or a previous disease, or a medical exemption from vaccination.
The same rules will be established for travel by train and plane.

Steep climb: how the Chinese become skiers
The Olympics should attract millions of people to the slopes and help create international resorts in the country
China hopes that the Olympics will not only attract 300 million citizens to winter sports, which will allow to collect the 1 trillion yuan designated by President Xi Jinping, but also contribute to the economic development of backward remote provinces.
Taiwu Ski Resort in Zhangjiakou, located near the site of the Winter Olympics, is becoming increasingly popular with the Chinese.
In addition to the construction of infrastructure in the region, landscaping works are also carried out: workers plant trees.
There are more than 700 ski resorts in the country, but only 20 of them are large enough to host international competitions.
In many regions of China where resorts are located, including Zhangjiakou, there are problems with snow.
The main task for the long term is to provide a comfortable and interesting holiday at Chinese resorts, so that all beginners become regulars.
However, this is still a long way off.
Justin Downs, an adviser on the organization of the Games, says that since his last visit in 2007, the Chinese ski industry has changed beyond recognition.
Every year in winter, more and more Chinese go to the slopes.
Fiona, a snowboarder from Beijing, is one of them.
Despite the major changes, it will take many more years to create a ski culture here, Downes said.
Many resorts are located in agricultural and mining areas.
These regions have yet to be actively developed and the necessary infrastructure for recreation has been created there.
Gao Makong, 70, lives in Chungli, near the venues of the Winter Olympics.
He notes that in recent years there has been a boom in winter sports tourism.
Two years ago, a high-speed railway was built from Beijing to Chungli, now none of the locals suffer without work.
More and more shops selling clothes and equipment for winter sports are opening in the country.
On the slopes open catering points with dishes of national cuisine.
Taiwoo now even has a COVID-19 testing station.
China is striving to create a thriving winter sports industry, its athletes should become leaders in major international competitions, and resorts and equipment should reach the world level.
More than 500 million people in the world may face extreme poverty due to the pandemic, said the WHO
More than 500 million people in the world could be plunged into extreme poverty due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has slowed down human progress on universal access to health services, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank (WB) said.
On the occasion of International Universal Health Coverage Day on 12 December, WHO and WB published two complementary reports.
In them, they stated that the pandemic led to disruptions in the provision of medical services, caused excessive stress in health care systems.
In this regard, for the first time in 10 years, immunization coverage has decreased, mortality from tuberculosis and malaria has increased.
The WHO and the World Bank stressed that the pandemic caused "the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, so it became more difficult for people to pay for treatment."
This situation pushes more than 500 million people "into extreme poverty because they have to pay for these services out of pocket."
In October, UN Secretary-General António Guterres said that the coronavirus pandemic has pushed more than 100 million people into poverty, more than four billion people have almost no social support.

Reuters: Taiwanese minister was disconnected from broadcast at the "Summit for Democracy" at the request of the White House
Taiwan's digital technology minister Audrey Tan's speech at a panel discussion during the U.S.-organized "Summit for Democracy" was switched to a non-video mode, according to a recording of the summit on YouTube.
Reuters, citing sources, claims that the picture was turned off at the request of the White House.
According to them, the reason was the map, on which Taiwan was highlighted in a separate color from the PRC, which considers the island its territory.
The map, which was shown by Ms Tan, was compiled by the South African non-governmental organization CIVICUS and ranked the countries of the world according to the degree of civil rights.
Taiwan was highlighted in green as "free", and the PRC, North Korea, Laos and Vietnam - in red, as "closed".
After the minister showed the map, the picture on her part was replaced by a screenshot with a note that the opinions of the participants in the discussion "do not necessarily express the position of the US government."
The PRC was not invited to the "Summit for Democracy".
Reuters sources note that the map shown by the Taiwanese minister could go against the "one-China" policy, which Washington adheres to.
One of the agency's sources said that after the demonstration of the map, the US National Security Council angrily contacted the State Department, accusing it of showing Taiwan as a separate country.
The Washington-organized "Summit for Democracy" was held from December 9 to 10 with the participation of representatives of 110 countries and territories, as well as civil society associations and charitable organizations.
Russia was not invited to the summit.
During the "zero day" of the summit, Nobel Peace Prize laureate, editor-in-chief of Novaya Gazeta Dmitry Muratov called for the creation of an international fund through which money obtained through corruption would be given to charity.
Earlier today, Deputy Secretary of the Russian Security Council Yuri Averyanov said that the summit carried an "anti-Russian and anti-Chinese charge."
You are served as if they are cooking food, and there is rotten meat everywhere, in fact, the meat to the last piece remains with the butcher.

In addition, it is noted that cities in which land checkpoints are located and which meet certain conditions may consider the possibility of creating buffer zones for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic within their jurisdiction.

The Foreign Ministry told about the "sad conclusion" in relations between Russia and the United States
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov in an interview with Izvestia assessed the prospects for relations between Moscow and Washington.
He noted that the long way of interaction led to sad conclusions, and the problems between the two countries did not begin yesterday.
There is a one-sided negative predictability, but in terms of some prospect of improving relations, everything is completely unpredictable.
This is a sad conclusion after the long journey that we have passed with the current administration, with Trump, and with Obama.
The problems did not start yesterday," the diplomat said.
According to Ryabkov, the problems are connected with the desire of the United States to impose approaches on Russia on many issues.
The deputy foreign minister added that he would not dare to give optimistic forecasts about the prospects for improving relations and would not expect a change in Washington's position.
He explained that with the exception of such areas as strategic stability and cybersecurity, there is no progress.
At the same time, Russia calls on the United States to take a responsible approach to international security issues and hopes that the signals will be heard, and the Americans will listen to the arguments of common sense.
Earlier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov at a meeting with US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said that Moscow is ready to restore dialogue with the United States.
Virologist Warns of Dangers of Covid Nasal Drug Vaccination Outside Hospitals
Those vaccinated with the nasal vaccine against COVID-19 may have allergies and need the help of doctors, so the first points for vaccination with this drug should not be organized at airports and shopping centers.
This was reported to TASS by virologist, corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, head of the laboratory of bionanotechnology, microbiology and virology of Novosibirsk State University Sergey Netesov.
It is easier to organize nasal vaccine vaccination points at airports and shopping centers, but I would do this at first only in medical institutions.
The fact is that the likelihood of an allergic reaction to such a vaccine is there, it is small, but it is desirable that the person then sits next to the doctor's office.
Doctors have special sets of antiallergic drugs that act literally in a minute or two, which is sometimes very necessary," Netesov said.
According to the virologist, it will be possible to think about vaccination in shopping centers when experience in using the drug is accumulated.
He also stressed that when using a nasal vaccine, it is important that it gets on the mucous membrane in the nasal cavity.
At the same time, there is a possibility that the vaccine will not reach its destination if the vaccinated with nasal congestion blows his nose after injection.

Alexander M., Could you please remind me of the style of the marathon at the 2021 World Cup?
Do you see the track that the participants of the race must finish in the classic style?
Attention, the question is - what is Klebo doing to the right of Bolshunov and how does he want to get to the track if he was walking behind on the turn in front of the alignment?
And the "best finisher" at 1.5 km and after 50 km are two different things.
It was a long time ago...
I was, and in fact I wasn't a driver.
I had a license, but I didn't know how to drive.
We offered to go 250 km in one direction on MAZ!
Young, bad, agreed.
The owner is nearby, drinking vodka, I'm going.
First, as king, he took the axial!
A column lined up behind me.
Missed.
Then the belt on the GUR broke.
Then the traffic cops stopped us.
There was a convoy organized, and their car broke down.
Need to be towed.
The owner of the MAZ explained that he was drunk, driving inexperienced.
And to him - how drunk are you?
You don't stumble, you don't fall.
Ahead of us with flashing lights and forward!
In my opinion, it does not come out of the advertisement whether he should grieve.

In the UK, 1239 cases of omicron strain of coronavirus - RT were recorded per day Russian
During the day in the UK, 1239 cases of infection with a new omicron strain of coronavirus were identified.
This is reported by Sky News.
In particular, 1196 new cases of the "omicrone" strain were recorded in England, 38 people fell ill with a new type of infection in Scotland and five in Northern Ireland.
The total number of COVID-19 cases from the new strain in the UK has reached 3137.
Earlier, scientists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in a pessimistic forecast calculated that in England by April, due to the outbreak of coronavirus caused by the omicron strain, 75 thousand people could die.
Peskov warned about the suffering of Western countries that impose anti-Russian sanctions
Press Secretary of the President of the Russian Federation Dmitry Peskov commented on the possible introduction of anti-Russian sanctions in the event of the continuation of "aggressive actions" against Ukraine, including because of the alleged "invasion" of the country.
"It is impossible to impose any restrictions against Russia and not to experience suffering yourself," the official representative of the Kremlin said on the TV channel "Russia 1".
Peskov claims that this is "understood by everyone in the world."
Earlier it was reported that the United States is considering the possibility of introducing anti-Russian sanctions in the energy sector as an extreme measure.
In addition, Washington and the European Union plan to impose restrictions that will be aimed at complicating the conversion of rubles into dollars against Russian banks and the Russian Direct Investment Fund.
At the same time, the head of Sberbank, German Gref, is sure that this is impossible.
From adequate thinking people - appropriately adequate comments!

Ksenia, you do not need to convey anything to my mind, my mind must figure it out for itself!
"Inability of the mind separated from spirit to perceive" - this is what you are talking about?!
Imagine that you need to explain this on the fingers of an unthinking child, how do you do it?!
(Keep in mind that a child under 3-5 years old still has channels of communication with the subtle world, and the child may know more than you!)
The inhabitants of New Caledonia rejected the idea of independence from France
According to the final results of the third referendum on the independence of New Caledonia, the overwhelming majority of participants refused to secede from France.
This was reported on December 12 by the French TV channel BFM. TV.
96.5% of voters voted against independence.
Independence from France was supported by 3.51% of the inhabitants of the archipelago in the South Pacific.
2.99% of the ballots were annulled.
The level of participation in the voting on this day was very low: about 55% of the inhabitants of the archipelago came to the polling stations.
According to experts, the low turnout is explained by the calls of the separatists to refuse to participate in the referendum because of the coronavirus.
Paris refused to postpone the date of the referendum.
In October 2020, the people of New Caledonia voted against independence from France in a referendum.
In 2018, a referendum on independence was already held in the region.
The majority of residents supported the presence of the archipelago as part of France.
New Caledonia is located almost 20 thousand kilometers from mainland France.
In 1853, France declared New Caledonia its possession.
About 270 thousand people live on the archipelago, the territory is endowed with a special administrative-territorial status.
There is a 1998 agreement between Paris and the administration of New Caledonia, according to which the region can organize a vote on its independence twice with a difference of two years.

WHO tentatively considers "omicrone" less dangerous than "delta"
The World Health Organization (WHO) tentatively believes that "omicrone" is less dangerous than the delta strain of coronavirus.
At the same time, there is evidence of a decrease in the effectiveness of vaccines in case of a new variant of COVID-19.
According to information as of December 9, "omicron" is registered in 63 countries.
"Preliminary data and a significantly altered antigenic protein profile of the omicron strain suggest a decrease in the effectiveness of the vaccine against infection and transmission of the variant.
According to preliminary findings from South Africa, it is assumed that it ("the severity of the disease" - ed.) may be less severe than with the "delta", - said in a technical message WHO.
The organization notes that so far all registered cases of infection with "omicron" in the EU are mild or asymptomatic.
At the same time, the new strain, according to preliminary data, spreads faster than the "delta".
In Russia, two cases of infection with the omicron strain have been registered.
They "had previously been immunized," the Gamaleya Center reported.
The head of Rospotrebnadzor Anna Popova said that so far there is no reliable data that the new variant of the coronavirus is less dangerous than the rest.

In Ukraine, called four scenarios for Zelensky
Ex-deputy of the Verkhovna Rada Vadym Denisenko listed four scenarios for the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky in 2022.
In his opinion, the head of state may be left without the support of the West, and also, possibly, will make compromises on the Donbass.
On Sunday, December 12, Denisenko said in a publication on the portal "Glavred".
The first option, which Denisenko called a "perfect storm," assumes that Ukraine will cease to be supported by key Western countries, reaching an agreement on the future of the country without its participation.
Such a development will contribute to the deep crisis that Kiev may face in 2023.
"In parallel, there is a decrease in prices for key goods that we traditionally export <... > internal protests and opposition of the authorities with key FIGs (financial and industrial groups). - Ed.) ", - the ex-parliamentarian added.
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario for the development of the situation - "a war against all."
This forecast will come true in the event of high turbulence in world politics, in which the Ukrainian authorities will face a number of problems.
Because of this state of affairs, the leadership of Ukraine can make compromises on the Donbass, as a result of which a confrontation within the country is possible.
At the end of the summer, Zelensky's position will weaken, the probability of such a situation, according to the former MP, is up to 50-55%.
The third option for the development of the situation in Ukrainian politics is the confrontation of groups of the population who disagree with Zelensky and the president, which is why it is likely to seize control over the power bloc and implement "populist initiatives".
During this version of the crisis, Zelensky will begin to "reformat the government," Denisenko added.
Another scenario is the transformation of Zelensky into the "father of the nation."
This can lead to a certain event that will be a strong shock to society.
"The event should be large enough to provoke a reaction from external partners and lead to an increase in support for Ukraine," Denisenko said.
Such a scenario is possible as a result of a natural disaster, a man-made disaster or russia's aggressive actions, the ex-deputy believes.
At the same time, the Russian side has repeatedly rejected any possibility of an "attack" on Ukraine.
Moscow noted that it is the Ukrainian authorities, NATO and the United States that are increasing military activity near the Russian borders.
Earlier, on November 11, a survey by the sociological group "Rating" showed that the rating of the Ukrainian president fell to record lows, amounting to 19.3%.
This is the lowest figure since his election as head of state.
Analysts predicted a situation in which in the event of the next presidential elections in Ukraine, only 21.8% would vote for Zelensky, while 14.5% would vote for ex-President Petro Poroshenko.
At the same time, among all respondents, only 19.3% expressed support for the president.

Thank you to the author for the story about the great athlete, I did not know that Elena Shushunova died, it is very sad to learn this.
I remember rooting for her at the Olympics in Seoul, for us, the residents of Primorsky Krai, it was a live broadcast, real time.
Such intensity of passions, emotions went through the roof, I remember the joy when Elena won.
They were also happy with the rest of the victories, just as they were rooting for Salnikov, for the players, for all the then Soviet athletes.
On television, I once saw a documentary about one of the Central American countries, and there watermelons were rolled down the ladder on board the ship, like barrels.
The watermelons were monstrous in size.
I myself worked many times in my youth on harvesting and loading watermelons in the Astrakhan region and did not meet watermelons weighing more than a pound.
I buy watermelons weighing 4-5 kg directly from the melons and not earlier than the beginning of August.

The lower part of the cup is reinforced with an inelastic transparent cloth.
The lateral inner part of the cup, in the area of sewing the straps, is reinforced by an inelastic fabric in the fold, without additional seams for comfort.
It is this element that allows the lace not to stretch.
The richness of the lace can be appreciated thanks to the festoon along the neckline and under the breast.
Vertical bones on the side panels of single-layer microfiber do not allow the fabric to twist on large sizes.
I really didn't like the article, evil, poisonous.

The poet arrested for the rally on Red Square: "For the quote of Yevtushenko, 10 days are given, here it is, the power of poetry!"
At the beginning of the week, 21-year-old poet Alexander Volchenkov was arrested for ten days.
A HSE student was detained on Red Square with a poster on which the hashtag #поэтвроссиибольшечемпоэт was written.
This quote belongs to the writer Yevgeny Yevtushenko.
A protocol was drawn up on Alexander under an administrative article on repeated violation of the procedure for holding a public rally.
The first time he was detained on January 23 on Pushkin Square, at a rally in support of Alexei Navalny.
"The goal was to draw attention to poetry in general, now interest in it, unfortunately, has been lost, to the decline of common culture in Russia and also a small hope to inspire unknown poets to write their poems on the Internet under this hashtag," explains Alexander.
We contacted the young poet to find out the circumstances of his detention and to reveal in more detail the message of his message.
How have you been treated by police officers this time and before?
What did the department ask, how did they comment on your action?
This time the officers were more correct, the detention was as polite as possible, no matter how ridiculous it may sound in some context of this word.
On Pushkinskaya they took riot police and took hard.
They asked about motives.
When they heard, in principle, they looked, if not approvingly, then understandingly.
With the exception of the monkey blown on all 4 sides, everything was extremely correct, but I knew what I was going for.
And if after the action under this hashtag they begin to write their poems, at least a few people, I will serve these 10 days not in vain.
Maxim, according to the protocol, speak privately at least in the language of the Tumba-Yumba tribe.
And at public and official events, they speak the language of others, so that everyone understands what happened in the Bundestag on September 25, 2001, or in their native language through an interpreter.

And gradually sell these shares by opening an account in any bank in the world.
Sell not in dollars, but in a currency less dependent on the United States, for example, Swiss francs.

Researchers told how potatoes help in the fight against age-related disorders
The study showed that potatoes are rich in vitamins and trace elements that help improve blood circulation and lower cholesterol levels.
The root vegetable contains vitamins of group B, vitamin C, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, riboflavin, folic and pantothenic acids.
All these elements help the body's systems to function.
In addition, potatoes help in the fight against age-related disorders.
Due to the high content of klechatka, it is useful for the gastrointestinal tract, and with regular use it can also help in the prevention of hypertension and atherosclerosis.
However, for the greatest benefit, the root vegetable is better stewed or boiled, and not fried in oil.
Earlier, The Daily Express warned that potatoes can be dangerous for diabetics, like other foods with a high glycemic index.
These are carbohydrate-dense foods that are quickly broken down into sugars such as sugar, sugary soft drinks, white rice, and white bread.
In early December, the newspaper Kommersant warned of a possible shortage of Russian table potatoes, noting a reduction in its production in personal subsidiary farms and an increase in processing capacity.
According to market participants, the shortage of products at the moment will be able to replace only imports.
Lostfilm, lordfilm and other pirates will be removed from the issuance of "Yandex"
Candidates for departure
In 2015, right holders from the RAEC/Media cluster compiled a list of the 100 largest pirate sites on the Runet and most of them ceased to exist, says Karen Ghazaryan, director general of the Institute for Internet Research.
But some - Kinogo, Lostfilm, Filmix - still managed to survive thanks to the regular change of domain name, he adds.
For example, on Lostfilm, which is available in the search results of both Yandex and Google, you can watch pirated copies of the Netflix series "Squid Game" and "Tenderness" directed by Anna Melikyan - the original series of russia's largest video service ivi (part of the AIV).
On Kinogo, which is also available in the search results, you can watch the animated novelty "Encanto", but, judging by the quality of the video, this is the so-called screen (a pirated copy of the film shot in the cinema).
On Filmix, which can also be found through search engines, the series "Univer. 10 years later" of the TNT TV channel (part of Gazprom-Media).

"This idea developed by the Poles" - it would be more correct to say that Poland only reworked the idea of 1776 for itself, but developed it quite effectively.

Mattress Dimax Micro Ultimate, size 160x190
Orthopedic spring mattress Micro Ultimate.
The model is convenient because it has two surfaces that are different in softness - high hardness and slightly more than average.
The composition of the product includes only high-quality and premium fillers, which have proven themselves exclusively from the best side.
Springs: in the center of the model there is a block of independent springs "micropackage".
This means that the bed has 2000 spirals that work completely autonomously.
It is their functioning that gives a unique point adjustment.
"Micropackage" is the highest frequency of the whole variety of spring blocks "Dimax", therefore it has a pronounced orthopedic effect and is considered premium.
Fillers: combinations of coir and natural latex layers are installed on top and bottom of the springs.
The only difference is the order of the plates.
If one surface has latex, the other has coconut coir.
Such a tandem of fillers has long carried the status of a classic, since it transmits to the mattress not only orthopedic, but also anatomical properties.
If the coir provides the right support for the back, then latex gives an adaptation of the surface to the human body.
Case: The model comes in a quilted knitted case Aloe Vera.
At the request of the client, it can be made both removable and stationary.
The total height of the product is 27 cm, the recommended load on the bed is 170 kg.
Warranty and safety: warranty period – 3 years.
The mattress has received all the necessary certificates and documents that confirm its complete safety and reliability in operation.
The orthopedic foam that is used in the mattress is CertiPUR certified.
Estonian scientists will search for life on Venus
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in collaboration with the Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies, is preparing three space missions to Venus to look for signs of life in the atmosphere, the Actual Camera reported on Sunday.
The purpose of the missions launched in five years is to assess the habitability of the clouds of Venus, and then search for life there.
For the project, Tartu scientists have proposed tools to measure the acidity and oxygen content of Venus' clouds.
Until now, it has been assumed that the clouds of Venus, the planet closest to Earth, are too acidic for life to exist there, but it is likely that Venus was originally an Earth-like planet.
During the third mission, a sample from Venus should arrive.
Suppose that if we find life there, the main question will be whether it is similar to earthly life or different.
If it is very similar, then it will be obvious that terrestrial life did not begin on Earth.
If it is different, then perhaps it will be more likely that life originated on Earth," said Mihkel Pajusalu, head of the Estonian team of the Venus Life Finder project.

Metaverses will change Russian business
The topic of the metaverse became popular this fall when Mark Zuckerberg announced Facebook's transformation into Meta.
For the market, this event was an important signal: the largest player confirmed the development of a new format of digital interaction between people.
This means that business in Russia, as well as throughout the world, will invest in the creation of its own metaverses and their subsequent monetization.
Metaverses should be considered as a continuation of objectively existing trends.
On the one hand, there is a trend towards creating remote interactions in a pandemic, because people are tired of separation and restrictions.
On the other hand, it is a consequence of the desire of business to develop ecosystems and adapt operating models for them.
On the third hand, they are a logical continuation of the trend of digitalization of assets, when any rights, securities, works of art and even money are transferred to a digital format.
Anya, you are right, changing your diet is a conscious process.
When you start eating right, you no longer want something too fatty and harmful.
Of course, we will have a traditional olivier and herring under a fur coat for the holiday, but no one makes me eat everything at once.
You can eat a spoonful, try - and enough is enough.
After all, there are really ten days off ahead, you can cook any delicious and healthy dishes.

British economist could not give a forecast for 2022
British economist Jim O'Neill could not give a forecast for 2022, because, in his opinion, such attempts will turn out to be a failure.
He wrote about this in an article for Project Syndicate.
The expert believes that next year will be full of unpredictability and any trend can change the turnover.
The coronavirus pandemic remains the most important factor, with inflation in second place, he said.
O'Neill also admitted that he did not know whether the increase in prices for goods was temporary or not.
As the expert pointed out, even before the pandemic, it was clear that "the world of endless generosity of central banks has already outlived itself" and it is time to return to a relationship where interest rates, taking into account inflation, will correlate with the expected GDP growth rate.
O'Neill noted that against the backdrop of the pandemic, the continuation of ultra-soft economic policy could, according to some experts, lead to a new surge in inflation.
In addition, attention should be paid to the issue of productivity growth, as well as rising poverty and climate change, O'Neill summed up.
Earlier, the head of the global research department "Otkritie Investments" Mikhail Shulgin said that positive expectations for the dollar exchange rate for 2022 remain, while the growth potential will be less significant.
Among the risks for the dollar, Shulgin called the Fed's monetary policy, the dynamics of oil prices and fears against the background of the coronavirus pandemic.
I have to agree.
But one thing is encouraging: if you compare yourself with yourself, then five years ago there were fewer containers.
It's better now.
There is progress, only sluggish.
There is also such a problem: there are many environmental initiatives in cities, but people do not know about them.
All sorts of eco-taxis that take waste from the house.

Russians gave car dealers about 4.5% of the country's GDP
According to the results of 10 months of 2021, Russians spent 2 trillion 784 billion rubles on the purchase of new cars, which is 28% more than in the same period last year, according to statistics from the Russian Automotive Market Research (NAPI).
To understand the scale, about the same amount (about 3 trillion rubles) was spent by the state to support citizens and the economy during the coronavirus pandemic.
Last September, at a meeting of the heads of the shanghai cooperation organization, President Vladimir Putin said that such an amount is comparable to more than 4.5% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) for 2020.
In terms of revenues in the Russian market, the Korean brand Kia is the leader.
For 10 months of this year, he managed to sell cars worth 325.7 billion rubles, which is almost 24% more than a year earlier.
At Kia's sister brand Hyundai, the increase is even more significant - more than 35%, and revenue from the sale of cars is estimated at 279.3 billion rubles.
In the leading positions, this brand and in terms of increasing the weighted average price of the car - for the year at Hyundai it grew by almost 21%, to 1.94 million rubles - only Changan, Chery, Geely and Mercedes-Benz were stronger than the dynamics of the rise in price.
At the same time, sales volumes of Korean brands did not grow so significantly: according to statistics from the Automobile Manufacturers Committee of the Association of European Businesses in Russia, in quantitative terms, Kia sold 9.4% more cars over the same period than a year earlier.
Hyundai - almost 12%.
Closes the top three in terms of sales in monetary terms, the Japanese Toyota - russians spent 275.5 billion rubles on cars of this brand for 10 months, which is 14% more than a year earlier.
The Japanese are followed by Mercedes-Benz with an indicator of 266.1 billion rubles (+ 75%) - the German premium brand increased both the volume of sales (by 37%) and the weighted average price of the car (by almost 28%, to 8.2 million rubles).
"Mercedes-Benz simultaneously has a good increase in sales and weighted average price - more, for example, than BMW - hence a greater increase in financial capacity," explained TATYANA Arabadzhi, GENERAL Director of NAPI. -
In terms of sales growth, Chinese brands are showing fantastic performance, which have also significantly increased their financial capacity this year."
Russian Lada in terms of the dynamics of income growth shows average market indicators (plus 28%), Russians spent 229.4 billion rubles on cars of this brand for 10 months.
At the level of last year in terms of financial capacity are companies whose sales of cars in pieces in 2021 fell: in particular, Volkswagen, Mitsubishi and Nissan.
UAZ is completely in the red - for 10 months, Russians spent 12 billion rubles on SUVs and pickups of this brand against 12.4 billion rubles a year earlier.
Against the background of problems with the supply of automotive components and interruptions in production that have swept the entire world automotive industry, car companies continue to continuously adjust prices - the same AvtoVAZ increased the cost of Lada models seven times a year, the last rise in price (by 8-10 thousand rubles) occurred at the end of November.
Other automakers regularly rewrite the price tags for their products.
The volume of the Russian car market in monetary terms will increase further - in addition to the shortage of cars, inflation makes its contribution to this, as well as the desire of automakers to win back past losses, experts say.
In the conditions of a shortage of cars, I think that many automakers were even able to partially shift to the consumer the costs of past periods, which they could not lay in the price of cars earlier,
says VTB Capital's analyst for the automotive industry Vladimir Bespalov. -
I believe that financially, automakers are doing very well now, maintaining high sales margins."
An indirect indicator of this is the growth rate of the cost of cars, which is observed during 2021, prices for new cars are growing faster than inflation, the expert specifies.
In the long term, the market will grow both in quantitative terms and in monetary terms, but mainly due to inflation and the complication of the design of the machines themselves, Bespalov predicts.
As supply increases, opportunities for price increases will be limited.
In monetary terms, the Russian car market will continue to grow next year, even if the growth in the cost of cars slows down, automakers will be able to get their income at the expense of volumes, said Sergey Burgazliev, an independent consultant on the automotive industry.
Given the increased demand and insufficient supply, automakers are now striving to get the greatest profit from each car sold, Burgazliev notes. -
An increase in the volume of production of cars is not expected at least in the next six months, while in Russia the excitement is also fueled by the uncertainty of citizens in the future.
Against the background of the current situation in the market, cars turned out to be a good object for investment - a car bought a year ago, even with mileage, can now be sold more expensive than the original cost, the expert states.
Biden spoke about the transfer of the US military to Ukraine in the event of a Russian invasion
The US leadership has never considered sending the US military to Ukraine in the event of an "invasion" by Russia.
This statement was made by US President Joe Biden.
"There have never been such plans," the head of the White House said, answering a journalist's question about whether the United States abandoned such an idea.
Biden noted that in the event of an escalation of the situation around Ukraine, Russia will face economic consequences.
At the same time, he stressed that the United States and NATO have no obligation to use military force to protect Ukraine in the event of escalation.
The American leader also said that the possibility of using American troops unilaterally for the defense of Ukraine is not on the agenda.
Biden explained that if Russia invades Ukraine, the United States will transfer forces to Eastern European NATO countries (Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Estonia).
"We're going to have to send more U.S. and NATO troops to the eastern flank, the B9 — all those NATO countries for which we have a sacred commitment to defend them against any Russian attack," Biden said.
Earlier, the press secretary of the President of Russia Dmitry Peskov stressed that Moscow has no intentions to invade the territory of Ukraine.
At the same time, he pointed out that Moscow sees a problem in the combat use of drones supplied by Turkey by Kiev, as well as in the fact that "American weapons are approaching our territory."
I immediately leave such interviews.
If already at the interview they want to make me listen to screams, wait for hours, drink incomprehensible burda and wash another cup - it is terrible to imagine what will happen at work.
I will find a normal place for myself, without an HR layer, where you immediately talk to the leader.

If a scammer calls from such a number, like an "employee of the Ministry of Internal Affairs" or another law enforcement agency, then it is immediately inefficient to reset, and most likely not to have time to blacklist.
Because to confirm his lies about his involvement in the security forces, he quickly repeats the call and continues to frighten and persuade.
We need more useful recommendations for the people.
That's...
I don't believe it was.
They no longer know what to come up with, who to blame.
We got to the Queen.
And most importantly, in their opinion, everyone is to blame, except for the most...
And it would not be easier to leave people alone from coercion, of course, if our people care.
Maybe all the strains of the virus will disappear...
Like in Japan... before the elections, the influence was weakened and there were fewer infections ...

As the regular friendly meetings of the presidents of Russia, Azerbaijan and Turkey show, in my opinion, you are, to put it mildly, off topic.
Only yesterday, the President of Azerbaijan approved the opening of the azerbaijani-Russian joint venture KamAZ.
