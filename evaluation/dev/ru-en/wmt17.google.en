28-year-old chef found dead in San Francisco mall
The 28-year-old chef, who recently moved to San Francisco, was found dead in the stairwell of a local mall this week.
However, the victim&#39;s brother says he can&#39;t imagine anyone willing to hurt him, remarking, &quot;Finally, things were looking up for him.&quot;
A body found at Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning has been identified as 28-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galicia, the San Francisco Medical Examiner&#39;s Bureau said.
The San Francisco Police Department says the death has been classified as a homicide and the investigation is ongoing.
The victim&#39;s brother, Luis Galicia, told ABC&#39;s KGO channel in San Francisco that Frank, a former takeout line cook in Boston, landed his dream job as a cook at San Francisco&#39;s Sons &amp; Daughters restaurant six months ago.
A spokesman for Sons &amp; Daughters said they were &quot;shocked and devastated&quot; by his death.
&quot;We are a small team that works like a close-knit family and he will be greatly missed,&quot; the spokesman said.
Our thoughts and condolences to Frank&#39;s family and friends during this difficult time.
Luis Galicia said that Frank initially stayed in hostels, but lately, &quot;Finally, things were going well for him.&quot;
&quot;He found an apartment, he dated a girl,&quot; Luis Galicia told KGO.
Luis Galicia said he couldn&#39;t imagine anyone who would be willing to hurt his younger brother.
He had a kind soul and a big heart.
His way of connecting with his family has always been to prepare a meal for us, cook us dinner,&quot; said Luis Galicia.
He never wanted to be involved in any quarrel.
He was a brother who went with the flow.
&quot;For all the bad things that happen to this world, he was that rough diamond that shone bright every day,&quot; he said.
Anyone with information is asked to call the SFPD Hotline at 415-575-4444.

Italy&#39;s public debt rises to record levels
Italy&#39;s public debt in June 2016 exceeded 2.248 trillion euros.
The central bank of the country said that this amount is a historical maximum, reports RIA Novosti.
The previous negative record was set in May of this year.
Then the amount of public debt reached 2.228 trillion euros.
It is noted that in the first half of the year, Italy&#39;s debt burden increased by 77.2 billion euros.
Earlier it was reported that at the end of 2015, Italy&#39;s public debt was 132.7% of the country&#39;s GDP.
Meanwhile, the Italian Minister of Economy and Finance, Pier Carlo Padoan, predicted a decline in this indicator in 2016 to 130.9%, and in 2018 to 123.4% of GDP.
141 victims of the terrorist attack at Domodedovo received payments from the airport.
141 people received charitable payments from the Aviation Fund, which was created by the leadership of the Domodedovo airport to help victims of the terrorist attack in 2011, Interfax reports.
According to airport spokesman Alexander Vlasov, two more applications are currently under consideration.
&quot;The fund continues to make charitable payments to victims of the 2011 terrorist attack and provides comprehensive assistance in resolving existing issues,&quot; Vlasov added, recalling that the fund&#39;s website was created specifically to facilitate interaction with the victims, containing complete information on the procedure for providing charitable assistance.
In 2011, in the arrivals hall of Domodedovo foreign airlines, a suicide bomber detonated an explosive device.
As a result of the attack, 37 people were killed and 172 others were injured.
Scientists have found an animal that can live 500 years
An international group of biologists has concluded that the longest-lived vertebrate animal is the Greenland shark, which can live for about 500 years.
Scientists conducted a radiocarbon analysis of the lens of the eye of 28 Greenland sharks.
The largest shark, which is over five meters long, can be between 272 and 512 years old.
Biologists believe that a low metabolism, which leads to slow development, plays an important role in the shark&#39;s longevity.
Female Greenland sharks reach sexual maturity only by the age of 150.
It was previously believed that the &quot;neighbor&quot; of the shark, the bowhead whale, lives the longest of all vertebrates.
The oldest individual known to scientists was just over 210 years old.
Putin changed the composition of the Security Council of the Russian Federation.
Russian President Vladimir Putin, by his decree, made changes to the composition of the Security Council of the Russian Federation, the Kremlin press service reported.
Earlier it became known that Putin removed the head of the presidential administration, Sergei Ivanov, from his post, and Anton Vaino was appointed his successor.
Ivanov will now work as the president&#39;s special envoy for environmental protection, ecology and transport.
Deputy Secretary of the Council Rashid Nurgaliyev was expelled from the permanent members of the Security Council of the Russian Federation.
The council includes Sergei Ivanov, Anton Vaino, presidential envoy to the Siberian Federal District Sergei Menyailo and envoy to the Northwestern Federal District Nikolai Tsukanov.
Sergei Ivanov has been relieved of his post as head of the presidential administration.
By presidential decree, Sergei Ivanov was relieved of his post as head of the Kremlin administration.
Ivanov was appointed special representative of the Russian Federation for environmental protection, ecology and transport.
Anton Vaino, who previously served as Sergei Ivanov&#39;s deputy, has been appointed the new head of the administration.
According to Vladimir Putin, Ivanov himself asked him to be transferred to another job.
Is it worth going to a sanatorium if there are no health problems?
Our expert is the head doctor of the sanatorium Olga Bogush.
And if a person is healthy, just tired of work, should he go to a sanatorium?
We need sanatorium-and-spa rest not only for treatment, but also for the prevention of diseases.
In the conditions of a sanatorium, a person can check the state of his body and receive doctor&#39;s recommendations on how to live so that his health does not collapse.
Such recommendations will not be superfluous to anyone.
&quot;Just tired of work&quot; is an important signal of the body, you should not dismiss it.
Constant stress, mental and physical overwork can lead to depression and chronic fatigue syndrome.
And stress is experienced by about 90% of visitors.
Moreover, people from large cities aged 45 to 55 are most susceptible to it.
So it’s better not to complicate the situation and give yourself time to relax.
Studies show that 98% of people reduce their biological age during their stay in a sanatorium.
Modern sanatoriums offer a comfortable stay for the whole family.
So, if you want to spend your holidays with your kids, you won&#39;t have to leave them.
For children, even the smallest ones, wellness programs are provided, which include both diagnostic services, pediatrician consultations, tests, and treatment.
For example, swimming (many resorts have children&#39;s pools), inhalations, a special diet, massages, oxygen cocktails, physiotherapy exercises.
The course of procedures is determined by the doctor, taking into account individual indications and characteristics of the growing organism.
In addition, in sanatoriums, as a rule, there is a children&#39;s club with animators, where children can attend game classes, various master classes.
Some sanatoriums open their doors even for guests with babies, provide babies with the necessary conditions and provide experienced babysitting services.
Mild winters, long summers, an abundance of sunny days a year (over 300) create good conditions for year-round recreation in the resorts of Caucasian Mineralnye Vody.
And then the body needs rest not only in summer.
So do not be afraid of the weather outside the window, especially since most of the procedures are carried out indoors and do not depend on the season.
In general, spa treatment is desirable to be carried out 2 times a year, especially for people of mature age.
The main feature of the region of the Caucasian Mineral Waters, of course, is the healing mineral springs: Slavyanovsky, Smirnovsky, Essentuki, Narzan.
Their waters have unique properties and affect various body systems.
Water differs in temperature, amount of salts, total mineralization, chemical and gas composition.
The doctor selects water depending on the patient&#39;s well-being.
So, &quot;Narzan&quot; has anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory effects, restores the functions of the gastrointestinal tract and metabolism.
&quot;Essentuki‑4&quot; affects the gastrointestinal tract, lowers sugar levels.
&quot;Essentuki new&quot; has anti-inflammatory, choleretic and diuretic effects.
The water &quot;Slavyanovskaya&quot; has the same effects.
When prescribing water, the doctor must take into account the state of the cardiovascular system.
If there are signs of hypertension, he picks up less salty water, because salts retain fluid, which leads to an increase in pressure.
The intake of mineral water requires compliance with the regime: water should be drunk at a certain time, in the right amount and at a specific temperature.
Now in sanatoriums various cosmetic procedures for the face and body are also available.
What types of health improvement, based on the natural features of the North Caucasus, can be obtained at the resorts of this region?
Near Pyatigorsk, for example, there is a salt lake Tambukan, silt mud from which is good for the joints, spine, and internal organs.
It has an anti-inflammatory, resolving, immunomodulatory effect.
These are wellness walks on individually compiled routes.
They are especially popular in Kislovodsk, where there is a huge Kurortny park (the second largest in Europe).
Popular in Kislovodsk, which is located in close proximity to the mineral spring &quot;Narzan&quot;.
There you can also take wine, pearl, iodine-bromine, selenium, sage-licorice baths, depending on what the doctor prescribes for you.
Let&#39;s keep fruiting.
What can be done so that the harvest goes until the end of the season?
Yulia Belopukhova, agronomist and summer resident, tells.
It is time for tall tomatoes to arrange a haircut: remove new stepchildren, cut off the tops, remove all leaves to the penultimate brush with fruits and inflorescences with small ovaries - they will not have time to ripen.
We feed all tomatoes, regardless of the &quot;constitution&quot;, as well as peppers and eggplants with an ash-superphosphate extract, treat them with biological products (Ripener - to accelerate the filling and growth of fruits, Fitosporin-M, Fitolavin, Gamair, Bactofit - from diseases, Immunocytophyte - to increase immunity, Bitoxibacillin, Lepidocid, Fitoverm - if there are pests).
Of the chemicals at the end of summer, it is worth using only copper sulfate, colloidal sulfur and green soap.
We do the last watering of plants.
We lower long-climbing cucumbers in the greenhouse from the trellis so that the lower, bare part of the stem (25-40 cm) lies on the ground, pour warm water and Zircon solution, sprinkle the stem with 5-7 cm of compost.
Prolonging the fruiting of zucchini is also easy: cut off old leaves, pour warm water and a solution of complex fertilizer, pour fertile soil under the bush.
To protect against night cold, install arcs with covering material over the bed.
Keep the plants open during the day, and close after sunset.
Signs of the end.
What indicates that Russia is emerging from the crisis?
Economists have seen signs of Russia emerging from its longest recession in twenty years.
According to analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, Russia&#39;s GDP is showing a positive trend - in the second quarter, GDP fell by 0.8% in annual terms.
This figure is the lowest since the beginning of 2015.
According to the latest data from Rosstat, the decline in the Russian economy slowed to 0.6% in the second quarter.
The Central Bank and the Ministry of Economic Development have also recently announced stabilization of the situation.
Slow growth ahead.
According to CBR experts, the recession in the Russian economy is a thing of the past.
&quot;The index assessment of Russian GDP suggests that the recession is behind us, and slow economic growth is ahead,&quot; says the Bulletin of the Bank of Russia &quot;What Trends Say&quot;.
The regulator&#39;s specialists raised the modular estimate of GDP for the current quarter to 0.4%, the estimate for the fourth quarter is 0.5%.
According to a representative of the Ministry of Economic Development, during the second quarter, the decline in Russia&#39;s GDP stopped in the second quarter, amounting to 0.2%.
In the second quarter, the seasonally adjusted decline in GDP was 0.2% qoq.
But during the quarter, the decline stopped: in April it amounted to 0.2%, and in May and June, the change in GDP was in the range of 0-0.15,&quot; RIA Novosti quotes a representative of the MED.
The slowdown in the rate of decline of the Russian economy over the past five quarters indicates that &quot;the bottom has been passed.&quot;
Among other markers pointing to signs of recovery in the national economy, Bloomberg names the growth in demand for electricity and rail transportation, business recovery.
If we make an adjustment for the fact that the year is a leap year, then it is clear that the dynamics of plus 1% of electricity consumption can be half due to an additional working day.
Add to this the lower average annual temperature in the first quarter.
The next argument is the growth in freight traffic, but it is difficult to get accurate data here, and plus or minus 0.5% of the semi-annual volume can also be explained by seasonality,&quot; explains Kirill Yakovenko from ALOR BROKER.
However, there are other, more obvious signs of stabilization of the Russian economy.
For example, reducing price pressure.
In July, the consumer price index was 7.2% compared to 15.6% in the same month last year.
Moreover, the last two weeks Rosstat fixes deflation.
Prices in Russia fell for the first time in five years.
If you look at the dynamics of the ruble exchange rate, which, although it showed strong fluctuations at the beginning of the year, has appreciated by 12% since the beginning of the year in August.
This is also one of the signs of recovery, which should be followed by indicators from the real sector of the economy,&quot; Yakovenko emphasizes.
In addition, since April in the Russian Federation there has been an increase in industrial production.
In June, the index rose by 1.7%.
The rate of decline in foreign trade turnover is slowing down from -32.8% in January 2016 to -20.7% in May.
Positive dynamics is also demonstrated by the situation in the labor market, where the unemployment rate fell to 5.4%.
It was lower only in September 2015 (5.2%).
Despite the favorable situation in the labor market, the issue of real disposable incomes of the population leaves much to be desired.
In annual terms, the indicator is reduced by 4.8%.
This factor may slow down the economic recovery, as household spending makes a significant contribution to GDP.
As a rule, their share in the structure of the economy exceeds 50%.
In addition to low consumer activity, the tough policy of the Bank of Russia can also be cited as risk factors for economic growth.
The regulator keeps the rate at 10.5%, which does not have the best effect on the real sector.
The insufficiently high level of investment is also a negative factor, which hinders the development of industrial potential.
But in general, we can assume that by the end of the year the rate of decline in the Russian economy will slow down to -0.5% against -3.7% in 2015,&quot; says Irina Rogova, analyst at Forex Club.
The process of naturalization of athletes, recently launched in Russian football and well established in winter sports at the Sochi Olympics, is not yet as actively developed in summer sports.
If former foreigners compete for Russia in the Olympic Games in Rio, then in most cases we are talking about natives of countries - the former republics of the Soviet Union.
But in Rio de Janeiro, we can observe the reverse process - a fairly large number of Russians perform under the flags of other states.
In each case, the history of the change of citizenship is different.
Someone&#39;s parents were taken to another country as a child, leaving no choice.
Someone could not stand the competition for a place in the Russian team.
And someone thought that better conditions for development in sports would be created abroad.
AiF.ru found at least 16 athletes who decided to change their Russian citizenship.
The German passport of a 27-year-old girl says that her name is Lisa Ryzhykh.
But earlier she was, of course, Elizabeth.
She was born in 1988 in the city of Omsk.
Just four years later, as soon as the Soviet Union collapsed, Lisa&#39;s parents decided to emigrate to Germany.
The girl had no choice.
There she decided to follow in the footsteps of her older sister - to take up athletics.
Just like her sister, Lisa chose pole vaulting.
If she had stayed in Russia, she would hardly have been able to &quot;move Elena Isinbayeva from the throne.&quot;
Unfortunately, at the Rio Olympics, Lisa will be our only compatriot, albeit a former one, in the pole vault sector.
Her best achievements in this sport are the bronze of the European Championship in 2010 and the silver of the continental championship in 2016, which she won again in the absence of Elena Isinbayeva.
Elena Pirozhkova, 29, was born in Novokuznetsk in 1986.
Her parents are evangelical religious propagandists.
Largely because of their faith, they left for the United States when the girl was only three years old.
In addition to Elena, eight more children grew up in the family.
They all lived in the small town of Greenfield, Massachusetts.
Lena began to get involved in wrestling at school.
Showing good results, she moved to the city of Colorado Springs, where she continued her studies at the US Wrestling Training Center under the guidance of another former Russian, Vladislav Izboynikov.
At the 2012 Olympics in London, Elena lost in her first fight.
But at the World Championships in the same year - a victory.
Before that, by the way, she managed to win silver at the 2010 world championship.
This was followed by bronze in 2013 and silver in 2014.
26-year-old Maria was born in the city of Yaroslavl, where she first got acquainted with synchronized swimming.
But to say that our coaches in Russia brought her up would be wrong.
Soon the girl&#39;s family decided to emigrate to the United States and settle in the city of Colorado.
There Mary continued her studies.
Soon she was already a member of the US team and showed excellent results at the Pan American Games.
It is clear that at a serious international level she cannot compete with Russian synchronized swimmers, but for America her performance is the ceiling.
A new name, which sounds strange in Russian, Christina Shaldybina received at the age of 11, when her parents decided to continue teaching the girl rhythmic gymnastics overseas.
Until that moment, the girl was engaged in her favorite sport in her native Yaroslavl.
Having emigrated to the USA, she quickly entered the youth team of this country, and later broke into the main national team.
At the Pan American Games, 19-year-old Kristen won gold and silver.
Of course, she didn’t have to fight for the first positions on the world stage, but for the USA she organized a real breakthrough - she brought the star-striped team to the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Another of our former &quot;artists&quot; is Yana Berezko-Marggrander, who plays for the German national team.
Yana was born in Tolyatti.
In 2008, when the girl was 13 years old, the family decided to move to Germany - there the girl had more prospects to get into the national team.
Soon she was already representing her country at the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
There, however, Yana was able to take only 17th place, which is not enough to get into the finals in the individual championship.
But two years before that, she managed to win the bronze medal of the Olympic Games - youth.
Another gymnast, only this time a sports one - Irina Sazonova.
If the emigration paths of the previously mentioned athletes can be called standard, then the choice of Irina&#39;s family is very unusual - Iceland.
Ira is a pupil of the Volgograd sports school.
Naturally, in Iceland, she immediately became the champion of the country.
True, Ira still trains in Russia - she specially comes to her homeland so as not to lose her skills.
In Rio, she did not perform as well as she would like.
The best place is 40 in the individual all-around.
There is very little information about swimmer Maria Ugolkova in the Russian information space.
Maria has been living and training in Switzerland for a very long time.
However, for a long time she competed under the Russian flag, showing good results - there was even a country record in the 200-meter butterfly.
In 2015, she received Swiss citizenship and began to compete under the red and white flag.
In Rio, her best performance was 14th in the 4×100 medley relay.
To get to the games, the girl launched a crowdfunding project, thanks to which she was able to raise about 6 thousand francs, which allowed her to pay for the preparation for the Olympics.
31-year-old freestyle wrestler Adam Batirov spent almost his entire career under the Russian flag.
During this time, a native of Khasavyurt managed to become a three-time winner of the European Championships, the champion of Russia, a master of sports of Russia of international class.
When he stopped getting into our national team, it was time to think about changing citizenship.
For several years, a talented wrestler disappeared from sports platforms.
A triumphant return took place at the 2016 Asian Championships - Batirov already represented Bahrain, for which he won a gold medal and received a ticket to the Rio Olympics.
About another ex-Russian, Mikhail Kudinov, even less is known at home than even about the Swiss swimmer Maria Ugolkova.
The fact is that his parents emigrated from Vladivostok to New Zealand when the boy was very young.
It was there that Mikhail began to do gymnastics.
He did not achieve great success at the international level.
In Rio, his best result was 40th in parallel bars qualification.
But for New Zealand, even getting to the Olympic Games in gymnastics is already a breakthrough.
When Nastya, who was born in Moscow in 1985, was only 9 years old, her family emigrated to Israel.
There, the girl continued her synchronized swimming lessons, showing good results at the national level.
In 2014, at the European Championships in Berlin, the girl took 6th place in synchronized swimming.
In a duet with Evgenia Tetelbaum, Anastasia took eighth place.
In the solo program, she was fifth.
Like Anastasia, 23-year-old Dmitry Kroiter plays for the Israeli national team.
When the boy was only 6 years old, his mother decided to immigrate to Israel.
In 2009, at the age of 17, Dmitry already became the champion of the country.
In the same year, he won the World Youth Championship.
A year later, Kroyter also won gold at the Youth Olympic Games in Singapore.
In addition to high jump, Dmitry is engaged in long jump and triple jump.
31-year-old Albert is another native of Khasavyurt, who, after long performances for Russia, decided to change his sports citizenship.
However, unlike Batirov, Albert chose Romania, which he will represent in Rio.
In Russia, he played for the School of Higher Sportsmanship of Krasnoyarsk, in 2011 he even became the champion of the country.
28-year-old Oleg Antonov was born in Moscow in the family of the player of the USSR national volleyball team Yaroslav Antonov.
Literally a year before the birth of his son, Yaroslav was recognized as the best volleyball player on the planet.
Soon he decided to continue his career in Italy.
The family stayed there permanently.
In 2015, as part of the national team, he became the bronze medalist of the European Championship, held on the territory of his new homeland.
Khadzhiev was born in Chechnya in 1994 and ended up with his family in the midst of the war.
Ten years later, the parents decided to emigrate.
The original goal was Norway, but it was not possible to get into this northern country - I had to go to France, to Nice.
There Zelimkhan continued to study freestyle wrestling.
Soon he won the world championship among juniors, and later qualified for the Olympic Games.
In Rio, he will be the only representative of France in the wrestling tournament.
And again freestyle wrestling, and again a former Russian.
This time we will talk about a native of North Ossetia who emigrated to Spain - about Taimuraz Friev.
At the end of December 2012, he was granted Spanish citizenship, and currently he plays for the national team of this country.
Before that, however, the 30-year-old athlete managed to score high results in Russia.
He became the bronze medalist of the national championships in 2007 and 2008.
Tired of not getting into the national team, Taimuraz decided to change his sports citizenship.
The last on our list is a Chechen boxer, born in 1995 in the capital of Dagestan, Makhachkala, Artur Biyarslanov.
When the boy was ten years old, his parents took his family through Azerbaijan to Canada.
There, Arthur, on the advice of his older brother, began boxing.
Since then, Arthur has become the champion of Canada three times, and in 2012 he became the world champion among youth.
In 2015, Biyarslanov won the Pan American Games gold, the first for his new homeland since 1975.

Married, has a son.
Why do children need Cossack classes in schools?
According to Governor V. Kondratyev, &quot;Cossacks should be brought up not by actions and parades, but systematically.&quot;
They must grow up and understand at least from the age of 7 that they are Cossacks and education should be Cossack.
But so far, this work, it seems to me, is being carried out formally and, I suspect, more on paper.
If the Cossack classes absorb all the positive things that have been accumulated earlier, at a qualitatively new level, I will be glad.
If everything is in a hurry and no one knows how, the new idea will turn into cheap populism.
Housing and communal services continues to be one of the most criminal sectors of the country&#39;s economy.
There are encroachments on the funds allocated for the needs of the communal sector from the budgets of different levels.
According to the Prosecutor General&#39;s Office, inflated tariffs are one of the most common crimes in the housing sector.
As a result, consumers in the region overpaid energy companies more than 170 million rubles.
Recently, the prosecutor&#39;s office of the Krasnodar Territory revealed the facts of including unreasonable costs in the tariffs.
And the expenses of IV-consulting LLC (supplies cold water) included 4 million rubles. for car rental at a price higher than the market price.
And there are many such examples throughout the country.
The people give their last money for the &quot;communal&quot;, and they pay regularly - according to the Ministry of Construction of the Russian Federation, the average collection of payments from the population is 94%.
He is accused under several articles of the Criminal Code at once: embezzlement, legalization of proceeds from crime, abuse of power, etc.
According to the investigation, as the head of the fund, which was engaged in the repair of urban facilities, Makarov entered into contracts with entrepreneurs, the work on them was not actually carried out, but paid.
Businessmen simply returned most of the money to him.
And as the owner of the Criminal Code, Makarov collected money from the population, but did not pay service providers and spent it on his own needs.
As a result, the damage to the budget and residents is millions of rubles.
Makarov&#39;s scheme of machinations, alas, is typical for Russia.
A whole wave of arrests and detentions of the heads of the Criminal Code, who embezzled money from citizens, swept across the country.
In Kamchatka, the trial of A. Kokhan continues, by the way, also a former deputy of the City Council, who is accused of fraud for 91.7 million rubles.
According to investigators, in 2012-2013. in Yelizovo, Kamchatka Territory, he established 6 management companies and created 3 limited liability companies.
One of them performed contract work for the management company, the other two played the role of cash settlement centers, that is, they accepted money from the population.
However, A. Kokhan did not transfer funds to power engineers, but spent them on himself, his beloved.
Litigation in the housing sector is quite difficult.
Cases are not initiated, they are dragged out.
And the extremely confusing housing legislation “helps” in this,” says Svetlana Razvorotneva, executive director of NP ZhKKH Control.
We do not have time to work one law, as we come up with a new one, which should make the previous one work.
There are also few specialists, including among judges, on housing and communal services.
Lawyers themselves admit that very little attention is paid to housing law in universities.
The Prosecutor General&#39;s Office is also talking about refusals to initiate criminal cases, about red tape in the course of investigations.
Of the 3,500 crimes in progress in 2015, less than half were sent to court.
For the rest, the investigation took on a protracted nature, and every fifth was suspended due to the failure to identify the accused person.
Often shortcomings in the activities of law enforcement agencies are written off by them as gaps in the current legislation.
There is a law, but the bodies of inquiry are in no hurry to initiate and investigate such cases.
In the second half of 2015, there were about 230 reports of fakes - only 60 criminal cases were initiated.
For 5 months of the current year, their number increased only slightly - 99.
And what is the falsification of the minutes of the meeting of tenants?
This means: a change in the management of the house, financial and other issues bypass the opinions of the owners.
It also means that normal companies that want to work honestly and not &quot;milk&quot; the population cannot enter the housing and communal services market.
It turns out that the residents are in the red, as well as small and medium-sized businesses.
First of all, by eradicating corruption as such throughout the state, - Anton Zharkov, a member of the State Duma Committee on Property Issues, is sure.
And now this work is actively carried out.
These are not just isolated actions - this is a purposeful course towards the fight against corruption.
Of course, not all regions have such a sad situation.
In particular, there is no smell of scandals in the capital.
Why are there no such scandals in the housing sector in Moscow as in many other regions?
Yes, because the city government showed an iron will and put things in order, - Anatoly Vyborny, a member of the State Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption, told AiF.
I mean the personnel issue, and legislative amendments, and legal education.
Management companies are closely supervised, and all of them have gone through licensing.
Citizens&#39; complaints are promptly resolved in the public space (both residents&#39; appeals and response measures are posted on the Moscow government portal).
Many do not just pay monthly receipts, but carefully monitor what is written there, how the house is maintained.
Awareness among the population about the rights of owners and obligations of resource-supplying and managing organizations is very high.
Plus, Moscow is checking the validity of tariffs for housing and communal services - after all, a considerable part of the budget funds goes to subsidies and benefits for numerous categories of the population.
Probably, all this together explains the calm situation in Moscow.
It turns out that everything rests on the will of the regional authorities?
Maybe the weak-willed should change jobs?
Turkish gambit.
Will Erdogan be able to abandon friendship with the EU and the US?
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan issued an ultimatum to the US, offering to choose between Turkey and Fethullah Gülen, an Islamic cleric accused of masterminding the coup.
He stated this while addressing his supporters in Ankara.
Erdogan urged the Americans to stop supporting the &quot;fethullahist terrorist organization.&quot;
This is not the first statement from Turkey calling for the US to change its position.
Experts believe that the split in Turkey&#39;s relations with the West is growing and may lead to a new attempt to change power in the country.
&quot;Sooner or later, America will make a choice between Turkey and FETO (Fethullahist Terrorist Organization).
Either organizing coups FETO, or democratic Türkiye.
She must make this choice,&quot; Erdogan&#39;s address was quoted by the Anatolian Agency as saying in Ankara on Wednesday evening.
The President of Turkey once again, but more severely, demanded that the United States fulfill his demand, voiced by him for the first time immediately after the suppression of the rebellion.
Recall that on the night of July 16 in Turkey, high-ranking representatives of the Turkish army made an attempt to overthrow the legitimate government in the country, and an attempt was made on the life of the head of state.
However, after Recep Erdogan addressed the population, the rebellion was suppressed, and its organizers and participants were arrested.
In total, about 8 thousand people fell under suspicion, in whose ranks, in addition to the military, there were teachers and scientists.
According to Recep Erdogan, their mentor was Fethullah Gulen, who lives in Pennsylvania in the United States.
Erdogan&#39;s supporters also admitted that the Americans could be directly involved in the coup.
The United States denied all claims against them, refusing to extradite Gülen and advising them to change their tone.
The last statement of representatives of the State Department on this matter was made at the time of Erdogan&#39;s visit to St. Petersburg last Tuesday.
However, this does not stop the Turkish president - he stubbornly insists on his own and also puts forward demands on his other Western partners.
&quot;Ankara will cease to fulfill its obligations under the migration agreement with the European Union if Brussels does not name a date for the abolition of visa restrictions for Turkish citizens,&quot; Turkish Minister for EU Affairs Omer Celik said on August 9.
According to him, Ankara&#39;s introduction of changes to the anti-terrorist law, as required by the EU, will jeopardize Europe&#39;s own security.
It should be noted that on August 1, German Vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel demanded that Turkey stop blackmailing the European Union with promises to open borders for migrants in order to achieve visa facilitation with the EU.
His words were a response to a corresponding statement by Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu.
Cavusoglu made another provocative statement last Wednesday, admitting that Turkey could withdraw from NATO.
The head of the Turkish Foreign Ministry did not rule out that the country would consider leaving the alliance if it did not meet with the expected support from it.
The decision to increase defense cooperation with Russia is not a move against NATO.
There are NATO countries cooperating with foreign states in the defense sphere - they import missiles,&quot; Cavusoglu said in an interview with Anadolu agency.
According to him, Turkey now needs to create its own defense system based on its technologies, as well as cooperate with other countries.
&quot;Until now, Turkey has tried to cooperate with NATO member countries, but the results did not satisfy us, and we began to look for others,&quot; the minister said.
Experts believe that all this indicates serious disagreements between Turkey and the West and the reorientation of the country to the East.
The head of the International Institute of Political Expertise, Yevgeny Minchenko, believes that Recep Erdogan is now playing his own game and cannot go into a tough confrontation with the West.
He has a lot to do with the West, both in terms of business and military (Turkey is a member of NATO), so I think that Erdogan will try to balance, maintaining frame relations with the West.
Although, of course, it would be more convenient for the Americans to see a completely obedient person in this post,&quot; the expert explained to AiF.ru.
According to him, it is possible that after the statements of the Turkish leader (about the non-payment of EU compensation, the demand for a visa-free space with Europe and the extradition of Gülen from the United States), he will be put under pressure.
&quot;Recep Erdogan will face a deterioration in relations with both America and the European Union, and they will put pressure on him precisely on humanitarian issues, for dictatorial methods of governing the country, and so on,&quot; Minchenko said.
The head of the Center for Political Information, Aleksey Mukhin, admits that the Turkish president will change his point of view in relations with Russia as soon as it becomes profitable for him.
Eight months ago, Erdogan took an extremely tough stance against Russia and sought the favor of the West in every way.
In a very short time, the situation has reversed.
There are no guarantees that after some time the Turkish president will not change his priorities again.
I think Erdogan has entered a period of shuttle diplomacy.
Caught between two poles - the West and Russia, he will try to get the maximum benefit for himself,&quot; Mukhin said.
In his opinion, the main task for the Turkish president today is to retain political power in the country, and for this he needs Russia and partnerships with Vladimir Putin so that the United States stops supporting Gülen.
Turkey is needed by both the EU and the United States, which, with the help of it, control the situation in Syria and the Middle East.
Therefore, a consensus with Turkey will be reached,&quot; the expert believes.
Anna Glazova, head of the Center for Asia and the Middle East, has a different point of view.
Now Turkey&#39;s relations with both the EU and the US are quite tense, and this is primarily due to the domestic policy pursued by Erdogan personally.
I think that this crisis in relations will worsen, and against the background of this crisis, the Turkish leadership will try to reset the policy both in the Middle East and in relations with Russia.
It is no coincidence that the President of Turkey, as well as a number of Turkish politicians, declare that they are ready to change their position on a number of issues on Syria, relations with Israel have been settled, and active political interaction with Iran is underway,&quot; Glazova explained to AiF.ru, admitting that Erdogan&#39;s next step will be to normalize relations with Egypt.
According to her, the policy that Erdogan is now pursuing is a return to the course of the foreign policy concept that Turkey followed before the start of the Arab revolutions.
“It was then that, in the position of “zero problems with neighbors,” Turkey began to actively develop its relations with the Middle East and the Asian region.
Now there have been very successful visits of the President of Turkey to Russia and African countries.
Therefore, this vector of foreign policy will develop and contribute to the strengthening of Turkey&#39;s position both in the regional and international arena,&quot; the expert believes.
Glazova believes that it will be incredibly difficult for Turkey to return to its previous relations with the EU, now the question is rather whether the EU will begin to respond harshly to Turkey, which can open borders for migrants and thereby create serious problems for Europe.
Junior doctors strike: Calls for new collective protests
Representatives of junior doctors asked the union to sanction new collective protests in their dispute over a new labor contract.
The Junior Physicians Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) is going to ask its full advice to support more collective protests from early September.
JDC says ministers were unable to answer questions about the employment contract.
Junior doctors and medical students in July voted to cancel the labor contract deal negotiated with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members participating in a secret ballot.
In a letter to members posted on Twitter Thursday night, JDC Chair Ellen McCourt said the government continued to be &quot;stubbornly silent&quot; about the issues she said led to the rejection of the employment contract.
She said, &quot;Given the current environment, the JDC Executive has voted to reject the proposed new employment contract in its entirety and has called for a formal renegotiation on all of your issues.&quot;
In response to the government&#39;s silence, the JDC chief today made a formal request for an extraordinary meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing program of expanding collective protests starting in early September.
The dispute has led young doctors to take part in six strikes this year, including the first general strikes in NHS history.
The leader of the BMA junior physicians, Dr. Joan Malawana, resigned after voting to cancel the agreed terms of the employment contract that the BMA had recommended.
He told BMA members that the deal was a good one that should be accepted during meetings ahead of a vote by 54,000 junior doctors and medical students.
Following the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said the contract would be used for health workers in England.
Russia and Türkiye: &quot;Alliance of the Bad&quot;?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and declare an official end to an eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of the palace in St. Petersburg, I got the strong impression that Ankara wanted this reconciliation more.
There was a handshake, yes.
But Mr. Putin&#39;s smile looked forced, and he barely radiated warmth, even by his own reserved standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, by contrast, has spoken about his &quot;dear friend&quot; Mr. Putin on numerous occasions - five times, according to one report.
I&#39;ve lost count.
He also promised that relations with Russia would return not only to their pre-crisis level, but even higher.
The next day, a newspaper described Mr. Erdogan&#39;s actions as if nothing bad had ever happened.
In my opinion, his enthusiasm suggested the opposite.
But the lingering chill emanating from Mr. Putin showed that the Russian leader hadn&#39;t forgotten anything.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening comments: Turkey shot down a Russian fighter jet on the Syrian border.
Moscow&#39;s reaction at this point was frantic.
Mr. Putin launched into an angry tirade, blaming Ankara for stabbing Moscow in the back.
The insult was even stronger coming from a supposed friend.
Restoring real trust will be difficult, probably impossible.
Russian public opinion has also changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media have carried out a stunning, all-out offensive against Ankara.
It suddenly seemed that the Turks should be considered guilty of everything.
The most serious were accusations from senior officials that Mr. Erdogan&#39;s own family profited from the illegal oil trade from areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He denied it emphatically.
But there was an official signal in St. Petersburg that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting only happened because Mr. Putin received the apology he demanded from President Erdogan.
Russia could claim a victory of sorts.
For Ankara, the benefits of declaring a truce are clear.
First and foremost, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was nearly ousted from his post last month in a coup attempt.
The repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have clearly shaken him too.
There is also an economic reason.
Russian sanctions have hit hard — especially the ban on charter flights, which typically bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
The number has plummeted by almost 90%.
As for Russia, tour operators and charter companies here will certainly feel relieved when flights finally resume.
They put on the peak of the end of the season in the Mediterranean.
And even this week, state television predicted cheaper fruit and vegetables once Turkish agricultural imports were allowed again.
&quot;Tourists go there, tomatoes come back here,&quot; as the report in the Vedomosti newspaper put it.
But the visit also had additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West for what it sees as a weak response to the coup attempt.
Add to that her lingering dissatisfaction with the snail&#39;s pace of talks about joining the EU, and Mr Putin&#39;s move - which seeks to take advantage of the coolness and gradually destroy Turkish ties with the West.
The Russian leader, of course, won bonus points with Ankara for calling for the support of the elected authorities after the coup attempt.
Mind you, this is a given for Moscow, which has its own deep-seated fear of regime change.
So, the summit in this glitzy seaside palace allowed Russia and Turkey to present what one analyst described to me as an &quot;alliance of the bad&quot;: two countries that feel rejected and humiliated by the West are joining forces.
Yet, despite the public display of reconciliation, the two still have significant differences.
The key is Syria, where Moscow has recently positioned itself as a peacekeeper, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
Perhaps it speaks for itself that after nearly three hours of initial talks, while the two presidents held a press conference, they didn&#39;t even broach the subject.
The Turkish President deliberately avoided answering the question about their differences, while Mr. Putin chose to focus on them.
There is no clear agreement on how they can find common ground on Syria.
But after months of open hostility - and given the possibility of total disaster when NATO member Turkey shot down a Russian fighter jet - it&#39;s certainly better that the two leaders are at least talking again.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside of Scotland
The RBS brand should be reduced to a back office role, according to the bank&#39;s chief executive.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside of Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank&#39;s global ambitions.
The bank had retreated from them since it almost collapsed eight years ago and needed to be rescued.
During this period, brand strategists used &quot;RBS&quot; to protect other consumer finance brands.
It has been backed by millions of pounds of sponsorship to international sports, from the Rugby Six Nations Cup to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now it has been decided that it is right to allow more national brands to come to the fore.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scottish clients but will not be launched.
In England and Wales, all references to RBS, including external headquarters and stock exchange, will be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for clients in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller private banking brands that will gain more influence - Coutts, Adam &amp; Co, Drummond and Holt&#39;s Military Bank.
Mr. McEwan was interviewed during a customer and staff tour of Invernessshire.
He told BBC Scotland: &quot;The RBS brand will eventually become our investment brand and the one our staff will work in because we are now becoming more of a brand bank.&quot;
Since the bank itself has become a global brand, RBS has become a global brand.
I am now saying that we no longer have global aspirations, we have local aspirations.
Each of these brands will represent something very different in their respective populations and our staff will work with clients under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue its sponsorship of the Six Nations Cup, and it is building up the profile of various brands in sports sponsorship.
&quot;Is this the right time for us to move the bank of brands, since at the core (we asked ourselves) how do we focus on improving the bank for customers?&quot; said the chief executive.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we said that we were going to be a great bank for customers and shut down all these brands.
But with the work that we&#39;ve been doing, focusing on the needs of the clients and not our own, I think you&#39;re seeing a lot of change.
We can bring back these brands again, so I think the time is right.
Frankie Dettori reaches 3,000 winners with Newmarket win on the Addiction
Dettori splashes champagne after double in Newmarket leads him to 3,000 wins
Jockey Frankie Dettori scored his 3000th British win at Newmarket on Friday.
He came to this outstanding mark with the help of his second winner of the night on his home track, the Predilection trained by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to achieve this outstanding milestone in smooth racing.
It follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Iddery and Willie Carson.
Three-time champion jockey Dettori, who previously won at Ghayyar, said: &quot;This is something special.&quot;
I am very excited because my family is here too
I am very glad that this happened in Newmarket, since this is where I settled 30 years ago.
It&#39;s not a big social event, it&#39;s not Royal Ascot - it&#39;s just a regular Friday night with 20,000 people.
I am free from business and very unassuming.
Dettori receives applause as he leads Predisposition after winning
Two jockeys have achieved this milestone in steeplechase: champion jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had over 4,300 victories in a career-high.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4,493 career wins
Franchi is one of the finest jockeys of the modern era and it&#39;s no surprise that he has reached a milestone that so few have before him.
He&#39;s stylish and strong, but it&#39;s his tactical savvy that sets him apart from others in the weight room.
He is a great horse racing representative, and his enthusiasm and charisma have attracted fans to the sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom he would have brought 6,000 winners if he wasn&#39;t just a weekend and big race jockey!
But seriously, Franchi has been leading UK winners for the better part of 30 years, which is great to see.
He is an energetic character, which is good for British horse racing, but more than that, he is an incredible jockey.
Franchi Dettori celebrated this outstanding milestone with his signature rush dismount.
From sweeping finishes to sweeping dismounts, Franchi Dettori has been a symbol of British smooth racing for over two decades.
It was ups and downs.
Numerous big race winners, including his famous Magnificent Seven at Ascot in 1996, but he also survived a plane crash and was banned for doping.
Three years ago, he initially struggled when he returned from a six-month ban, but he showed tremendous willpower to defy the naysayers and get back in shape.
And he may not have finished for a while - Dettori has previously said he would like to continue competing until at least 50 years of age.
Putin fires chief of staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly fired his chief of staff, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin&#39;s trusted inner circle for many years.
The 63-year-old has now been appointed spokesman for the environment and transportation.
A statement from the Kremlin says Putin &quot;has decided to release Ivanov from his duties as head of the Russian presidential administration,&quot; but did not give a reason.
Ivanov&#39;s deputy since 2012, Anton Vaino, has been appointed as his successor.
Mr Vaino, 44, former diplomat.
Born in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State University of International Relations (MGIMO) and served in the Tokyo embassy.
Later he was the head of the presidential protocol department and the government apparatus, according to the Kremlin website (in Russian).
During his appointment, he told Putin: &quot;Thank you for your trust.&quot;
I think the most important task of the administration is to support your activities as head of state in terms of drafting laws and monitoring how your instructions are carried out.
Putin told a Russian TV channel on Friday that Ivanov had asked to be relieved of his post and recommended that Vaino replace him.
Are smiles persuasive?
This is a move that puzzled Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin&#39;s closest supporters and, like him, served in the Soviet security service, the KGB.
As head of the administration, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, which was shown on state television, both men said that the head of the administration had resigned of his own accord.
But despite the smiles on camera, few people here were convinced, especially now, right before the parliamentary elections.
So, these are the unintended consequences of some kind of power struggle?
So far no one knows.
But the official announcement - that the man once campaigned for as a potential president suddenly wanted to control Russian environmental policy - was met with huge skepticism.
In remarks to Putin quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said: “It is true that in early 2012 I asked you in a conversation to entrust me with this very difficult position, even, one might say, a problematic position, for four years.
Well, it turns out that I was the head of the presidential administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
He previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the State Security Service of the KGB, like Mr. Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was named his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted the most.
It was once thought that Ivanov could become president of Russia after Putin&#39;s second term, since a third term for Putin would be unconstitutional.
However, another close supporter of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev, has taken the post.
Putin became prime minister before returning to the presidency after just three and a half years.
Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson fired after brawl with producer
Gibson was involved in a brawl on the set of the show in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced his termination in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, issued an apology Thursday before his suspension was announced.
There were creative differences on set and differences of opinion.
I regret that this happened,&quot; he said in a statement.
Details on how the Gibson character will be written off the show, which is following a team of FBI agents, are expected to come at a later date, according to statements from ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old actor, who previously starred on the sitcom Dharma &amp; Greg, has been on the show since its first season in 2005.
&quot;I love Criminal Minds and have put my heart and soul into it for the past twelve years,&quot; Gibson said in a statement released Friday.
I had hoped to be present in it to the end, but now it will be impossible.
I would just like to thank the writers, producers, actors, our amazing team, and most of all, the best fans the show could ever dream of.
The show is slated to return for its twelfth season on September 28.
Riddle: Fish Landed in Banff Garden
A man from Banff asked for help identifying fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 fish could be gerbils left behind by a waterspout.
Bain, who lives 500 meters from the sea, uploaded footage of the spectacle to Periscope in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two-inch fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to Fife
£1.35bn project now due to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the north span and the Queensferry Crossing Viaduct - which means the bridge is now connected to Fife.
This is the first of four closures between &quot;web fans&quot; that are now nearing completion near all three pylons of the bridge.
The bridge section from Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It contains 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 bridge cables.
The £1.35bn project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
Economy Minister Keith Brown visited the site today and was among the first to walk from the ground to the bridge.
He said: &quot;This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of Queensferry Crossing.
We are all witnesses of engineering on a truly epic scale in this project, where over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel were used just to build this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, completing the junction between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a virtuoso operation using extremely precise assembly tolerances.
In total, about 79% of the entire bridge deck is now in place, with the last section of the deck being cast at Rosyth today, meaning the entire deck is ready to be lifted into place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, project director of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: “The first closure on every bridge project is always a significant milestone.
In this stunning project, this closure represents the state of the art of building.
With the last section of roadbed in place and connected to the widening North Pylon roadbed, we then had to close the remaining gap on the north—or shore-facing—side.
This was done by pulling up the north approach viaduct 700 millimeters further south.
It was a large-scale and at the same time very elegant operation.
Large-scale, because the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6000 tons and had to be raised at an inclination angle of about 3%.
Neat because the tolerances the team worked on were tiny - just a few millimeters in each direction.
Fortunately, it all went very well.
Moelfre Bay Rescue: Three men &#39;lucky to be alive&#39;
Three men are &#39;lucky to be alive&#39; after being thrown from a fishing boat in Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station raised the alarm at 13:20 British Summer Time on Friday after the team saw the incident unfold in Moelfre Bay.
The three men struggled to swim to safety as their ship continued to move under its own power.
“We saw their ship circling next to them and assumed the worst,” said Moelfre lifeboat helmsman Vince Jones.
&quot;Fortunately, by the time we got on the water, strong winds had blown him away from them,&quot; he added.
Two men were rescued with the help of a local fishing boat, and a third man, aged 60, was found exhausted and clinging to a buoy without a life jacket.
All of them were taken aboard the coastal lifeboat and taken to the rescue station.
Jones said: &quot;The three men thrown into the water are lucky to be alive and completely unharmed.
The boat&#39;s engine had an emergency disconnect, but it somehow unhooked from the man driving the boat when it capsized.
Someone guarded these guys today.
Pokémon Go, decent hunting for health and happiness
It&#39;s exciting to watch the world change.
That teenagers and children no longer go out to play, preferring to spend their free time looking at screens, has been a complaint by many over the past decade.
Pokemon Go gets people off the couch and into some physical activity.
Screen time was originally limited to television, then video games, and more recently smartphones.
It&#39;s so great to see that technology and outdoor activity are not mutually exclusive.
I&#39;m referring, of course, to the craze that is Pokémon Go, a character-based app originally created for video games in the 1990s (which has since spawned a series of cartoons, playing cards, and other offshoots).
Like so many other pop cultural phenomena, it all fell into disrepair a little before this new game was made available in the US, Australia, and New Zealand in early July.
The launch in other countries was delayed at the time due to massive backlash that overloaded the servers.
In a matter of days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and nearly as many as Twitter.
So how does it work?
In a nutshell, smartphone players go looking for Pokémon that are tracked by GPS and, once found, can be &#39;photographed&#39; (via a screenshot on your phone) or &#39;caught&#39;.
The generation that played the game when they were younger joined the craze, breaking away from sofas to search.
In the US, the game has led to a significant increase in the number of steps taken by the &quot;normal&quot; person on a daily basis.
Cardiogram, an Apple Watch app that tracks 35,000 users, recently told the Washington Post that within two days of the game&#39;s launch, the number of people it tracked who did 30 minutes of exercise a day jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company doesn&#39;t know who&#39;s playing Pokémon Go, it just sees raw data about completing levels.
Many health campaigns urging people to &quot;find 30 minutes&quot;, &quot;get off the couch&quot; and &quot;be active every day&quot; have fallen on deaf ears because most health messages are boring and are delivered by people who look unhappy.
However, the importance of exercise cannot be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps with weight management, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits too long to list here.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is that it takes people outside to do what they love.
Thus, the three foundations of health are covered: movement, fresh air and sunshine and joy.
Some people even make new friends on the hunt.
As usual, there are boring bores who are looking for something to complain about.
And yes, someone might stumble on the door.
So what?
The breakthrough has happened.
Because even though smartphone apps like Fitbit could track our physical activity before, they didn&#39;t give us a reason to exercise like this game does.
The novelty will become boring, and the use will weaken over time.
However, due to the success of Pokemon, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with physical activity in the real world, helping many people on the hunt to be more active, fit and healthy.

Simone Biles wins gold overall in women&#39;s gymnastics
Forget pressure.
Forget the hustle.
Simone Biles is immune to all of this.
Dynamic on vault.
Relaxed on the log.
Stunning on the floor
Awesome everywhere.
And now, finally, the Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast rose to the overall title on Thursday, putting a chasm between herself and the rest of the world in a convincing display under Olympic scrutiny.
Her overall score of 62.198 was well behind silver medalist and Final Five teammate Eli Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
Biles of the United States performs on the beam during the rhythmic gymnastics women&#39;s individual all-round final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Biles became the fourth American woman in a row to win the overall title and fifth overall, cementing her reputation as the best of her generation and possibly ever.
She burst into tears when her final total score was shown and her long journey to that point was over.
This achievement puts her in the same league as exceptionally rare track and field athletes like Michael Phelps who have taken their sports to new heights:
Biles has spent the last three years dominating her sport, winning 15 World Championship medals - including 10 golds - with such mind-boggling programs in their mixture of hard work and precision that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her &quot;the greatest gymnast I&#39;ve ever seen.&quot; have seen.&quot;
One last test awaited in Brazil, a competition not so much between Biles and the rest of the industry as between her and the weight of high expectations.
Anything less than heading back to your family&#39;s home in Spring, Texas with a fistful of gold medals would be seen as an unfulfilled expectation.

Biles earned her first gold on Tuesday, providing a beautiful final touch to the farewell party for outgoing national team coordinator Marta Caroli.
While Biles insisted that she never looked into the future during her long journey to the top, this is not entirely true.
Part of her floor exercise program - the one that includes her signature passage - is set to Latin music that would fit right at home on the street right outside Rio&#39;s Olympic Arena.
This is not a coincidence.
The girl, adopted by her grandparents as a toddler and revealed by trainer Aimee Boorman&#39;s mother during a visit to the gym where Boorman was a trainer, has become a force.
She hasn&#39;t lost a single overall since the summer of 2013, a streak of luck that should last as long as Biles wants it to.
Even though Mustafina got a slight lead with two spins, it was a mirage.
The balance beam and floor exercise—where Biles defends his world title—lie in wait.
She took the lead again with 15.433 on balance beam and finished with 15.933 on floor.
Raisman hugged her gently as they waited for the final count—a pure formality—and tears formed around Biles&#39; glittery red, white, and blue eyeliner as the plan she&#39;d once written down in a scrapbook came to fruition.
Raisman&#39;s performance was a small retaliation for what happened four years ago when she tied for third but lost bronze to Mustafina in a tiebreak.
This time, the 22-year-old captain of the team that the Americans call &quot;grandmother&quot; was way ahead.
She sent kisses to the crowd after her floor exercise, engulfed in a comeback that sometimes seemed in jeopardy.
As for Biles, the 19-year-old&#39;s viral tweet from earlier this week now has a whole new meaning:
Police: 3 victims in serial killer case shot to death while listening to music in car
The two women and a 12-year-old girl who died in the deadliest attack in the first Phoenix serial killer case in over a decade were sitting in a car talking and listening to music when they were shot, according to police reports released Thursday.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stephanie R. Ellis and Ellis&#39; daughter, Malia, were gunned down on June 12 while their car was parked in a driveway, authorities said.
The offender fired about eight shots from a pistol while standing on the passenger side of the car, after which he fled in another vehicle, according to the report.
Police say the triple homicide does not appear to be the result of a robbery, as the perpetrator did not take the purses or $2,900 from one of the adult victims.
Phoenix police spokesman Sgt. Jonathan Howard said the shooting prompted investigators to look into whether it was linked to four previous attacks.
A total of seven people were killed and two others injured in nine attacks in two predominantly Hispanic areas over four months.
&quot;This is happening in a residential area in front of the house,&quot; Howard told CBS affiliate KPHO earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have driven several vehicles, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators have refused to release evidence that led them to conclude that the attacks were linked and carried out by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized with her injuries and later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis&#39; daughter, Malia, died at the scene.
The witness told police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car listening to music.
Authorities have also released a police report on a shooting that targeted an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder and is believed to have been the work of a serial killer.
Investigators found shell casings and removed the bullet from the seat and bullet fragments from the engine compartment.
Mother of 6-year-old child with microcephaly: &#39;It&#39;s getting better&#39;
Like most six-year-olds, Edmund Piksivto loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike most of his peers, Edmund has microcephaly, the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elisabeth Pixivto was unaware of during her pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was - I can&#39;t do it.
I won&#39;t be able to do it.
I didn&#39;t sign up for this.
Which isn&#39;t really true — of course you&#39;re signing up for it,&quot; she said.
She and her husband Vincent were told that Edmund might never recognize them and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested placing him in a specialized medical institution.
&quot;My first response was, &#39;I didn&#39;t think people still did that,&#39;&quot; Pixivto explained.
Edmund walks with a walker.
Edmund didn&#39;t sit or crawl until he was three, and he still doesn&#39;t speak.
But he slowly goes through some stages.
He walks with assistance and rides a bicycle.
He also enjoys playing with his two brothers and singing.
Elizabeth shows the gesture Edmund came up with for &quot;please sing to me&quot;.
&quot;We&#39;re teaching him sign language,&quot; Pixivto told CBS News.
But not just ordinary sign language - she says that Edmund invented his own gestures.
Microcephaly can occur due to a number of different circumstances: genetic, such as Edmund&#39;s, infections during pregnancy from viruses such as measles and Zika.
Symptoms and prognosis can vary significantly.
It is too early to tell how this will affect the lives of those infected with the Zika virus.
Pixivto recalls the emotional loss due to an uncertain future.
I kept saying what would happen?
What will happen?
And she still doesn&#39;t know.
I didn&#39;t actually ask for a lifetime forecast because I don&#39;t expect anyone to actually be able to tell me.
But Pixivto has some reassuring advice for mothers of children with Zeke&#39;s birth defects.
Getting better.
You know that things will get better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rain, flood cause rescue efforts in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rain and widespread flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with more rain expected to fall over the state through Saturday.
Numerous rivers in southeast Louisiana and southern Mississippi have burst their banks and are threatening widespread flooding after extreme rainfall, the National Weather Service said.
Louisiana Gov. John Bell Edwards said state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and aid has already traveled to affected parishes.
Mike Steele, spokesman for the Governor&#39;s Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, said there were requests for high water transport, boats and sandbags.
Steele said that the Tanjipahoa parish alone had requested tens of thousands of sandbags.
Flood danger remains in effect through Saturday across much of south Louisiana.
The weather service said in a statement that an additional 3 to 5 inches could wash over the area.
In southern Alabama, a flood watch remained in effect until Friday as rain continued to fall in the Mobile area.
The Comite River near Baton Rouge and the Amite River near Denham Springs, both in Louisiana, were forecast to set record flood levels over the weekend.
Forecaster Alec Krautmann said both rivers could flood many homes in suburban areas near Baton Rouge.
He also said flooding downstream in Assension Parish is a threat as these swollen rivers will slowly drain into Lake Morpa.
The Tickfaw River, just south of the Mississippi line in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached its highest level ever recorded at 9 am Friday.
Rescuers were still pulling people out of flooding in Amit and Wilkinson counties in southwest Mississippi.
Leroy Hunsford, his wife and stepson were among those rescued early Friday near Gloucester.
Hunsford, 62, says the waters of Beaver Creek, which are usually more than 400 feet from his home, rose rapidly overnight.
He said that another stepson who lives nearby warned him.
&quot;We woke up and the water kept coming,&quot; Hunsford said.
She reached the level of my belt.
His wife told Hunsford that this was the biggest influx she had seen in her 48 years of living here.
Hunsford said he and everyone in his family has a disability and is the only one who can swim.
Hunsford said rescue workers rescued all three with an army truck and took them to the fire station in Gloucester, where they took shelter on Friday.
Krautmann says the flooding is &quot;spreading fast&quot; as the rains continue, noting that officials are considering an evacuation order.
Krautmann says one observer near Livingston reported 13.75 inches of rain from midnight to Friday morning.
Krautmann said the ground has been oversaturated with rainfall since Wednesday.
Heavy rain and street flooding have led to efforts to rescue residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Ward and the cancellation of classes in five school districts, authorities say.
WWL, a CBS affiliate, reports that Tangipahoa&#39;s councilor spoke of 200 flooded homes.
Residents were evacuated to two churches, but both are now flooded.
Ward chairman Robbie Miller said authorities rescued 72 people and seven pets trapped in high water.
Shelters have been set up in the town of Amit and the town of Hammond to take in those who have been evacuated.
&quot;They will be able to return home as soon as the water starts to recede,&quot; he said.
In the town of Hammond, Tangipahoa Ward, about two dozen streets were closed due to high water levels, and sandbags were made available for distribution to residents in the hope that they would keep water away from homes and businesses.
&quot;The last major flood we had was in March,&quot; City Manager Lacey Landrum said.
It&#39;s on its way to becoming a similar event.
In Mississippi, Harrison County, emergency response chief Rupert Lacy said that heavy rain continued to fall on the Gulf Coast.
Several houses were registered as flooded on Thursday, but none were registered on Friday, he said.
Keith Towson, manager of Shopper Value Foods in Amit, has lived in the area for 40 years.
&quot;I&#39;ve seen water in places where I&#39;ve never seen it before,&quot; Towson said, &quot;and it&#39;s still pouring onto the ground.&quot;
Mahaj Brown, 6, &#39;bullet riddled&#39;, survives shootout in Philadelphia
Police say a 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, recording the second shooting of a 6-year-old in the city this week.
The child&#39;s grandparents identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
The grandparents say Brown suffered multiple gunshot wounds, including his groin, leg, arm and abdomen, but was conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
&quot;He got hit hard, his little body was riddled with bullets,&quot; his grandmother Delores Melendez tells the station.
I just can&#39;t believe it.
The boy is listed in the hospital in critical condition and has survived several surgeries.
The family told the station that he was expected to recover.
He was supposed to go to first grade at the local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people shot at in the Germantown neighborhood.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men is reported to be in critical condition; the other two victims were reported in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot dead in the front seat of the car next to the 29-year-old in critical condition, the station reports.
The other two victims were not in the car, and police are investigating whether any of the injured men may have been the shooter.
Investigators tell CBS Philadelphia that what appears to have been a shootout between several gunmen.
Semi-automatic shell casings, attributed to various semi-automatic weapons, littered the scene.
It seems like it was definitely a long battle.
There were shell casings in the street, on both sides of the sidewalk.
Therefore, apparently, there were several armed fighters and they were actively involved in the shootout,&quot; Philadelphia police captain Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Many houses and cars in the area were also affected.
No arrests have been made and the police are reportedly reviewing security cameras.
Another 6-year-old, a girl, was struck in the arm by a stray bullet Tuesday while playing in front of her home in West Oak Lane.
She is recovering and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That&#39;s what I call this year&#39;s women&#39;s Olympic gymnastics team, and for several reasons.
First, I&#39;ve been to every Summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant.
And two, three gymnasts play a key role in this team: Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren &quot;Lori&quot; Hernandez, who have already inspired so many non-white girls.
The composition of this team, complete with Eli Raisman, who is Jewish, and Madison Cochan, who is Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team finally looks like America.
It also solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of the sport.
For the past four years, the number one women&#39;s gymnast has been an African American.
Simone and Gabby were #1 and #2 last year.
It&#39;s powerful.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was the surprise Olympic champion and America cheered.
The world could now witness the incredible performances of three-time World Champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez performing unexpected yet virtuoso gymnastics.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American in a row to win gold in the women&#39;s individual overall championship.
Teammate Elie Raisman took silver.
We are witnessing the peak of this sport, but it does not look like this in gymnastics sections across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Lori all chose the same path as Eli and Madison to form the Olympic team.
They are the &quot;final five&quot; because the next Olympic gymnastics team will only have four gymnasts on the team and this is Marta Caroli&#39;s final year of coaching.
But in reality, gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnasts first train in private gymnastics clubs supported by parents who pay for tuition fees, equipment, travel, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (for coaches and their gymnasts and families). ) and the list goes on.
Most of these gymnastic clubs are located in affluent suburban areas that can support this business.
These clubs are where the gymnasts get the most out of their training, and it is an expensive and long-term obligation for the families of the gymnasts.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Honey, coach of Lori Hernandez, have both coached their athletes since they took up gymnastics.
We must create more affordable and accessible gymnastics education for communities of myriad young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I founded my gymnastic foundation 20 years ago.
At my organizations, we&#39;ve already provided free, low-cost gymnastics classes based in Harlem to over 15,000 urban youngsters (mostly blacks and Hispanics) and raised national and international champions.
In September we will be expanding to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high quality gymnastics to youth who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body, as well as resistance to exhausting work, discipline and perseverance for the mind.
This combination has a lifelong positive impact on good health, school and work success.
It is the inspiration of this team that will send thousands of girls to do gymnastics, and this is wonderful.
Playing sports is so important, especially for girls.
Now is such a wonderful time.
Thank you Simone, Eli, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this serious show of &quot;Woman Power&quot; in winning team Olympic gold and for motivating so many girls of all backgrounds to be healthy, strong and successful young women.
Junior doctors take to calling further strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt&#39;s proposal
The ministers had hoped to end the change dispute by agreeing on a modified contract with the leaders of the British Medical Association, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 young doctors who took part in the vote rejected it.
In July, Hunt unveiled plans to introduce the treaty, saying the NHS was in &quot;no man&#39;s land&quot; and any subsequent delay would be detrimental to staff and patients.
The first junior doctors have been transferred to a new contract that includes changes to night and weekend work to improve after-hours service.
Dr Helen McCote, chairman of the BMA Young Physicians Committee, said in a statement last night: &quot;Junior physicians still have serious concerns about the proposed treaty, in particular that it will fuel an ongoing workforce crisis and that it may not apply to all physicians. fair&quot;.
Only eight weeks are left before the first group of doctors is transferred to a new contract, progress is needed, and time is running out.
The WMA&#39;s attempt to resolve the dispute through negotiations was met with reluctance to take action and sometimes complete silence from the government.
This is despite Jeremy Hunt&#39;s promise last month that his door is always open.
“Jeremy Hunt needs to act now, inspire the introduction and respond to the concerns of junior doctors.
If he does not, then the junior doctors are unequivocal in that they are prepared to organize subsequent strikes.
The last strike at the end of April brought about 13,000 scheduled surgeries and 100,000 nurse appointments to be postponed, while nurses and consultants were called in to ensure the replacement of doctors on the picket line.
The ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by negotiating an amended treaty with the leaders of the British Medical Association.
The WMA wants better holiday pay for the 54,000 junior doctors who will be covered by the agreement.
Daniel Mortimer, CEO of NHS Employers, urged junior doctors not to go on strike.
Mortimer stated: &quot;The strikes accomplish little or nothing, but put pressure on already stretched teams and services, and cause anxiety, physical pain and frustration to patients, caregivers and their families.&quot;
Over the past two months, we have been talking to the Committee of Associate Physicians and, together with the Department of Health and others, have responded positively to their concerns regarding the role of caregivers and corporate whistleblowing policies.
Workers hoped continued positive assistance on other important topics such as staffing, training flexibility, additional training for those returning from a career break, tuition fees, mutual curriculum recognition, sabbatical leave, and gender pay gaps in medicine — were a sign of how seriously employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health were going to comply with the conditions reached by the WMA in November, February and May.
£2 a day drug could reduce risk of heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are set to use the £2-a-day drug after authorities have advised giving it to more people for a longer time.
The anticoagulant drug ticagrelor reduces the risk of recurrent attacks for people with heart disease.
The drug is already prescribed for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or a new attack.
The National Health Service&#39;s NICE surveillance service advised giving it to people for four years to eliminate the risk of cardiovascular problems in the future.
Now, however, the National Health Service NICE surveillance service has advised giving it to people for four years to eliminate the risk of cardiovascular problems in the future.
Approximately 140,000 people in England have a heart attack each year, and a quarter of them have another attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes result from the accumulation of fatty material on the walls of the arteries and plaque formation.
If the plaque ruptures, it can cause a blood clot, blocking blood flow to the heart and causing a heart attack.
And if the clot moves, it can move through the blood stream and block blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had one seizure are at greater risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by the British firm AstraZeneca and sold under the name Brilique, reduces the risk by making blood clots less likely.
The NICE draft guidelines released today recommend that people be given 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months, then 60 mg with aspirin twice a day for the next three years.
Professor Carol Longson, director of the NICE Center for Health Technology Assessment, said: &quot;Despite the existence of effective secondary prevention methods, about a quarter of people who have already had a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with devastating consequences.&quot;
Fear of repetition can have a significant negative impact on a person&#39;s quality of life.
There is evidence that ticagrelor combined with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
By pre-recommending ticagrelor, we are pleased to be able to increase the treatment options available to the many thousands of people who are willing to use it.
Because there is limited information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor—especially the risk of bleeding—beyond three years, the draft guidelines do not recommend treatment beyond that.
PC Ownership Culture Allows Vote Fraud to Thrive in Muslim Areas
Former Tower Hamlets mayor Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year over corruption, prompting a government report.
The culture of political correctness has led to a blind eye that has resulted in widespread vote-count fraud in Muslim communities, according to a devastating government report released today.
Former cabinet minister Sir Eric Pickles has lashed out at police, election monitors and city officials for ignoring evidence of electoral fraud due to &quot;oversensitivity to race and religion&quot;.
The former secretary of local communities, now an anti-corruption czar, said sectarian voter intimidation was so severe that police should be allowed to set up cordons outside polling stations to protect frightened voters.
He suggests that voters take identification cards to prove who they are when they vote.
For now, voters only need to provide their name and address.
The report even suggests applying indelible ink to people&#39;s fingers when they turn in their ballots, with the goal of preventing someone from voting twice.
Whistleblowers need better protection, Sir Eric said.
He calls for more press access to local council documents and decisions taken by informal committees or working groups.
&quot;This is being done not only to protect against electoral fraud, but also to protect the local government from the more open culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it,&quot; he said.
The report was commissioned by Downing Street in the wake of the Tower Hamlets voting scandal in East London.
Last year, a special election court ruled that incumbent mayor Luftur Rahman should have been removed from office due to a long list of corrupt and illegal activities.
The court found that Rahman &quot;cynically misrepresented&quot; the religious sensibilities of his Muslim community and silenced his critics by accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman was said to have &quot;led his campaign on the basis that it was the duty of Muslim believers to vote for him.&quot;
Up to 300 votes were doubtful or were the result of personification, when a person votes, pretending to be someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud throughout the country.
He raised particular concerns about mail-in voting fraud, in which senior members of the Muslim community are said to have pressured people to vote for their chosen candidate.
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean up the voting system, including requiring you to bring your ID to prove who you are
His report stated: “Evidence has been presented of pressure being placed on vulnerable members of some ethnic minority communities, in particular women and youth, to vote at the behest of their elders, especially in communities of Pakistani and Bangladeshi origin.
&quot;There were fears that ... public institutions turned a blind eye to such behavior because of the over-sensitivity of &quot;political correctness&quot; about ethnicity and religion.&quot;
Cheese Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including removing political activists from mail-in ballots to stop the vote harvest.
The report, before Theresa May, also calls for tighter checks on registration to prevent the voter roll from being used for immigration and privileges fraud.
An option is being considered to require voters to present identification before voting.
Use indelible ink on people&#39;s fingers as soon as they cast their ballot to prevent anyone from voting twice.
Carry out systematic checks on people&#39;s nationality to make sure they are eligible to vote.
Introduce a three-year limit on applications for automatic postal voting.
Suspension of political campaigners and activists from work with completed absentee ballots and mail ballot envelopes.
Give the police the authority to set up cordons around polling stations.
Amend the law to make it easier for people to be charged with intimidation under the 1983 People&#39;s Act Submission.
Make it illegal to take photographs at polling stations.
Make it a requirement that only English be used at the polls (with the exception of Wales).
Strengthen training to ensure that staff forces voters to go to the booth one at a time.
Sir Eric violently attacks the city&#39;s police, saying it&#39;s &quot;amazing&quot; that no criminal charges have been filed since the Tower Hamlets case.
&quot;The election court has disqualified Lutfur Rahman and his agent for a long list of corrupt and illegal activities,&quot; he said.
He was found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt - the criminal standard of proof - on a number of grounds.
He also criticizes the inconclusive &quot;tick checks&quot; of the electoral registration departments of city administrations.
Sir Eric said: &quot;Last year&#39;s ruling at Tower Hamlets was a wake-up call.
Our nation has a proud heritage as the mother of parliamentary elections, and yet the alarming and covert spread of electoral fraud and the state of denial by some bodies threaten that good reputation.
Crazy for Kate&#39;s cycling counterpart and other Rio Olympics celebrity doppelgangers
Fans of the 2016 Rio Olympics have gone crazy this week for French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevost, who happens to bear an impressive resemblance to the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympian is far from the only athlete competing for gold this summer to boast her own celebrity doppelgänger — at least according to social media posts.
So, in honor of the Rio Games and all the famous faces appearing on our screens at the moment, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympians who bear more than a superficial resemblance to Hollywood stars.
The hunter and the wolf: U.S. men&#39;s archery team member Brady Ellison, left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child
Besides Kate&#39;s bike lane doppelgänger, many people online have been quick to point out how a certain archer might be superstar Leonardo DiCaprio&#39;s twin.
U.S. men&#39;s archery team member Brady Ellison caused a Twitter hurricane after images surfaced of him looking eerily similar to the Wolf of Wall Street star.
And in fact, the archer found out about the social media frenzy and admitted that he had heard that he looked like Leo since he was a child.
&quot;I personally don&#39;t see a huge resemblance, maybe with the exception of facial hair,&quot; Brady told the Huffington Post.
&quot;He&#39;s an attractive guy, so I think it&#39;s a compliment.&quot;
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 is sure to be pointed even more this year: the striking similarity between British jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina, with her large expressive eyes, is said to be a carbon copy of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron Van der Burgh has been compared to Glee star Matthew Morrison for years.
Moving on to the more unexpected: This user thinks Nathan is the &#39;athletic version&#39; of the &#39;Inception&#39; actor
Another long-running comparison was between tennis player Rafael Nadar and actor Josh Harnett, who boast similarly heavy eyebrows and lips.
Silver medalist Russian swimmer Yulia Yefimova not only boasts the same tanned skin and blonde hair of actress AnnaLynn McCord, while Team USA&#39;s Nathan Adrian looks like a &quot;sporty version of Joseph Gorgon Levitt&quot; according to fans.
Tough women: Football star Hope Solo, left, and actress Jennifer Carpenter of Dexter, right, share the same face and eye shapes
Not the only one: One Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw the similarities
Creating a Theory: According to this user, there may be a reason behind the couple&#39;s similar looks.
One Twitter user recently took to the site to go public with her delight that &quot;the rest of the internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical.&quot;
In fact, the US soccer star and actress Dexter have incredibly similar face and eye shapes.
Other popular comparisons have included Kerry Walsh Jennings and her smile, which is close to that of actress Laura Linney, and gold medal-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas, who boasts her own beautiful wide smile, which is similar to Bring It On star Gabrielle Union. .
CBC Olympics commentator apologizes for saying Chinese swimmer &#39;died like a pig&#39;
Byron McDonald&#39;s analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan&#39;s fourth-place finish in the women&#39;s 4x200m freestyle relay outraged CBC viewers in a live Olympics broadcast on Wednesday
Canadian broadcaster CBC was forced to apologize after one of its commentators said a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer &quot;started like a stink&quot; and &quot;died like a pig&quot; during her swim.
Commentator Byron McDonald thought his microphone was muted when he began to express his own opinion at the end of the final women&#39;s 4x200m freestyle relay.
McDonald, who was brought on to the CBC commentary team to &quot;color it up,&quot; could be heard saying, &quot;That 14-year-old Chinese girl dropped the ball, baby.&quot;
Too excited, started like a stink, died like a pig.
Thanks for this.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanghan, 14, swam the second leg of the relay in 1:57.79, 1.61 seconds slower than Canada&#39;s Taylor Ruck, allowing the Canadians to close the gap on China.
Viewers across Canada reacted quickly online after being shocked by the tone and language used.
Emmet MacFarlane tweeted: &quot;Did the CBC announcer really just say that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer &#39;died like a pig&#39;????&quot;
That idiot didn&#39;t realize they were still on the air.&quot;
Ai Yanhan of China was told in the women&#39;s 4x200m freestyle relay final, &quot;That little 14-year-old Chinese woman dropped the ball, baby.&quot;
Criticism on Twitter immediately fell upon Byron MacDonald, with many calling for him to be fired.
Twitter users couldn&#39;t help themselves when they heard how insensitive Byron MacDonald was
Another Twitter user, Sara Paradise, wrote: &#39;Wow #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and make us look like a bunch of racists. #disgusted.
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russell, who hosted the CBC broadcast, apologized live for McDonald&#39;s comment, stating: &quot;We apologize for the comment about the swimming performance being aired.&quot;
It was an unfortunate choice of words, we are sorry that this happened&#39;.
SHS ended by apologizing to the over 90 people who tweeted in response to this comment.
Friend commentator Scott Russell had to apologize on behalf of McDonald
The CBC then copied and forwarded their apologies to over 90 other Twitter users who complained about McDonald&#39;s comments.
The network was also quick to apologize and release a statement.
We sincerely regret that these statements were made and that they were allowed to air.
We acted swiftly last night to apologize to our live viewers and our social media followers.
To be clear, Byron&#39;s comments referred to the swimmer&#39;s performance, not to her as a person.
And yet it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words, and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, McDonald apologized on live television and tried to clarify his comment, saying he didn&#39;t think his words would be construed as an attack on a person.
&#39;I&#39;d like to take a moment to apologize for the comment I made last night after the women&#39;s relay,&#39; he said on CBC&#39;s broadcast of the Olympics.
&#39;I was talking about the swimmer&#39;s performance, not about her personally.&#39;
&#39;It goes without saying that no disrespect was meant, and I&#39;m sorry.&#39;
Primark shopper insulted woman who shamelessly tried on lingerie in the middle of the store
Shoppers didn&#39;t know where to look when a woman stripped naked to try on panties on a shopping floor in the middle of Primark.
Even worse, she tried on how she looked in them, pulled them off and put them back on the shelf.
She kept searching and ended up trying on four pairs of lingerie at Bouverie Place in Folkestone.
The Primark store at Bouverie Place in Folkestone, where a woman tries on knitted panties before putting them back on the shelf
Mother-of-two Jenny Davidson, who was at the store at the time, said that after trying on underwear, the mystery woman &quot;dressed again and left the store without buying anything.&quot;
She said, &quot;People couldn&#39;t believe what they saw.&quot;
Standing in the middle of the sales area, she took a pair of panties from the display case, took off her own pantyhose and underpants, and put them on.
&quot;She didn&#39;t try to find a secluded place somewhere to do it - she just stood there, shameless.&quot;
&quot;Everyone stared when she took off her panties again and she obviously didn&#39;t like them because she put them back on the shelf.&quot;
She did the same with three other couples before finally deciding that there was nothing to like here, dressed again and went out.
&quot;She didn&#39;t seem to care who was watching her, or what she thought about the person who ended up buying those underpants she was trying on.&quot;
Jenny Davidson, 33, from Kent, said: &quot;It&#39;s disgusting to think that someone is going to take home underpants that someone else has already worn and they haven&#39;t been washed.&quot;
The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added: &quot;My conclusion is that the staff apparently tried to remove these items of clothing from sale after she left - well, so much the better.&quot;
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t want to come home with a new pair of women&#39;s underpants and find that another woman has put them on and taken them off and they haven&#39;t been washed.&quot;
A spokesman for Primark said: &quot;Primark is aware of an incident that happened at our store in Folkestone on Tuesday 9th August.&quot;
All items in question have been withdrawn from sale.
How to Protect Yourself from Gun Attacks Using Krav Maga
The world around you is dangerous, but this video from Dailymail.com might help make it a little safer for you.
We spoke with Ron Mizrachi, Master of the Krav Maga Federation in New York, to figure out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
Whether approached from the front or from behind, this video will show you how to beat a robber with his own weapon.
If approached from behind, according to Mizrachi, the first thing to do is turn around so you can see the attacker and &#39;clear the line of fire&#39;.
You then grip the pistol tightly between your forearm and shoulder before striking them in the face with your free elbow.
Then knee to the groin follows, and while the attacker is doubled over in pain, you twist the gun out of his hands, hit him in the face with the muzzle and step back, keeping the weapon pointed at him.
For an armed one approaching from the front, the method of execution is similar - move your body out of the line of fire, quickly grab the gun and twist it so that the villain cannot shoot.
At the same time, shift your weight onto the gun and punch your attacker in the chest, then twist the gun out of his grip before stepping back and aiming at him.
Sounds difficult?
Watch the video to see exactly how Mizrachi does it.
But remember, the safest way out of any heist - unless you&#39;re a Krav Maga master - is to hand over your cash.
For travel guide Ian Wright runs his tongue through the dirtiest places in Europe
A British traveler put his immune system and gag reflex to the test by licking some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
Host and travel writer Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk, ran his tongue over a euro banknote, Piccadilly Circus railings, a train toilet flush button and a Russian public telephone to prove the power of his immune system.
Before licking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he was getting into.
But the experiment, which is to become a movie called &quot;The Slimer Traveler&#39;s Guide to Inner Strength,&quot; produced some amazing results.
The thought of licking the flush button on a train shared by thousands of others may be extremely disgusting, but there are actually worse bacteria in the kitchen sink.
Throughout the trip to Europe, Wright spoke to doctors and paramedics about the increase in gut bacteria and his own health.
Luckily, nothing he licked brought him more than a bad taste in his mouth.
Wright became famous for testing the strength of his gut by traveling the world eating weird and wonderful things.
From public railings at train stations to the toilet flush button, this challenge has certainly tested his immune system.
In the film he made, he said: &#39;Since childhood, I have been completely careless about my health and I have put many things into my mouth from the ground, eating worms and dirty water.&#39;
He certainly proved his reputation during the movie.
The only thing he refused was a dirty Russian public toilet.
His test smear showed a luminometer value in excess of 4,000 units.
For comparison: freshly washed hands should be within 60.
But there was one Russian public toilet that he refused to lick after his luminometer reading was over 4,000 while freshly washed hands showed less than 60.
Wright and Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio made a film about the traveler called The Traveler Lizun&#39;s Guide to Inner Strength, which shows the amount of bacteria in different places, such as the toilet.
In the film, he said: &#39;This is close to one of the worst things I&#39;ve smelled in a closet.&#39;
There is nothing dirtier than this!
I&#39;m not going to lick anything because it&#39;s disgusting.
The Slime Traveler&#39;s Guide to Inner Strength was filmed with Finnish dairy producer Valio.
The company provided Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamins C and D, to help boost the growth of human gut bacteria and develop the immune system.
Valio Senior Vice President for Snacks, Juices and New Categories Niko Vuorenmaa said: &#39;We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that would be interesting to see and at the same time could explain the benefits of probiotics.
We had a brainstorming session that ended with the idea &quot;let&#39;s call Jan&quot;.
They claim interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about foods, we wanted to put them in more context: the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of gut health and how it relates to the immune system.
The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with this documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information about it in an engaging way.
I also think the film shows that we have a good sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: &#39;Let&#39;s put it this way: I would lose respect for Jan if he licked some of the things I asked for, like the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the film.&#39;
Naturally, some things were easier for Jan to lick, and some were quite hard.
I&#39;m glad we were able to capture some of those licks on film.&#39;
In a 2015 Valio survey, 84 percent of respondents associated lactic acid bacteria solely with good stomach and intestinal health, and 58 percent said they consumed, at least occasionally, foods containing added lactic acid bacteria.
Family of hooligans demolished Saltash, Cornwall Council House, ahead of eviction
A hooligan family left their council house with a £50,000 loss after they were evicted for bullying their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Sean Trebilcock were kicked out of their property in Saltash, Cornwall after a long list of complaints against them.
After they were forcibly evicted from the property, shocked housing association officials found the property in a state of need of repair.
The walls were left with gaping holes, the floorboards were ripped open, trash was scattered across the floor, and the walls were covered in graffiti.
The family has now been relocated and is believed to be living in a private apartment.
Donna McEvoy, a settler at Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid he might not be saved.
She said: &#39;It was an absolute nightmare for the people here and I don&#39;t think people should live like this.
There are many things to weigh because this property is likely to be known as not being a good aspect of Cornwall.
This family is notorious and their name is notorious.
The couple have three sons who have lived in the property on and off, and police say the family&#39;s realm of terror included street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of nearby residents, drug use, drug dealing, excessive yelling, arguments and swearing. .
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, received a warrant for anti-social behavior in June.
Old rubbish was found in several rooms of a house that could be demolished
The floorboards in the house that sold drugs in the past were pulled out
Neighbors say they saw street fights and regularly called the police.
Cornwall Housing forcibly evicted her and her partner from their home this week after they were given an extended period of 11 weeks to voluntarily leave.
The eviction was welcomed with relief by neighbors, who said their lives had been turned into a living hell.
One reported: &#39;They didn&#39;t care about anyone.&#39;
We lived next to them for 20 years and it was always bad.
The number of times we&#39;ve seen the police here is unbelievable.
&#39;We couldn&#39;t sleep this morning.&#39;
We got up because it was so quiet here - we&#39;re not used to it!
Now that they&#39;ve finally left, everything will be fine.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighborhood Team Leader for Cornwall Housing, said the family was unable to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, with the police, and besides, the police were regularly called.
Rubbish and old toys were scattered down the overgrown side of the council house.
He added: &#39;It is a shame that the tenant failed to take any responsibility for her and her family&#39;s behavior as eviction is always the last course of action Cornwall Housing considers.
This was a very difficult case as the behavior was extreme and their actions must have been horrifying to her watching neighbors.
I appreciate all the work my team, the police and community members of Devon and Cornwall have put in, who bravely stepped up to give us the information.
I hope this development will give neighbors some comfort and send a signal that antisocial behavior will not be tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said all three sons lived in the house at different times, but said they were all in their early 20s at the time.
Dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the bedrooms of the house after the eviction
Settlement workers will now have to clean up the piles of rubbish that surrounds the house
In 2014, the police raided the house and found over 70 grams of cannabis, as well as a scale, related supplies and £1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined after pleading guilty to possession of Class B drugs with intent to supply.
She stated that the money was used to pay for a headstone for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After they were made homeless, there are reports that Tanya and her partner now live in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms of the house were covered with graffiti all over the surface.
Police say they will try to evict tenants who do not comply with the rules for renting the premises
Angela Crow, Devon and Cornwall Police, said the move sent a clear warning to other tenants who continue to break the rules.
&quot;This is a message for those who feel they can behave without being blamed by the accuser, and for those who are harmed by such behavior,&quot; she said.
Criminal and anti-social behavior will never be tolerated by Devon and Cornwall Police who will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal were horrified when a low-flying military plane nearly touched down on the beach
In the city of Aveiro in Portugal, tourists who love to soak up the sun are terribly afraid for their lives.
A P-3C Orion of the Portuguese Air Force flew incredibly low
The Air Force said it was on a training flight but insisted there was no safety risk.
Here is the moment when frightened tourists begin to panic, while the moment when a low-flying plane dived over a crowded beach.
Dramatic footage shows a military aircraft flying within touching distance of the hunters on a strip of sand in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
Vacationers jumped to their feet as they became understandably concerned about the noise of the aircraft&#39;s engines, but not being able to see what was moving their way through the clouds.
The incident took place last night near the city of Aveiro in Costa Nova.
Daniel Fernandes, one of several campers who posted video of the shocking flyby on social media, said: &quot;It flew really low twice and there was a moment, at one point it looked like it was going to crash.&quot;
Nuno Arroja added: &quot;I was surfing and I swear it felt like the plane was about to fall on me.&quot;
Tourists on the beach of Aveiro were terrified when the plane emerged from the fog and flew at an extremely low altitude.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that a P-3C Orion pilot was on a training flight to spot fishing boats off the coast and was forced to descend as low as it was the only way to check on them.
The pilot said the plane flew a little lower than usual due to poor visibility caused by smoke from nearby burning forests, but the air force insisted no one was in danger.
Wildfires have wreaked havoc on the Portuguese mainland this summer and have also claimed the lives of four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force issued a statement today that the pilot had to fly so low due to the circumstances - thick fog and smog from forest fires, which reduced visibility.
The aircraft was on a training flight and the pilot was instructed to locate the fishing boats as part of the mission.
The HACCP system has been mandatory for public catering for more than a year, but most cafes and restaurants in St. Petersburg have not yet implemented it.
Inspections are becoming more active, and businesses face fines of up to 1 million rubles.
For more than a year, the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP, in the Russian version of HACCP) system - risk analysis and critical control points - has been mandatory for use by food producers and carriers, as well as catering companies in Russia, as a member of the Customs Union (CU) .
Checks of business by Rospotrebnadzor for compliance with these standards in St. Petersburg began in February 2015.
But so far, officials are issuing fines only for individual violations of the regulations (see &quot;List of documents&quot; ...).
Failure to comply with the regulations as a whole will cost the enterprise 600 thousand rubles for the first violation and 1 million rubles for the second.
HACCP as a system that takes into account the risks when working with food and prevents them, was invented in the United States in the 1960s.
Then it was about the safety of food for astronauts.
Now the system is used at all food enterprises not only in the USA, but also in Canada and the European Union.
Since February 2015, HACCP has been operating on the territory of the Customs Union.
The business had 4 years to develop and implement the system (the HACCP requirement appeared in the technical regulations of the Customs Union in 2011).
However, both entrepreneurs themselves and officials admit that most companies have not even heard of this rule.
Unfortunately, we were sure for a long time that the norm applies only to food production, and not to restaurateurs, - explained the head of the Public Council, Elena Tsereteli.
Now everyone is trying to catch up.
The expected date for the resumption of charter flights to Turkey is the end of August - the beginning of September.
But they will not cause a rush demand, since their target audience - families with children - is already preparing for school, experts say.
The Alliance of Travel Agencies yesterday sent a letter to the government asking them to allow charters now.
&quot;For many Russian tourists, the issue of choosing a quality and affordable seaside vacation is unsolvable, since in the resorts of the Krasnodar Territory and the Republic of Crimea, most accommodation facilities have already been booked until the end of September,&quot; the authors of the letter note and emphasize that the opening of charter flights in August will not significantly affect already established demand for Russian marine tourism product.
According to the North-West Regional Branch of the Russian Union of Travel Industry (PCT), if the aviation departments of Russia and Turkey quickly agree, the resumption of charter flights to Turkey can be expected within a month.
There is no clear understanding of when charters will be resumed, it depends primarily on the aviation authorities.
Technically, planes can fly in September, even August, if tour operators quickly build programs and agree with airlines on the aircraft they need on the route,&quot; says Pavel Rumyantsev, Deputy Director for Communications and International Projects of the North-West Regional Branch of the PCT.
According to him, the possible resumption of charters is good news, but will not affect the balance of power in the market too much, because the main buyers of charter tours - families with children - have already returned from vacation and are preparing for school or vacationing in other countries.
In the velvet season, tours are bought mainly by single travelers and couples.
Charter programs can count on those who have the opportunity to relax spontaneously,&quot; says Pavel Rumyantsev.
&quot;Turkey has a chance to attract a lot of tourists if it now gives very budget offers - 50-60 thousand rubles for a tour for two, because there are people who are purposefully waiting for very cheap tours,&quot; says Valeria Rozental, CEO of the Optio travel agency -Travel.
Otherwise, you should definitely not count on the excitement - the bulk of the trips have already been planned.
Pavel Rumyantsev also believes that since there is a demand for regular flights to Turkey, charters will also be in demand, but there is no need to expect a rush.
&quot;For Turkey, the launch of charters now is a rehearsal for the next season,&quot; says Pavel Rumyantsev.
&quot;The opening of charters to Turkey is positive news for the next season,&quot; agrees Valeria Rubtsova.
The Tax Code provides for exemption from personal income tax for compensation payments established by law within the limits of approved norms related to compensation for harm caused by injury or other damage to health.
The issuance of milk to workers employed in work with harmful working conditions, according to established standards, is provided for by Art. 222 of the Labor Code of the Russian Federation.
At the same time, the very norms and conditions for extradition are established by order of the Ministry of Health and Social Development of Russia dated February 16, 2009 No. 45n.
According to this document, free distribution of milk or other equivalent food products is made to employees on the days of actual employment in jobs with harmful working conditions due to the presence of harmful production factors at the workplace.
Based on these norms, the Federal Tax Service of Russia in the letter in question came to the conclusion that on the basis of par. 2 p. 3 art. 217 of the Tax Code of the Russian Federation exempt from personal income tax income in the form of the cost of milk issued to employees on the days of actual employment in jobs with harmful working conditions in accordance with the Norms and conditions approved by order of the Ministry of Health and Social Development of Russia dated February 16, 2009 No. 45n.
Moscow &quot;Gazstroybank&quot; was left without a license from the Central Bank.
On Friday, August 12, 2016, the Central Bank of Russia revoked the banking license from the credit organization Joint Stock Commercial Bank GAZSTROYBANK, registered in Moscow.
According to the regulator, JSCB GAZSTROYBANK pursued a high-risk credit policy associated with the placement of funds in low-quality assets.
An adequate assessment of the risks taken at the request of the supervisory authority and a reliable reflection of the value of the bank&#39;s assets led to the emergence of grounds for the credit institution to take measures to prevent bankruptcy.
In addition, the credit institution was involved in dubious transit transactions.
A temporary administration has been appointed in the bank for a period of validity until the date of appointment as a bankruptcy trustee or liquidator.
The powers of the credit organization&#39;s executive bodies have been suspended in accordance with federal laws.
JSCB GAZSTROYBANK is a member of the deposit insurance system.
Recall that the payment of insurance compensation to bank depositors, including individual entrepreneurs, in accordance with Federal Law No. 177-FZ &quot;On insurance of deposits of individuals in banks of the Russian Federation&quot; is provided for in the amount of 100% of the balance of funds, but not more than 1.4 million rub. in aggregate per depositor.
Payments, according to the Deposit Insurance Agency, will begin no later than August 26, 2016.
According to the financial statements, as of August 1, 2016 JSCB GAZSTROYBANK ranked 335th in the banking system of the Russian Federation in terms of assets.
London schoolgirl who joined ISIS dies in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, has reportedly died in Syria.
Lawyer Tasneem Akunji said her family learned of her death in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.
She is believed to have died in a Russian airstrike in Raqqa, the group&#39;s stronghold in the country, ITV News was told on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, she died just as she was planning to leave the war-torn country and return to England.
&quot;One can only hope that the only advantage of all this - as a tombstone and a testament to others, that these are exactly the risks that come with traveling to a war zone - to dissuade people from ever making the same choice,&quot; Akunji said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other East London schoolgirls boarded a plane to Turkey and then a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana&#39;s family was told she married an ISIS fighter in Syria and became a widow within months.
Reid Says Clinton Will Remain Loyal To Garland As Chief Justice Candidate If Elected
Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid says he is convinced Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Justice Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if elected as president.
Senate Republicans blocked Garland&#39;s confirmation since President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the next president will choose someone who can replace last Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
Reed said on Thursday&#39;s conference call that he predicts Clinton will pick Garland &quot;with some degree of confidence.&quot;
Reed&#39;s spokeswoman later said he did not speak directly to Clinton about whether she would run Garland and was merely speculating.
He praised Garland and said the Clinton team would not want to &quot;rock the boat&quot; with a new choice.
Garland is Chief Justice of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Reed said the Republicans who are blocking Garland&#39;s nomination are &quot;henchmen&quot; and &quot;accomplices&quot; of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump was not fit for the position.
Treats says erotic calendars are for &#39;women as well as men&#39;
Treats magazine has partnered with photographer David Ballmer to release a 2017 calendar inspired by 1970s Pirelli.
But instead of naked celebrities, they&#39;re aiming to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 nude muses calendar.
Treats president Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his nude magazine is different from old-fashioned Playboy because &quot;Playboy is for men.&quot;
I make it for women.
Obviously he thinks the calendar is too.
&quot;We need to get back to showcasing the timeless and classic nude, where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired by these images of the female body,&quot; Shaw said in a press release announcing the calendar.
Women will want to be a part of this project because it is a beautiful work of art.
Models can submit photos online or in person at open castings in Los Angeles and New York.
Muscovites will be handed out a memo about unscrupulous online stores.
In Moscow, they are going to issue a memo that will tell you how not to become a victim of an online store.
This was reported in Rospotrebnadzor, writes M24.
It is reported that the specialists of the department are preparing a memo that will help citizens choose the right online store and recognize possible fraudulent schemes.
The concept of this brochure includes several sections.
This will be general information and the legal framework, the rules for the delivery of goods, ways to protect their legal rights.
The annex will give recommendations on how to properly file a claim and so on,&quot; Rospotrebnadzor said.
The memo is currently being finalized.
Subsequently, it will be posted on the website of Rospotrebnadzor in Moscow, it is also planned to release a printed version and distribute it to Muscovites.
The Russian Foreign Ministry issued a statement in which it named the second suspect in the organization of sabotage in Crimea.
Persons from among the citizens of Ukraine and Russia who assisted in the preparation of terrorist acts were detained.
Among them are Panov Evgeny Alexandrovich and Zakhtey Andrey Romanovich.
&quot;They all give confessions,&quot; the statement said.
Earlier, a resident of the Zaporizhia region, Yevgeny Panov, who was detained on suspicion of organizing terrorist attacks in Crimea, admitted his guilt during interrogation.
FAS will fine Google 438 million rubles.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service of Russia (FAS) has imposed an administrative fine on Google in the amount of 438 million rubles, according to the agency&#39;s website.
&quot;The fine for Google for violating antitrust laws amounted to 438 million rubles.
We hope that the company will comply with our decision and pay the fine in the near future,&quot; said Aleksey Dotsenko, deputy head of the Federal Antimonopoly Service.
During the investigation, the FAS found that Google supplies the Google Play app store to manufacturers of smartphones sold in Russia only on the condition that other corporation applications are installed on the device.
Among these applications is the search engine, which should be placed on the main screen of the smartphone.
Thus, the corporation violates Part 1 of Art. 10 of the Federal Law &quot;On Protection of Competition&quot; (abuse of dominant position).
We are confident that the implementation of the order will provide an opportunity for the development of competition in the mobile software market in Russia, which will have a positive impact on our customers.
The Law &quot;On Protection of Competition&quot; must be observed by all companies whose products are supplied to the territory of the Russian Federation, including transnational corporations,&quot; said Elena Zayeva, Head of the Department for Regulation of Communications and Information Technologies of the Federal Antimonopoly Service of Russia.
The department suspects 16 Russian stores of collusion.
The New Book Network was fined for selling the book 50 Days Before My Suicide.
The New Bookstore chain has been fined for selling Stace Kramer&#39;s book 50 Days Before My Suicide, the Moscow City News Agency reports.
Rospotrebnadzor said without specifying the amount of the fine, the text of the book can be considered as &quot;provoking or motivating suicidal behavior in children and adolescents.&quot;
The Ostankinsky District Court confirmed the violation of the established requirements for the dissemination of information products among children and decided to impose a fine with confiscation of 49 copies of printed materials arrested by the Rospotrebnadzor department.
A source in the &quot;New book&quot; confirmed that we are talking about the work of Stace Kramer.
In March of this year, it was reported that the largest bookstores in Moscow were checking for the availability of the book &quot;50 days before my suicide.&quot;
An evening in memory of Ernst Neizvestny will be held in Moscow.
Moscow will host an evening in memory of sculptor Ernst Neizvestny, TASS reports.
The event will take place on August 15 at the Central House of Writers.
Unfortunately, not everyone will be able to say goodbye to the Unknown in the US in person.
Therefore, it was decided to organize this evening for those who want to commemorate him in their native land,&quot; the press service of the Russian Jewish Congress said.
They noted that this is important for the widow of the sculptor Anna Graham and his friends around the world.
Close friends of the Unknown are invited to the evening, including the poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko, the artist Boris Messerer, the president of the Pushkin Museum im. Pushkin Irina Antonova, director Mark Rozovsky, as well as Russian Minister of Culture Vladimir Medinsky, head of the Moscow Department of Culture Alexander Kibovsky, Deputy Mayor of Moscow Leonid Pechatnikov.
Earlier it was reported that the relatives of Ernst Neizvestny are planning to hold a memorial service for the sculptor in New York, presumably before August 14.
Vinyl End User: Who Really Buys Records?
Single middle-aged men love vinyl.
And as long as you haven&#39;t littered the comments section with rude insults under the pseudonym Not All Single Middle Aged Men, this statement follows from the factual data.
According to YouGov, the much-discussed record revival is not driven by a millennial boom that wants to embrace the newness of a material thing, but by middle-aged nostalgia.
Those who recently bought a vinyl album are more likely to be between the ages of 45 and 54, according to the data.
Moreover, those who belong to the 18-24 age group are the least likely.
It&#39;s not just an act of amateur gathering either - it has emotional implications: older vinyl buyers are slightly more likely to keep their feelings to themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy being alone (69% vs. 66%).
But are YouGov&#39;s results correct?
If this blog were a TV news report, the camera would follow me as I walked down the middle of a busy Soho street, wearing a modest gray suit and gesticulating wildly before stopping, folding my arms and saying something impressive like: &quot;Okay, let&#39;s see .&quot;
So, let&#39;s see.
While the heart of Soho is slowly shedding its charm and filth - hotels, cafes, Paperchase stores now fill buildings once occupied by independent sellers - a few record stores with fantastic specialists still remain.
I would probably ask the camera to stop for the next scene in which I am close to various people in some of these stores and try to gauge their age and emotional state through observation.
Glaswegian Stewart, 55, who I followed from Sister Ray (count: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (count: eight middle-aged men, one woman probably over 20), in London for half a day to have a meeting, and walking around the shops to take a few hours.
Is he a collector, I ask?
&quot;I guess so,&quot; he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These records, pictured above (he e-mailed me the picture, I didn&#39;t follow him home), run in lines along the walls of his living room.
His reason for acquiring so many albums and singles stems in part from his disposable income: he can now buy records he couldn&#39;t afford when they first came out and buy back items he sold when he was young and broke.
&quot;A lot of what I buy is late 60s, early 70s, stuff that came out when I was 11 or 12, stuff I was probably too young to buy for.&quot; he says.
He agrees that record buyers are more likely to be introverts who enjoy their own company, adding: &quot;I don&#39;t smoke, I don&#39;t drink very much.
This is my shortcoming.
Wez, 25, who works for Sister Ray, also believes that many of the clients he meets fit the YouGov profile.
He did, however, notice a new wave of people influenced by the media hype, people who heard about the comeback and felt compelled to buy back their old records.
From the conversations I&#39;ve had, people got rid of their collection, usually around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their vinyl to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy back their records,&quot; he says.
This may explain the boom among vinyl revivalists of a certain age.
And what about the alleged emotional importance of the records?
It only takes a few seconds to spend a few seconds in a store like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a comfortable community for like-minded people.
According to Wez, some older clients in particular are offended by the cashless payment system.
Some vinyl lovers may feel overwhelmed by the digital world and prefer to retire to the permanence of familiar record sleeves, items that evoke memories of serene adolescence.
&quot;I think sometimes it can be filling a void or having material things as a kind of comfort,&quot; says Wez.
Since I&#39;m a collector myself, I have it, and I think a lot of people have it too.
This is an easy way to keep your head busy.
&quot;We&#39;re like their social workers!&quot; said a colleague from the record rack.
An ICM poll in April showed that nearly 50% of the people who bought a vinyl album last month hadn&#39;t listened to it yet.
The survey also found that 41% own a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy vinyl do not have a record player.
At this point in the news report, I would probably look seriously puzzled as I flip through the rack of Bosanov collections.
The &quot;trophy&quot; aspect of the resurgence is something Johnny, 42, who works for Sounds of the Universe noticed (data count: three middle-aged men).
&quot;Someone came in recently and said, &#39;I don&#39;t have a turntable, but I want to buy a Radiohead record so we can put it on our shelf,&#39;&quot; he says.
It&#39;s not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.
More component of the product, less music.
We have people who say, &quot;I don&#39;t have a record player.&quot;
These are younger people, not older, a little under twenty who are just getting to know this.
Fopp, who has now devoted almost the entire floor to vinyl, has a much more diverse audience when I visit.
There are couples in their 70s, tourists taking pictures, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Although the atmosphere is less laid-back than the aforementioned stores - Wild Beast&#39;s latest synth-and-sexy-pop, rather than jazz improvisation, blasts through the speakers - it&#39;s nice to see diversity in your customers.
None of them seem particularly lonely, but the excruciating psychological trauma is difficult to ascertain after standing for 30 seconds next to someone.
Eleanor, 27, walked around Fopp for several minutes looking at the various records available for sale.
She looks at the goods, but does not spend money.
She doesn&#39;t make much money, she says, so collecting records isn&#39;t a good option.
It is expensive.
Listening to music on a computer or other device is easy, but the beauty of vinyl is…” she drifts off into her dreams with a sigh overflowing with love.
I don&#39;t know how to explain - it&#39;s really unique.
My last stop is a store that is said to have spearheaded a new generation of vinyl lovers: the Urban Mods.
While I pretend to be looking at skinny denim shorts, I watch a group of teenage girls gather around a Polaroid camera every minute before a father and his daughter start discussing buying a Crosley record player.
To the left is a staircase whose wall is lined with records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mack: a mix of modern and classic, a must-have record for any average collection.
No one is looking - perhaps because they are just decoration, some are placed so high on the wall that it would be impossible to touch them.
This is a real &quot;art vinyl&quot;.
But given that any publicity for these items could mean more money for the industry and send a few customers into the Soho hinterland for a while longer, there&#39;s little to complain about.
Not surprisingly, the segment of the population that is more likely than most to have more time and money than most is the one that spends the most money on luxury goods like vinyl.
But while my findings suggest that YouGov&#39;s results are accurate, at least in Soho record stores, they do not rule out the vast number of female vinyl collectors and lovers that exist in the real world, in record stores and on online forums.
These people are probably hard at work in schools or offices.
But they obviously don&#39;t spend Thursday mornings strolling through the Berwick Street record shops, flipping through records and avoiding the eyes of the obnoxious 30-year-old fake presenter who looms over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Greenland polar shark - the longest-lived vertebrate animal - video report
Scientists say that the Greenland shark has the longest lifespan of all vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studies these sharks, says the record was set by a female 272 to 512 years old and five meters long.
French court rejects proposal to demolish stores in Jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected a proposal by the Calais authorities to demolish dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp, which is home to thousands of refugees.
In court hearings this week, Calais officials said the state should be able to demolish a total of 72 makeshift stores where people inside the camp sell goods ranging from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts or sell tea for 50 cents (40r) or the simplest meals. for a few euros in makeshift restaurants.
The prefecture of Calais has argued that these places should be demolished because they are a parallel economy that does not pay taxes and because they carry fire and sanitation risks.
Humanitarian groups told the court that shops and restaurants are vital, arguing that the free meals offered by the pro-government association and other groups do not provide enough food for the camp&#39;s growing numbers.
They said that makeshift shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food for those in need.
A Lille court ruled that there was no legal basis to kick out the people running the 72 makeshift stores, but said the Calais prefecture&#39;s problems &quot;were completely understandable.&quot;
Judge Jean-Francois Mollat said that groceries, cafes and restaurants played a much larger role than just feeding people who &quot;live in extremely precarious conditions.&quot;
He said the spaces provided peaceful meeting points for refugees and volunteers.
One site that was threatened with demolition was the camp&#39;s Jungle Book Children&#39;s Café, which operates for no profit and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes and shelter counseling for hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors in the camp.
Over 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect the kids cafe.
A letter sent to the Guardian said that its closure &quot;would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are no more than eight years old.&quot;
Two charities, Refugee Aid and L&#39;Auberge des Migrants on Friday estimated that numbers at the Jungle camp have risen to over 9,000 people - the highest ever - after a surge in new arrivals during the summer.
Libraries of microdistricts invite young freemen to educational programs.
This week, branch libraries will hold meetings dedicated to the City Day, the Year of Russian Cinema, and even the Athlete&#39;s Day.
The programs are aimed at a children&#39;s audience, so for the most part they will be held in a playful way.
Today, August 10, branch library No. 2, in a suburban microdistrict, invites you to the cruise presentation &quot;My Town is Small&quot;.
On August 11, in the library-branch No. 1, a local history hour &quot;I live in this city, I know this city&quot; will take place.
On the same day, the library-branch No. 2 will host a multimedia lesson &quot;Past destiny of the native land.&quot;
And in the branch library No. 4 in Surazhevka there is a game program &quot;Film, film, film&quot;.
On Sunday, August 14, for children from the northern microdistrict, library-branch No. 3 will hold a game program &quot;Fizkult-hello!&quot;.
Britain settles for silver in rugby sevens after Fiji masterclass lets them take gold
Great Britain&#39;s impressive run of Rugby Sevens was devastatingly halted at the final hurdle by Team Fiji in Thursday night&#39;s final when they were completely crushed 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji gave a masterclass in ball possession, passing, slips, backing the game, running lines and brute force to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat came with the not-too-poor consolation of a silver - Britain&#39;s third of the day - and they could be proud of their efforts in the first Olympic Rugby Sevens tournament, defeating New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa along the way.
The painful beating of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-finals earlier in the day, could come back to hurt them in the final.
But, in spite of everything, Fiji in this form won the best team of 15 people.
It may be some consolation for the UK - but probably not - that at least one Brit will hang a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: Fiji head coach Ben Ryan, former England chief from Wimbledon.
This has been some travel for the UK.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens.
Here they lost only one.
These blows will hurt, but the progress is amazing.
Fiji got off to a great start, parrying British attempts to intercept the ball for fun.
It was like running into a line of moving buses for captain Tom Mitchell and company, and the World Series champions went up 5-0 when Osea Kolinisau ducked into a corner.
With four minutes on the clock, Jerryr Tuwai added another touchdown down the right flank, which was converted.
12-0 and Great Britain barely touched the ball.
Mitchell&#39;s superb interception attempt kept man-mountain Leon Nakarawa from scoring third, but that only delayed Fiji.
Jasa Veremalua scored a touchdown in the right corner in the seventh minute and Great Britain were down 17-0.
Nakarawa added another after the resumption and the clock was still over a minute...in the first half.
Watemo Ravovo then broke through more half-hearted UK interception attempts and took the line by storm to score a point.
The implementation led to 29-0 at halftime.
It looked as if Fiji was born to play rugby sevens while the UK is still mastering the craft.
Which to a large extent it is.
Great Britain were making massive substitutions in the half of the game and they plugged the Fijian dam... for the full four minutes, which was good by first half standards, until Joshua Tuisova got through after some brilliant Fijian interactions.
Dan Norton snatched a try for Great Britain with a touchdown in the left corner to make it 36-7, but the game had long gone the way of the South Sea Islanders, whose fans sang, waved flags and danced in the stands.
It was impossible not to admire Fiji&#39;s joyful approach.
Mata William embellished a Fijian cake that needed no embellishment with another attempt in the final seconds.
The whistle blew, the Fijians embraced, and Great Britain fell to the pitch, completely defeated.
Earlier in the day, Fiji defeated Japan 20-5 in their semi-final and Great Britain narrowly edged out South Africa in a tight semi-final of one try each - the difference between British implementation.
Kyle Brown put the Boks ahead in the first half, but Dan Norton broke the line with some great footwork and scored under the beams in the second half.
A brilliant last interception attempt from Marcus Watson, brother of England&#39;s 15th-a side team, Anthony, secured the win - and ultimately the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired to win rowing by coach&#39;s battle with cancer
There will be no more exciting gold in these games, and that&#39;s saying something.
From the first move to the last, 220 heavy lifts in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found the added value of their golden moment on the Estacio da Lagoa.
Though they were the two that pulled the oars, there were three voices in that boat, an echo of coach Robin Williams was always there as they strove for their second straight Olympic gold in women&#39;s doubles, the first women in the annals of British sport to reach that height.
Their dominance was absolute, after all it was their 39th undefeated performance, again unprecedented.
What we see, two brilliant athletes gliding across the surface with the elegance of swans, does not fully capture the nature of the triumph.
Every gold was rowed by a battalion of ready hands contributing to incremental victories that matter, and there are no hands that were more important than the hands of a coach who, 30 months ago, when he was diagnosed with cancer, did not know if he would live to see to see this day.
As he said, it was a dangerous business.
I had bladder cancer which is one of the things they can operate on and they did.
If they don&#39;t, it goes everywhere.
It could be a pretty bad situation.
It slightly changes your views on the future.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio were lucky that they could start treatment early in 2014 during the off-season, keeping the schedule gap minimal, if that&#39;s the right word in circumstances like these.
I needed payment, so I needed to get better quickly.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and I was walking around the ward - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time, although they said a few steps were enough.
Here&#39;s how it starts.
Rowing itself is a journey, but that makes it a little more.
The moment after the victory, their first thoughts were of Williams, who had spent a nervous morning talking a little more than usual in an attempt to overcome his own feelings.
Stanning, an artillery captain with a service in Afghanistan, said: &quot;I&#39;ve been an emotional wreck this week, maybe a little too much, but it means so much.&quot;
It just confirms how much this means to me, how much Helen and I have worked, and Robin too.
It&#39;s been a fantastic three years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we would be nothing, so many thanks to him, he is the best coach in the world.
I couldn&#39;t ask for a better training partner or a better trainer.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in five years.
This pair sets a tense pace that their competitors have never been able to match.
Even in the final 500 meters, as the New Zealand and Danish teams began to close in, Stanning and Glover had too much to spare.
We were strongly in phase.
Helen called: &#39;stay in the process, stay in the process&#39;.
Now it is very important not to get carried away.
We had a good start and at the same time we didn&#39;t try to do something amazing.
We weren&#39;t expecting fireworks today, we were just expecting to be able to row well and get out and win this race, which we did.
It will take the couple a year to decide their future.
Glover needs to be at her own wedding next month with TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn&#39;t want to say that this is my last race.
It would mean too much pressure.
It took about six months in London to realize that I had become an Olympic champion.
It was all so new and I was so tense.
It took about four minutes here.
I feel so much better,&quot; she said.
The government extended the deadline for the destruction of sanctioned products
The government extended until the end of 2017 the deadline for the destruction of food products prohibited from being imported into Russia.
The corresponding decree was signed by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, it is published on the official portal of legal information.
An embargo against countries that have imposed anti-Russian sanctions due to the situation in Ukraine was introduced in our country in August 2014.
Subsequently, the ban was repeatedly extended, now it is valid until December 31, 2017.
It is forbidden to import certain types of agricultural products, raw materials and foodstuffs from the USA, EU countries, Canada, Australia, Norway, Ukraine, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland and Liechtenstein into Russia.
In particular, meat and meat products, fish, seafood, vegetables, fruits and dairy products were banned.
Disposal of food imported into the country in circumvention of the embargo has been carried out in Russia since August 2015.
In the first quarter of 2016 alone, about 100 tons of prohibited products were withdrawn from sale.
Hunting for the &quot;forbidden&quot;
On Friday, rain and thunderstorms are expected in Moscow.
An atmospheric front will pass through the capital region, which will bring precipitation and lower the air temperature.
During the day, the air will warm up to 25 degrees Celsius.
So, on the night of Saturday in Moscow in places it will be intermittent rain, thunderstorms and wind gusts up to 15 m/s are possible.
In the afternoon rain is expected with thunderstorms and wind gusts up to 12-17 m/s.
Rains with thunderstorms are also predicted in the Oryol, Kursk and Voronezh regions, according to &quot;Dni.ru&quot;.
Precipitation is unlikely for the next working week.
A panel of WTO arbitrators has found that Russian import duties on paper, refrigerators and palm oil are contrary to the organization&#39;s rules.
Import rates exceed the obligations assumed by Russia when joining the WTO.
&quot;This is the first time that the WTO has taken a decision against the Russian Federation,&quot; the organization&#39;s official website says.
However, the arbitrators emphasized in their opinion that the European Union did not provide sufficient evidence that Russia&#39;s measures &quot;were systematic&quot; or &quot;were comprehensive.&quot;
Russia, in turn, promised to adapt import duties on paper and refrigerators in the near future.
This is stated in the message of the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia.
On July 4, it was reported that Kyiv intends to complain to the World Trade Organization about the actions of Russia, which introduced additional restrictions on the transit of Ukrainian goods.
This is stated in the statement of the government of Ukraine.
In May, the Financial Times wrote that the US behavior in resolving contentious issues in the WTO undermines the organization&#39;s principles of discussion.
A similar statement was made by Brazil, Japan, the European Union and other members of the WTO because of the refusal of the Americans to approve the South Korean judge Jang Song-hwa for a second term.
In this regard, Russia will not apply to the WTO on the issue of Western sanctions imposed against the Russian Federation.
The WTO is an international organization established in January 1995 to liberalize international trade.
Now it includes 162 countries.
Russia joined it in 2012.
The head of the presidential administration has changed
Russian President Vladimir Putin appointed former deputy Sergei Ivanov Anton Vaino as head of his own administration.
Vladimir Putin reshuffled the presidential administration and expressed hope that the new head of his administration would contribute to the constructive work of the government and the Kremlin.
In turn, Anton Vaino during the meeting said that he considers important the anti-corruption work that Ivanov began to carry out as head of the presidential administration, and promised to cooperate with the government.
Earlier, Izvestia wrote that experts consider the situation with the resignation of Sergei Ivanov from the post of head of the administration transparent and understandable, and the reshuffle will not fundamentally change anything in the activities of the Kremlin administration.
They note that the leader who worked in the presidential administration for quite a long time, who effectively built the activities of the Presidential Administration, has left.
He was replaced by Deputy Head of Administration Anton Vaino, a man who knows very well the specifics of this work.
Poland admits that they will not buy fuel from Gazprom.
The state-owned Polish oil and gas company PGNIG does not exclude that in a few years gas supplies from the Russian Federation may become unattractive for it due to the reorientation to fuel from Norway and other countries.
This was announced by the vice-president of the Polish company for finance Bohuslav Mazhets.
His words are reported by TASS.
&quot;It may happen that we will not buy gas at all (from Gazprom), we are now diversifying our supplies.
Within the next four years, the main directions of supplies for us will be the East, raw materials from LNG terminals and Norway,&quot; Mazhets said.
At present, Gazprom occupies a dominant position in gas supplies to Poland.
On Friday, August 12, PGNIG reported that the Russian supplier in the first half of 2016 supplied it with almost 5.3 billion cubic meters. m of gas, which is 30% higher than in 2015.
The Russian gas giant&#39;s share in PGNIG&#39;s purchases rose to 49.8% from 40% a year earlier.
Recall that on July 22, the Polish Antimonopoly Office did not agree on the creation of a joint venture between Gazprom and its European partners to build the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.
At the same time, a month earlier, Poland left a request to Gazprom for the supply of 11 billion cubic meters. m of gas via Nord Stream 2.
This was stated by Deputy Chairman of the Board of the holding Alexander Medvedev.
An auction for the capacity of Nord Stream 2 will take place in 2017, and in autumn 2016 it is planned to hold an auction for its laying.
At the end of May, it was reported that Gazprom was not yet planning to take any action in connection with the intentions of the Polish side to abandon long-term contracts for the supply of gas from Russia after 2022, Alexander Medvedev, deputy chairman of the board of the company, said.
He recalled that in the first quarter of this year, the Poles only increased gas purchases from Russia by 42%.
The deputy chairman of Gazprom added that the very fact that the Polish PGNIG filed an application with the Stockholm Arbitration Court does not mean the termination of negotiations.
Earlier, the Polish company applied to the court to reduce the purchase price for Russian gas.
Let us remind you that Piotr Naimsky, Commissioner of the Polish Government for Gas and Energy Infrastructure, said that the Polish authorities had decided not to renew the contract with Gazprom for the supply of gas.
Poland&#39;s contract with Gazprom was signed in 1996 and expires in 2022.
In March, Piotr Naimsky, the authorized representative of the Polish government for gas and energy infrastructure, said that his country could refuse to supply blue fuel from the east in six years.
According to him, Warsaw plans to build a new terminal for the supply of liquefied natural gas Baltic Pipe, which will connect the country with the Norwegian shelf.
Nord Stream 2 provides for the construction of two strings of an offshore gas pipeline with a total capacity of 55 billion cubic meters. m of gas per year from Russia to Germany along the bottom of the Baltic Sea.
The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) has increased the number of observers near the border between Ukraine and Crimea.
This was announced by the first deputy head of the SMM in Ukraine Alexander Hug.
&quot;I can confirm that the SMM has increased the number of observers in this area,&quot; he said, answering a related question from journalists, RIA Novosti reports.
According to the OSCE, the situation on the border between Ukraine and Crimea is calm, no incidents affecting security have been recorded there.
The observers monitored what was happening at three checkpoints across the Russian-Ukrainian border.
A video of a Yak-42 passenger plane that landed at Ufa airport, which rolled out of the runway by 400 meters and fell on the left wing, appeared on the Web.
The video was published by the 360 TV channel.
The incident happened at 4:30 Moscow time.
The KrasAvia flight arrived from Sochi.
They were quickly evacuated to safety, and there were no casualties.
The aircraft itself was transported to the parking lot.
Ufa airport operates as usual.
The Volga Investigation Department for Transport of the TFR began to find out the reason for the hard landing of the plane of the liner.
The UN is investigating the use of chemical weapons in Syria.
A UN special commission is investigating the possible use of toxic gas in rebel-held areas of the Syrian city of Aleppo.
All parties to the conflict deny the use of chlorine, but the UN special envoy for Syria, Steffan de Mistura, considers the fact of what happened to be indisputable.
Similar statements were made on the eve of the third round of intra-Syrian talks, which are due to begin in late August in Geneva.
UN experts have launched an investigation into reports of the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian city of Aleppo.
The first information about a terrorist attack using a toxic gas, presumably chlorine, appeared on August 2.
Then the opposition said that in the area where the Russian military transport helicopter was shot down the day before, aviation dropped bombs with a poisonous substance, but in Moscow these accusations were called stuffing.
Later, the Russian Ministry of Defense blamed the opposition group Harakat Nur al-Din az-Zinki for the incident.
It soon became known that there were two bombs filled with toxic gas.
This was confirmed to the BBC by one of the victims.
“A few minutes later, I smelled gas, my eyes began to burn, it became difficult to breathe,” an eyewitness quoted the publication as saying.
As a result of the attack, at least 7 people were killed, 23 were hospitalized.
If the fact of the use of poison gas is confirmed by experts, the actions will be regarded as a war crime.
UN Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura told reporters: &quot;There is a lot of evidence that this really happened.&quot;
The inadmissibility of the use of chlorine for military purposes is spelled out in the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).
Despite the fact that all parties to the Syrian conflict deny the use of toxic gases, in 2015, human rights activists recorded 35 cases of the use of chlorine by the Syrian army against the &quot;moderate opposition&quot;.
The situation in Aleppo is complicated by the fact that shelling of its districts is carried out daily, and terrorists prevent the withdrawal of residents from the city.
According to Reuters, the UN is waiting for Russia to establish a &quot;humanitarian pause&quot; in hostilities.
The current regime of a daily three-hour lull in the organization is considered &quot;insufficient to help almost 2 million civilians trapped.&quot;
Staffan de Mistura&#39;s humanitarian adviser Jan Egeland said a 48-hour ceasefire would be required every week to bring aid into the city and evacuate the sick and wounded from there.
&quot;We have to send bulk cargo with a convoy of trucks in an area where the roads are practically destroyed, and those that remain are mined,&quot; Mr. Egeland said. “But the Russian delegation confirmed its readiness to sit down with us at the negotiating table.”
Consultations in Geneva between representatives of the United States and Russia regarding the establishment of a &quot;humanitarian pause&quot; continue.
How Russia opened &quot;humanitarian windows&quot; in Aleppo.
As the battle for Aleppo, Syria&#39;s second largest city, continues, Russia on August 11 announced a three-hour cessation of hostilities, which will be in effect daily from Thursday.
The creation of &quot;humanitarian windows&quot; is designed to provide conditions for the delivery of medicines, food and essentials to the city.
The decision of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation was taken against the backdrop of increasing international pressure on Moscow to curtail the military operation and facilitate the resumption of the negotiation process.
A series of explosions at resorts in Thailand killed four people.
Immediately several explosions thundered in southern Thailand on Friday morning.
Four people were killed and 19 injured in the attack.
The epicenter of the explosions fell on the city of Hua Hin.
Among the victims were ten foreigners, citizens of four states, there are no Russians among them.
None of the terrorist groups has yet taken responsibility for the incident, but the country&#39;s Interior Ministry hastened to declare that the Islamists were not involved in it.
Several people have already been detained on suspicion of organizing the explosions.
According to preliminary data from the local police, the scale and characteristics of the explosions indicate that they were directed against the military in charge of the country.
The attacks took place in popular tourist resorts, including Patong Beach in the Phuket area and the cities of Hua Hin, Trang and Surat Thani.
After the military junta came to power in the country in 2014, economic growth fell from 7.2% (2012) to 2.8% (2015), but tourism remained one of the few industries that showed development.
In 2016, 14 million people have already visited the country, which is 1.5 million more than in 2015.
The first suspects in the preparation and organization of the attacks have already been detained, police colonel Krisana Patanacharoen said.
It is too early to talk about targets, he added, but the country&#39;s Interior Ministry &quot;is confident that they are not connected with international extremist groups.&quot;
Too early to draw conclusions, said Mr. Patanacharoen. -
But we know for sure that these incidents are not directly related to any type of terrorism, in fact, these are local sabotage, and we are trying to identify those who were behind them.
The explosions happened on the birthday of Thai Queen Sikrit.
The Thai junta considers protecting the monarchy one of its top priorities, so the incident is most likely directed against it.
According to Police General Sithichai Srisopacharoenrath, the bombs were detonated remotely within half an hour of each other.
They were hidden inside trees on busy streets filled with tourists dining in restaurants.
It is already known that one of the four dead was a Thai girl selling street food.
The identity of the remaining victims is still unknown, but it is known that they are residents of four foreign countries.
Among them are four German citizens, three Dutch citizens, two Italian citizens and an Austrian citizen, according to the Royal Thai Police.
There are no Russians among the victims of the explosions, the press service of Rostourism reported.
Local experts also link the explosions to the August 7 referendum, in which 61.4% of the country&#39;s population supported the draft new constitution.
It was prepared by a constitution drafting commission appointed by the military junta.
Voters had to decide whether they supported a system in which the upper house of parliament is entirely appointed by the military and has a significant role in the election of the country&#39;s prime minister.
The new system has been adopted and will be tested for the first time in the 2017 parliamentary elections.
Recall that on May 22, 2014, a military coup took place in Thailand under the leadership of the country&#39;s army commander Prayut Chan-Ocha.
According to him, the army was motivated to take this step by the ongoing political crisis and the lack of progress in negotiations between the government and the opposition.
The military created the National Council for Peace and Order, imposed curfews and censorship, dispersed the protesters and the upper house of parliament.
How Bangkok ended up in a state of emergency
The Thai government, led by Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, declared a state of emergency in Bangkok and the provinces adjacent to the capital in January 2014.
The special regime lasted 60 days.
Like two explosions in Bangkok.
In January 2014, in the center of Bangkok, at the Victory Monument, where one of the main protests took place, two explosions occurred, as a result of which 28 people were injured, five of them were in critical condition.
Explosions were made by unknown people on motorcycles.
Authorities have stepped up security in the capital and deployed military forces to protect demonstrators.
Development of conditions began in Sukhoi Log.
As Kommersant has learned, the government has been asked to agree on the draft terms of the auction for the Sukhoi Log gold deposit, while maintaining two key restrictions.
It is proposed not to allow companies where 25% or more is owned by foreigners, and those applicants whose capital will not have at least 25% state participation, to be excluded from the auction.
Industry participants are not waiting for the government to rewrite the conditions, noting that many players do not dare to take on a complex and expensive project anyway.
The auction may be announced in August and held in October.
The Ministry of Natural Resources has submitted to the government a draft order and auction conditions for the largest undeveloped gold deposit in Russia, Sukhoi Log (Irkutsk region, reserves and resources - 130 million ounces), two Kommersant sources familiar with the situation told Kommersant.
The project was submitted on Wednesday evening, one of them clarifies.
The Ministry of Natural Resources confirmed to Kommersant that the project had been submitted to the government.
A representative of Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Khloponin, who oversees subsoil use, told Kommersant that the project had not yet been received by the official&#39;s office.
&quot;The auction may be announced as early as August, immediately after the government decree is issued, and taking into account the deadline for collecting applications from potential participants (at least 45 days), the tender may take place as early as October,&quot; the Ministry of Natural Resources says.
According to Kommersant&#39;s information, the project retained two key requirements for potential participants, spelled out in the version that was sent for approval to ministries and federal executive authorities in July (Kommersant has it).
The first is the presence in the capital of applicants of at least 25% state participation.
The second is the denial of access to the auction for companies controlled by foreign investors, based on the understanding of FZ-57 on foreign investment in strategic companies.
According to the two articles of the Federal Law specified in the draft, as Kommersant already wrote on August 2, companies whose beneficiaries (25% of shares and more) are not tax residents of the Russian Federation or have dual citizenship may not be allowed to participate in the auction.
The government has the right to impose such restrictions, since Sukhoi Log belongs to the subsoil of federal significance (reserves of more than 50 tons of gold).
The Ministry of Natural Resources confirmed that the project &quot;contains restrictions on the admission of foreign companies,&quot; but declined to comment on the details until the government ordered.
The demand for state participation in the capital of the auction participants was put forward by the Irkutsk region, Kommersant was told in December 2015 in the Ministry of Natural Resources and later confirmed by the governor of the region Sergey Levchenko, noting that it was sent to the Ministry of Natural Resources by his predecessor Sergei Eroshchenko, &quot;who had agreements on investment projects with Rostec &quot;&quot;.
Kommersant&#39;s interlocutors do not specify who lobbied for the restriction on the admission of foreigners.
&quot;But it&#39;s in the spirit of the times: not to give up control in the largest gold deposit in Russia against the backdrop of Western sanctions,&quot; says Kommersant&#39;s interlocutor, who is familiar with the preparations for the auction.
The head of the Ministry of Natural Resources, Sergey Donskoy, said on August 1 that foreigners &quot;may join the consortium&quot; if applicants attract them &quot;as a financial structure, technological partners.&quot;
Kommersant&#39;s interlocutors consider it unlikely that the government will adjust the conditions.
The main contender for Sukhoi Log in the industry is considered a consortium of the largest gold miner of the Russian Federation PJSC Polyus, controlled by the son of Suleiman Kerimov Said, and Rostec.
As Kommersant wrote, in July the partners created the SL Zoloto joint venture, where Polyus has a 51% stake, and the Rostec structure RT-GR has a 49%.
Rostec declined to comment, Polyus told Kommersant that they are &quot;certainly interested in this asset&quot; and have all the necessary competencies and resources for its development.
&quot;But the final decision on the possibility and format of our participation will be made after the conditions are announced,&quot; Polyus added.
ALROSA may participate in the auction, but the decision is up to the government of the Russian Federation, Kommersant&#39;s sources said.
Russian GV Gold and Canadian Kinross, which is developing assets in Chukotka, have announced the possibility of participating in the development of Sukhoi Log, while Polymetal and Nordgold, according to Kommersant, are not interested in the asset.
The head of the Union of Gold Producers of the Russian Federation, Sergei Kashuba, in December 2015 estimated Kommersant&#39;s investment in Sukhoi Log at $2.5-4 billion.
Most potential applicants are deterred not only by the volume of investments, but also by the complexity of the project: serious additional exploration of reserves and technologies for working with complex ores are needed, Kommersant&#39;s interlocutors in the industry explain.
The largest M&amp;A deal has started on the pension market - KIT Finance Pension Administrator launched the process of merging four controlled NPFs.
As a result, on the basis of the Gazfond Pension Savings, an NPF will be created with a savings volume of about 373 billion rubles.
The launch of the procedure for merging four pension funds - KIT Finance, Promagrofond, Naslediye and Gazfond Pension Savings - was announced yesterday by the owner of 100% of the funds, LLC KIT Finance Pension Administrator.
&quot;The reorganization is carried out in agreement with the Central Bank, subject to the requirement of non-deterioration of the terms of existing contracts,&quot; the company said in a statement.
The merger is being carried out on the basis of the Gazfond Pension Savings.
According to Oleg Byaloshitsky, General Director of this NPF, the merger of funds allows us to solve several problems: expanding the geography of presence, concentrating resources for development, reducing costs, replicating the best practices of each of the funds and optimizing corporate governance.
According to him, the estimated completion date for the consolidation is the second quarter of 2017.
As a result of the merger of NPF &quot;Gazfond Pension Savings&quot; will become the largest player in the OPS market.
As of March 31, the volume of pension savings of the merging funds exceeded 373 billion rubles.
As follows from the reports on the website of the funds, the beneficiaries of their owner, KIT Finance Pension Administrator, are currently Anatoly Gavrilenko (owns 65% through controlled LLCs) and NPF Gazfond (35%).
However, the group itself launched the association much later than its competitors.
Thus, the NPF &quot;Future&quot; controlled by the O1 group absorbed &quot;Stalfond&quot; at the beginning of this year.
At present, this united NPF is merging the Uralsib and Russian Standard funds.
&quot;Unification into a single structure, in addition to reducing costs, is necessary to solve structural problems,&quot; notes Nikolay Sidorov, general director of the NPF &quot;Future&quot;.
Active work on the consolidation of funds since April has been going on in the pension group &quot;Safmar&quot; - NPF &quot;European&quot;, &quot;Education and Science&quot; and &quot;Regionfond&quot; should join the NPF &quot;Safmar&quot; before the end of this year.
In 2017, NPF &quot;Doverie&quot; will join them.
&quot;The merging of funds will give the effect of strengthening control over risks, operational processes and costs,&quot; the Safmar pension group noted.
The pause in the merging of funds, which KIT Finance Pension Administrator has withstood, can be caused by several reasons, experts point out.
Until recently, NPFs could not redeem more than 40% of the issue of infrastructure bonds in which the group was actively placed.
After amendments to the Central Bank&#39;s resolution in March of this year for a number of issuers that meet the requirements of the regulator, such restrictions no longer exist.
If necessary, the entire issue can be bought out by one major player,&quot; says Yury Nogin, director of the ACRA Financial Institutions Ratings Group.
Several heads of NPFs from the top 15 in terms of assets cite the separation of spheres of influence and, as a result, personnel appointments in a single fund, which the owners of the group had to agree on, is another possible reason for the pause.
Yesterday Anatoly Gavrilenko was not available for comment.
The NPF Gazfond also did not respond to Kommersant&#39;s request.
Although the consolidation of funds is a laborious and expensive undertaking, in the long run this decision will be justified.
According to Sergey Okolesnov, general director of the Pension Partner consulting company, Gazfond Pension Savings has fewer outflows, and the merger will help stabilize the base of the group&#39;s other funds.
At the same time, the more successful experience of NPF &quot;KIT Finance&quot; and &quot;Promagrofond&quot; in building retail sales of OPS, as well as using more modern software, will be in demand.
The requirements of the Central Bank to the processes and personnel of NPFs are constantly growing, therefore it is not advisable to duplicate the infrastructure at four funds with a single investment policy, says Pavel Mitrofanov, managing director for corporate ratings at Expert RA.
&quot;The effect of the reduction of duplicating functions will unequivocally block the possible costs of merging,&quot; Mr. Mitrofanov notes.
Sergei Okolesnov estimates the cost of merging the four funds at 30-50 million rubles.
&quot;The cost of maintaining four funds of this size is about 400 million rubles a year, with consolidation in the medium term, the budget can really be halved,&quot; Mr. Okolesnov is sure.
The kindest Disney movie &quot;Pete and his dragon&quot; was released in Russian rental.
Beautiful views of New Zealand, a touching dragon, a heartbreaking story and songs in country style are enough to believe in old-fashioned magic again, says ELENA KRAVTSUN.
The frightened baby was picked up by a dragon, who became a human cub and a gentle nanny, and a devoted friend.
Pete names his friend Elliot, after a puppy from a book of fairy tales, plays catch-up with him and falls asleep in an embrace.
Six years later, overgrown and in a loincloth, he can no longer be distinguished from another intelligent forest tomboy - Mowgli.
In this form, Pete is discovered by the red-haired female gamekeeper Grace (Bryce Dallas Howard), while the brigade of Gavin (Karl Urban), her husband&#39;s brother, aggressively cuts down the forest.
Now she will not only have to believe in the existence of the dragon, but also help save him.
Pete takes a crash course in &quot;being human&quot; surrounded by idyllic Americans who wear cowboy shirts, have a moral code in their hearts, and smile brighter than any advertisement.
No character looks or acts too terrible for the viewer to truly hate or fear.
Even Gavin, who opened the hunt for an atypical inhabitant of the forests subject to him, is far from an incorrigible villain.
The huge fluffy dragon also turned out not to be scary at all, with a kind bulldog muzzle, an airliner&#39;s wingspan and the ability to become invisible.
The dragon hums funny, purrs, even grunts and, fortunately, does not speak, but you always want to stroke him, this compares favorably with all known cinematic dragons.
Elliot&#39;s visual image and demeanor provide such a high degree of emotional involvement that in the most tense moments, not only small spectators, but also adults begin to sob desperately into three streams.
Surprisingly good is the underage Oakes Feegley as Pete, torn between a possible family and a true friend.
And Robert Redford masterfully gives out the canonical grandfather, which literally every child would be glad to have.
How did director David Lowry manage to pull off a fantastically cute remake of the forgotten 1977 Disney film Pete&#39;s Dragon, mediocre from nose to tail and remembered only for its mix of animation and live-action cinema, and make it the most heartfelt movie of the summer?
Nothing but a miracle helped.
In his painting, Lowry from the original, in fact, took only two things: the orphan Pete and the dragon.
Musical numbers and most of the strange jokes were left behind.
In this kind fairy tale, features borrowed from &quot;Bambi&quot;, &quot;Alien&quot; and many other children&#39;s pictures dear to the heart are read.
Disney Studios continues to successfully expand the gallery of high-quality remakes of the XXI century.
Of course, &quot;Pete and the Dragon&quot; is not as stunningly beautiful as the same &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;, and it does not have the masterful villain that Cate Blanchett turned out to be as a stepmother in the new &quot;Cinderella&quot;.
But this naive film no less successfully helps to believe in miracles and goodness in the best Disney traditions.
By the way, director Lowry will receive the keys to Disney&#39;s magic castle again - for the artistic film adaptation of the story about &quot;Peter Pan&quot;.
David Lowery and screenwriter Toby Halbrooks worked as a tandem in &quot;Pete and His Dragon&quot; in an ambitious new project about a boy who does not grow up based on the fairy tale of the same name by James Barry.
RBC journalist Alexander Sokolov will face new charges
Lawyers for RBC journalist Alexander Sokolov, who is accused of organizing the activities of an extremist structure, said that the prosecutor&#39;s office had found flaws in their client&#39;s case.
The fact that the prosecutor&#39;s office made such a presentation, we learned from the investigators just yesterday.
We were scheduled to participate in a court session on the issue of limiting familiarization with the materials of the criminal case, but the meeting did not take place as a result, and the investigators informed us about the presentation made by the prosecutor&#39;s office,&quot; RBC quoted lawyer Olga Dinze as saying.
She said that the prosecutor&#39;s office pointed out to the investigators that the qualifications of the case and the materials collected did not match.
Now investigators will have to fill in the gaps in the evidence base and bring new charges against Alexander Sokolov.
Either another article of the Criminal Code (CC) will appear in the case, or it will remain the same, but with different arguments and new evidence, Ms. Dinze clarifies.
As Kommersant reported, Alexander Sokolov was arrested on July 29, 2015.
In June of this year, it was reported that the investigation excluded from the accusation against the RBC journalist the wording about &quot;shaking the political situation towards instability&quot; and &quot;overthrow of power by illegal means.&quot;
Kommersantboscosport correspondent ALEXANDER ZILBERT lived the life of an Olympian in the Olympic village, inspected the house of the Russian team, dined at the local canteen and even passed the WADA test after that.
It seems that life here does not stop for a second.
Even at night.
The last starts sometimes end after midnight, after which the athletes need another hour and a half or two to return to the Olympic village.
In addition, non-stop check-in and check-out from the village is being carried out, as some athletes complete their performances and leave Brazil, while others, on the contrary, only arrive here.
Well, already at 7:30 in the morning, the heads of all Olympic delegations are drawn into one of the temporary tents.
At these meetings, we usually discuss some operational everyday issues, - says the head of the sports delegation of the Russian Olympic team, Igor Kazikov. - Despite the fact that the house in which ours is located, consider it exemplary - it was one of the first to be commissioned and demonstrated to all the inspectors, even in it there are some imperfections every now and then.
Either there are problems with hot water, then, excuse me, with toilet bowls.
We have been fighting for purity for a long time.
At first, just no one came to clean up.
Then the cleaners began to come, but they only sprinkle some substance on the floor, and that&#39;s all.
Their floors, you see, are some kind of innovative.
Like, you can’t wash them humanly.
Yes, we know these floors - ordinary laminate!
In general, we succeeded in changing the cleaning company and now everything is OK with this.
The Olympic village is a kind of South Butovo, a sleeping area, fenced on one side by mountains, on the other - by an impressive moat, sometimes filled with water.
Well, for reliability, there is still a two-meter iron fence along the entire perimeter, along which machine gunners walk along.
In total, the village can accommodate up to 17 thousand people in 3604 apartments located in 31 houses.
A huge Russian flag hangs on one of the 18-storey buildings - this house is completely devoted to the needs of our team.
Looking at the small foyer at the entrance, you can immediately determine what problems, apparently, are the most pressing for the national team.
There are two notices at the front desk: a printed &quot;Please don&#39;t throw paper in the toilet!&quot; and from the hand &quot;I will accept a gift of badges.
The rack itself is buried in booklets.
Their cheerful colors contrast with the titles of the brochures: &quot;Memo on infectious diseases for those traveling to Rio de Janeiro&quot;, &quot;First aid for drowning, foreign body in the respiratory tract, loss of consciousness - stages of cardiopulmonary resuscitation&quot;, &quot;First aid for burns, heat stroke, fractures and bleeding.&quot;
The text inside is generally reassuring.
For example, this: &quot;Infection is accompanied by fever and subsequent cure.
However, not everyone has a favorable outcome.
Of course, the Russian national team has a medical center that is ready to provide qualified assistance to residents of the house at any time, including relaxing and sports massage.
Opposite the medical center is the actual headquarters of our delegation.
Next to the door is an inspiring poster &quot;No matter what, we will win!&quot;.
And, of course, the lyrics:
All arguments are absolute nonsense!
Only those who are afraid believe in them.
Let there be fewer of us, the sweeter the taste of victories, Russia will not retreat, will not break!
And for even more uplifting of the spirit, there is an announcement: “Dear brothers and sisters!
With the blessing of His Holiness Patriarch Kirill of Moscow and All Rus&#39;, archpriest Andrey Vladimirovich Alekseev provides spiritual care for the athletes of the Russian Olympic team.
You can order a prayer service and other services by phone...
In general, on the territory of the village there is a Center for Meditation and Religious Rites for representatives of all faiths.
Well, the Russians, it turns out, are in a privileged position - they have their own chapel.
Due to the busy elevator from the ninth floor to the fourth, I decided to go down the stairs, which is recommended to be used during a fire.
And in the darkness he stumbled over the bodies lying on it.
Apparently, they were sleeping employees of the new cleaning company.
I suppose, ready at any moment to rush to wash innovative floors, they decided to arrange a quiet hour directly on the cold steps.
On the fourth floor, I met with an old acquaintance - Vitaly Fedorovich Dubko, the coach of our trampolines, who led them to Olympic gold 16 years ago in Sydney.
He and his pupil, European champion Yana Pavlova, kindly agreed to show their rooms.
By and large, there is nothing to complain about, - the honored coach of Russia shares his impressions. - We live in pairs, the beds, of course, are almost back to back, but this is not critical.
The bathroom is one for four, but spacious.
The closet, of course, is funny, made of fabric, does not inspire confidence, but things can be put.
&quot;No, well, you&#39;re guessing, they&#39;ve run out of tea!&quot; - the tennis player Svetlana Kuznetsova, whom I met in the main dining room, spreads her hands.
It is called the main one, if only because it is a space of 2.7 thousand square meters. m and is ready to receive 5 thousand visitors at the same time.
Here they give out 60 thousand portions per day for free.
The menu options are: &quot;Best of Brazil&quot;, &quot;World Cuisines&quot;, &quot;Asian Dishes&quot; and &quot;Pizza Pasta&quot;.
The last option, as I saw, is very popular with our volleyball players.
At the same time, let&#39;s say, I did not find soups in any of the departments of the giant restaurant.
What kind of soups? - Kuznetsova is surprised. - No tea!
It&#39;s good that I took Chinese with me, custard.
And a teapot.
But in general, for you to understand, the food on our courts is even worse.
Here at least something you can choose, despite the unbearable monotony.
I personally chose steamed cod and meatballs in tomato sauce.
Next to each dish there is a plate with its name in three languages - English, French and Portuguese, as well as indicating the nutritional value of the product and the presence of allergens in it.
Well, quite frankly, it was edible.
I don’t even understand why there is such a queue all the time at the local McDonald`s.
Well-fed, relaxed, one might say &quot;warm&quot; athletes at the exit of the restaurant are waiting for our best friends - representatives of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
They lure deftly - a quiz, the winner of which gets a T-shirt.
Provoking, you might say!
To receive a gift, you must correctly answer at least eight questions out of ten.
There are questions in Russian! - a girl from WADA attacked me.
But he didn&#39;t attack him.
That is, I harnessed myself in a patriotic impulse, of course.
The situation escalated already at the second question: &quot;If I received a notice of doping control, should I immediately go to the doping control station?&quot;
I settled on option B: &quot;No - I have one hour.&quot;
Lost, so to speak, vigilance.
I forgot that there is no need to expect concessions from WADA.
Basically, you need to show up immediately.
Well, at the seventh stage of the quiz, my situation became completely critical.
For some reason, I thought that if I find it difficult to follow a balanced diet due to my busy schedule (and it is difficult for me, by the way!), Then I can use supplements to get &quot;additional nutrients to increase my performance.&quot;
But no, they don&#39;t!
More precisely, the answer is formulated in such a way that it is not categorically forbidden, but strongly discouraged in several sentences.
WADA is playing dishonestly!
Well, how are you, Russia? - the host of the quiz mockingly asks.
There is nowhere to retreat - behind Efimov, Isinbaev and our entire bloodless team.
So I concentrated and with the last of my strength won the unfortunate T-shirt.
Know, as they say, ours!
In a victorious mood, I wandered into the fitness center next door.
I got carried away with counting simulators.
Dropped by 250.
He noted with surprise that not a single Russian athlete was found in this heap of treadmills.
But maybe it&#39;s right?
Let those who can&#39;t play train!
But in a nearby clinic, one of our guys was sitting.
In line to the optometrist.
Don&#39;t worry, no shooter.
In the clinic, however, as well as throughout the village, wherever you spit, there is a machine for issuing condoms.
It is inscribed with the inspirational message: &quot;Celebrate with a condom!&quot;
Then all that remains is to twist the piece of iron, reminiscent of the handle of a door lock, and the condom, made from natural Amazonian latex, readily falls out of the device.
I took one for myself as a keepsake.
From the athletes will not decrease - they were brought 450 thousand of them.
Just for a festive and idle pastime in the Olympic Village there is a whole entertainment center.
Just in case, there is an informative sign next to it, reminding that the International Olympic Committee spends $ 3.25 million a day on athletes in various ways.
The center is littered with video games, pool and tennis tables, foosball and hockey, and some strange video-simulation devices.
What is this? - I&#39;m interested in a friend in the form of the Ukrainian national team, who actively uses an outlandish toy.
Of course, he could simply say that he does not want to talk to a person in the form of the Russian national team, and that&#39;s all.
Here, by the way, due to some strange coincidence, it dazzles in the eyes of the guys in yellow-black.
The most playing team, it turns out.
To go around the whole village, looking into every corner, you need at least three hours.
But, if you walk instead of driving electric cars, you will open the house of the Canadian team with an elk at the entrance and a tent with a recovery bath, and a ticket office, and a laundry, and dry cleaning, and a hairdresser, and a flower shop, and a store with everyday goods. consumption, and mail with unique stamps (only you still can’t wait out the queue from Chinese philatelists), and a bank, and a lost and found office, and a photo kiosk.
And late in the evening, exhausted, you will sit down near the olive tree, hung with colorful ribbons in memory of the friends and relatives of the athletes who have left this world.
And to the accompaniment of a machine randomly spraying liquid to kill insects, you will think about the eternal.
That is about the Olympic movement.
Which in this village does not stop for a minute.
While the rest of the Russian world watched with bated breath as the Australians almost punished the American Dream Team, the real fans went online.
Few people know: I was the first to receive the news that Inna Deriglazova won gold in foil at the XXXI Olympic Games.
Maybe I&#39;m even the only Muscovite who saw it happen - apart from those, of course, who watched the competition in Carioca that evening.
Only a real fan can understand this.
Just imagine: a dead Moscow night.
The neighbors downstairs - as always by one in the morning - wake up and begin to yell at each other without malice, but very loudly.
And menacingly move furniture.
A tap is leaking in the kitchen - there is no time to go to the market and buy, as the plumber asked, a new one.
Nothing is clear in the television schedule, so I just kept the channels &quot;Match&quot;, &quot;First&quot; and, just in case, &quot;Russia&quot; under control - although this is almost meaningless.
“Russia” is the birthplace of repetitions, all sports are recorded there for some reason.
The series is broadcast live.
Hope, of course, for the &quot;Match&quot; - the whole evening the young man shouted in the news releases, first about the great semi-finals of Deriglazov - Shanaev, then about the upcoming fight for gold.
It would be logical to show
But instead basketball is USA-Australia.
By the way, I have nothing bad to say about this decision.
The Australians were on an equal footing, they generally won the first half.
They put in their place the Americans who went nuts from their own greatness.
As a result, they still lost, but, as they say now, the basketball Olympic tournament will not be the same.
It&#39;s all good, but the fight with Di Francis is approaching, and on the screen there is no change.
In a slight panic, I start flipping channels.
It feels like it&#39;s spinning for the second time in a row.
Okay, let&#39;s go deeper into the cable.
There is no fencing at any of the thematic &quot;Matches&quot;.
And, according to my feelings, the battle is about to begin.
Text and tweet broadcasts of some sports sites do not suit me.
Convulsive surfing gives an unexpected but brilliant result.
It turns out that on the site of the &quot;First&quot; there is a live technical broadcast of all the competitions that are taking place at this moment in time.
I click on fencing, I get a duel for gold.
Deriglazova counterattacks well, goes ahead on points - and quite obviously begins to play for time.
The Italian wins back almost the entire gap.
Our team is one point ahead with just over two seconds left.
Di Franchisca rushes at Deriglazova, she retreats, time is running out, the Italian inflicts an injection.
Victory!
A couple of seconds later, the Olympic messenger on the phone announces the fourth gold medal.
It turns out I&#39;m the first to see it with my own eyes.
Crazy, faithful, involved.
The Spiritual Administration of Muslims (DUM) of Tatarstan refuses to use the Russian language in mosques.
Yesterday, the plenum of the DUM obliged its imams to conduct Friday sermons only in Tatar, in order to force young Tatars to &quot;learn their native language.&quot;
The department says it &quot;in no way infringes&quot; the rights of Muslims of other nationalities.
In some mosques in Kazan, they complain that up to 60% of the parishioners do not understand the Tatar language, including foreign students, migrants and the Tatars themselves.
Imams fear that their sermons in Tatar &quot;will not reach the entire audience.&quot;
Yesterday, the plenum of the Muslim Muslim Spiritual Board of Tatarstan unanimously decided to hold Friday sermons in the mosques of the republic only in the Tatar language.
As Mufti of Tatarstan Kamil Samigullin said, this should be an incentive for young Tatars to &quot;learn their native language.&quot;
&quot;For those who say it&#39;s &#39;difficult&#39;, we intend to organize Tatar language lessons absolutely free of charge in every large mosque,&quot; Mr. Samigullin promised.
He added that &quot;the decision has already entered into force&quot; and today in all mosques sermons &quot;should already be in the Tatar language.&quot;
He recalled that the DUM of Tatarstan publishes the magazine &quot;Shura&quot; with typical sermons in the Tatar language.
An imam who does not speak Tatar well enough &quot;can thoroughly prepare for them.&quot;
The DUM of Tatarstan unites more than a thousand parishes in all municipalities of the republic.
According to the mufti, Friday sermons in the districts are conducted exclusively in the Tatar language.
At the same time, a number of mosques in Kazan previously used predominantly Russian.
In particular, as the mufti pointed out, this was practiced in the Burnaevskaya mosque, Zakabannaya and Eniler.
However, Mr. Mukhametshin emphasized, the leadership sets the task that all students should speak both state languages of the republic, regardless of nationality.
&quot;There can be no question of any infringement of non-Tatar Muslims,&quot; Mr. Mukhametshin emphasized, explaining that the sermon itself &quot;is not an obligatory, main part of the prayer.&quot;
At the same time, the prayer itself will continue to be read in Arabic, lectures and lessons in Russian will remain in mosques.
At the same time, Rafik Mukhametshin told Kommersant that there was no serious threat of ousting the Tatar language from mosques.
In addition to Russian and Tatar, other languages, for example, Uzbek or Tajik, according to his information, are not used in sermons in the republic.
The decision of the DUM was actively supported in the executive committee of the World Congress of Tatars (WCT).
The head of the executive committee of the CGT, Rinat Zakirov, told Kommersant: &quot;Mosques are an important part of our national life.&quot;
It would be sad if the Tatar language left this sphere.
He noted that conducting sermons only in the Tatar language is &quot;the desire of the imams themselves&quot;, but the executive committee of the CGT &quot;considers it to be right.&quot;
The imams interviewed by Kommersant, who preached in Russian, are ready to fulfill the decision of the DUM, but they believe that the parishioners will have difficulty understanding the clergy.
Both Tatars and Russians go to the mosque.
Many do not understand the language.
They, of course, will be tight.
&quot;We&#39;ll have to rebuild,&quot; says Farhat Mavletdinov, the imam of the Burnaevskaya mosque.
According to him, sermons in Russian are closer even to many Tatars, since &quot;Russian in schools, kindergartens, on the radio is everywhere from the very beginning.&quot;
However, he believes that the mosque will be able to continue the lessons and lectures in Russian, which are held on other days.
We rely on Allah.
Allah will show a way out of this situation,&quot; he concluded.
But about 60% of us do not know the Tatar language.
These are Uzbeks, and Tajiks, and Azerbaijanis.
Many foreign students visit us: Africans, Arabs.
&quot;That&#39;s why we switched to Russian for four years,&quot; says the imam.
He believes that sermons in the Tatar language will &quot;reach a narrower circle and will not reach the entire audience.&quot;
But we will obey the decision of the plenum.
It&#39;s just that the outcome of the sermons will be different.
But time will tell.
&quot;For example, it will only be easier for me, because the Tatar language is my native language,&quot; Gabdulla Galiullin concluded.
The former director of the Federal Penitentiary Service was put on trial
The Moscow prosecutor&#39;s office approved the indictment in a criminal case investigated by the Main Investigative Committee of the ICR on embezzlement of budget funds allocated for the needs of the Federal Penitentiary Service of Russia.
Ex-head of the prison department Alexander Reimer and his deputy, who caused the Federal Penitentiary Service damage in the amount of more than 2.7 billion rubles, will appear before the court.
The Moscow prosecutor&#39;s office sent a criminal case to the Zamoskvoretsky District Court against the former director of the Federal Penitentiary Service of Russia Alexander Reimer, his former deputy Nikolai Krivolapov, as well as the director of the Federal State Unitary Enterprise &quot;Center for Information Technology and Communications of the Federal Penitentiary Service&quot; (FSUE TsITOS) Viktor Operedinov.
Depending on the role and degree of participation in the commission of crimes, they are accused by the Main Investigative Committee of the ICR in Moscow under Part 3 of Art. 285 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (abuse of official powers that entailed grave consequences), part 4 of Art. 159 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (fraud committed using one&#39;s official position, as part of an organized group, on an especially large scale).
In addition, Krivolapov is charged under Part 1 of Art. 222 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (illegal acquisition and storage of ammunition).
According to the TFR, in 2010-2012, these individuals fraudulently stole from the state treasury budget funds allocated by the Federal Penitentiary Service to provide the department with electronic monitoring systems for controlled persons, the so-called electronic bracelets.
To steal budget money, the group members developed a scheme according to which the FSUE TsITOS enterprise under their control, with which relevant state contracts were concluded, produced technical means of control and supervision, including &quot;electronic bracelets&quot;, and sold them at prices that were several times inflated.
Despite the fact that FSUE TsITOS did not have production equipment, buildings, facilities for accommodating production facilities that would allow creating a complete cycle for the production of &quot;electronic bracelets&quot;, five government contracts worth more than 3.3 billion rubles were concluded between it and the Federal Penitentiary Service of Russia.
As a result of this scheme, more than 2 billion rubles ended up on the accounts of the Samara branch of the Federal State Unitary Enterprise, of which 1.2 billion rubles. was stolen.
According to the investigation, more than 140 million rubles. Mr. Reimer personally received the cashed funds in his office from one of the accomplices, the criminal case in respect of which was separated into a separate proceeding.
Nikolai Krivolapov, who participated in the fraud, was found to have cartridges for a premium pistol of unknown origin, which allowed him to be charged with additional charges.
In this case, the volume of which amounted to 133 volumes, the Federal Penitentiary Service filed a claim against the accused for compensation for material damage in the amount of 2.7 billion rubles.
Football player Hakan Shukur is suspected of involvement in the coup.
Turkish authorities have issued an arrest warrant for former football player and later member of parliament Hakan Shukur and raided two of his family&#39;s homes.
Turkish football star of the 1990s and early 2000s striker Hakan Şukur is wanted by Turkish authorities in connection with last month&#39;s coup attempt.
The striker, who ended his sports career in 2008, is accused of belonging to an &quot;armed terrorist group.&quot;
We are talking about the Hizmet movement, a society associated with the well-known Turkish religious figure and opposition leader Fethullah Gülen.
It is him that President Erdogan considers the organizer of the military coup attempt on July 15.
Fethullah Gulen lives in the United States, the Turkish authorities demand his extradition.
According to local media, a warrant for the arrest of Hakan Shukur was issued today, the police have already searched two houses that belong to the family of the former football player.
According to investigators, in addition to Hakan Shukur himself, Fethullah Gülen&#39;s organization also included his father.
However, neither the former footballer nor his relatives were there.
He and his family now live in the United States.
When he was a football player, Hakan Shukur defended the colors of several Turkish clubs and played for the national team.
He spent most of his career at Galatasaray.

The Russian Copper Company (RCC) is ready to take on social responsibility and pay more attention to the environmental aspects of its business.
This is confirmed, for example, by the fact that the RCC has taken up the modernization of one of the oldest and environmentally &quot;dirty&quot; enterprises in the country - the Karabash copper smelter.
The Karabash copper smelter was founded by an English joint-stock company headed by Leslie Urquhart in 1910.
In Soviet times, it was a significant industrial enterprise for the country&#39;s economy, and it actually provided the life of the whole city.
However, in the 1990s, due to financial problems, production was stopped, which led to serious social problems in Karabash.
In 1998, a decision was made to resume the work of the Karabash copper smelter.
It was also necessary to solve one of the main problems of the Karabash plant - environmental.
By the early 2000s, Karabash was already infamous as an ecological disaster zone.
The situation at Karabashmed began to change in 2004, after the company was taken over by the Russian Copper Company.
The company began to modernize production, which began to gradually reduce the environmental impact on the environment.
This was recently noted by the governor of the Chelyabinsk region, Boris Dubrovsky, who visited Karabashmed in early July.
The head of the Southern Urals called grandiose changes that have taken place with the enterprise since Karabashmed was transferred to the RMK group.
The main event for the modernization of Karabashmedi in recent years has been the construction of a new sulfuric acid plant, which makes it possible to capture up to 99.9% of metallurgical gases.
According to the President of the Russian Copper Company Vsevolod Levin, the volume of investments in this project amounted to about 7 billion rubles.
The next stage of modernization of CJSC Karabashmed is the reconstruction of the converter section.
The replacement of three converters, dusters, gas duct is scheduled for the end of 2017.
The cost of the project is 2.5 billion rubles.
In addition, at the end of 2016, it is planned to launch a new industrial wastewater treatment plant worth RUB 1 billion.
In turn, the amount of taxes deducted to the budget of the city of Karabash will also increase.
For the entire period of implementation of the Tominsky GOK project - from the start of construction to the commissioning of the second stage - the federal treasury will receive 8.9 billion rubles.
And after the GOK is put into operation, tax revenues to the budgets of all levels may amount to 80.9 billion rubles.
During the year of operation of production in the Varna region, 346.3 million rubles were transferred to the budgets of different levels.
And this is for the first year.
&quot;The longer the company successfully operates, the higher the amount of deductions can be,&quot; Valery Ulanovsky added.
RMK clarified that in 2015 tax deductions from Mikheevsky GOK approached 1 billion rubles.
However, the participation of RCC enterprises in the life and development of the territories where they operate is not limited to tax deductions.
RCC enterprises help repair and maintain schools, kindergartens, sports facilities, build cultural and entertainment facilities, and improve territories.
In 2016, one of the largest social projects of the Russian Copper Company in Karabash was the overhaul, and in fact, the almost complete restructuring of Kindergarten N9 for 95 pupils.
The building, built in 1960, was in disrepair.
Also on the territory of the RMK Arena there will be a landscape park with an artificial pond, underground and above-ground parking lots for 600 cars, cafes and sports shops.
The RMK Arena will make it possible to hold spectacular professional sporting events of international level.
But the main task of this project is to make physical education and sports in comfortable conditions accessible to the residents of Chelyabinsk, especially for children.

WSJ: The US is considering imposing sanctions against the Russian Federation due to the hacking of the Democrats&#39; servers.
US officials are considering imposing new sanctions on Russia in response to the hacking of the Democratic Party&#39;s servers, The Wall Street Journal writes, citing sources.
Reportedly, in order to impose sanctions, the administration of US President Barack Obama will have to formally blame Russia or Russian-backed hackers for the attack on the servers.
The FBI and other U.S. intelligence agencies are virtually certain of Russia&#39;s involvement in the cyberattack, the sources said.
The WSJ notes that the US usually prefers not to name those who carry out hacker attacks.
The exception is the 2014 hack of the Sony Entertainment Pictures database, for which the DPRK was officially held responsible.
However, last year Obama issued an executive order making it easier to impose sanctions on those who carry out or facilitate cyberattacks.
It was originally directed against China, but can be used against other countries as well.
The process of deciding on sanctions can be lengthy, the newspaper writes.
Even if officials concluded that the hackers were acting with Russian support, they would have to weigh the possible consequences before making a decision to release information.
They will have to determine whether the incident is serious enough to exacerbate tensions in bilateral relations because of it.
Earlier it was reported that the administration of Barack Obama admits the possibility of sanctions against the state, whose hackers hacked into the servers of the National Committee of the Democratic Party.
WikiLeaks has released the emails of the Democratic National Committee.
The media reported that hackers working with the Russian authorities may be involved in the hack.
The Kremlin called such reports absurd.
FAS fined Google almost half a billion rubles
The reason was the violation of competition in the mobile application market.
The antimonopoly proceedings were initiated at the initiative of Yandex.
The Russian company claimed that Google was giving smartphone makers access to Android components under conditions that prohibited the pre-installation of applications from other developers, in particular from Yandex.
FAS found confirmation of these claims and established that the company abused its dominant position in the market and forced mobile device manufacturers to install other applications along with the Google Play store.
As a result of the audit, the Federal Antimonopoly Service decided to punish Google, said Alexei Dotsenko, deputy head of the FAS.
The fine must be paid within 60 days after the entry into force of the decision.
The FAS concluded that all companies, including transnational corporations, must comply with the law on protection of competition.
In turn, Google intends to first study the decision and only then decide on further actions: execute it or challenge it.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service recognized the company as a violator of the law on competition in September last year and ordered to adjust the contracts until December 18.
However, Google did not agree to this.
Since then, the company and the department have been litigating.
The FAS noted that, despite the fine, they are discussing with Google the possibility of concluding a settlement agreement.
This measure will do nothing.
This opinion was expressed by Eldar Murtazin, a leading analyst at the Mobile research group, to Ekho Moskvy.
Murtazin also noted that the fine would not affect either the users or the competitiveness of the corporation.

When the owner came to check his home, he found it completely empty: no washing machine, no TV, no refrigerator, no tenant himself.
The total amount of damage was 84 thousand rubles.
Soon the law enforcement officers went on the trail of the thief.
It turned out to be a 30-year-old unemployed Volzhanian.
The man was detained, he confessed, saying that he had already managed to sell the stolen property.
Now he will have to answer for the theft to the fullest extent of the law - a criminal case has been initiated against the detainee.
This year, Crimeans will receive a notification to pay transport tax.
Now the inhabitants of the peninsula will pay taxes on land, property and transport.
Roman Nazdrachev, Head of the Department of the Federal Tax Service for the Republic of Kazakhstan, stated this at a press conference.
Until the end of 2016, Crimean car owners will receive a notification to pay transport tax.
So far, the tax authorities have counted about 250 thousand people who own vehicles.
Data on taxpayers will be provided by the traffic police, Rosreestr.
&quot;If, as of January 1, information about the owners of real estate and owners of land plots is transferred to us, then next year the citizens of Crimea will be payers of these taxes,&quot; said Roman Nazdrachev.
Beneficial categories of citizens will be provided with benefits for paying property taxes, first of all, this is the category of pensioners.
Also, there is a system of deductions for land tax, depending on the preferential category of the taxpayer, but, according to the head of the Federal Tax Service, it is too early to talk about this until 2017.
A resident of Balakhna stood up for a woman, breaking her offender&#39;s head with a brick
According to investigators, on the night of June 16, 2016, in a garage on Glavnaya Street in Balakhna, the accused saw quarreling roommates, with whom he had stayed the day before.
The man repeatedly insulted his civil wife, and then he put the woman on his shoulder and carried her home.
The attacker stood up for the woman and hit the victim several times with a brick on the head.
The 29-year-old man died at the scene.
The defendant pleaded guilty in part.
At the moment (August 12, 2016), this is all the information.
A terrible accident occurred the night before in the area of the Kizil-Tash tract of the Crimean peninsula.
As &quot;MK in Volgograd&quot; was informed by the press service of the Main Directorate of the Ministry of Emergency Situations of Russia for the Volgograd Region, at 17.05 a regular bus with people in the cabin was driving along the R-29 &quot;Sudak - Feodosia&quot; highway.
Suddenly, the car turned into a ditch and fell off a cliff.
Five people were killed in the accident and 20 others were injured.
The injured from the crash site were taken by ambulances to medical facilities, where doctors provide them with the necessary assistance.
On that ill-fated flight, four residents of the Volgograd region were seriously injured.
These are Yuri and Elena Krivokhizhins from Kotovo, together with their 9-year-old grandson Artem, as well as 5-year-old Anastasia Bochkareva, who was taken to the regional hospital in Simferopol - the girl is in serious condition.
When calling an ambulance, we hope that the team will arrive quickly and the doctors will provide all the necessary qualified assistance.
In what cases should an ambulance be called, how quickly should it arrive at the patient?
In the event of a call for an ambulance in an emergency form, the nearest free mobile ambulance team or a specialized team is sent to the call.
The arrival time of an ambulance to an emergency call is up to 20 minutes.
The arrival time of an ambulance to an emergency call is up to 2 hours.
The time of arrival of an ambulance upon the fact of death is not regulated.
OSCE observers did not record military activity on the Crimean border.
Observers of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) did not record military activity on the Russian-Ukrainian border.
This is stated in a statement published on the website of the organization.
Observers report that the situation on the Crimean border is calm, no incidents that may be somehow related to the security of Ukraine and Russia have been recorded.
&quot;None of the monitors was able to confirm media reports that dealt with security issues, including firefights and hostilities in the immediate vicinity of the administrative boundary line,&quot; the OSCE report says.
Employees of the organization continue to monitor the situation at three checkpoints on the border near the Ukrainian cities of Kalanchak, Chaplinka and the Chongar peninsula in the Sivash Bay.
Earlier, the State Border Service of Ukraine reported that the rotation of Russian troops on the border of Crimea is being completed.
At the same time, according to the department, the updated personnel have more modern equipment.
Bulgaria shows inflation for the first time in 8 months
Inflation in Bulgaria was 1% monthly in July, according to national statistics.
This is the highest reading in years (since June 2012) and the first above zero since last October, when a positive 0.2% was shown.
Average annual inflation measured by CPI for the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8%.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0%, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2%, and annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
In July 2016, compared to the previous month, an increase was observed in the price of the following groups of consumer goods: food and soft drinks (1.7%); transport (1.8%); recreation and culture (6.3%); restaurants and hotels (1.2%); other goods and services (0.3%).
Prices decreased for clothing and footwear (2.2%); furniture, household appliances and regular maintenance (0.5%); health (0.1%).
Prices remained at the same level as in the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco; housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; communication systems; and education.
Snapchat&#39;s &#39;Anime&#39; effect criticized as a caricature of Asians
Snapchat claims this filter is anime-inspired, but some reviewers say it&#39;s racially insensitive.
With the help of the &quot;Lenses&quot; tool, Snapchat allows approximately 150 million users a day to change reality and play with personality in ways that border on the absurd.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog, or a character to match a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
Lenses are crude, feature-bending tools that create over 30 million self-corrected selfies a day.
Any errors quickly become public knowledge.
Snapchat lenses have been the subject of criticism in the past, when they were accused of promoting dark complexion or promoting whitened faces as a beauty ideal.
So when some users were offered a lens this week that gave them slanted eyes, crooked teeth and chubby cheeks, some critics saw it as a racist caricature of Asians - &quot;yellowfaces&quot;.
And they wondered if these recurring controversies pointed to a bigger diversification problem for the company.
Messages circulated on Wednesday, followed by outrage in reports on The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat announced it had removed the feature.
The company commented that the lens was intended as an homage to anime characters and not as a caricature of Asians.
But for experts who know about racism firsthand, the lens reminded offensive stereotypes in action.
Others have dismissed the anime comparison entirely.
In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose photo tweet was heavily shared, said the lens was &quot;offensive and embarrassing to say the least.&quot;
She added that &quot;it&#39;s hard to argue with the side-by-side comparison of a very crude Asian caricature and filter effects.
This shows that the filter is not just yellow-faced, but eminently derogatory yellow-faced.
Snapchat isn&#39;t the only company crossing these cultural bridges.
American culture seems to be engaged in a never-ending struggle for diversity and inclusion, from corporate boardrooms to Hollywood to the gadgets we all carry around with us.
And the huge audience of young people on Snapchat - who are more racially diverse than their older generation - could mean they&#39;re more likely to be understood.
When one of Snapchat&#39;s lenses creates an image that is offensive to the user, then, 25-year-old Kathy Zhu said in an interview on Thursday, &quot;It&#39;s much harder for that course of events to go unnoticed than it used to be.&quot;
On Thursday, Zhu, a product manager and engineer who works for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and encouraged others to do the same.
In an article for Medium and in a phone interview, she said she believes racial controversy is the reason for the lack of diversity in Snapchat recruiting.
Zhu criticized the company&#39;s predominantly white, all-male leadership and ended her article with the hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
As Zhu, herself a Chinese-American, wrote, “Either they didn’t have enough non-white people on staff to make these decisions, or they employ non-white people but aren’t in positions where they can safely and speak openly.&quot;
Other reviewers share her point of view, expressing dissatisfaction with the fact that Snapchat did not answer most of her questions.
The company does not publish information about the representation of national minorities in its state, emphasizing its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the racial background of its staff, but the company recently hired a recruiter with the goal of focusing on underrepresented sections of the population and actively trying to engage internal resources, according to a confidant.
For her part, Zhu said she will keep her Snapchat account private, adding, &quot;I&#39;m wondering if they really need more users like us so they can say that&#39;s not going to work.&quot;
Military leadership misrepresented ISIS intelligence, congressional committee says
U.S. Central Command officials have altered intelligence reports to present a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than events on the ground suggest, a congressional panel said in a report released Thursday.
An interim report by a task force established by the Republican chairs of the House Military Affairs Committee, the Intelligence Committee, and the War Appropriations Subcommittee found &quot;widespread discontent&quot; among Central Command intelligence analysts who allege that leaders have tweaked their assessments of US actions aimed at victory over the Islamic State.
Central Command, known as Centcom, is the main military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which oversees US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
&quot;Intelligence documents approved by Central Command&#39;s high command tended to provide a more optimistic portrayal of U.S. counterterrorism efforts than is supported by actual on-scene data, and were consistently more optimistic than analysis provided by other intelligence agencies,&quot; the report&#39;s news release said. .
&quot;What happened at CENTCOM is unacceptable: when bad analysis is presented to senior management, our military suffers,&quot; said Rep. Ken Calvert, a Republican from California.
Leadership problems at Centcom reach the very top of the organization.
The 10-page report details the shortcomings that recurred in 2014 and 2015 in the description and analysis of US actions aimed at training the armed forces of Iraq, provided by the Central Command.
While he does not provide conclusive evidence that members of the Obama administration ordered the falsification of the reports, he argues that analysts felt they were being pressured by Central Committee officials to take a more optimistic view of the threat from the Islamic State, also known as ISIL or ISIL.
&quot;Throughout the first half of 2015, many press releases, statements and testimonies from Central Command in Congress were significantly more optimistic than actual events,&quot; the report said.
For example, a Central Committee official has publicly stated that a major military attack aimed at recapturing Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
&quot;After months of investigation, this is known for certain,&quot; Rep. Mike Pompeo, a Kansas Republican, said in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the highest levels of the U.S. Central Command Intelligence Service forged U.S. Central Command intelligence documents to downplay the ISIS threat in Iraq.
The Republicans created the task force when they learned that analysts had expressed concern that intelligence about the Islamic State was being falsified.
As the investigation progresses, the report released on Thursday will be followed by more detailed data.
An additional, currently pending investigation into Central Committee intelligence is being conducted by the Chief Inspector of the Department of Defense.
Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee released their own data Thursday, which is consistent with some of the Republican task force&#39;s findings.
&quot;Between 2014 and 2015, CENTCOM created an overly closed process for producing intelligence assessments on ISIS and the Iraqi Guards,&quot; Rep. Adam B. Schiff, the top Democrat on the committee, said in a statement.
The procedure, according to Schiff, &quot;has stalled the release of intelligence documents,&quot; hurt analyst morale, and &quot;doesn&#39;t adequately reflect divergent views.&quot;
But Schiff and the Democrats say they have found no evidence that the White House tried to force CENTCOM analysts to conform their conclusions to &quot;a given or political interpretation.&quot;
The preliminary results of the Congressional investigation were released on Tuesday by The Daily Beast.
Last August, The New York Times reported on the existence of an investigation by the Pentagon&#39;s chief inspector following complaints from Central Committee analysts.
Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on the congressional report while the inspector general&#39;s investigation continues.
But he said &quot;experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data, and intelligence agencies and the Department of Defense welcome a healthy dialogue on these vital topics of national security.&quot;
The implications of the investigation go beyond the question of whether the American-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria is achieving its goal (as a growing number of Defense Department officials are now claiming).
But last year&#39;s statements cast doubt on whether President Obama can rely on Central Command to provide truthful assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis points.
Criticism of intelligence on the Islamic State echoes the controversy that took place more than a decade ago, when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker wrote an op-ed article alleging that the administration of President George Walker W. did not think about what would follow the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in the protest sparked by intelligence on the Islamic State.
Last year, officials said, Hooker&#39;s team concluded that despite public claims to the contrary, airstrikes on oil refineries owned by the Islamic State did not significantly worsen the financial situation of the terrorist group because it built temporary oil refineries. to sell oil on the black market.
But the discovery was not shared outside of Central Command, the Times reported in September.
Centcom&#39;s then-commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, came under fire last year after testimony in the Senate that many MPs saw as an overly optimistic assessment of the war.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced in Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.
US wins 4 consecutive women&#39;s field hockey titles, closer to showdown with Britain
Once scoring three goals in a match that ended in a 6-1 win over Japan, Kathy Bam opened the scoring on Thursday with her first two goals for the US women&#39;s field hockey team as the Americans beat India 3-0. .
Five goals in two games should be a memorable achievement, but Bam, 27, says she&#39;s not sure if she would ever do something like that.
“I don’t know,” she said.
I&#39;m not really the type of person who keeps track of their goals.
Here&#39;s what she knows: The Americans are 4-0 in the Olympic tournament and they are competing for first place in their group against Britain, who remain undefeated after losing 2-0 to Japan on Thursday.
Teams of Great Britain and the USA will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams are in contention for the quarter-finals and the outcome of the game will determine who will finish first in their group of six teams and who will finish second.
The winner will avoid a strong Dutch team, the leaders of the other group, a little later, when the quarter-final games begin.
However, Saturday&#39;s game shows that the Americans are making a splash here with their surprise streak, four years after finishing last among 12 teams at the London Games.
Bam was on that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, picked up a field hockey stick for the first time when she was 3 (her older twin sisters played the sport at Drexel), and joined the national team at age 16, her youngest player in history.
She missed the 2008 Olympics when she did not qualify for the final squad.
Then came 2012, when things didn&#39;t go well for her and her teammates.
The following year, Coaig Parnham, an Englishman, was named manager and things began to change.
&quot;Cultural change, psychological change, physical fitness change,&quot; Bam said.
In London, we didn&#39;t have the performance we have now.
We have completely changed our views.
On Thursday night, Bam opened the scoring in the first half of the game with a shot from an awkward hand at short range.
India went into the game without a single win in the tournament, but the team proved to be surprisingly tough and kept the score 1-0 until the end of the third period, when Bam took the lead.
She made a long pass with the ball down the left side of the field, then spiraled into the middle and sent the ball hard into the net, thus giving the Americans a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez added the final goal midway through the fourth period.
The shutout victory was the first of the tournament for US goaltender Jackie Briggs, who conceded one goal in each of her first three wins.
She is on fire.
As is Bam.
&quot;We&#39;re in a good position right now,&quot; Parnham said, but how good it is depends on the outcome of Saturday&#39;s game.
In the midst of the rampage of the Olympic Games - the &quot;zen&quot; of trampolining
Wherever you are, no matter how much time it is now, this is the Olympics.
Events in Rio de Janeiro seem fixed and inevitable, a frenzied combination of competition and drive.
As if the Olympic flame itself is that burning torch that is passed from the archer to the swimmer, to the gymnast, to the triathlete.
You can&#39;t turn on the TV, read the newspaper, or eavesdrop on your neighbors in line at the coffee shop and not hear about Simone Biles, Cathy Ledecky, or the Michael Phelps-Chad de Cloes feud.
And then there&#39;s Logan Dooley.
Dooley, a dimpled, handsome newcomer to the Olympics for the first time, could very well be among those prime-time celebrities promoted by sponsors and life-affirming commercials if he were a swimmer, gymnast, or even a fencer.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is vying for gold in the Olympic trampolining event.
The Olympic flame does not cover all events in the same way.
Further from the center, partly in the shade, are those sports that are not generally recognized: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
Brass will always be with us, long reign to him.
But if I may be allowed to timidly defend my personal predilection, let me draw your attention to the modest charm of trampoline jumping.
Although trampolining has been an Olympic sport since 2000, when it debuted at the Sydney Games, it has received so little recognition in the past 16 years that many of the people I interviewed were not aware that it was an Olympic sport at all.
This may be regional ignorance.
Although the United States sent athletes to compete, it never won a trampoline medal, and its athletes did not reach the finals until 2012.
The Chinese and Russians tend to share the men&#39;s awards, while the Chinese and Canadians share the women&#39;s awards.
Dong Dong of China and Rosie McLennan of Canada will defend their London gold medals this year.
But trampolining has an outsider charm, partly because to the unenlightened ear it is more associated with a college circus than with the Olympics.
Here I must confess that I am not an expert, but only a down-to-earth enthusiast.
They do have comic potential—the caricatured flash of endless jumps—but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two sports they basically combine.
The word &quot;trampoline&quot; comes from the Spanish word &quot;el trampolín&quot;, meaning &quot;diving springboard&quot;.
Contenders jump on a giant trampoline, flying nearly 30 feet into the air, and must perform a series of acrobatic stunts (turns, folds and somersaults) before finally landing on their feet.
They are judged on performance, difficulty and &quot;flight time&quot; according to the official program of the Olympic Games.
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.
The most common Olympic course is forward.
Medal contenders have to go further, faster, higher and higher in pursuit of gold, sometimes to the finish line, and sometimes back and forth, back and forth across the field.
They aim not only for the finish line or starting wall, but also, in full view of the TV cameras, for another tantalizing milestone: a world or Olympic record.
This stubborn aspiration is noble, admirable, even fanatical - and it is enough to make even the viewer shed a tear.
But it, in my opinion, is somewhat tiring when watching the Games.
From him, jumping on a trampoline gives a respite.
The direction of the trampoline is up.
Moving forward is not the goal.
He or she bounces, seems weightless, like an astronaut, flying up, then down, then effortlessly up again.
And they, of course, are not without competition or difficulties, but during the entire program there is no insane zeal to the finish line, no long jumps, only a marvelous, graceful disappearance of time and gravity.
It is the closest Olympic sport to Zen.
The women&#39;s qualifiers and then the final will take place on Friday afternoon, broadcast at 1pm ET; men&#39;s - on Saturday, also at one o&#39;clock.
NBC will broadcast the finale as a daytime program starting at 2:00 pm on both days.
In the midst of the Olympic craziness, a calm, beautiful moment is expected, which can be easily overlooked in the general scuffle.
And if consciousness-raising can only be achieved by subjecting male athletes to coveted stares and objectification—as male gymnasts from the United States have recently suggested, according to the Wall Street Journal—Dooley is just waiting for his new admiring crowd of fans.
&#39;Generation protests&#39; in Ethiopia, longtime US ally
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators demanding political change in Ethiopia have faced fierce opposition from the government.
Eyewitnesses say dozens of protesters were fatally injured during clashes with police.
Is Ethiopia really on the verge of a split?
Over the past decade, it has been one of Africa&#39;s most stable countries, a solid ally of the West with a booming economy.
But in recent months, anti-government protests have rocked the country, spreading to more and more of its territories.
In the past week alone, thousands have taken to the streets demanding radical political change.
Human rights activists say the government&#39;s response has been brutal.
Eyewitnesses claimed that police officers shot and killed dozens of unarmed demonstrators.
Video footage of the protests, believed to have been taken late last or early this year, shows young people being beaten with sticks by security officers as they were put up against a wall with their hands.
The United Nations&#39; top human rights official is now calling for a thorough investigation.
&quot;It has always been difficult to keep this country from collapsing, and it will continue to be even more difficult,&quot; said Rashid Abdi, head of the Horn of Africa Project at the International Crisis Research Group.
Ethiopia is the second most populous country in Africa after Nigeria, and its stability is supported by the West.
The US military and intelligence services are working closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats in the region, especially in Somalia, and virtually no country in Africa receives such support from the West.
The Ethiopian economy is developing at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has improved significantly - there is even a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.
And its streets are generally quiet, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia was hardly a model of democracy - human rights organizations constantly mention government repression - the opposition on the territory of the state was suppressed, due to the fact that dissidents were effectively silenced.
Many of them were exiled, imprisoned, killed or banished to remote deserts.
But this may change.
&quot;If people are constantly suppressed and left with no other option but to protest, an uprising will break out,&quot; said Seyum Teshome, a lecturer at a university in central Ethiopia.
All the youth are protesting.
The generation is protesting.
Complaints are numerous, ranging from land use to the seizure of power by the government coalition.
After last year&#39;s widely criticized elections, the government party and its allies completely ousted the opposition and now control 100 percent of Parliament.
At the same time, tensions are rising along the Eritrean border; the fight over this vague, disputed border claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups that have been more or less wiped out in recent years, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may try to exploit the unrest and rearm.
A number of factors explain why bitter feelings, boiling in the depths of the soul for several years, flare up now.
The first, it would seem, is completely harmless: smartphones.
In the last couple of years alone, large numbers of Ethiopians have been able to connect on social media as cheap smartphones have become commonplace and internet service has improved.
Even when the government closes access to Facebook and Twitter, as often happens, especially during protests, many people still find it possible to communicate through proxy servers that hide where they are.
Several young Ethiopians said that was how they organized for the protests.
The second is that there is more solidarity between the Oromo and Amhara, the two largest Ethiopian ethnic groups.
Oromo and Amhara are not natural allies.
For centuries, the Amhara of the predominantly Christian highlands of Ethiopia have prospered in politics and business by exploiting the Oromo, many of whom are Muslim and live in the lowlands.
But this is also changing.
&quot;We will act together under a single command,&quot; said Mulatu Gemechu, the leader of the Oromo.
The largest protests took place in the Amhara and Oromo regions.
Many in Amhara and Oromo feel that Ethiopia is being unfairly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group, which makes up about 6 percent of the population and controls military and intelligence services, trade and politics.
The third reason for unrest is the loss of Meles Zenawi.
Meles, a former rebel leader, served as Ethiopia&#39;s acting prime minister for 17 years, until his death from an unknown illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could foresee danger.
Analysts say he was especially adept at spotting early signs of discontent and using scouts to gather intelligence and neutralize opponents.
&quot;The current regime lacks common sense,&quot; said Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia&#39;s new prime minister, Hailemariam Desaleni, came out of nowhere and took Meles&#39; place.
Unlike Meles, who hailed from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam is a southerner.
Analysts say he is not trusted by the Tigray-controlled security forces.
Many fear that this will lead to more bloodshed as a result.
Ethiopia last experienced such unrest in 2005, after thousands of people protested what analysts said appeared to be an election that the government botched and then rigged.
In the repression that followed, many Protestants were killed, although in fewer numbers than in recent months, and this period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts commended Ethiopia&#39;s leaders for visionary infrastructure developments such as a new intercity train and significant progress in the fight against poverty.
But it is clear that this did not stop the growth of internal dissatisfaction with the Ethiopian government.
And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, a city in Amhara, attacked businesses owned by Tigray, and anti-Tygray hatred on social media is becoming all-encompassing.
Analysts say the protesters are putting the United States and other Western allies in an uncomfortable position.
The US government has used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia, although it recently announced that it has closed the base.
On the one hand, it is clear that the West wants to support democracy, but on the other hand, it does not want its ally to lose power in an already unstable region.
&quot;And this tightrope will be difficult to walk on,&quot; Abdi said.
Donald Trump explains his claim that ISIS was founded by Obama as &quot;sarcasm&quot;
Donald J. Trump tried to hush up the latest conflict that engulfed his campaign headquarters on Friday, claiming he was joking when he said several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the &quot;founders&quot; of the Islamic State terror group.
The clarification raised new questions about the Republican presidential nominee&#39;s ability to intelligibly address the American people.
It also placed his deputies, who tried to protect him during the period of unrest, in the awkward position of having to explain statements he probably did not mean.
Having made that suggestion at the convention on Wednesday night, Trump strongly insisted on his statement on Thursday, repeating in an interview that he really wanted to say that the president and Clinton founded ISIS.
But in a Twitter post early Friday morning, Trump wrote that he was just being sarcastic.
The post was the exact opposite of a statement made just a day earlier, when Trump stated in several interviews that he was absolutely serious about his accusation.
When conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften his remarks by reminding him that Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential nominee did not seize the opportunity.
The latest scandal erupted as Trump tried to refocus his campaign on the economy amid a downgrade.
Trump and Clinton made rival speeches about the economy in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump again tried to return to this topic.
Taking to Twitter again, he warned that Clinton&#39;s plans would lead to higher taxes and said he found her speech boring.
Trump has used sarcasm as an excuse before.
In late July, after he drew widespread criticism by practically suggesting that the Russians should hack into Clinton&#39;s email, he later explained his remarks by saying, &quot;Of course I&#39;m kidding.&quot;
This approach allows Trump to go beyond what is acceptable in political speech and take back his words if necessary.
&quot;I think it&#39;s his way of testing certain messages that resonate with his fans, see how they work, and then &#39;explain&#39; them one way or the other, depending on the reaction,&quot; said Ruth Sherman, an expert Communications, which analyzed the language of both candidates.
But I also think that he is careful in his statements and knows that they are vague enough to be interpreted differently.
Instead of softening his remarks to the broader constituency, Trump has taken on an even more scathing tone in recent days as his approval rating continues to fall.
The new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist rankings released on Friday showed Trump trailing Clinton by a wide margin in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado and tied with her in Florida.
While Trump generally tries not to apologize for the provocative things he says, he often accuses his critics of misinterpreting his words and misunderstanding his sense of humor.
But as Trump has become the focus of attention in the final months of the presidential campaign, his jokes have put his loyal allies in the awkward position of having to publicly support him, no matter how provocative his remarks.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, a former New York City mayor who is one of Trump&#39;s most prominent deputies, went to great lengths to defend the nominee in an interview given to CNN on Thursday.
&quot;I think what he&#39;s saying is an acceptable political comment,&quot; Giuliani said when asked about the credibility of Trump&#39;s claim that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
It&#39;s true in the sense that before Obama, ISIS was an almost unknown little organization, he called it a non-threat, absolutely unfair, and that&#39;s why it happened, because he pulled out of Iraq.
Most average Republicans argue that the Obama administration, in which Clinton served as secretary of state, allowed ISIS to develop by failing to deal with the situation in the Middle East hard.
Before the rally in Pennsylvania on Friday, Trump continued on Twitter to attack the media for slandering his every word and prejudicing him.
He mocked the &quot;poor unfortunate&quot; television experts who are trying to figure it out, and said: &quot;They are weak!&quot;
Some Democrats have ridiculed Trump&#39;s excuses as further evidence that he is unfit for the presidency.
Once-displaced coffee shop returns to Greenpoint
The Werb Coffee Shop was a shabby, cash-only Williamsburg place that had no Wi-Fi but had been serving good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, she was pushed out of her window shop on Bedford Avenue.
Soap Sheri, which took over from Verb in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.
The locals mourned her as the last loss in a renewing city.
Artist Molly Crabapple tweeted: &quot;New York is constantly changing, I know but still can&#39;t believe CBGB is dead, the Chelsea hotel is in ruins and the Willow is now a soap shop.&quot;
But while New York City is constantly changing, it is in turn renewing itself.
The revived Werb coffee shop opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of the original location.
The new Verba has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but retains some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.
Plus the coffee is still good.
At the head of the new Verba is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old coffee shop, who is the owner and general manager of the new location.
He started working at Verba in 2001 and was there until the very end.
When one of the clients offered to sponsor him in a new location, he said that he would gladly go for it.
Rodriguez, who is 36 years old, has left a lot the same.
Verb works with the same bagel distributor and bought the same model of coffee machine.
It even has chandeliers from the old &quot;Verba&quot;.
But Rodriguez said he also wanted to experiment.
He suggested new dishes.
The menu features bacon, egg and cheese sandwiches, and caper or fried onion toppings are available.
There are brown rice dishes.
The coffee shop no longer serves beer, but now serves freshly squeezed juices.
After nine months, Rodriguez said he noticed a steady stream of old regulars.
&quot;Many former clients were also forced out of Williamsburg by prices,&quot; he shared.
On a recent Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was one of those clients.
Oliveira, 34, used to live in Williamsburg and used to frequent the Werb.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she still stopped by there.
After Verba closed, she said she stopped drinking coffee for a while.
“I realized that it was coffee and the atmosphere that impressed me at Verba,” she said.
Now she is drinking coffee again, although that day instead of the usual ice coffee she ordered blended tea, another novelty.
Tom Rosenthal, another longtime client, has been a devoted visitor to the Werb since 2003.
He stopped by before work and ordered invariably the same thing.
“At fifteen minutes past seven, every day, like clockwork, I would come and have my bagel cooked for me with butter and all the toppings,” he said.
Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and introduced new dishes to the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still makes the usual order, but someday he will change something with bacon, egg or cheese on a bagel with all the toppings.
Rodriguez said that he was not offended that the soap shop once took over the old place.
What&#39;s more, the owners of Soap Sheri offered to make a special soap for Verba using cold-brewed coffee from a coffee shop as an ingredient.
&quot;I think we might agree to their proposal,&quot; Rodriguez said.
Permanent residents of Greenpoint of Polish origin have also chosen this coffee shop.
One of these new clients translated the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said he plans to find a place for it in a display case to make his new neighbors feel welcome.
The new location has other benefits as well.
The local juice outlet plans to bottle and sell cold-brewed coffee.
There is a possibility that the coffee shop will take over the neighboring building.
For many customers, it is enough that the new Verb will include their favorite dishes on the menu.
Joseph Witt was a regular customer and shared that he was heartbroken when they closed.
When the coffee shop opened in its new location, Witt said that stepping inside and ordering a cup of coffee made him feel like he was back home.
“For a long time I wanted to smell this fragrance,” he admitted.
The Depressive Food of Depression at The Tight Meal
In March 1933, shortly after ascending to the presidency, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down to dinner in the Oval Office.
As a gourmet, President Roosevelt loved Fifth Avenue trendy dishes such as foie gras and Maryland turtle soup.
His menu that day was more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and, for dessert, prune pudding.
“It was an act of culinary solidarity with the people who were suffering,” said Jane Siegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added: &quot;It was also a message to Americans about how to eat.&quot;
The couple, who live in Brooklyn Heights, are experts in food history.
Kowa&#39;s latest book, Chinese Stew, focused on Chinese food in America, and Siegelman told the story of life in a rented apartment on the Lower East Side through food in her book 97 Orchard Street.
Their newest collaboration, The Hearty Meal, to be published Tuesday by Harper, is the story of American food in the Great Depression.
In a show of culinary solidarity of their own, they met the reporter for dinner at Eisenberg&#39;s Sandwich Shop, a tiny, unpretentious eatery in the Flatiron Quarter that has been in business since the 1929 Stock Market Crash.
Siegelman, 54, ordered cream cheese and a sandwich with olive slices, while Coe, 57, ordered turkey, mashed potatoes and vegetable mix.
When the reporter ordered the meatloaf, the couple saw it as a fitting starting point for a discussion about Depression-era food.
&quot;The rolls were in high demand,&quot; Siegelman said.
There was peanut roll, liver roll, bean roll.
They were made from the main ingredient and cheap products that allowed the ingredient to stretch.
Imagine that you have eaten as many peanuts as you need for dinner.
Kou winced.
&quot;Probably, he was lying in the stomach with a stone,&quot; he said.
In the years before the Depression, the American table, especially in rural areas, was a smorgasbord.
Groups of women cooked for the male farm workers, and a freshly baked pie was served for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. &quot;The Heavy Meal&quot; describes how the country coped with the fact that it suddenly ceased to be a country of abundance.
&quot;It was a time when food became a central, difficult topic for Americans,&quot; Coe said, explaining why he and his wife decided to write about it.
Just as challenging was the new budget ration: arcane dishes such as rolls and casseroles became staples; A casserole is &quot;a great way to use leftovers,&quot; Siegelman said, &quot;because chefs could hide unappetizing ingredients under a thick layer of sauce.
Fresh fruits have been replaced by cheaper dried fruits.
Meat, for many years the staple of American food, has become a sparingly distributed luxury.
People tried strange concoctions because energy and nutritional value became more important than taste and even culinary common sense.
While doing research for a book that includes recipes, Siegelman prepared a dish from that era: baked onions stuffed with peanut butter.
&quot;This addition to the dining table was not a success,&quot; Coe said.
Siegelman added: &quot;It was very strange.&quot;
Peanut butter doesn&#39;t go well with baked onions.
This was typical for many household recipes.
Like never before, and never since, home economics experts—including Louise Stanley, chief of the federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943—managed the nation&#39;s eating habits.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become &quot;budgeters,&quot; rise to the challenge of transforming squash like pureed spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.
The &quot;Heavy Meal&quot; is a feast of curious historical facts.
Particularly poignant are stories about the government&#39;s response to starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover&#39;s &quot;let them eat pies&quot; stance.
While publicly extolling the simple Iowa farm food of his childhood, he ate like the sophisticated millionaire he had become.
&quot;He liked continental cuisine, like fish with cucumber sauce,&quot; Coe said.
He ate in a practically gilded dining room, wearing a tuxedo.
He was fantastically out of touch with reality.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not advised him to set an example with his own stomach.
According to the book, Eleanor Roosevelt hired a housekeeper with no interest in taste, which led the White House to &quot;eat not only the dullest food in Washington, but sometimes the most disgustingly cooked.&quot;
Many of the culinary techniques of the Depression era were forgotten once the country got back on its feet.
Their legacy is our ongoing focus on calories and nutrition, Siegelman says, and how science has been used in food preparation.
The couple say that while writing the book, they got a better understanding of Siegelman&#39;s mother&#39;s eating habits - that she couldn&#39;t throw away food, for example.
&quot;She had a serious fear of casual eating,&quot; Coe said.
Siegelman recalls, &quot;She literally poisoned people.&quot;
There was one unpleasant incident with profiteroles.
When the plates at Eisenberg&#39;s were empty, she and Coe pulled out a dessert they&#39;d made at home: the prune dessert that President Roosevelt had for lunch.
&quot;It&#39;s called prune mousse,&quot; Siegelman said, adding that it was a common practice to give humble recipes catchy names.
There was no whipped cream, just prunes, some flour, sugar, water, and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly plunged the spoon into the viscous, brown, sticky substance.
Surprisingly, it was good.
Coe asked for more twice.
In a confident budgeter&#39;s voice, he told his wife, &quot;A few chopped walnuts would do the trick.&quot;
Arrest of defendants in case of mass brawl at Khovansky cemetery extended until November 14
The Presnensky court left the defendants in the case of a mass brawl at the Khovanskoye cemetery under arrest until November 14, having granted the corresponding request of the investigation.
There are 14 defendants in the case.
Recall that on May 14 at the Khovansky cemetery there was a mass brawl of several hundred immigrants from Central Asia and the North Caucasus with the use of weapons, as a result of which three people died.
Former head of the cemetery Yuri Chabuev and lawyer, co-founder of the public organization &quot;Healthy Nation&quot; Alexander Bocharnikov were charged with organizing the murder.
The issue of the second indexation of pensions in 2016 can be resolved within the next two to three weeks.
This was announced on August 12 by Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation Olga Golodets during a visit to the Bryansk region.
We have specific parameters for how much the pension needs to be increased in order to level out the inflation that exists in the country.
All calculations have been made.
Now economists are summing up the results of the first half of the year, and we will complete this work within the next two to three weeks,&quot; Interfax quoted Golodets as saying.
Commenting on the scheme proposed by the head of the Center for Strategic Research, Alexei Kudrin, to raise the retirement age by six months every year, the Deputy Prime Minister said that this topic was not being considered in the Cabinet.
At the end of July, it became known that the Government had agreed on a position on the full indexation of pension payments in 2017.
Kamensky and Grigoryan made it to the finals of the small-caliber rifle shooting competition.
Russian athletes Sergey Kamensky and Kirill Grigoryan reached the finals of the small-caliber rifle prone shooting competition at the Olympic Games in Brazil.
According to TASS, Sergei Kamensky scored 629 points and took first place - this is a new Olympic record in qualifying.
Kirill Grigoryan became the second - 628.9 byla.
In total, the top eight athletes made it to the finals.
Kamensky is the world record holder in this discipline (633).
Turkish opposition leader Fethullah Gülen demands an international investigation into the circumstances of the coup attempt in Turkey.
&quot;I demand that an independent international commission investigate the coup attempt,&quot; Gülen was quoted as saying by the French newspaper Le Monde.
Also, the Turkish oppositionist said that &quot;if at least some of the accusations are confirmed, I will return to Turkey.&quot;
However, Gülen strongly denies involvement in the coup, stressing that his organization has never claimed political power.
An Istanbul court earlier arrested opposition Islamic preacher Fethullah Gülen in absentia.
Recall that an attempted military coup took place in Turkey on the night of July 15-16.
Gilead to Reimburse Attorneys in Hepatitis C Patent Dispute with Merck
Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to recover attorney fees it incurred in a hepatitis C patent lawsuit with drug maker Merck &amp; Co Inc, a federal district judge ruled.
In June, Gilead was cleared of $200 million in damages for infringement of two Merck patents relating to Gilead drugs, top sellers Sovaldi and Harvoni, after a US judge found a number of infringements by Merck, including, lying under oath and other unethical acts.
In court filing on Thursday, U.S. District Court Judge Beth Labson Freeman said Gilead is entitled to recover costs incurred in the course of the dispute.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which dominates the market for a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case took place in 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other over claims of lab work behind sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead&#39;s drugs.
US-backed military claims to have wrested full control of Manbij from the Islamic State
A U.S.-backed military has seized full control of the northern city of Manbij, near the Turkish border, after the last Islamic State fighters left in the city left, a spokesman for the group said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now clearing the city after the departure of the remaining group of militants who were hiding in the city.
They released more than 2,000 civilian hostages held by the militants, Sharfan Darwish of the SDF-allied Manbij military council told Reuters.
&quot;The city is now completely under our control, but we are undertaking cleansing operations,&quot; he told Reuters.
Clinton earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 percent of the federal tax rate
Hillary Clinton on Friday released her 2015 tax returns, which showed the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband had $10.75 million in income this year and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.
In 2015, the Clintons received $1 million in philanthropic contributions, mostly to the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton received about $5.3 million in speaking fees, and the former Secretary of State claimed $3 million in income from the publisher. Simon &amp; Schuster for her book about her time in the State Department.
Potential Vice President Clinton, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, along with his wife Anna Holton, released 10 years of tax returns.
In 2015, they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3 percent.
&quot;Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set the standard for financial transparency,&quot; Clinton campaign adviser Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
In complete contrast to them, Donald Trump hides behind fake excuses and breaks his past promises to release his tax returns.
It is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, even though they are not required by law to do so.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers cited an IRS audit as the reason for his refusal to release his tax returns.
&quot;Your move,&quot; Clinton campaign adviser Ian Sams tweeted, referring to the Democratic nominee&#39;s declarations.
On Thursday, Trump&#39;s special adviser Michael Cohen told CNN he won&#39;t let Trump release them until the checks are over.
Trump&#39;s critics, including 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and other fellow Republicans, said his rejection raises questions about his wealth, his charitable contributions, his business dealings and other ties, including with Russia.
Clinton seized on the issue and on Friday released an online video that featured prominent Republicans urging Trump to release his tax returns.
On Thursday, she raised the issue during a speech about the economy in Michigan.
&quot;He refuses to do what every single presidential candidate has done for decades: release their tax returns,&quot; she told the crowd.
Politico reported that Trump paid little or no taxes for two years in the 1990s, and a New York Times business columnist on Friday quoted many tax lawyers and accountants as saying that this may have been the case until so far.
Federal tax rates became a point of contention in the presidential election.
Clinton backed a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett that would ensure that people making more than $1 million a year would pay a tax rate of at least 30 percent.
President Barack Obama also supported the proposal.
At a meeting with Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway is based there, suggested that Trump meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he, too, was under IRS scrutiny and that Trump was &quot;feared&quot; not of the tax collection agency, but of the voters.
The Clinton campaign published tax returns up until 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average federal tax rate of about 32 percent from 2007 to 2014 and an effective compound tax rate of about 40.5 percent.
The 2015 Clinton Declaration showed that, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income came from paychecks.
Their main investment was a low-cost index mutual fund, and the Clintons posted dividends and a return on equity of $109,000.

Chili powder condoms and fireworks boost protection for Tanzanian elephants
Conservationists in Tanzania use an unconventional way to stop elephants from wandering into human settlements by throwing condoms filled with chili powder at them.
The method proved effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with the idea a few years ago, along with the American Committee for Conservation, took it upon themselves to promote it, training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non-violent, four-step way to protect their homes. and crops without harming animals.
Previously, many used spears to protect themselves.
Friday will be World Elephant Day, dedicated to the protection of animals.
&quot;Since we invented the toolkit ... we have seen a change in attitudes within these communities where they are much more confident that they can keep the elephants out of their fields without harming the elephants,&quot; he said in a statement. Honeyguide CEO Damian Bell.
The first two steps consist of lighting a torch in front of the trespassing elephant and signaling with the horn.
If it was not possible to scare him away, then they throw the so-called &quot;cloud of chili&quot;.
Chili powder mixed with soil is placed with a cracker in a condom, and its end is twisted, leaving only the wick outside.
When ignited, the condom bursts with a crash, spraying a fine dust of chili powder into the air.
One breath is usually enough to turn the elephant in the other direction.
The last resort is a launcher that fires Roman candles into the air, producing a loud, bright explosion.
32 Turkish diplomats who left the country after the coup attempt in July this year have not yet returned to Turkey.
Such data was given by Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu in an interview with local journalists.
At the first stage, we recalled 208 career diplomats so that they could continue their work in the center.
Of these, 32 people did not return without objective reasons and explanations,&quot; the head of the Turkish Foreign Ministry said.
Recall that in July there was an attempted coup d&#39;état in Turkey.
The country&#39;s authorities officially announced that the coup had failed, and also reported the detention of more than six thousand people, among them military officials of the highest and middle levels.
As a result of the coup attempt, 290 people were killed, according to the Turkish Foreign Ministry.
Jewish director slams Berlin hotel for removing Israel&#39;s dialing code at &#39;request&#39; of Arabs, RT News reported
The Jewish-French director caused a media scandal after discovering that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin does not have Israel&#39;s dialing code listed, with employees citing &quot;requests&quot; from Arab customers.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary Shoah, expressed his dissatisfaction with the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German media FAZ.
During his recent stay at the hotel, Lanzman tried to find Israel in the list of phone codes provided by the hotel.
The country, however, was not mentioned among the states that can be called directly from the room.
How could it be that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel is excluded and uprooted?
Written by Lanzman.
In return, Kempinski Bristol provides the ability to dial Israel through its own call centre.
Seeking an explanation, the director raised the issue at the hotel reception.
The answer he received there, according to Lanzman, &quot;shocked him.&quot;
The hotel clerk said the move was &quot;a deliberate decision by the management of the Kempinski hotel chain.&quot;
The reason behind this move angered the director even more.
&quot;Most of our guests are Arabs and they demanded that the Israel code be removed,&quot; a hotel clerk said, according to Lanzman.
Israel&#39;s ambassador to Germany, Jacob Hadas-Handelsman, called the case &quot;a terrible disgrace,&quot; according to the Suddeutsche Zeitung newspaper.
We were shocked and shocked by the incident.
It is, in fact, a terrible shame.
The fact that this happened in Germany and in this hotel chain is an even greater shame.
Explanations are not needed here.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions,&quot; the official said.
The case caused a considerable resonance on the Internet; people called it a scandal.
Some have argued that the Kempinski hotel simply &quot;fell in line&quot; with the alleged demands of Arab customers.
“Shame on you,” said another post, which indicated that the hotel, located on the glorious Kurfurstendamm street, was next to the synagogue.
The hotel itself was quick to dismiss any allegations, calling the incident an &quot;oversight&quot; and &quot;apologising&quot; to Lanzmann, newspaper Der Spiegel reports.
&quot;There was no direct order not to put Israel on the speed dial list,&quot; the Suddeutsche Zeitung newspaper quoted a spokesman for the Kempinski Hotel as saying.
She adds that the code has now been added.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
Students clashed with police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday as they gathered to protest government reforms to the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.
The riot started when police tried to disperse the students, causing the police to use rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstration to express their concerns about the plans.
Under proposals from São Paulo state governor Geraldo Alckmin, nearly 100 public high schools will close and 300,000 students will be reallocated to save money.
Some of the protesters could be seen writing graffiti on the walls against interim President Michael Temer.
This latest protest comes just days after protesters took to the streets en masse to support ousted President Dilma Rousseff as the country&#39;s Senate voted to impeach her.
Trade between Russia and Iran grew by 71%, according to the RT Business portal
With the lifting of sanctions, trade between Moscow and Tehran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the previous year, according to Russian Ambassador to Iran Levan Dzhagaryan.
Since international sanctions against Iran have been lifted, there has been an increase in interest from Russian firms to do business in the country, the ambassador said.
Russian companies are renewing ties with Iran, and new firms are poised to gain access to the market.
Of course, the further expansion of trade is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran,&quot; Jagaryan said.
He noted that in the first five months of 2016, the trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $856 million.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran grew by 91.5 percent and amounted to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The increase in trade was achieved through the supply of machinery, land vehicles and weapons,&quot; the ambassador said.
Jagaryan also predicts that a record number of Iranian tourists will visit Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran issued about 35,000 visas, mostly tourist visas, to Iranian citizens.
In addition, for the first time, Iran entered the top 20 countries in terms of the number of tourists visiting Russia.
It is safe to say that last year&#39;s record for the number of Iranian tourists visiting Russia will be broken,&quot; he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians visit Iran, which the ambassador hopes will change.
&quot;I personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which preserve the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization in good condition,&quot; he said.
The state continues to tighten the screws in the military-industrial complex.
The reason for the dismissal was the &quot;systematic failure to fulfill&quot; the instructions of the general director of the Almaz-Antey concern, &quot;omissions in work&quot; and &quot;loss of confidence.&quot;
Gennady Bendersky has been appointed head of the NGO for the next three years.
Information about the dismissal of Neskorodov appeared only on Thursday evening and did not cause a wide resonance in the media.
How to explain such silence in the conditions of large-scale rearmament of the army?
Most likely, the leadership of the Russian Federation does not want any rumors or negative assumptions to spread in the public environment.
This once again confirms that the military-industrial complex (DIC) has many problems and the state does not want to draw increased attention to them from the society.
The dismissal of Neskorodov is undoubtedly an important event in terms of restoring order in the industry.
NPO Almaz is the head enterprise of the concern, which specializes in the production of sea and land-based anti-aircraft missile systems (SAM).
Almaz is currently working on the creation of the Polyment-Redut and Morpheus air defense systems, which are planned to be installed on new corvettes, frigates, destroyers and cruisers.
The founder of the portal Military Russia Dmitry Kornev believes that the dismissal of Neskorodov was caused by the failure to meet deadlines for these projects.
This version is the most logical.
For example, the development of &quot;Morpheus&quot; began in 2007, and commissioning was expected in 2013.
&quot;Polyment-Redut&quot; should become the main air defense system on the latest ships of the Navy.
According to the information I receive, in several years of testing, not a single truly successful test has been made.
True, as far as I can tell, this is not the unequivocal fault of Almaz,&quot; said Kornev.
The expert fears that a delay in commissioning may also occur with the S-500 air defense system.
Development work on the project has not yet been completed, but during 2016 the first complexes should go to the troops.
The Ministry of Defense assures that &quot;the work is being carried out as planned and everything will be completed on time,&quot; although in 2014 the department admitted that there were problems with the development of the S-500.
It is extremely difficult to assess the professional qualities of Neskorodov, who has been in charge of Almaz since 2011.
Kornev stated that failures to meet deadlines for projects can be both a reason and a reason for dismissal.
In his opinion, in recent years it has become extremely difficult to obtain information about the internal processes in the defense industry and the plans of enterprise management.
The industry has received long-term orders worth tens of billions of rubles, and big money, as you know, loves silence.
As a rule, the directors of defense companies leave their positions of their own free will, by agreement of the parties, or are transferred to another job.
In this case, the suspension took place publicly, although it did not receive a resonance.
This suggests that the head of &quot;Almaz&quot; was, perhaps, a figure of a shrew and resisted the &quot;orders&quot; coming down from above.
Apparently, the state no longer intends to put up with such behavior.
With the hands of shareholders, it will remove those who prefer to argue with the installations of the Ministry of Defense and do not fulfill their tasks.
At the same time, the leadership of the Russian Federation seeks to punish the stealing managers (fraud at the Zvezda shipyard).
The president personally pays increased attention to the problems of the sector.
Vladimir Putin heads the Military-Industrial Commission and periodically holds meetings on rearmament.
The Kremlin protects the ranks of the OPK managers, seeking to have a loyal staff of directors on hand who will carry out orders received from above.
This is far from an ideal policy, but against the backdrop of rampant corruption and the lack of normal competition in the defense industry, the state has no other tools.
The current situation in the defense industry, of course, is not catastrophic, but the current geopolitical situation encourages the Kremlin to put the Armed Forces in order as soon as possible.
In parallel with the &quot;cleansing&quot; of managers in the defense industry, the leadership of the Russian Federation is taking quite successful steps to improve the professionalism of the Russian troops.
The personnel of the army acquired a new quality with the advent of the Minister of Defense Sergei Shoigu.
One gets the impression that the president has adopted the well-known saying &quot;If you want peace, prepare for war.&quot;
During the Cold War, Soviet military might and nuclear parity achieved in the 1970s led to the Helsinki Pact, which secured Moscow&#39;s spheres of influence on the continent.
With all the shortcomings of the bipolar system, it worked quite effectively.
The proof of this was the absence of wars on the European continent and the relatively stable situation in the Middle East.
The triumph of the &quot;winners&quot; in the Cold War eventually turned into a strengthening of international terrorism.
After a series of terrorist attacks in Europe and the United States in the &quot;civilized world&quot;, perhaps, there is not a single calm corner left.
Despite the common misfortune, the West refuses to talk with Russia on the level of an equal partner.
Under such conditions, the only allies of our country are the fleet and the army.
The strengthening of military power will allow Moscow to more effectively defend national interests and reach new frontiers in world politics.
Scot&#39;s Callum Skinner races down the finish line, causing the Brits to capture cycling gold
Scotsman Callum Skinner raced to triumph in the men&#39;s team sprint at the Rio Velodrome last night, causing the UK team trio to defend their title from London 2012.
The 23-year-old Glaswegian was in a heavyweight role that his fellow Scot Sir Chris Hoy made his own, and the youngster proudly made history by racing down the finish line to snatch victory from the favorite New Zealand team.
Britain claimed a surprise victory four years ago, winning when Hoy claimed a fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the stunt after finishing modestly sixth at the World Track Cycling Championships in London in March, despite the fact that Hoy has since retired.
The issue between Beijing and London was the replacement of member specialist Jamie Staff.
They did so just at the time when Hindes appeared.
Hoy&#39;s departure also created a void that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was the man the British coaches stuck to, seeing potential in the Scot that was now realized.
Hindes, Kenny - champions since Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in qualifying, but the standard was surpassed by New Zealand in the first round.
And the British trio won the duel for gold.
Hindes was exactly behind after his lap, but Kenny pushed the team forward and Skinner supported.
The change of strategy was a big part of the transformation, with Hindes riding in a higher gear to slow down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to keep pace.
Hoy watched from his seat as a BBC guest pundit and caught the eye of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they stepped onto the podium.
Skinner, 23, from Glasgow, said: &quot;It&#39;s a flattering comparison.&quot;
I&#39;m here to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the final and beat the world champions.
That was incredible.
There is no better way to win.
After triumphing in London in 2012 alongside Kenny and Hoy, Hindes admitted to having deliberately fallen onto the track after a bad start.
He later retracted comment and there was no way to appeal from UK competitors.
There was no such question this time in the greatest victory.
Hindes said: &quot;I felt like I was in London with all those UK flags on the podium.&quot;
We all met as a team in the last three months.
We have lost so many world-famous races that it was amazing to win the Olympics again.
This is one event, one gold medal for a country that has won seven of the 10 race titles in both Beijing and London.
If this is a barometer of progress made in the last five months, then the velodrome has five more successful days ahead.
With the form Kenny has shown, it&#39;s not beyond imagining him repeating Hoy&#39;s feat of winning three Olympic gold medals in the same Games.
This would see Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (it seems to be a sacred date in British sports, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - finish his score up to six gold medals and one silver.
It would be the same as Hoya&#39;s.
Kenny next competes in the sprint, which starts today and plays out over three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said: &quot;I&#39;m just enjoying it now.
Team competition is always the best.
You come to win with your comrades.
It&#39;s a little lonely to win alone, to be honest.
Hindes said: &quot;If he wins two more gold medals, he should get a knighthood.&quot;
It was the only medal draw of the day, but there was good news for Britain that followed.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Stephen Burke and Owen Dull qualified in the fastest four-kilometer team pursuit in fours.
They finished in 3:51.943.
The world record set when winning gold in London 2012 is 3:51.659.
The first round and final (10:42 pm) will take place today, on the second day of the event, where Wiggins will definitely be in the spotlight.
He had a discussion with the commissioners yesterday, on the eve of the qualifying race, when the officials demanded that he measure his weight.
In the respective women&#39;s event, which resumes and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Eleanor Barker and Cathy Archibald of Milngavie all improved the world record with a time of 4:13.260.
Team Great Britain has come to rely on a mighty team of cyclists to take over the middle period of the Olympics and earn tons of medals.
After the truly exceptional displays of total dominance in Beijing and London, expectations have eased in the gradual preparations for Rio.
There have been dramas in the background, not least the departure of CTO Shane Sutton in April amid accusations of sexism and harassment, and the exits of major figures such as Hoy and Victoria Pendelton.
However, based on the first evening&#39;s race at the velodrome, it seems that Britain&#39;s now legendary glory in reaching the top at the right time may just be repeating itself.
The future of the Portland steel plant is under threat due to the termination of the contract for electricity
The future of the Portland aluminum smelter in Victoria - as well as the jobs of hundreds of workers - is in jeopardy when the electricity company that supplies the plant is about to terminate the supply contract, according to one of the plant&#39;s owners: all supply contracts are scheduled to be terminated.
The move follows a decision made earlier this year by the Victorian government not to renew subsidies to support the operation of the plant.
The fixed subsidy for 20 years expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs could be at risk at Alcoa&#39;s Portland plant.
As many as 2,000 jobs – directly and indirectly – could be at risk from any closure.
There may also be additional indirect impacts, as the steel plant consumes about 10 percent of all electricity generated in Victoria.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry steel plant, leading to the closure of the Anglesey power plant last year.
Alcoa&#39;s Portland steel plant is losing money and is in danger of closing.
These actions were the result of several years of deliberation about the future of the plant, initially due to the strong position of the Australian dollar, and later - because of the price of the plant&#39;s products.
AGL, which supplies electricity to a large aluminum smelter from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, said it expects the other three owners to also take steps to terminate the contracts.
The plant is majority owned by a short-term joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, with China&#39;s CITIC and Japan&#39;s Marubeni Corp holding smaller stakes.
&quot;AGL expects that the Portland site will continue to operate, that is, that the physical demand for electricity from the steel plant will not stop,&quot; she said.
According to AGL, the contracts in question are so-called &#39;hedged contracts&#39;, which were due to come into effect in November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month termination period, so they will actually end in 2017.
&quot;Accordingly, AGL still expects these contracts to generate their share of revenue in fiscal 2017,&quot; the utility said.
Any potential impact on AGL&#39;s earnings from fiscal 2018 is currently limited to forecasts of a strong futures market for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL said it had already reduced the amount of contracts in its accounts by $187 million in view of the &quot;upcoming termination.&quot;
Alcoa said the decision to terminate the contracts &quot;does not affect Alcoa&#39;s ability to operate the steel plant or supply electricity to the steel plant.&quot;
The American company said it entered into a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which was due to take effect in November this year, but has yet to explain why it terminated the contract.
Analysts feared the possible closure of both the Portland ironworks in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the unfavorable economic situation in the industry.
Speaking to analysts earlier this week, AGL chief operations officer Steven Mikkelsen said Portland uses about 600 megawatts of power annually and Tomago about 900 megawatts.
If both of these plants leave the market, there will be a significant reduction in demand in the [electricity] market.
For us, as a manufacturer, it will be bad,” he said.
Not only the reality TV star Kardashian, Kendall on the cover of the September issue of Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of manager mother Kris&#39; Kardashian-Jenner clan, appeared on the coveted September cover of US Vogue magazine.
Kendall, who is the face of Estee Lauder and has walked at Milan, Paris and New York fashion weeks, broke the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
“Staying in a room with my favorite people, I looked at this cover and cried,” wrote Kendall.
The news about the cover was accompanied by a strange (or just in the spirit of the &quot;Kardashian Family&quot;?), Prepared reality video, in which the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (rogues Rob and Caitlin, also joined by everyone&#39;s favorite show business uncle, producer of &quot;Family Kardashian by Ryan Seacrest), forgot about her sister&#39;s appearance on the cover, and at the end - a classic twist: they planned a surprise party.
It&#39;s a standard storyline for almost every birthday episode of children&#39;s television shows (Seacrest delivers the line, &quot;Did you think we forgot about you?&quot; with the sincerity of an 8am cartoon bunny), but Chris needed that fame so or otherwise went to other girls.
Because with this episode dedicated to the September issue of Vogue, we have undoubtedly entered a new era of the Kardashian show.
Older sister Kendall Kim may have been on the cover of Vogue before (she appeared on the cover with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September cover of the magazine is an achievement in itself.
The September issue is Vogue&#39;s best-selling issue of the year.
Thick as a deluxe edition than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a huge number of advertisers (Fashionista estimates that 615 pages of last year&#39;s 832-page issue contained ads).
News about which stars will be on its cover is awaited with such eagerness that in the past two years, the magazine&#39;s photos have been leaked before the official announcement.
Previous women on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have certainly been more &quot;celebrity models&quot; on the cover than &quot;models who are celebrities.&quot;
Oscar winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was featured on the cover in 2013, one year after Lady Gaga was given the honor.
But even in the unlikely event that Jenner, who the magazine described as the &quot;outstanding model&quot; of her generation, falls into the first category, she&#39;s in good company.
These celebs aren&#39;t famous relatives, reality TV stars, or modern day kids who know how to make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner falls into all of those categories).
These are truly talented women who excel in the entertainment industry.
For Beyoncé, who appeared on the cover last year, this year was one of the most successful in her career in connection with the release of the Lemonade album.
Of course, not everyone is happy about Jenner&#39;s success.
Jenner&#39;s position in the fashion world, given her past as a reality TV star, must have always been precarious.
In June, one of the first models of Victoria&#39;s Secret Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them &quot;the bitches of the moment.&quot;
These sentiments were bubbling up again after the news of Jenner&#39;s appearance on the cover of Vogue.
But there is no point in dwelling on dissatisfaction.
Kendall Jenner on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.
She is a supermodel in every sense of the word.
She parades for Marc Jacobs.
She sells you Estee Lauder foundation.
She, and all her sisters, sell you their photos in their own applications, available for a paid subscription.
She sells self-made photographs of her daughter Cindy Crawford to LOVE magazine.
And in her free time, perhaps in order to still see her sister Courtney and her children, she participates in a reality TV show.
Community legal centers deny service to 160,000 people a year
Each year, more than 160,000 of the most vulnerable members of the population are denied service from community legal centers as the sector braces for the effect that further funding cuts will have on already stretched capacity activities.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly the elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, people unable to deal with unfair dispossession and so on - have already been turned down while trying to get free legal help and representation.
Public legal services, already operating beyond capacity, are bracing for further cuts.
From June next year, these law centers are set to lose another 30 percent of federal funding.
Queensland Community Law Centers director James Farrell said thousands of people a year are being turned away, according to the National Association of Community Law Centers&#39; latest census report.
Farrell said that if the federal government&#39;s decision is not reversed, the situation will only get worse.
&quot;Queensland Community Law Centers are consistently underfunded, which means thousands of people are denied the life-saving services they need,&quot; he said.
People leaving abusive relationships, people with unmanageable and devastating debts, families going through divorce, workers being unfairly fired—they all have legal problems, and this report shows they can&#39;t get the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 percent from June 2017, meaning thousands of less protected Queenslanders will have to deal with complex legal issues without help.
We call on Attorney General and Queensland Senator George Brandis to rescind these funding cuts immediately so people can get the help they need when they face legal problems.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise legal aid funding to the national average.
Now is the time to address the needs of community law centers and communities, their clients, and it is time for the Palaszczuk government to invest in this important work.
Donald Trump campaign headquarters sued after employee allegedly threatened gun
Donald Trump&#39;s campaign is reportedly being sued in New York after reports that its North Carolina COO threatened a staff member with a gun while riding in a jeep in February.
The incident was described in a lawsuit filed Wednesday in state court in Charlotte by Vincent Bordini, a former software instructor at the state campaign headquarters.
Bordini said he waited several months for the problem to be resolved internally, but realized that &quot;it will not happen.&quot;
Director Earl Phillip &quot;pulled his gun, put his right index finger on the trigger and aimed the muzzle at Vincent&#39;s kneecap,&quot; Bordini claims in the complaint.
After complaining to the local and regional campaign office, Bordini realized that at least four other people were involved in similar incidents with Phillip, the appeal says.
&quot;Pistols don&#39;t have to be fired to cause damage,&quot; Bordini said in the complaint.
The lawsuit comes just two days after the Republican presidential candidate made a splash when he told listeners in North Carolina that &quot;Second Amendment people&quot; - understood as gun owners and hobbyists - could take action if his rival Hillary Clinton will be elected and will be able to choose judges.
The Trump campaign said the media took his words out of context and that he did not speak out in support of the violence.
In his complaint, Bordini seeks compensation from the campaign headquarters for negligent control, and from Phillip for the threat of physical violence, physical abuse and infliction of non-pecuniary damage.
Trump spokesman Hope Hicks has been slow to respond to a request for comment.
Attempts to talk to Phillip were unsuccessful.
WCCB, a local news partner in Charlotte, reported that Phillip had recently left the campaign.
In response to a call to his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, no one called back quickly.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has run a controversial campaign.
Case: Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court, Mecklenburg County Division of Superior Court (Charlotte).
Britain must channel the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also bring rebirth and prosperity, not only to our local communities and to London as a whole, but throughout the country.
For me, that was exactly the huge advantage of Heathrow, just like it was with London 2012, where we made every effort to ensure that our peoples and regions benefit from the Games.
The Olympic Games have been of great benefit to Stratford and the East End.
And we will do it again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
For our local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new internships, 40,000 new jobs and end youth unemployment around the airport.
Just as there was before London 2012, there will be those who think that the task of expanding Heathrow is too big.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympics and that we would be in a quandary on the world stage.
Skeptics were wrong in 2012 and will be proven wrong about Heathrow.
There are always hurdles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question asked about him.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for the majority, not just for a narrow circle.
The expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211bn of economic growth, leaving a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow that delivered a £11bn infrastructure investment program on time and within budget, from T5, voted best airport terminal for five consecutive years, to T2, built in the middle of two of the world&#39;s busiest runways.
They are now ready to secure a third runway, backed by £16bn of private investment.
The London 2012 Olympic Games were a huge success for the UK and I&#39;m sure Heathrow will expand too.
Now is the time for us to put the Olympic spirit back on track and expand Heathrow, securing our trading future and creating a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Dayton - Chairman of Heathrow Council and former Trade Attaché to the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook playing cat and mouse on ad blocking
For companies that make money from online advertising, trying to bypass ad-blocking software is a game of cat and mouse, according to one company that makes such software.
On Thursday, just a couple of days after Facebook announced that it was going to block ad blockers on its desktop version of the site, Adblock Plus published a blog post that users can update their filters in the program to block ads on the social network again. .
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that the desktop version of the site will change the layout around its ads to make it harder for ad blockers to recognize which parts of the page are ads.
But Adblock now says it was able to bypass the new code.
In a blog post, Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote that &quot;this kind of mutual struggle between the open source ad blocker community and those who try to circumvent it has been going on since the invention of ad blocking&quot; and it is possible that Facebook will introduce its own solution. in the near future.
The fact that the world&#39;s largest social network has entered the fray is a clear sign of just how big a problem ad blockers have become for the industry.
Around 200 million people around the world use ad blockers, according to last year&#39;s survey by Pagefair and Adobe; nearly four times the number who used such software in 2013.
With 1.3 billion daily active users who access Facebook via mobile devices, mobile advertising now makes up 84 percent of Facebook&#39;s ad revenue.
However, the company is hunting for ad blockers on the desktop version, as mobile ad blockers are ineffective on Facebook&#39;s social media and Instagram mobile apps, according to a spokesperson.
Still, desktop ads are profitable enough that Facebook considers such a move a worthwhile investment.
Also Thursday, Facebook announced that it is going to update its &quot;ad preference&quot; tool to give people more control over how ads are targeted to them.
On Thursday, Facebook said the new Adblock filters were a concern, as they would also block some non-advertising content on the site.
&quot;This will not be a positive experience for people and we plan to address this issue,&quot; a Facebook spokesperson said in an official email.
Ad blockers are a crude tool, so we&#39;ve instead focused on building tools like Ad Preferences to put control in the hands of the people.
Woman run over on Swiss motorway in apparent suicide
The victim was lying on the freeway in the middle of the night.
Police are calling for witnesses after a woman was run over by multiple vehicles on a freeway early Thursday in an apparent suicide attempt.
The incident took place on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud just after midnight on Thursday.
The woman lay down on the road in the dark &quot;in a gesture of desperation&quot; and was hit by several vehicles, police said in a statement.
In an apparent attempt to kill himself, the victim, a Swiss woman aged 49, was hit by several vehicles, including a truck.
She died on the spot.
Several of the drivers involved have already been interviewed, but some have yet to be identified, police said, who are urging them and anyone else who witnessed the incident to come forward.
A criminal case was opened, a &quot;logical&quot; step in such a situation, lawyer Gillet Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be seen if any of the drivers involved will face charges.
Was it possible to avoid being hit?
That&#39;s what the prosecutor has to determine,&quot; Hofstetter said.
Two other similar cases in the last five years suggest that drivers will not be held responsible.
In each case - both of which involve a person walking in the dark on a freeway - the verdict was that motorists cannot expect to accidentally encounter a pedestrian on a freeway in the middle of the night, the newspaper reported.
Last year, an officer was acquitted of causing death by negligence after she hit and killed a man lying on the A1 near Payerne on the night of August 2014.
22-year-old victim drank and passed out on the road, heard the court.
The court found that the female police officer - who answered the emergency call - was driving in a manner that was justified, and that having a person on the road was &quot;a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation,&quot; the judge said.
Anyone with information about Thursday&#39;s incident near Morges should call the police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA Climate Model: Venus Was Once Habitable
Venus may have once been habitable, according to NASA&#39;s new climate model estimates.
Scientists at NASA&#39;s Goddard Institute for Space Studies have developed a model for exploring Venus&#39; past using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was developed to determine whether Venus, with its hot, waterless surface and atmosphere saturated with carbon dioxide, could ever have experienced Earth-like conditions.
Scientists have previously suggested that Venus&#39;s slow rotation is due to its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulations suggest that Venus could probably have a thin atmosphere like Earth&#39;s and still rotate slowly.
The model also considered the topography of early Venus.
The planet, in all likelihood, had more dry regions than Earth, but it once had enough water and enough geographic variability to support life and prevent rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent dimmer.
&quot;According to the GISS model, Venus&#39;s slow rotation exposes its dayside to the sun for nearly two months at a time,&quot; GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio explained in a press release.
This warms the planet&#39;s surface and produces rain, which creates a thick cloud layer that acts as an umbrella, shielding the planet&#39;s surface from much of the sun&#39;s heat.
The result is average climatic temperatures that are, surprisingly, several degrees colder than today on Earth.
The model shows a history of Venus that is similar to the evolution previously assumed by planetary scientists.
Even though Venus may have once been habitable, it has been exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet radiation for several billion years.
Its oceans evaporated and its water vapor was scorched by ultraviolet radiation.
When its hydrogen evaporated, only a dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect remained - that is, Venus as we know it today.
The researchers shared the results of their new climate model for Venus in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy steps down as Avalanche coach
Patrick Roy stepped down as coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche on Thursday, citing a lack of influence during the team&#39;s decision-making process.
Colorado team executive vice president/general manager Joe Sakic confirmed the news and noted that the club would start looking for a new coach immediately.
&quot;For the past three years, I have carried out my duties as Head Coach and Vice President of Hockey Operations for the Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination,&quot; Roy, 50, said in a statement.
Over the summer, I thought long and hard about how I could improve this team to give it the depth it needs and take it to a higher level.
To achieve this goal, the vision of the coach and vice president of hockey operations must perfectly match the vision of the organization.
He should also have a say in decisions that affect the work of the team.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contributions to the team.
&quot;Patrick informed me of his decision today,&quot; Sakic said.
We appreciate everything he has done for our organization and wish him success in the future.
Roy won the Jack Adams Award for Best Coach in the League during his first season with the Avalanche in 2013-2014.
He led the club to 112 points and a Central Division victory, but Colorado were crushed by Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs and have been losing the playoffs for the past two years.
The Avalanche posted a 39-39-4 record for the 2015-2016 season and was five points behind the Wild for a second promotional ticket to the Western Conference.
Hall of Famer goaltender Roy has won four Stanley Cups, two each with the Montreal Canadiens and two with the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers resume talks and suspend strike
Workers&#39; strikes over North Sea oil workers&#39; wages have been suspended and all parties to the discussion are embarking on a new round of talks, leading spokesmen said.
Strikes against oilfield services company Wood Group have been sporadic on North Sea platforms operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
&quot;Wood Group and the Unite and RMT alliances can confirm that we have agreed to resume the negotiation process to resolve ongoing disputes,&quot; the joint statement said.
We will be holding several full-time meetings over the next few weeks, starting early next week, to take a fresh look at the issues.
The unions said their recent action, which they say was the first in more than 25 years, was against potential pay cuts of up to 30 percent.
The Wood Group has cut the rates paid to contract workers working in the North Sea by about 9 percent this year due to negative market pressures.
The company&#39;s rate cut comes after a 10 percent rate cut for shore contract workers in 2014.
The additional cuts will give it the space it needs to weather the market downturn, the company said.
Shell, for its part, has laid off thousands of people and announced plans to shut down its oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as it streamlines its operations following its mega-merger with British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to lower prices for crude oil: the economic situation worsened due to the decision to leave the European Union, taken in June by the UK.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with trade union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labor disputes in the North Sea in our era.
The North Sea, he said, is vital to the regional economy.
&quot;In the North Sea, and across the country, we need an economy that works for the majority, not just a few,&quot; he said in a statement.
Less than $1.4 billion in spending on new projects in the North Sea is expected in 2016, in contrast to an average of about $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of stars in the Pleiades cluster
The latest Kepler space telescope mission has helped astronomers assemble the most comprehensive catalog of the rotational speeds of stars in the Pleiades cluster.
The new data is helping astronomers understand why the stars in the cluster rotate at different speeds, as well as how rotation periods correlate with planet formation.
&quot;We hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age, and even the history of its solar system,&quot; Louise Ryball, a researcher at the Center for Infrared Processing and Analysis at the California State University, said in a press release. technological institute.
The Pleiades cluster is located 445 light years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster are now just reaching maturity; they were born about 125 million years ago.
They are spinning as fast as they&#39;ll never be again.
At their peak rotational speeds, these maturing stars throw out large amounts of stellar wind.
As they travel through the magnetic fields of stars, these winds exert a decelerating effect on the stars.
As a star ages, its rotation speed begins to slow down.
Kepler measures each star&#39;s rotation rate by tracking the time between the appearance of recognizable star spots, such as sunspots.
The latest catalog of rotation rates suggests that more massive stars rotate more slowly than less massive stars.
Ryball compares the stars to dancers: the larger ones pirouette slower than the smaller ones.
&quot;In the Pleiadian ballet, we see that those that rotate slowly are usually more massive, while those that rotate faster are usually very light stars,&quot; Ryball said.
Because the Pleiades Cluster is so close, it serves as an ideal space laboratory for comparing the properties of stars with rotational speeds.
&quot;The Pleiades star cluster provides a starting point for theoretical models of the rotation of stars, both younger and older,&quot; Ryball said.
We still want to know a lot about how, where and why stars slow down their rotation and hang their &quot;dancing shoes&quot; on a nail, figuratively speaking.
Ryball and her colleagues have detailed their latest analysis of the Pleiadian rotation rates in three new papers, soon to be published in The Astronomical Journal.
The investigation related to the activities of a group of Ukrainian saboteurs detained in Crimea is being conducted by two departments, Kommersant writes.
The FSB is collecting evidence of the involvement of the detainees in the preparation of sabotage in the Crimea.
As previously reported, Yevgeny Panov, a resident of the Ukrainian city of Energodar, confessed, agreeing to cooperate with the investigation.
According to him, he considered the Titan chemical plant in Armyansk, the oil depot in Feodosia, the Kerch ferry crossing, a gas pipeline, and also one of the military airfields as targets for sabotage.
Law enforcers believe that not all of the accomplices of the saboteurs were able to be detained.
This, in particular, became the basis for the arrest of suspects in the Kievsky District Court of Simferopol, the newspaper notes.
Stanislav Cherchesov became the head coach of the Russian national football team
At a meeting of the Executive Committee of the Russian Football Union, it was decided to appoint Stanislav Cherchesov as head coach of the Russian national football team.
The contract with him will be for two years - until the end of the 2018 World Cup.
On August 11, the executive committee of the RFU appointed Stanislav Cherchesov to the post of head coach of the Russian national football team.
This is a well-known football player who previously played in the Moscow &quot;Spartak&quot; as a goalkeeper, as well as a coach with solid experience, who was a mentor of such Russian teams as the same &quot;Spartak&quot;, &quot;Pearl-Sochi&quot;, &quot;Terek&quot;, &quot;Amkar&quot;, Dynamo, as well as the Warsaw Legia, which became the winner of the national championship and the country&#39;s cup.
It is reported that the contract with Cherchesov will be signed in the very near future and is designed for two years.
Thus, it is he who is responsible for preparing the national team for the 2018 World Cup.
It is known that his coaching staff will include Miroslav Romashchenko, Gintaras Stauche, Vladimir Panikov.
There is information according to which the salary of the entire coaching staff will be 2.6 billion euros per year.
According to media reports, the leadership of the RFU set a goal for Stanislav Cherchesov to bring the Russian team to the semi-finals and win medals.
According to the coach himself, as a priority he considers the creation of a competitive environment in the team and is going to give the players the opportunity to prove themselves.
Also, according to Cherchesov, he is glad that the choice fell on him.
The Russian national team will play the first match under the leadership of Cherchesov on August 31 in Antalya - it will be a friendly match with the Turkish team.
Recall that earlier the post of head coach of the Russian national football team was occupied by Leonid Slutsky, who combined it with coaching at the CSKA club.
He announced his resignation from the post after the failed performance of the Russian national team at Euro 2016 in France.
At the same time, he took responsibility for the poor result of the national team.
Sandwiched between Angola and South Africa, Namibia suffered greatly during the long struggle against apartheid.
However, since gaining independence from South Africa in 1990, this country of 2.4 million has made tremendous strides, especially in the last few years.
The main reason for Namibia&#39;s success is that the government places a lot of emphasis on education.
While people in developed countries take for granted free primary and secondary education, in many poor countries secondary and even primary schools require tuition fees.
Moreover, governments are often advised to introduce &quot;cost recovery&quot; tuition fees.
However, in Namibia, education in primary schools is free.
Moreover, since 2015, secondary education has also become free.
The country&#39;s authorities are also actively working in other important areas.
Efforts to eradicate malaria have reduced the number of annual cases by 97% over the past ten years.
Contrary to the international trend of growing inequality, it is declining in Namibia.
Compared to the 1993 figure, the Gini coefficient, which is a standard measure of inequality in income distribution, has fallen by 15 points.
Then, 23 years ago, this figure was one of the highest in the world.
And the poverty rate has fallen from 69% in 1993 to less than 30%.
The number of people living in extreme poverty (less than $1.90 a day) has also fallen, from almost 53% to less than 23%.
Namibia also has the highest free speech rating in Africa, according to Reporters Without Borders.
The country has significantly outpaced the United States and other wealthy states.
In addition, the country has a favorable rating - one of the highest in Africa - in the Corruption Perceptions Index, compiled by human rights activists from Transparency International.
Even now, when commodity prices are falling, Namibia manages to maintain high growth rates.
At the same time, the debt-to-GDP ratio is around 25%, which is less than 1/3 of the level of debt in the US and most European countries.
Of course, Namibia also has some problems.
The unemployment rate, at least according to traditional methods of estimation, is still quite high - almost 28%.
And, like other countries in the region, Namibia has a high rate of HIV/AIDS with nearly 17% of the population being infected.
The World Bank estimates that Namibia is an upper-middle-income country, but the authorities insist that their country is in fact a developing country.
Namibia certainly faces some of the challenges that are inherent in underdeveloped economies.
The state has to develop a very large and arid country with a small population.
Isolated nomadic tribes of hunter-gatherers live in the deserts of the country, which one way or another must be integrated into modern society, without losing their identity.
Integrating people who a quarter of a century ago were on the periphery of the world economy is not an easy task for any country.
For Namibia, it is even more difficult: like any other country in the world, it is facing the effects of climate change.
However, Namibia did not even think to give up, the country is solving the problems it faces.
Almost immediately after independence, the authorities set about building a diversified economy and a cohesive society.
Notably, rival political factions have come together to work for the common good.
Indeed, Namibia provides cheap medical care not only to its own citizens, but also to its neighbors.
About 15-20% of visitors to health facilities in northern Namibia are Angolan citizens.
No one in Namibia talks about building a wall to separate the country from its poor and corrupt neighbors.
The Namibians realized that they did not choose their neighbors, and therefore decided not to conflict with them, but to cooperate - to share scarce water resources, take part in regional medical projects, encourage investment and student exchange.
Moreover, the Namibian government rightly judged that rich natural resources could easily become a curse, making the few rich at the expense of the many.
The authorities understand that the income from Namibia&#39;s natural wealth must be invested in infrastructure and productive capacity.
They also recognize that it would be irresponsible not to seek maximum profit from the sale of the country&#39;s resources, and are reviewing investment laws and mining contracts to ensure that this is the case.
Transparency is critical to this process, which is why strong government support for free speech is so important.
As head of state Hage Geingob noted, the media often say what he does not like.
But after fighting for freedom from apartheid in South Africa, Namibia must defend the freedoms it has gained, the president says.
Not all of Namibia&#39;s key resources are exhaustible.
Some - such as fishing - are renewable, and the government is working hard to preserve and strengthen them.
Every year, over a million foreign tourists visit the country.
Namibia shows that even those countries that start out with serious flaws - racism, colonialism, inequality and underdevelopment - can get on the path to shared prosperity.
Her achievement deserves international recognition and emulation.
Many have heard about the &quot;Gold of Varna&quot; - the oldest golden objects created by man (4600 - 4200 BC).
Perhaps this was the loudest archaeological sensation of the 1970s: in Bulgaria, during the excavations of the Varna necropolis, a fantastic number of gold artifacts were found - more than three thousand with a total weight of 6 kilograms.
Only from one burial, known as &quot;grave No. 43&quot;, 990 gold objects with a total weight of more than 1.5 kg were recovered.
However, the official status of the oldest gold in the world may soon pass to a plain-looking bead found by archaeologists in July this year.
And again in Bulgaria - in a prehistoric settlement known as Tell Yunatsite.
Unlike Varna, a port city, Tell Yunatsite is located far from the sea, near the village of Yunatsite in the Pazardzhik region.
The bead is a gold strip rolled into a ring.
Yavor Boyadzhiev, head of the excavations at Tell Yunatsite, dated the find to 4600 BC and said it was at least 200 years older than the Varna gold.
Treasures of Varna, we recall, date back to approximately the same period, 4600 - 4200 years. BC.
There are currently no technologies that allow metal dating with impeccable accuracy.
Where is the confidence in which gold is more ancient?
Evidently Prof. Boyadjiev knows more than he told Reuters: &quot;I&#39;m quite sure that Yunatsite&#39;s gold is older than Varna&#39;s.&quot;
This is a find of extreme importance: it looks like a tiny object, but it is large enough to take its rightful place in history.
In an interview with Reuters, Boyadzhiev said that in the near future, scientists will analyze the composition of the metal, as well as re-examine and more thoroughly the archaeological layer where the gold artifact was found.
This will help date the bead as accurately as possible.
The location of the find also explains a lot.
Tell Yunatsite is a famous settlement, even if you have never heard of it.
Tell Yunatsite is currently considered the oldest &quot;city&quot; in Europe.
Tell was founded by the descendants of people who migrated to Europe from Anatolia (modern Turkey) in the 7th millennium BC.
Over the following centuries, metalworking flourished in this region, from the development of the first metallurgical skills to the creation of a full-fledged industry.
In Russian historiography, this archaeological community has a special name: the Balkan-Carpathian metallurgical province.
In the 5th millennium BC, urban-type settlements began to appear around metalworking centers.
Now they are called the oldest cities in Europe.
Of these, Tell Yunatsite is perhaps the most ancient, since artifacts from 4900 BC were found here.
I would call Tell Yunazi the prototype of a modern city, although this is a very ancient settlement, even compared to Mesopotamia.
&quot;This place is a thousand years older than Sumer,&quot; says Boyadzhiev, referring to the conventional wisdom that urban culture originated in southern Mesopotamia - modern-day Iraq.
The first cities in the usual sense of the word arose there.
The excavations of Tell Yunatsite have been carried out since 1976.
During this time, archaeologists have unearthed almost 12 hectares, which is about a third of the estimated total area of the settlement.
The remains of the fortress wall were found, which once reached three meters in height.
Little has been preserved of the houses and workshops, but archaeologists clearly distinguish between streets, public buildings, urban dense buildings, the &quot;business center&quot; and residential outskirts.
Tell Yunatsite is often called the &quot;Bird City&quot;: dozens of clay figurines of birds have been found here.
All birds are depicted in a state of rest, hence the assumption that they were not decorative objects, but the object of a local cult.
The &quot;Bird City&quot; was destroyed around 4100 BC - possibly by Indo-European tribes who came from the northeast.
The nomads had no cities, but they had horses and weapons.
Three-meter fortress walls did not stop them.
Archaeologists have found obvious signs of a brutal massacre: the remains of old people, women and children were found inside the houses with traces of wounds inflicted by battle axes.
New finds and new facts appear every year, changing the usual ideas about the ancient history of mankind.
Bulgarian archaeologists are increasingly talking not about individual cultures, but about the &quot;lost&quot; first civilization of Europe, which originated in the Balkans.
A powerful incentive in the search for this civilization was the &quot;gold of Varna&quot;, found relatively recently, in 1972.
It is logical that the golden luxury of Varna should have been preceded by something - something like a tiny golden bead created in Tell Yunatsite.
Porsche artificially aged the 911 Targa
It is officially stated that the preparation of the 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design is carried out manually by specialists from the division who work with serial machines.
The &quot;retro look&quot; consists, for example, in the special body color Etna Blue, which was developed back in 1960 for the Porsche 356B model - even the model logo is painted in this color.
In addition, the targa received branded white graphics along the sides and special 20-inch RS Spyder wheels, as well as some bodywork details painted in white and gold metallic.

In addition, with the purchase of the special edition, each customer will receive a free car cover and a richly finished album with photographs of the production process.
The Porsche Exclusive specialists did not touch the power plant: the retro targa, according to its characteristics, is quite the same as the serial one.
It is equipped with a 3.0-liter turbocharged six-cylinder engine developing 420 hp. and 500 Nm.
The most dynamic version of the 911 Targa 4S can accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h in 4 seconds.
The Porsche 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design will be released in a limited edition, but neither its volume nor the cost of each specific sports car has been disclosed.
Facebook and ad blockers unleashed an &quot;arms race&quot;
Facebook&#39;s recent introduction of technology to prevent ad-hiding on social media pages has provoked retaliatory action by developers of ad-blocking solutions.
AdBlock Plus has released an &quot;antidote&quot;, but Facebook plans to make it useless soon.
This is how AdBlock Plus advertised their new technology, which is likely to remain effective for a short time.
The social network representatives noted that, in an effort to deceive the new technology of &quot;unblockable&quot; advertising, the solution from AdBlock Plus, along with commercial ads, also blocks many ordinary posts from friends or pages.
Facebook expressed regret with this policy of AdBlock Plus and promised to solve the problem soon.
As a source among the developers of the social network told TechCrunch, the code that makes AdBlock Plus useless on the Facebook desktop site will be ready within the next few hours.
Thus, the social network and blockers unleashed a kind of “arms race”, trying to beat each other, while users who missed interesting posts from friends or saw ads where they were not used to seeing them became the affected side.
The ethical aspects of ad blocking have been hotly debated lately.

Dongfeng will bring Fengguang 370 crossover and Rich New pickup truck to Russia - website Driving www.zr.ru
Dongfeng Fengguang 370 is a representative of a class of cars that is gaining popularity in China, combining the advantages of a minivan and a crossover.
Another announced Russian premiere is the Rich New pickup truck.
Many Western firms decided to ignore the Moscow International Motor Show this year, so Chinese firms will fill the emptiness of Crocus Expo showrooms.
In particular, Dongfeng Motor Corporation, which has great views on the Russian market and intends to offer our motorists a number of interesting new products in the near future, will act as a powerful front.
One of them will be the Dongfeng Fengguang 370 crossover, which went on sale in China this spring at a price of 55,900 yuan (just under 550,000 rubles at the current exchange rate).
The Russians are unlikely to get such a price tag, and the issue of deliveries to our country is still under discussion.
In China, by the way, following the results of June sales, the Fengguang 370 managed to reach 11th place in the list of the best-selling minivans, although due to the high ground clearance (175 mm) and the protective plastic body kit along the lower perimeter of the body, it can be considered a crossover.
Crossvan is built on the front-wheel drive platform of the younger model Fengguang 360, the 370 has the same wheelbase of 2725 mm, but the body is slightly longer (4565 mm versus 4510 mm), the design is more solid, and the equipment is richer.
The salon is decorated with wooden planks, but the large vertical touch screen &quot;like Tesla&quot; on the center console shown in the photo was only on the early exhibition copies of the crossvan, and cars with simpler &quot;music&quot; went on sale.
Five of the seven seats can be easily folded to form a flat loading area 1650 mm long, with a maximum trunk volume of 1500 liters.
The engine for the Fengguang 370 is only one - a 1.5-liter gasoline &quot;aspirated&quot; with a capacity of 115 hp, docked with a 5-speed manual gearbox.
The manufacturer is modestly silent about the dynamic qualities of the car, but promises a budget-friendly appetite of the owner at the level of 6.7 l / 100 km.
The Rich New pickup truck is the Nissan NP300 Navara of the generation before last, well known to Russians, but with a design slightly ennobled by Chinese stylists.
Despite the obsolete design, this model is still in stable demand among the Chinese consumer as a reliable and unpretentious workhorse.
At a reasonable price, Rich New will certainly interest Russians, too, because modern Japanese pickups have become prohibitively expensive.
Rich New is equipped with two engines to choose from: a 2.4 liter petrol (137 hp) or a 2.5 liter turbodiesel (116 hp).
Gearbox - only mechanics, drive - to the rear wheels, but there are modifications with a hard-wired front end.
The new flagship sedan A9 will also be at the Dongfeng booth, its Russian premiere was announced by the representative office of the Chinese company back in June.
There are more and more minivan-like crossovers in the Chinese market, one of the latest innovations is Cowin V3 and SWM X7.
Currently, the Russian Dongfeng line consists of two models: the S30 sedan and the H30 Cross hatchback.
For seven months of this year, the dealers of the Chinese company sold 696 cars in our country.
Notifications for transport tax will no longer be sent by mail - the site Behind the wheel www.zr.ru
The Tax Inspectorate has changed the procedure for sending property tax notices.
All Russian car owners are accustomed to the scheme that has not changed over the years: in summer and autumn they receive by mail receipts for paying transport tax for the previous year.
However, this year, many of them will not wait.
The fact is that the tax inspectorate quietly changed the procedure for notifying citizens.
Those who are registered in the &quot;Personal Account of the Taxpayer&quot; on the official website of the department nalog.ru will receive notifications in electronic form.
The inspection automatically considered such Russians as online users and deleted them from the standard, &quot;paper&quot; mailing list.
The innovation will affect all owners of vehicles and real estate.
Everyone else will continue to receive the usual emails.
However, the owners of an account on the site also have the opportunity to return to the old scheme.
To do this, they will have to visit the tax office during August and write an application.
On the one hand, the new order is more modern and more convenient.
The notification will appear in the &quot;personal account&quot; immediately after the compilation, while the letter will take several days and may be completely lost.
In addition, the number of users of the Internet service of the tax inspectorate has exceeded 18 million people, which will allow the department to seriously save on mailing lists.
On the other hand, modest news on the site of the inspection is clearly not enough to inform citizens about the changed order.
Some could register in the &quot;personal account&quot; for a one-time service and have long forgotten about it.
These people will not wait for notifications by mail and, without knowing it, will fall into the category of non-payers with all the ensuing consequences.
Access to the &quot;Taxpayer&#39;s Personal Account&quot; is carried out in three ways: through the gosuslugi.ru portal account, using an electronic signature or entering the login and password specified in the registration card.
The latter can be obtained in person at any branch of the tax office (regardless of the place of registration).
We remind you that this year the transport tax must be paid before December 1st.
The distribution of notifications began in July.
The tuning Mercedes-Benz G-class, in which the improvements are aimed at achieving a very high return, is a thing in itself.
But the controversial concept did not bother the masters of G-Power, who took up the modification of the sports version of the Mercedes-AMG G 63.
G-Power is known for its passion for BMW cars, but nothing human is alien to its craftsmen.
Indeed, why not improve the G 63 - a 571-horsepower flying sledgehammer with the aerodynamics of a tank and acceleration to hundreds in 5.4 seconds?
By pumping up the “muscles” of the crazy “Gelika”, the masters took advantage of the advantages that the 5.5-liter supercharged “eight” opens up.
But the dynamics of acceleration to hundreds has improved by an indistinguishable 0.1 s, and now the flying &quot;brick&quot; is capable of a breakthrough in 5.3 s.
However, acceleration from medium speeds is certainly given to him much better.
The speed ceiling is frightening: if the standard G 63 does not go faster than 210 km/h, then the tuning SUV with the electronic collar deactivated is capable of squeezing 250 km/h.
From the outside, the car is almost indistinguishable from its original factory source, with the exception of other rims - 23-inch Hurricane RR dimensions 305/35 ZR 23.
The luxury division of Mercedes-Maybach has announced a striking 6m-long concept coupe that will be unveiled as part of the Pebble Beach Contest of Elegance.
Mercedes-Benz is going to compete with the &quot;green sub-brand&quot; BMW i and will promote its electric models under a separate brand name.
In the coming years, at least four environmentally friendly new products are expected to appear.
