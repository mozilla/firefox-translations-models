"He found an apartment, he was dating a girl," Luis Galicia told KGO.
Luis Galicia said that he could not imagine someone who would like to hurt his younger brother.
He had a good soul and a great heart.
His way of communicating with his family was always to prepare some dish for us, to prepare us dinner," said Louis Galicia.

Scientists have found an animal that can live 500 years
An international biologist has concluded that the longest-lived vertebrate animal is the Greenland polar shark, which can live about 500 years.
Scientists conducted a radiocarbon analysis of the lens of the eye of 28 Greenland sharks.
The largest shark, which is longer than five meters long, can be from 272 to 512 years.
Biologists believe that an important role in the longevity of the shark is played by low metabolism, which leads to slow development.
Greenland sharks reach puberty only by the age of 150.
Previously, it was believed that the longest of all vertebrate animals live "neighbor" sharks - the Greenland whale.
The oldest specimen known to scientists was a little older than 210 years.

Should I go to a sanatorium if there are no health problems?
Our expert is the chief doctor of the sanatorium Olga Bogush.
And if a person is healthy, just tired of work, is he to go to the sanatorium?
Sanatorium-resort rest is necessary not only for treatment, but also for the prevention of diseases.
In the conditions of a sanatorium, a person can check the condition of his body and get recommendations from a doctor how to live, so that his health is not destroyed.
Such recommendations will not be superfluous to anyone.
"Just tired of work" - this is an important signal of the body, it is not worth brushing off.
Constant stress, mental and physical fatigue can lead to depression and chronic fatigue syndrome.
Stress is experienced by about 90% of those who come.
And it is most susceptible to people from large cities aged 45 to 55 years.
So it is better not to complicate the situation and give yourself a rest in time.
Studies show that 98% of people reduce their biological age during their stay in a sanatorium.
Modern sanatoriums offer a comfortable rest for the whole family.
So, if you want to spend a vacation with the kids, you won't have to leave them.
For children, even the youngest, there are health programs, which include both diagnostic services, pediatrician consultations, tests, and therapeutic programs.
For example, swimming (in many sanatoriums have children's pools), inhalations, a special diet, massages, oxygen cocktails, medical exercises.
The course of procedures is determined by the doctor taking into account the individual indications and characteristics of the growing organism.
In addition, in sanatoriums, as a rule, there is a children's club with animators, where children can attend game classes, various master classes.
Some sanatoriums open their doors even for guests with babies, provide infants with the necessary conditions and provide services of an experienced babysitter.
The mild winter, a long summer, the abundance of sunny days in the year (over 300) create good conditions for year-round recreation in the resorts of the Caucasian Mineral Waters.
And then the body needs rest not only in the summer.
So do not be afraid of the weather outside the window, especially since most of the procedures are carried out indoors and do not depend on the season.
In general, it is advisable to carry out sanatorium treatment 2 times a year, especially for people of mature age.
The main feature of the region of the Caucasian Mineral Waters, of course, medicinal mineral springs: Slavyanovsky, Smirnovsky, Essentuki, Narzan.
Their water has unique properties and affects various systems of the body.
Water varies in temperature, number of salts, general mineralization, chemical and gas composition.
The doctor selects the water depending on the patient's health.
So, "Narzan" has an anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory effect, restores the function of the gastrointestinal tract and metabolism.
"Essentuki 4" affects the gastrointestinal tract, reduces the level of sugar.
"Essentuki new" has an anti-inflammatory, choleretic and diuretic effect.
The same effects have water "Slavyanovskaya."
When prescribing water, the doctor necessarily takes into account the state of the cardiovascular system.
If there are signs of hypertension, it selects less salty water because the salts retain the fluid, which leads to increased pressure.
Reception of mineral water requires compliance with the regime: water should be drunk at a certain time, in the right amount and specific temperature.
Now in the sanatoriums available and various cosmetological procedures for the face and body.
What types of rehabilitation, based on the natural features of the North Caucasus, can be obtained at the resorts of this region?
Near Pyatigorsk, for example, there is a salted lake Tambukan, the silt mud from which is useful for the joints, spine, internal organs.
It has anti-inflammatory, resorption, immunomodulatory effect.
This is a wellness walk on individually compiled routes.
They are especially popular in Kislovodsk, where there is a huge Resort Park (the second largest in Europe).
Popular in Kislovodsk, which is located in close proximity to the mineral spring "Narzan."
There you can also take baths wine, pearl, iodobromine, selenium, sage-lacquer, depending on what your doctor will prescribe.
Extend the fruit.
What to do to make the harvest go until the end of the season?
Tells Yulia Belopukhova, agronomist and summer cottage.
It's time for tall tomatoes to arrange a haircut: remove new stepsons, cut the tops, remove all the leaves to the penultimate brushes with fruits and inflorescences with small ovaries - will not have time to ripen.
All tomatoes, regardless of the "constitution," as well as pepper and eggplant, feed ash-perpersphate hood, process biologics (Currator - to accelerate the inflow and growth of fruits, Phytosporin-M, Phytolavin, Gamair, Baktofitite - from diseases, Immunocytophite - to increase immunity, if there are Fitoshibillins.
Of the chemicals in late summer, it is worth using only copper sulfate, colloidal sulfur and green soap.
We make the last watering of plants.
We lower long-weet cucumbers in the greenhouse from the trellis so that the lower, bare part of the stem (25-40 cm) lay on the ground, water with warm water and circulated Circus, sprinkle the stem of 5-7 cm compost.
Extend the fruiting of zucchini is also easy: cut off the old leaves, spill with warm water and a solution of complex fertilizer, pour the fertile soil under the bush.
To protect against night colds, install an arc over the bed with cover material.
During the day, keep the plants open, and after sunset, close.
Signs of the end.
What does it mean that Russia is emerging from the crisis?
Economists have seen signs of Russia's withdrawal from the longest recession in the last 20 years.
According to Bloomberg analysts, Russia's GDP shows a positive dynamics - in the second quarter of GDP decreased by 0.8% in annual terms.
This is the lowest since the beginning of 2015.
According to the latest data of Rosstat, the decline of the Russian economy in the second quarter slowed to 0.6%.
The Central Bank and the Ministry of Economic Development also announced the stabilization of the situation.
Ahead is slow growth.
According to experts of the Central Bank, the recession in the Russian economy is a thing of the past.
"The indicative estimate of Russian GDP suggests that the recession is behind, and ahead - slow growth of the economy," - stated in the bulletin of the Bank of Russia "What are the trends say."
The modular estimate of GDP for the current quarter, the regulator's specialists increased to 0.4%, the estimate for the fourth quarter is 0.5%.
According to the representative of the Ministry of Economic Development, during the second quarter, the decline in the GDP of the Russian Federation stopped in the second quarter, amounting to 0.2%.
In the second quarter, the seasonally cleared GDP decline was 0.2% compared to the previous quarter.
But during the quarter, the decline stopped: in April it was 0.2%, and in May and June, the change in GDP was in the range of 0-0.15," - quotes the representative of the Ministry of Economics of RIA Novosti.
The slowdown in the pace of the fall of the Russian economy over the past five quarters indicates that "the bottom has been passed."
Among other markers pointing to signs of a revival of the national economy, Bloomberg calls the growth of demand for electricity and rail transportation, the revival of business.
If you make an amendment that the year is leap year, it is clear that the dynamics of plus 1% of electricity consumption can be half due to an additional working day.
Add to this a lower average annual temperature in the first quarter.
The next argument is the growth of freight traffic, but it is difficult to obtain accurate data, and plus or minus 0.5% of the semi-annual volume can also be explained by seasonality," explains Kirill Yakovenko of ALOR BROKER.
However, there are other, more obvious signs of stabilizing the Russian economy.
For example, lower price pressure.
In July, the consumer price index was 7.2% compared to 15.6% in the same month last year.
Moreover, for the last two weeks, Rosstat has recorded deflation.
Prices in Russia fell for the first time in five years.
If you look at the dynamics of the ruble, which, although it showed strong fluctuations at the beginning of the year, by the end of August from the beginning of the year strengthened by 12%.
This is also one of the signs of recovery, which should be followed by indicators from the real sector of the economy," Yakovenko emphasizes.
In addition, since April, the Russian Federation has seen an increase in industrial production.
In June, the figure grew by 1.7%.
The rate of decline in foreign trade turnover is slowing from -32.8% in January 2016 to -20.7% in May.
The situation in the labor market, where the unemployment rate has fallen to 5.4%, also demonstrates positive dynamics.
It was only in September 2015 (5.2 percent).
Despite the well-off situation in the labor market, the issue with the real disposable incomes of the population to leave much to be desired.
In annual terms, the indicator decreases by 4.8%.
This factor can hamper the economic recovery, as household spending contributes a considerable contribution to GDP.
As a rule, in the structure of the economy, their share exceeds 50%.
In addition to low consumer activity, the Bank of Russia's strict policy can also be called as risk factors for economic growth.
The regulator holds the rate at 10.5%, which does not have the best effect on the real sector.
The negative factor is the insufficient level of investment, which hinders the development of industrial potential.
But in general, it can be assumed that by the end of the year the pace of the decline of the Russian economy will slow to -0.5% against -3.7% in 2015," says Irina Rogova, analyst at Forex Club.
The process of naturalization of athletes, recently launched in Russian football and well entrenched in winter sports at the Olympics in Sochi, is not yet so actively developed in summer sports.
If in the Olympic Games in Rio for Russia and are former foreigners, in most cases we are talking about native countries - the former republics of the Soviet Union.
But in Rio de Janeiro, we can observe the reverse process - quite a large number of Russians are flying the flags of other countries.
In each case, the history of citizenship change is different.
Some parents took to another country as a child, leaving no choice.
Someone could not stand the competition for a place in the Russian team.
And someone believed that the best conditions for development in sports will be created abroad.
"AIF.ru" found at least 16 athletes who decided to change their Russian citizenship.
In the German passport of the 27-year-old girl it is written that her name is Lisa Ryzhikh.
But she had previously been Elizabeth.
She was born in 1988 in Omsk.
Just four years later, as soon as the Soviet Union collapsed, Lisa's parents decided to emigrate to Germany.
The girl had no choice.
There she decided to follow in the footsteps of her older sister - to do athletics.
Like the sister, Lisa picked pole jumps.
Stay in Russia, it is unlikely to be able to "move from the throne" Elena Isinbaeva.
Unfortunately, at the Olympics in Rio Lisa will be our only compatriot, albeit former, in the sector for pole jumps.
Her best achievements in this sport are the bronze of the European Championship 2010 and the silver of the continental championship in 2016, which she won again in the absence of Elena Isinbayeva.
29-year-old Elena Pirozhkova was born in Novokuznetsk in 1986.
Her parents are religious propagandists of the evangelical direction.
Many because of their faith, they left for the United States when the girl was only three years old.
In addition to Elena, eight more children grew up in the family.
They all lived in the small town of Greenfield in Massachusetts.
Lena began to get carried away by the fight at school.
Showing good results, she moved to the city of Colorado Springs, where at the U.S. Wrestling Training Center continued classes under the leadership of another former Russian Vladislav Izbunikov.
At the 2012 Olympics in London, Elena lost in her first fight.
But at the World Cup in the same year - victory.
Before that, by the way, she managed to win silver at the world championship in 2010.
After that, there was 2013 bronze and the silver of 2014.
26-year-old Maria was born in the city of Yaroslavl, where she first met synchronized swimming.
But to say that she was raised by our coaches in Russia, it would be wrong.
Soon, the girl's family decided to emigrate to the United States and settle in the city of Colorado.
Mary continued her classes.
She was soon a member of the U.S. national team and showed great results at the Pan American Games.
It is clear that at a serious international level, Russian synchronists can not compete, but for America its indicators - the ceiling.
The new name, which in Russian sounds strange, Christina Shaldybina received at the age of 11, when her parents decided to continue the girl's rhythmic gymnastics overseas.
Until this point, the girl was engaged in her favorite sport in Yaroslavl.
Having emigrated to the United States, she quickly entered the youth team of this country, and later broke into the main national team.
At the Pan American Games, 19-year-old Kristen won gold and silver.
For the first positions on the world stage, of course, she did not have to fight, but for the United States, she organized a real breakthrough - led the star-striped team for the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Another of our former "artist" is Jan Berezko-Marggrander, who plays for the German national team.
Jana was born in Togliatti.
In 2008, when the girl was 13 years old, the family decided to move to Germany - there the girl had more prospects to get into the national team.
She soon represented her country at the 2012 Olympics in London.
There, however, Jana was able to take only 17th place, not enough to get into the final competitions in the personal championship.
But two years before that, she managed to win the bronze medal of the Olympic Games - youth.
Another gymnast, only this time sports - Irina Sazonova.
If the ways of emigrating the previously mentioned athletes can be called standard, then the choice of the family of Irina is very unusual - Iceland.
Ira is a pupil of the Volgograd Sports School.
Naturally, in Iceland, she immediately became the champion of the country.
However, Ira is training in Russia - specially comes to his homeland, so as not to lose skills.
In Rio, she did not perform as well as she would like.
The best place is 40 in the all-around.
There are very little information about the swimmer Maria Ugolkova in the Russian information space.
For a very long time, Maria lives and trains in Switzerland.
However, for a long time, she performed under the Russian flag, showing good results - there was even a record of the country at a distance of 200 meters butterfly.
In 2015, she received Swiss citizenship and began to perform under the red and white flag.
In Rio, her best performance is the 14th place in the complex relay 4-100.
To get to the games, the girl launched a crowdfunding project, thanks to which she was able to collect about 6 thousand francs, which allowed her to pay for the preparations for the Olympics.
31-year-old freestyle wrestler Adam Batirov spent almost his entire career under the Russian flag.
During this time, the native of Khasavyurt managed to become a three-time winner of European championships, champion of Russia, master of sports of Russia of international class.
When he stopped getting into our national team, it's time to think about changing citizenship.
For several years, a talented wrestler disappeared from sports bridges.
The triumphal return took place at the 2016 Asian Championships - Batirov has already represented Bahrain, for which he won a gold medal and received a ticket to the Olympics in Rio.
About another ex-Russian, Mikhail Kudinov, in his homeland is known even less than even about the Swiss swimmer Maria Ugolkov.
The fact is that his parents emigrated from Vladivostok to New Zealand, when the boy was very young.
It was there that Michael began to engage in gymnastics.
He has not achieved much international success.
In Rio, his best result was 40th place in the qualification on parallel bars.
But for New Zealand, even getting to the Olympic Games in gymnastics is already a breakthrough.
When Nastya, born in Moscow in 1985, was only 9 years old, her family emigrated to Israel.
There, the girl continued her classes in synchronized swimming, showing high results at the national level.
In 2014, at the European Championships in Berlin, the girl took 6th place in synchronized swimming.
In the duet with Eugenia Tetelbaum Anastasia took the eighth place.
In the solo program, she was fifth.
Like Anastasia, 23-year-old Dmitry Croiter plays for the national team of Israel.
When the boy was only 6 years old, his mother decided to repatriate to Israel.
In 2009, at the age of 17, Dmitry became the champion of the country.
In the same year he won the World Youth Championship.
A year later, Croiter also wins the gold of the Youth Olympic Games in Singapore.
In addition to high jumps, Dmitry is engaged in long jumps and triple jumps.
31-year-old Albert is another native of Hasavyurt, who after long performances for Russia decided to change his sports citizenship.
However, unlike Battirov, Albert chose Romania, which he would represent in Rio.
In Russia, he played for the School of Higher Sports Excellence in Krasnoyarsk, in 2011 even becoming the champion of the country.
28-year-old Oleg Antonov was born in Moscow in the family of the player of the USSR national volleyball team Yaroslav Antonov.
Just a year before the birth of his son, Yaroslav was recognized as the best volleyball player on the planet.
He decided to pursue his career in Italy.
The family remained on permanent residence.
In 2015, as part of the national team, he became a bronze medalist of the European Championship, held on the territory of his new homeland.
Khadzhiev was born in Chechnya in 1994 and came with his family in the midst of the war.
Ten years later, the parents decided to emigrate.
The original goal was Norway, but it was not possible to get to this northern country - I had to go to France, to Nice.
There Zelimkhan continued to learn freestyle wrestling.
Soon he won the world championship among juniors, and later qualified for participation in the Olympic Games.
In Rio, he will be the only representative of France in the wrestling tournament.
And again freestyle, and again the former Russian.
This time we will talk about a native of North Ossetia, who emigrated to Spain - about Taimuraz Frieva.
At the end of December 2012, he was granted Spanish citizenship, and he is currently playing for the national team of this country.
Before that, however, the 30-year-old athlete managed to celebrate the high results in Russia.
He became the bronze medalist of the championships of the country in 2007 and 2008.
Tired of bad luck in the national team, Taimuraz decided to change sports citizenship.
The last in our list is the Chechen boxer, born in 1995 in the capital of Dagestan Makhachkala - Arthur Biyarslanov.
When the boy was ten years old, his parents took their family through Azerbaijan to Canada.
There, Arthur, on the advice of his older brother, began boxing.
Since then, Arthur has become the champion of Canada three times, and in 2012 he became the world champion among young people.
In 2015, Biyarslanov won the gold of the Pan-American Games, the first for his new homeland since 1975.

Married, has a son.
Why do children need Cossack classes in schools?
According to Governor B. Kondratyev, "they should be educated not by shares and parades, but systematically."
They should grow and at least from the age of 7 understand that they are Cossacks and education should be Cossacks.
But so far, this work, I think, is being carried out formally and, I suspect, more on paper.
If the Cossack classes absorb all the positive, which has been accumulated earlier, on a qualitatively new level, I will be glad.
If everyone is in a hurry and ignorant as it is, the new idea will turn into cheap populism.
Utilities continue to be one of the most criminal sectors of the country's economy.
There are encroachments on funds allocated for the needs of the communal sphere from budgets of different levels.
According to the Prosecutor General's Office, overestimated tariffs are one of the most common crimes in the housing and communal services sector.
As a result, consumers of the region overpaid the power engineers more than 170 million rubles.
Recently, the prosecutor's office of the Krasnodar Territory revealed the facts of inclusion in the tariffs of unreasonable costs.
And in the expenses of LLC "IV-consulting" (providing cold water) were pledged 4 million rubles. for car rentals at a price above the market.
And such examples in the country are the masses.
The people give the last money for the "communal," and pays properly - according to the Ministry of Construction of the Russian Federation, the average collection of payments from the population is 94%.
He is accused of several articles of the Criminal Code: embezzlement, legalization of proceeds from crime, abuse of power, etc. The d.
According to the investigation, as the head of the fund, which was engaged in the repair of urban facilities, Makarov concluded contracts with entrepreneurs, work on them was actually not carried out, but paid.
The businessmen just gave him back most of the money.
And as the owner of the Criminal Code, Makarov collected money from the population, but he did not pay service providers and spent them on their needs.
As a result, the damage to the budget and residents - millions of rubles.
The scheme of Makarov's machinations, alas, is typical for Russia.
A whole wave of arrests and detentions of the leaders of the Criminal Code, which appropriated the money of citizens, swept through the country.
In Kamchatka, the trial of A. Kohan, by the way, is also a former deputy of the city council, who is accused of machinations for 91.7 million rubles.
According to the investigation, in 2012-2013. In Elizovo, Kamchatsky Krai, he established 6 management companies and created 3 limited liability companies.
One of them performed contract work for the Criminal Code, two others played the role of cash and settlement centers, that is, they took money from the population.
However, the power engineers A. Kohan did not transfer the funds, but spent on himself, beloved.
Judging in the field of housing is quite difficult.
Things are not aroused, delayed.
And "helps" in this extremely confused housing legislation, - believes Svetlana Turnover, Executive Director of the NP "ZhKH Control."
We do not have time to earn one law, as we invent a new one that should make the previous one work.
There are also few specialists, including among judges, on housing and communal services.
Lawyers themselves admit that housing law in universities receives very little attention.
The refusals to initiate criminal cases, the revolt during the investigations are also said in the Prosecutor General's Office.
From in production in 2015. 3,500 Crimes have been sent to court by less than half.
The rest of the investigation was protracted, and one in five was suspended due to the failure to identify the accused.
Often, deficiencies in the activities of law enforcement agencies are written off by them to gaps in the current legislation.
There is a law, but the bodies of inquiry are in no hurry to initiate and investigate such cases.
In the second half of 2015. There were about 230 reports of forgery - only 60 criminal cases were initiated.
For 5 months of this year, their number has increased only slightly - 99.
And what is the falsification of the minutes of the meeting of residents?
This means: the change of management of the house, financial and other issues go bypassing the opinions of the owners.
And this also means that the market of housing and communal services can not break through normal companies that want to work honestly, and not "submit" the population.
It turns out that the tenants are in the red, small and medium-sized businesses too.
First of all, due to the eradication of corruption as such in the whole state, Anton Zharkov, a member of the State Duma Committee on Property Issues, is sure.
This work is underway now.
These are not just isolated actions - this is a focused course to fight corruption.
Of course, not in all regions is such a sad situation.
In particular, scandals in the capital does not smell.
Why are there no such scandals in Moscow in the housing sector, as in many other regions?
Because the capital's government showed the iron will and brought order, - said "AiF" Anatoly Electorny, member of the State Duma Committee on security and anti-corruption.
I am referring to the personnel issue, and legislative amendments, and legal education.
The management companies were closely monitored, and all of them went through licensing.
Complaints of citizens are promptly resolved in the public space (and the appeals of residents, and response measures are placed on the portal of the Moscow government).
Many not only pay monthly receipts, but closely monitor what is written there, how the house is contained.
Awareness among the population about the rights of owners and obligations of resource-supplying and managing organizations is very high.
Plus, Moscow checks the validity of tariffs for housing and communal services - because a considerable part of the budget goes to subsidies and benefits for numerous categories of the population.
Probably, all this together explains the calm situation in Moscow.
Is it that everything is in the will of the regional authorities?
Maybe the unwilling place to change jobs?
The Turkish gambit.
Can Erdogan give up friendship with the EU and the US?
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan put forward an ultimatum to the United States, proposing a choice between Turkey and Fethullah Gulen, an Islamic preacher accused of organizing a coup.
He said this, speaking to his supporters in Ankara.
Erdogan urged the Americans to abandon the support of the "terrorist organization of the hephthullahists."
This is not the first Turkish statement in which the United States is calling for a change of position.
Experts believe that the split in Turkey's relations with the West is growing and may lead to a new attempt to change power in the country.
"Sooner or later, America will make a choice between Turkey and FETO ("Terrorist Organization of the Fethullahists").
Either the FETO-organizing coups, or the democratic Turkey.
It should make this choice," Erdogan's appeal was quoted as saying by the Anatolian Agency on Wednesday evening in Ankara.
The President of Turkey once again, but has demanded tougher from the United States to fulfill his demand, which he made for the first time immediately after the suppression of the insurgency.
Recall that on the night of July 16, high-ranking representatives of the Turkish army in Turkey, a high-ranking representatives of the Turkish army were made an attempt to overthrow the legitimate authorities in the country, as well as an attempt on the life of the head of state.
However, after Recep Tayyip Erdogan made an appeal to the population, the mutiny was suppressed, and its organizers and participants were arrested.
In total, about 8 thousand people were suspected, in the ranks of which, in addition to the military, were teachers and scientists.
According to Recep Erdogan, their mentor was Fethullah Gulen, who lives in the state of Pennsylvania in the United States.
Erdogan's supporters also admitted that the coup could be implicated directly by the Americans.
The United States denied all claims, refusing to extradite Gulen and advising to change the tone.
The last statement of the representatives of the State Department in this regard was made at the time of Erdogan's visit to St. Petersburg on Tuesday.
However, this does not stop the President of Turkey - he insists on his insistence and also puts demands on his other Western partners.
"Ankara will cease to fulfill its obligations under the migration agreement with the European Union, if Brussels does not name the date of the lifting of visa restrictions for Turkish citizens," Turkish Minister for EU Affairs Omerce said.
According to him, the introduction of amendments to the anti-terrorist law, as required by the EU, will jeopardize Europe's own security.
German Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel demanded that Turkey stop EU blackmail with promises to open borders for migrants to achieve a visa regime with the EU.
His words were a response to the relevant statement of Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu.
Cavusoglu made another provocative statement on Wednesday, assuming that Turkey could withdraw from NATO.
The Turkish foreign Minister did not rule out that the country will consider the possibility of leaving the alliance, if they do not meet the expected support from him.
The decision to increase cooperation with Russia in the defense sphere is not a step against NATO.
There are NATO countries cooperating with foreign countries in the defense sector - they are importing missiles," Cavusoglu said in an interview with Anadolu.
According to him, Turkey now needs to create its own defense system based on its technologies, as well as cooperate with other countries.
"Until now, Turkey has tried to cooperate with NATO member countries, but the results have not satisfied us, and we began to look for others," he said.
Experts believe that all this indicates serious disagreements between Turkey and the West and the country's reorientation to the East.
The head of the International Institute of Political Expertise Yevgeny Minchenko believes that Recep Erdogan is now playing his game and can not go to a tough confrontation with the West.
It has a lot of business and from the point of view of the military (Turkey is a member of NATO), so I think that Erdogan will try to balance the framework with the West.
Although, of course, it would be more convenient for the Americans to see a fully obedient person in this post," the expert explained.
According to him, it is possible that after the statements of the Turkish leader (the non-payment of compensations of the EU, about the requirement of a visa-free space with Europe and the extradition of Gulen from the United States) will be pressured.
"Reger Erdogan will face the deterioration of relations with both America and the European Union, and they will pressure him on humanitarian issues, for dictatorial methods of governance of the country, and so on," Minchenko said.
The head of the Center for Political Information Alexei Mukhin admits that the Turkish president will change his point of view in relations with Russia as soon as it becomes beneficial to him.
Eight months ago, Erdogan took an extremely tough stance against Russia and sought favor in the West by all means.
For a very short time, the situation has changed to the opposite.
There are no guarantees that after some time the Turkish president will not change his priorities again.
I think that Erdogan entered the period of shuttle diplomacy.
Having found himself between the two poles - the West and Russia, he will try to get the maximum benefit for himself," - said Mukhin.
In his opinion, the main task for the Turkish president today is to retain political power in the country, and for this he needs Russia and partnership with Vladimir Putin, so that the United States stops supporting Gulen.
Turkey needs both the EU and the US, which control the situation in Syria and the Middle East with its help.
Therefore, a consensus with Turkey will be reached," the expert said.
A different point of view is held by the head of the Center for Asia and the Middle East Anna Glazova.
Now Turkey's relations with both the EU and the US are quite tense, and this is primarily due to domestic policy, which is carried out by Erdogan personally.
I think that this crisis in relations will worsen, and against the background of this crisis, the Turkish leadership will try to reset the policy in the Middle East and relations with Russia.
It is no coincidence that the President of Turkey, as well as a number of Turkish politicians, declare that they are ready to change their position on a number of issues on Syria, relations with Israel have been resolved, there is an active political interaction with Iran," Glagliova said, admitting that Erdogan's next step will normalize relations with Egypt.
According to her, the policy that Erdogan is now pursuing is a return to the course of the foreign policy concept, which was followed by Turkey before the beginning of the Arab revolutions.
"It was then that in the positions of "zero problems with its neighbors," Turkey began to very actively develop its relations with the Middle East and the Asian region.
Now there have been very successful visits of the President of Turkey to Russia and the countries of Africa.
Therefore, this vector of foreign policy will develop and contribute to strengthening the position of Turkey both in the regional and international arena," - said the expert.
Glazova believes that it will be incredibly difficult for Turkey to return to its previous relations with the EU, now the question is rather whether the EU will begin to respond harshly to Turkey, which can go to open borders for migrants and thereby create serious problems for Europe.
Strike of Junior Doctors: Calls for New Collective Protests
Representatives of junior doctors appealed to the trade union with a request to authorize new collective protests in their dispute over a new employment contract.
The Committee of Junior Physicians (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) is going to ask its full advice to support more collective protests since early September.
JDC says the ministers were unable to answer questions about the employment contract.
Junior doctors and medical students in July voted to cancel the deal under an employment contract agreed with BMA.
It was rejected by 58 per cent of its members who participated in the secret ballot.
In a letter to members posted on Twitter on Thursday night, JDC Chairman Helen McCort said the government continued to "damaged silence" about the problems she said had led to the rejection of the employment contract.
She said: "Given the current situation, the head of JDC voted to reject the proposed new employment contract in full and called for official renegotiations on all your issues."
In response to the government's silence, the head of JDC today made an official request for an extraordinary meeting of the BMA Council to endorse a continuous program to expand the collective protests, starting in early September.
The dispute led young doctors to take part in six strikes this year, including the first general strikes in the history of the State Health Service.
The leader of BMA's junior doctors, Dr. Joan Malawana, resigned after a vote to cancel the agreed terms of the employment contract that BMA recommended.
He told BMA members that the deal was good to be made during the meetings ahead of the vote of 54,000 junior doctors and medical students.
After the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the employment contract would be used for health workers in England.
Russia and Turkey: "Alliance of the bad"?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and announce the official end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of the palace in St. Petersburg, I had a steady impression that Ankara wanted more reconciliation.
It was a handshake, yes.
But Mr. Putin's smile looked strained, and he hardly radiated heat even by his own restrained standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, as opposed to this, has repeatedly said about his "dear friend" Mr. Putin - five times, according to one report.
I lost count.
He also promised that relations with Russia will return not only to their pre-crisis level, but even higher.
The next day, one newspaper described Mr Erdogan's actions as if nothing wrong had ever happened.
I think his enthusiasm was to the opposite.
But the tight-pairing coolness emanating from Mr. Putin showed that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in the introductory comments: Turkey shot down a Russian fighter jet on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at this point was frantic.
Mr. Putin broke out with an angry tyrande, accusing Ankara of hitting Moscow in the back.
The insult was even stronger, on the basis of an alleged friend.
Restoring real trust will be difficult, probably impossible.
Russian public opinion has also changed since November.
For months, state-controlled media carried out a staggering, total offensive against Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed that the Turks should be held guilty of everything.
The most serious accusations were from senior officials that Mr Erdogan's own family had earned money on the illegal oil trade from the Syrian zones controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He denied it decisively.
But in St. Petersburg, there was an official signal that it was time to move on.
In the end, this meeting took place only because Mr. Putin received an apology, which he demanded from President Erdogan.
Russia could claim a kind of victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of the armistice declaration are clear.
First of all, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was almost deposed last month in a coup attempt.
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have clearly shocked him too.
There is also an economic reason.
Russian sanctions have hit hard - especially the ban on charter flights, which are usually brought by several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
The number fell by almost 90 percent.
As for Russia, tour operators and charter companies here, of course, will feel relieved when the flights will finally resume.
They put on the peak of the end of the season on the Mediterranean Sea.
And even this week, state television predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as Turkish imports of agricultural products were allowed again.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here," as stated in the report in the newspaper Vedomosti.
But the visit also had additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is evil on the West for what it considers a weak response to the coup attempt.
Add to this her prolonged dissatisfaction with the turtle's pace of talk about joining the EU and Mr. Putin's move - which seeks to take advantage of the coolness and gradually destroys Turkish ties with the West.
The Russian leader, of course, won bonus points with Ankara for calling for the support of the elected authorities after the coup attempt.
Keep in mind, this is a given for Moscow, which has its own deeply entrenched fear of regime change.
So the summit in this brilliant palace on the sea coast allowed Russia and Turkey to imagine what one analyst described to me as a "alliance of the bad": two countries that feel rejected and humiliated by the West are joining forces.
Yet, despite the public display of reconciliation, the two still have significant differences.
The key is Syria, where Moscow has recently positioned itself as a peacekeeper, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposite sides.
Perhaps it is said for itself that after almost three hours of initial negotiations, while the two presidents were giving a press conference, they did not even touch on this topic.
The Turkish president deliberately avoided answering the question of their differences, while Mr. Putin chose to focus on them.
There is no clear agreement on how they can find a common language on Syria.
But after months of open hostility - and given the possibility of a total disaster, when a NATO member Turkey shot down a Russian jet fighter is better that the two leaders are at least talking again.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside Scotland
The RBS brand should be reduced to the role of the back office, according to the bank's executive director.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEvan told the BBC of Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's global ambitions.
The bank has retreated from them since it almost collapsed eight years ago and it had to be saved.
During this period, the brand's strategists used RBS to protect other brands of consumer lending.
It was supported by millions of pounds of sponsorship in international sports, from the Six Nations Rugby Cup to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now it has been decided that it is right to allow more national brands to come to the fore.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scottish customers, but will not be launched.
In England and Wales, all references to RBS, including the external head office and the stock exchange, will be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for private individuals banking services that will get more influence from Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr. McEvan gave an interview during a tour of customers and employees in Invernessshire.
He told the BBC, "The RBS brand will eventually become our investment brand and the one that our staff will be employed because we are now becoming a brand bank."
Since the bank itself became a global brand, RBS has become a global brand.
I am saying that we no longer have global aspirations, we have local aspirations.
Each of these brands will represent something completely different in their population groups, and our staff will work with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue its sponsorship of the Six Nations Cup, and it is increasing the profile of various brands in sponsorship.
"It's a good time for us to move the bank of brands, as the basis (we asked ourselves) how do we focus on improving the bank for customers?" The chief executive said.
It would be very cynical three years ago if we said we were going to be a great bank for customers and shut down all these brands.
But with the work we've done, focusing on the needs of our customers, not on our own, I think you can see a lot of changes.
We can get these brands back, so I think the time is right.
Frankie Dettors reaches 3,000 winners with victory in Newmarket on Disaddiction
The children sprinkle the champagne after the take in Newmarket leads him to 3,000 wins
Jockey Frankie Dettori achieved his 3,000th British victory in Newmarket on Friday.
He came to this outstanding mark with the help of his second night winner on his home track - on the Predation, trained by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old is the sixth jockey to reach this outstanding mark in smooth races.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lestor Piggott, Pat Idder and Willie Carson.
Three-time champion jockey Dettori, who previously won at Ghayyar, said: "This is something special."
I'm very excited because my family is here too.
I'm very glad it happened in Newmarket because that's where I settled 30 years ago.
It's not a big secular event, it's not a Royal Ascot - it's a regular Friday night with 20,000 people.
I'm free to do and I'm very unassuming.
The children take applause when it leads to a Predisposition after the victory
Two jockeys reached this mark in the hurdles: the champion of the jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had more than 4,300 victories in a record career.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4493 career wins
The Franks are one of the best jockeys of the modern era and it is not surprising that he has reached this mark, which so few have reached before him.
He is stylish and strong, but it is his tactical ingenuity that distinguishes him from others in the weight room.
He is a great representative for horse racing, his enthusiasm and charisma attracted fans to this sport for years.
I said Franki a few weeks ago to Epsom, he'd have brought 6,000 winners if he hadn't been just a jockey for the weekend and big horse racing!
And seriously, Franki led the winners in the UK for most of the 30 years, which is great to see.
He is an energetic character, which is good for British horse racing, but moreover, he is an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated this outstanding mark with a branded rapid jump from a horse
From the rapid finishes to the fast jumps, Franki Dettori has been a symbol of British smooth horse racing for two decades.
These were ups and downs.
Many of the winners of the big horse races, including his famous "Great Seven" in Ascot in 1996, but he also survived the plane crash and remained disqualified due to doping.
Three years ago, he first encountered difficulties when he returned after a six-month disqualification, but he showed tremendous willpower to challenge the skeptics and get back in shape.
And he may not have finished for a while - Dettori previously said that he would like to continue to participate in the competition, at least until the age of 50.
Putin dismisses the head of the administration Sergey Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly fired his head of the administration, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin's trusted circle for many years.
The 63-year-old has now been appointed as a representative on the environment and transport.
The statement from the Kremlin says that Putin "decided to release Ivanov from his duties as head of the Russian administration of the President," but did not name the reason.
Mr. Ivanov's deputy since 2012, Anton Vaino, was appointed his successor.
Mr. Vaino, 44, former diplomat.
Born in Tallinn, Estonia's capital in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State University of International Relations (MGIMO) and served in the Embassy of Tokyo.
Later, he was the head of the office of the protocol of the president and the government apparatus, reports the website of the Kremlin (in Russian).
During his appointment, he told Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
I think the most important task of the administration is to support your activities as head of state in terms of drafting laws and controlling how your instructions are being implemented.
Putin told a Russian TV channel on Friday that Ivanov had asked him to be relieved of his post and recommended that Vaino replace him.
Are the smiles convinced?
This is a move that puzzled Moscow.
For a long time, Ivanov was one of the closest supporters of Vladimir Putin and, like him, served in the Soviet security service, the KGB.
As head of administration, he was one of the most powerful people in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, who was shown on state television, both men said that the head of the administration resigned at his own will.
But despite the smiles on the camera, it's not enough here convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So, these are the unforeseen consequences of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows yet.
But the official statement - that the person who was once agitated as a potential president, suddenly wanted to manage Russian environmental policy - was met with tremendous skepticism.
In his remarks to Putin, quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said: "It's true that in early 2012 I asked you to entrust me with this very difficult position, even a troubled position for four years.
Well, it turns out I've been the head of the presidential administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
He previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the state security service of the KGB, as is Mr. Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was the head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov among the five people he trusted most.
It was once believed that Ivanov could become president of Russia after Putin's second term, as Putin's third term would be contrary to the constitution.
However, this post was taken by another close supporter of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister until he returned to the presidency after only three and a half years.
The star of the series "Think Like a Criminal" Thomas Gibson fired after a fight with the producer
Gibson was a member of the brawl on the show in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced his dismissal in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized on Thursday before he was announced.
There were creative differences on the set and the divergence of opinions.
I'm sorry that this happened," he said in a statement.
Detailed information on how Gibson's character will be erased from the show that is being watched by the FBI's team of agents is expected to arrive later, according to ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old actor, who previously starred in the sitcom Darm and Greg, was on the show from the first season in 2005.
"I love to "Think Like a Criminal" and have put my heart and soul into it for the past twelve years," Gibson said in a statement released on Friday.
I was hoping to be present in it to the end, but now it will be impossible.
I just want to thank the writers, producers, actors, our wonderful team, and most importantly, the best fans that the show could only dream of.
It is scheduled that the show will return with its twelfth season on September 28.
Mystery: fish landed in Banff's garden
The man from Banth sought help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Baine believes that 75 fish could have been geron left behind by a water tornado.
Baine, who lives 500 meters from the sea, posted the shooting of this spectacle in Periscope in the hope that someone could shed light on the appearance of two-inch fish.
Queensferry Crossing: The bridge is now connected to Fife
Project of 1.35 billion pounds to be completed by May 2017
The engineers connected the northern span and the Quincefrii Crossing viaduct - which means the bridge is now connected to Fife.
This is the first of the four clutches between the "weeds of the canvas," which are now coming to an end near all three pylons of the bridge.
The section of the bridge from Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 watts of the bridge.
The 1.35 billion-kilogram project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
Economy Minister Keith Brown visited the site today and was among the first to walk from the ground to the bridge.
He said: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of Queensferri Crossing.
We are all witnesses of engineering art of a really epic scale in this project, where more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel are used only for the construction of this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the clamping between the viaduct and the bridge is a virtuoso operation using extremely accurate assembly tolerances.
In total, about 79 percent of the entire pavement canvas is now on site, for the last section of the canvas, the concrete coating is cast in Rosatet today, which means that the entire canvas is ready to climb on the place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, director of the Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors project, said: "The first clutch on every bridge project is always a significant milestone.
In this amazing project, this clutter represents the most modern construction art.
After the installation of the last section of the roadway and its connection with the expanding roadway of the Northern Pylon, we then had to close the remaining gap on the northern side or facing the shore.
This was done by pulling the viaduct of the northern approach by 700 millimeters south.
It was a large-scale and at the same time very elegant operation.
Scale, because the viaduct with a length of 222 meters, weighs about 6000 tons and should have been raised to the angle of about 3 percent.
Elegant because the tolerances the team worked on were tiny - just a few millimeters in each direction.
Luckily, it all went very well.
Salvation in the Bay of Moelfr: Three men 'lucky to stay alive
Three men "luck to stay alive" after they were thrown out of a fishing vessel in Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station raised the alarm at 13:20 British summer time on Friday, after the team saw an incident unfolding in the Bay of Moelfr.
Three men tried their best to swim to a safe place, while their ship continued to go its course.
"We saw their ship circling next to them and implied the worst," said Vince Jones, a steering lifeboat Moelfre.
"Fortunately, by the time we went down to the water, a strong wind took him away from them," he added.
Two men were rescued with a local fishing vessel, and a 60-year-old man was found unimportant and locked in a buoy without a life jacket.
All of them were taken on board a coastal lifeboat and delivered to the rescue station.
Jones said: "Tirothy men thrown into the water are lucky that they are alive and completely unharmed.
The engine of the boat had an emergency opener, but he somehow detached himself from the man driving the boat when it overturned.
Someone's been guarding those guys today.
Pokemon Go, a decent hunt for health and happiness
It's fascinating to see the world change.
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go out to play, preferring to spend their free time looking at the screens, has been a complaint of many over the past decade.
Pokemon Go breaks people off the couch and engages in some physical activity.
The time in the screen was initially limited to the TV, then video games and recently smartphones.
It's so great to see that technology and activity on the street are not mutually exclusive.
I'm certainly referring to the craze that is Pokemon Go, an app based on characters originally created for video games in the 1990s (which has produced a series of cartoons, play cards and other offshoots).
Like many other pop-cultural phenomena, all this has lost its former relevance a little earlier than this new game became available in the United States, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
The launch in other countries at the time was delayed due to a massive response that overloaded the servers.
In a matter of days, Pok-mon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as much as Twitter.
So how does it work?
In a nutshell, smartphone players go looking for Pokemon, which are tracked by GPS and, when discovered, can be 'photo taken' (through a screenshot on your phone) or 'caught'.
The generation that played the game, being younger, joined the craze, breaking away from the sofas for search.
In the US, the game has led to a significant increase in the number of steps passed by the "ordinary" person on a daily basis.
Cardiogram, an app for the Apple Watch that tracks 35,000 users, recently told the Washington Post that within two days of launching the game, the number of people they tracked who performed 30-minute exercises jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company does not know who is playing in Pokemon Go, it just sees the primary data on the passage of levels.
Many health campaigns that convince people to "find 30 minutes," "get up from the couch" and "be active every day" did not find a response because most health messages are boring and are expressed by people who look miserable.
However, the importance of exercise should not be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce the chances of developing cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps in weight correction, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits, too long to bring here.
But the beauty of Pok-mon Go is that it pulls people out to do what they love.
Thus, three basics of health are covered: movement, fresh air and sunlight and joy.
Some people even make new friends on the hunt.
As usual, there are boring boobs who are looking for what to complain about.
And yes, someone can stumble upon the door.
What are you doing?
The breakthrough has happened.
After all, despite the fact that smartphone apps like Fitbit could have previously tracked our physical activity, they did not give us a reason to study, as this game gives.
The novelty will come, and the use will weaken over time.
However, due to the success of Pokemon, there will be more games that will combine applications and virtual reality with physical activity in the real world, helping many people on the hunt to be more active, in good shape and healthy.

Simone Bils wins the gold of the absolute championship in women's gymnastics
Forget about the pressure.
Forget about the turmoil.
Simone Blights is invulnerable to all of this.
Dynamic on the support jump.
Enviable on the log.
Stunning on the floor.
It's amazing everywhere.
And now, finally, the Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast rose to the title of champion in absolute championship on Thursday, placing the gap between each other and the rest of the world at a convincing demonstration under the close Olympic attention.
Her overall score of 62.198 was at a sufficient distance from the silver medalist and teammate "Final Five" Elie Reisman and Russian bronze medalist Alia Mustafina.
Bailose from the United States performs on a gymnastic log during the final of the women's individual absolute championship in rhythmic gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Bails became the fourth consecutive American woman to win the title of champion of the absolute championship and the fifth in general, cementing her reputation as the best of its generation and, perhaps, at any time.
She burst into tears when her final overall score was shown and her long journey was over.
This achievement puts her in the same league as exceptionally rare athletes such as Michael Phelps, who have raised their sports to new heights:
Byles has spent the last three years dominating her sport, winning 15 World Cup medals - including 10 gold - with such stunning programs in their mix of hard work and precision that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her "the greatest gymnast I've ever seen."
One last test was waiting in Brazil, the competition is not so much between the Byles and the rest in this area, but between it and the load of inflated expectations.
Anything less than going back to his family's home in Spring, Texas, with a handful of gold medals, would be seen as an undue expectation.

Bails earned the first gold on Tuesday, becoming a beautiful final chord for the farewell party of the retiring coordinator of the national team Martha Karoli.
While the Byles insisted that she never looked into the future during her long journey to the top, that's not entirely true.
Part of her free exercise program - the one that includes her signature passage - is installed on Latin American music that would fit right at home on the street right outside the Rio Olympic Arena.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl, a young child and grandmother, being a child novice and openly by the coach's mother Aimym Burman during a visit to the hall where Burman was a coach, became a force.
She has not lost a single competition in absolute championship since the summer of 2013 - a strip of luck, which should continue as long as Byles will want.
Although Mustafina gained a small advantage with the help of two spins, it was a mirage.
Gymnastic log and free exercise - where Byles defends the title of world champion - is in ambush.
It went forward again with 15,433 on the log and finished with 15,933 on the floor.
Reisman gently hugged her while they were waiting for the final score - pure formality - and tears appeared around the shiny red with white and blue eyeliners in Biles, when the plan she once recorded in the album for clippings came true.
Reisman's performance was a little revenge for what happened four years ago, when she shared third place, but lost the bronze to Mustafina on the tie-break.
This time, the 22-year-old captain of the team, which the Americans call "grandmother" was much ahead.
She sent kisses to the crowd after her free exercise, engulfed in return, which sometimes seemed in question.
As for the Byles, the viral tweet of 19-year-old from the beginning of this week now has a completely new meaning:
Police: 3 victims in the case of a serial killer shot dead while listening to music in a car
Two women and a 12-year-old girl who died in the deadliest attack in the first serial killer of Phoenix in the last decade, sat in the car, talked and listened to music when they were shot, according to police reports published on Thursday.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stephanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter, Malia, were shot on June 12 when their car was parked on the roadway, the authorities said.
The perpetrator fired about eight shots from the pistol, standing on the passenger side of the car, after which he fled on another vehicle, according to the report.
Police say the triple murder appears not to be the result of the robbery, as the attacker did not take the wallets or $2,900 at the disposal of one of the adult victims.
Phoenix police spokesman, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, said the shooting prompted investigators to check if he had been linked to the previous four attacks.
Only seven people were killed and two others injured in nine attacks in two predominantly Latin American areas within four months.
"It's happening in a residential area in front of the house," Howard KPHO told CBS, a CBS branch earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including the brown Nissan late 1990s, the Black BMW late 1990s, and the white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to conclude that the attacks were linked and committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized with injuries and later died.
The ship, 31, and Ellis' daughter, Malia, died on the spot.
The witness told the police that it was not unusual that they were sitting in a parked car listening to music.
Authorities also published a police report on the shelling, the purpose of which was an empty pickup half an hour before the triple murder and believed to have been the hands of a serial killer.
Investigators found the casings and extracted the bullet from the seat and fragments of the bullet from the engine compartment.
The mother of a 6-year-old child with microcephaly: "Becoming better"
Like most six-year-olds, Edmund Pixiusto loves singing, toys, and of course their mother.
But unlike most of her peers, Edmund's microcephaly is the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Pixiwto did not know during pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was - I can't do it.
I can't do that.
I didn't sign up for it.
What, in fact, is not true - of course you sign up for it," she said.
She and her husband were told Vincent that Edmund might never know them and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even offered to put him in a specialized medical institution.
"My first answer was: "I didn't think people are still doing that," Pixivto explained.
Edmund walks with the help of walkers.
Edmund did not sit and did not crawl until he was three, and he still does not speak.
But it is slowly going through some stages.
He walks with outside help and rides a bike.
He also loves to play with his two brothers and singing.
Elizabeth shows a gesture that Edmund came up with for "please sing me."
"We teach him sign language," said Pixievto CBS News.
But not just a normal sign language - she says that Edmund invented its own gestures.
Microcephaly can occur due to a number of different circumstances: genetic, such as Edmund, infections during pregnancy from viruses such as measles and Zika.
Symptoms and prognosis can vary significantly.
It is too early to talk about how this will affect the lives of those infected with the Zika virus.
Pixivto recalls the emotional losses due to an uncertain future.
I've been telling me all the time, what's going to happen?
What's going to happen?
And she still doesn't know.
I haven't actually asked for a prediction for life because I don't expect anyone to really be able to tell me.
But Pixiusvto has an encouraging advice for mothers of children with birth defects due to Zika.
It's getting better.
You know that everything will be better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rain, flooding cause rescue operations in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rain and widespread flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with even more rainfall expected to fall over the state until Saturday.
Numerous rivers in the southeast of Louisiana and southern Mississippi have emerged from the shores and threaten large-scale flooding after extreme rainfall, the National Meteorological Service said.
Louisiana Governor John Bell Edwards said that government officials are in constant contact with local authorities and help has already gone to the affected parishes.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Governor's Office for National Security and Emergency Preparedness, said requests for high water, boats and sandbags were coming.
Steele said that only the arrival of Tanjipahoa requested tens of thousands of bags of sand.
The danger of flooding remains in place until Saturday in most of the south of Louisiana.
The weather service said in a statement that an additional 3x5 inch could flood the area.
In southern Alabama, the duty awaiting flooding lasted until Friday, as rain continued to flow in the area of Mobile.
The Komit River near Baton Rouge and the Amity River near Denem Springs, both in Louisiana were projected to set a record for flooding last weekend.
Forecaster Alec Krautmann said both rivers could flood many houses in suburban areas near Baton Rouge.
He also said that the flooding that goes downstream in the parish of Assenchen is a threat, as these swollen rivers will slowly flow into Lake Morpa.
The Tikfo River, just south of the Mississippi border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level ever recorded at 9 a.m.
Rescuers were still pulling people out of the floods in the Amity and Wilkinson counties in southwest Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among those rescued early Friday near Gloucester.
Hansford, 62, says Beaver Creek's waters, which are usually more than 400 feet away from his home, quickly climbed overnight.
He said that another stepson who lived nearby warned him.
"We woke up and the water continued to advance," Hansford said.
She reached my belt level.
His wife told Hansford that it was the largest tributary she had seen in 48 years that she had lived here.
Hansford said that he and all his family members have a disability, and he is the only one who knows how to swim.
Hansford said rescue workers rescued all three with an army truck and took them to a Gloucester fire station, where they took refuge on Friday.
Krautmann says the flood is "quickly spreading" as the rains continue, noting that officials are considering the evacuation order.
Krautmann says one observer near Livingstone reported a 13.75 inch of rainfall from midnight to Friday morning.
Krautmann said the soil was saturated with rainfall from Wednesday.
Heavy rain and flooding of streets led to the rescue of residents from homes in the arrival of Tangipahoa and the cancellation of classes in five school districts, the authorities say.
WWL, a subsidiary of CBS, reports that Tanjipahoa's adviser told about 200 flooded homes.
The residents were evacuated to two churches, but they are both now flooding.
The parish chairman, Robbie Miller, said the authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets in high water.
The shelters were opened in the city of Amity and Hammond to receive those who were evacuated.
"They will have the opportunity to return home as soon as the water starts retreating," he said.
In Hammond, Tanjipaho's parish, about two dozen streets were closed due to high water levels, and sandbags were available for distribution to residents in the hope that they would keep the water away from homes and businesses.
"The last major flood we had was in March," said Lacy Landrum.
This is on the way to becoming a similar event.
In Mississippi, Harrison County, head of the Emergency Service, Rupert Lacy, said that cover rain continued to rain on the Gulf Coast.
According to him, several houses were registered as flooded on Thursday, but none were registered on Friday.
Kate Towson, head of Shopper Value Foods in Amity, lives in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen it before," Tusson said, "and she's still pouring to the ground."
Mahaj Brown, 6, "thrown out by bullets," remains alive after a shootout in Philadelphia
Police say Philadelphia was shot at a 6-year-old boy, recording a second shooting in a 6-year-old in town this week.
The child's grandmother and grandfather identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
Grandmother and grandfather say Brown suffered numerous gunshot wounds, including his groin, leg, arm and stomach, but was conscious when he was transported to the hospital.
"He got very much, his little body was riddled with bullets," says his grandmother Delores Melendez station.
I just can't believe it.
The boy is listed in the hospital in critical condition and has survived several surgeries.
The family told the station that it was expected to recover.
He was due to go to first grade at a local primary school.
Brown was one of four people who were shot in the Germantown quarter.
Three men were shot, two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-old.
It is reported that one of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition; the other two victims were reported to have been reported in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot in the front seat of the car next to the 29-year-old in critical condition, reports the station.
The other two victims were out of the car, and the police are investigating whether any of the wounded men could have been shot.
Investigators told CBS in Philadelphia that there appeared to be a shootout between several armed men.
The sleeves from semi-automatic weapons, attributed to different specimens of semi-automatic weapons, were tired of the place of action.
It seems to have been a long battle.
There were sleeves on the street, on both sides of the sidewalk.
Therefore, it seems that there were several armed fighters and they were actively involved in the shootout," said the station, Philipper's captain Anthony Ginaldi.
Many homes and cars in this area were also hit.
No arrests were made, and the police were reportedly viewing CCTV cameras.
Another 6-year-old child, a girl, was struck in a stray bullet Tuesday while playing in front of her home in the West Oak Lane area.
She's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why We Need Simon, Gabby and Lori
This is what I call this year's women's Olympic gymnastics team and for several reasons.
First, I've been to every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the U.S. has never been that dominant.
And the second: in this team, three gymnasts play a key role: Simone Byles, Gabbie Douglas and Lauren "Lory" Hernandez, who have already inspired so many non-white girls.
The composition of this team, supplemented by Eli Reisman, which is a Jewish, and Madison Koshan, who is a Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team finally looks like America.
It also strengthened the black and Latin American women's presence at the top of this sport.
For the past four years, the female gymnast has been an African-American.
Last year Simone and Gabby were number one and number two.
It's powerful.
At the last Olympics, Gabbie Douglas was an unexpected Olympic champion, and America welcomed it.
Now the world could have witnessed the incredible performances of three-time World Champion Simone Byles, Douglas and Lori Hernandez, performing unexpected, but nevertheless virtuoso gymnastic exercises.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American in a row to win gold in the women's individual absolute championship.
And the teammate Eli Reisman earned silver.
We are witnessing the peak of this sport, but it doesn't look like this in gymnastics sections across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all chose the same path as Eli and Madison to form an Olympic team.
They are the "final five" because the next Olympic gymnastics team will have only four gymnasts in the team, and this is the last year of coaching Marta Caroli.
But in reality, gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnasts first train in private gymnastics clubs, supported with the help of parents who pay for the cost of training, equipment, travel, fees, fees for participation in competitions, payment for hotel services (for coaches and their gymnasts and families), and the list continues.
Most of these gymnastics clubs are located in rich suburban areas that can support this business.
These clubs are where gymnasts get everything from their training, and it is an expensive and long-term duty for gymnasts.
Ami Burman, coach of Simone Byles, and Maggie Hani, coach Laurie Hernandez, both of them have coached their athletes since they embarked on gymnastics.
We need to create a more affordable and affordable gymnastics training for communities of an innumerable number of young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I founded my gymnast 20 years ago.
In my organizations, we have already provided free and inexpensive gymnastics classes located in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban young children (mainly black and Hispanics) and raised national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high-quality gymnastics for young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body, as well as resistance to debilitating work, discipline and perseverance for the mind.
This combination has a positive impact throughout life on good health, success in school and work.
It is the inspiration of this team that will send thousands of girls to do gymnastics, and that's great.
Doing sports is so important, especially for girls.
This is such a wonderful time.
Thank you, Simone, Eli, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this serious demonstration of the "Women's Force" winning the Olympic gold team and for motivating so many girls of different backgrounds to be healthy, strong and successful young women.
Junior doctors took up the announcement of further strikes after the rejection of Jeremy Hunt's proposal
The ministers hoped to conclude the dispute over the changes by agreeing on a modified treaty with the leaders of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 young doctors who took part in the vote rejected it.
In July, Hunt unveiled plans to introduce the treaty, saying that the NHS was on "no land" and any subsequent delay would damage staff and patients.
The first junior doctors have been transferred to a new contract, which includes changes in work at night and weekends to improve service during extracurricular hours.
Dr. Helen McCut, chairman of the BMA Committee of Young Physicians, said in a statement last night: "The younger doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will fuel the existing labor crisis and that it cannot be applied to all doctors fairly."
There are only eight weeks left before the first group of doctors is transferred to a new contract, progress is needed, and time is at the end.
The WMA's attempt to resolve the dispute by negotiations was met with a reluctance to take action and sometimes the total silence on the part of the government.
And that's despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that his door is always open.
"Jeremi Hant needs to act now, inspire the introduction and respond to the fears of junior doctors.
If he doesn't, then the younger doctors are unequivocally that they are ready to organize subsequent strikes.
The last strike at the end of April brought a delay of about 13,000 planned operations and 100,000 nursing appointments, while nurses and consultants were involved to replace doctors on the picketing line.
The ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes, agreeing on a modified treaty with the leaders of the British Medical Association.
WMA wants a better weekend payment for the 54,000 junior doctors who will be subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, CEO of NHS Employers, urged junior doctors not to continue strikes.
Mortimer said: "Strikes achieve little or nothing, but pressure the team and services already working at the limit, and cause anxiety, physical pain and disorders to patients, nurses and their families."
Over the past two months, we have spoken with the Committee of Associate Physicians and together with the Department of Health and others, have responded positively to their concerns regarding the role of guardians and corporate information policies.
Workers hoped that continued positive assistance on other important topics - such as staff distribution, training flexibility, additional training for those returning after a career break, tuition fees, mutual recognition of the curriculum, academic leave and gender pay gaps in medicine - were a sign of how seriously employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health were going to meet the conditions achieved by WMA in May.
The drug for 2 euros per day can reduce the threat of a heart attack
Thousands of patients with a heart attack are going to use the drug 2 per day, after the authorities have recommended giving it to more people and for a longer time.
Anti-cooking drug ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated attacks for people with heart disease.
The drug is already prescribed for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or a new attack.
The UK's NICE Supervisory Service has advised it to be given to people for four years to further eliminate the risk of cardiovascular problems.
However, the UK National Health Service's NICE Supervisory Service has now advised it to people for four years to eliminate the risk of cardiovascular problems.
A heart attack occurs with approximately 140,000 people in England every year, and a quarter of them have another attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes occur as a result of the accumulation of fat material on the walls of the arteries and the formation of plaques.
If the plaque is torn apart, it can cause a clot that blocks blood from the heart and a heart attack.
And if the thrombus moves, it will be able to move through the blood stream and block the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already been overtaken by one attack are at greater risk of getting another.
Ticagror, produced by British firm AstraZeneca and sold under the name Brilique, reduces the risk of making clots less likely.
The NICE draft instruction, published today, recommends that people be given 90 mg of ticagrelorator for 12 months, followed by 60 mg with aspirin twice a day for the next three years.
Professor Carol Longson, director of the NICE's Center for Medical Technology Evaluation, said: "Despite the availability of effective secondary prevention methods with about a quarter of people who have already had a heart attack, another heart attack or stroke - often with devastating consequences."
Fear of repetition can have a significant negative impact on a person's quality of life.
There is evidence that ticagrelore in combination with aspirin is effective when reducing the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
Pre-recommending the ticagrelor, we are pleased to be able to increase treatment options available to many thousands of people who are ready to use it.
Since information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrel - especially the risk of bleeding - after three years is limited, the draft instruction does not recommend treatment longer than this period.
The culture of possession of the PC allows to flourish the falsification of vote counting in Muslim areas
Former Tower Hamlets Mayor Luthfur Rahman was removed from office last year due to corruption, giving rise to government report
The culture of political correctness led to the closure of the eyes, which turned into a ubiquitous falsification of the counting of votes in Muslim communities, according to a devastating report released today.
Former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles is being criticized by police, election monitors and city administrations for ignoring evidence of election violations over "excessive sensitivity to race and religion."
The former secretary of local communities, now the anti-corruption czar, said that intimidation of voters on religious grounds was so strong that the police need to be allowed to put cordons outside the polling stations in order to protect the frightened voters.
He suggests that voters take identity cards to prove who they are when they vote.
At the moment, voters should only indicate their name and address.
The report even suggests putting indelible ink on people's fingers when they hand over their ballots to exclude someone from voting twice.
We need to provide better protection to whistleblowers, said Sir Eric.
It calls for greater access to local council documents and decisions taken by informal committees or working groups to the press.
"This is not only done to protect against election fraud, but also to protect the local government from a more open culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand," he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street due to a vote scandal at Tower Hamlets in East London.
Last year, a special court hearing election issues ruled that the incumbent mayor, Luftur Rahman, was to be removed from office in connection with a long list of corruption and illegal activities.
The court found that Rahman "cynically distorted" the religious feelings of his Muslim community and silenced his critics, accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman, as it was said, "has guided his campaign based on the fact that it was the duty of Muslim believers to vote for him."
Up to 300 votes were doubtful or the result of personation, when a person votes, being represented by someone else.
Sir Erik said there was evidence of fraud across the country.
He expressed particular concerns about mail-fightings in which senior members of the Muslim community were reported to have pressured people to vote for their candidate.
Sir Eric, in the photo, made several recommendations for cleaning the voting system, including the requirement to bring your identity card to prove who you are.
"There was evidence of pressure on vulnerable members of certain ethnic minority communities, in particular women and young people, to vote at the will of the elders, especially in communities of Pakistani and Bangladeshi descent.
"There were fears that... State institutions have turned a blind eye to this behavior because of the excessive sensitivity of "political correctness" about ethnicity and religion.
Cheese Eric gave 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including the removal of political activists from working with postal ballots to stop the "collection of the vote harvest."
The report, pending by Theresa May, is also calling for tighter checks on registration to prevent the use of the voter list for immigration fraud and privileges.
The option is to require voters to present an identity card before the vote.
Use indelible ink on people's fingers as soon as they drop their newsletter to prevent anyone from voting twice.
Conduct systematic scams of people's nationality to ensure that they have the right to vote.
Enter a three-year restriction on applications for automatic postal voting.
To remove the political participants of the campaigns and activists from work with filled absentee voting and envelopes with postal voting.
Give the police the power to establish cordons around polling stations.
Amend the law to facilitate the indictment of intimidation under the 1983 People's Opportunion.
Make photographs at polling stations illegal.
Make a requirement that only English be used at polling stations (except Wales).
Strengthen training to ensure that the staff forces the voters to go to the booth one by one.
Sir Eric furiously attacks the city's police, saying it's "amazing" that no criminal charges had been brought in since the Tower Hamlets case.
"The court, which deals with the election issues, disqualified Lutfur Rahman and his agent for a long list of corruption and illegal actions," he said.
He was found guilty in the absence of reasonable doubt - the criminal standard of proof - on a number of grounds.
He also criticizes the inefficient "checks for the sake of the checkbox" of the departments of the electoral registration of city administrations.
Sir Erik said: "Last year's ruling at Tower Hamlet was a wake-up call.
Our nation has a proud legacy as the mother of parliamentary elections, and yet the alarming and concealed spread of electoral fraud and the state of denial by some authorities threaten this good reputation.
Crazy in the bike analogue Kate and other twins celebrities of the Olympics in Rio
Fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio this week went crazy on the French cyclist Pauline Ferran-Prevo, which, as it turned out, is impressively similar to the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympics is not the only athlete fighting for gold this summer, which can boast of her own famous dover - at least, according to social media reports.
So, in honor of the Rio Games and all the famous people appearing on our screens at the moment, FEMAIL compiled a list of Olympians with more than superficial similarities with Hollywood stars.
A member of the U.S. men's team of archers Brady Ellison, on the left, compared with Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child
In addition to Kate's doppelganger on the bike track, many people online rushed to point out how a certain archer could be the twin of the superstar Leonardo DiCaprio.
A member of the men's team of archers Brady Allison was the cause of a hurricane on Twitter, after images of his, looking frighteningly like the Wallstree Wolf star, appeared.
And in fact, the archer learned about the madness of social networks and admitted that he had heard that he looked like Leo since he was a child.
"I personally don't see a huge resemblance, maybe with the exception of vegetation on the face," said Brady Huffington Post.
"He's an attractive guy, so I think it's a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will undoubtedly be indicated even more this year: the striking similarity between British jumper Gregg Radherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina, with her big expressive eyes, as they say, is an exact copy of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the basin of the South African swimmer Kameron Van der Burga was compared with the star of the Hor Matthew Morrison for many years.
Turning to the more unexpected: This user believes that Nathan is the "sports version" of the actor "Beginning"
Another long-existing comparison was between tennis player Rafael Nadar and actor Josh Harnett, who can boast of similar heavy eyebrows and lips.
Silver medalist from Russia Yulia Efimova boasts not only the same tanned skin and blond hair like actress AnnaLinn McCord, while Nathan Adrian from the US team, according to fans, looks like a "sports version of Joseph Gorgon Levitt."
Severe women: Football star Hope Solo, on the left, and actress Jennifer Carpenter from Dexter, on the right, have the same face and eye shape
Not the only one: One Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw similarities
Creating a theory: According to this user, there may be a reason that underlies the similar appearance of this pair
One Twitter user recently turned to the site to unveil his enthusiasm that "the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical."
In fact, the U.S. football star and actress Dexter have incredibly similar face and eye shapes.
Other popular comparisons included Kerry Walsh Jennings and her smile, which is close to the identical smile of actress Laura Linney, as well as the gold medal-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas, who boasts her own beautiful wide smile, which is like the smile of the star's "Addle" Gabrielle Union.
The CBC Olympic commentator apologizes for speaking about the Chinese swimmer "died like a pig"
Analysis of Byron Macdonald's fourth place at the finish of the 14-year-old Ai Yanhan on the women's freestyle relay 4x200 m angered CBC spectators in the live broadcast of the Olympics
Canadian broadcaster CBC was forced to apologise after one of its commentators said that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "started as a stench" and "died like a pig" during the swim.
Commentator Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was turned off when he began expressing his own opinion at the end of the final women's relay 4x200 m freestyle.
It was possible to hear how McDonald, who was attracted to the team of CBC commentators to "dilute it in color," said: "This 14-year-old Chinese dropped the ball, baby."
Too excited, started like a stench, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, who is 14, sailed the second stage of the relay for 1:57.79 euros for 1.76 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Rak, allowing Canadians to eliminate the lag from China.
Spectators across Canada reacted quickly online after being shocked by the tone and expressions used.
Emmet McFarlane tweeted, "Is the CBC announcer really just saying that a 14-year-old swimmer from China was "died as a pig"???"
That idiot didn't realize they were still on the air."
On the final of the women's relay of 4x200 m freestyle said about Ai Yanhanh from China in the final of the women's relay 4x200 m in freestyle: "This little 14-year-old Chinese dropped the ball, baby."
Twitter critics immediately hit Byron MacDonald, and many urged him to fire him.
Twitter users couldn't stand up when they heard how insensitive Byron MacDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradise, wrote: "Nothing for yourself is ByronMacDonald.
You're introducing CBC and Canada and making us look like a bunch of racists.
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russell, who hosted the CBC, apologised live for McDonald's comment, saying: "We're asking for a comment for a comment on the swim's performance."
It was a bad choice of words, we're sorry it happened."
SVS ended by apologising to more than 90 people who tweeted in response to this statement.
Commentator buddier Scott Russell had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald
CBC then copied and sent their apologies to more than 90 other Twitter users who complained about McDonald's comments.
The television network rushed to apologize and publish the statement.
We sincerely regret that these statements were made and that they were allowed to go on the air.
Last night, we acted quickly to apologize to our viewers live and our subscribers in social networks.
Let's make it clear, Byron's comments related to the performance of swimmers, and not to her as a person.
And yet it was an inappropriate and unsuccessful choice of words, and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized live and tried to clarify his comment, saying he did not think his words would be interpreted as an attack on the identity.
"I'd like to take a look apprehensive for the comment I made last night after the women's relay," he said at the CBC Olympics.
'I talked about the swimmer's performance, not her personally.'
"It goes without saying that there was no disrespect, and I am very sorry."
The buyer of Primark insulted a woman who shamelessly tried on underwear in the middle of the store
Buyers did not know where to look, when some woman exposed to try on panties, on the floor with shops in the middle of Primark.
Worse, she tried on what she looked like in them, pulled them down and put them back on the shelf.
She continued to search and eventually measured four pairs of underwear in the Bouverie Place shopping center store in Falkston.
The Bouverie Place Primark store in Falkston, where a woman tried on knitted panties before putting them back on the shelf
The mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in the store at the time, said that after fitting underwear, the mysterious woman again "dressed and left the store without buying anything."
She said, "People couldn't believe what they saw."
Standing in the middle of the shopping hall, she took a couple of panties from the window, took off her own tights and panties and put them on them.
"She didn't try to find a secluded place somewhere to do it - she just stood there, shameless."
"Everyone was staring when she took off her panties again, and she clearly didn't like them because she put them back on the shelf."
She did the same thing with the other three couples before she finally decided that there was nothing here that she liked, dressed and out.
"It doesn't seem like she cared, who was watching her, or what she thought of a man who would end up buying the underwear she tried on."
33-year-old Jenny Davidson of Kent, said: "It's disgusting to think that someone is going to take home cowards that someone else has already worn and they weren't washed."
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added: "I'm insane that the staff apparently tried to remove these items from the sale, after she left - and better."
"I wouldn't want to come home with a new couple of women's cowards and find that another woman wore and took them off and they weren't washed."
A Primark spokesperson said: "Primark is aware of the incident that occurred at our store in Falkston on Tuesday, August 9.
All the goods in question were withdrawn from sale.
How to Protect Yourself from Gun Attacks Using Krav Maga
The world around the world is dangerous, but this video from Dailymail.com may help make it a little safer for you.
We talked to Ron Mizrac, a Krav Maga Federation in New York to figure out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
Whether you're coming from the front or from behind, this video will show you how to beat the robber with his own weapon.
If fit from behind, according to the Migrachi, the first thing to do is to turn around so that you see the attacker and "liberate the line of fire."
Then you squeeze the gun between your forearm and your shoulder before hitting them in the face with a free elbow.
Then the knee follows the knee in the groin, and while the attacker bends in pain, you twist the gun from his hands, beat him in the face with a trunk and go back, holding the weapon induced on him.
For an armed, suitable in front, the way to perform is similar - remove your body from the line of fire, quickly grab the gun and twist it so that the villain can not shoot.
At the same time, move the weight to the gun and hit the attacker with a fist in the chest, then turn the gun out of his grip, before you step back and target him.
Does that sound hard?
Watch the video to see exactly what the Micah does.
But remember that the safest exit from any robbery - if you're not a master of krav-maga - is to give your cash.
For the guide, the traveler Jan Wright conducts his language in the dirtiest places in Europe
A British traveller has subjected his immune system and vomiting reflex to a serious test, licking some of the most dirty and disgusting places in Europe.
The presenter and author of the books on Jan Wright, 51, from Suffolk, spent the language on the euro banknote, the Circus of Pikkadi, the moaning of the circus, the toilet button on the train and the Russian public phone to prove the strength of his immune system.
Before licking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what it fits in.
But the experiment, which should be a film called "The Guide of the Traveler-Lisun on the Inner Force," gave some amazing results.
The thought of licking the flush button on the train, which is used by thousands of others, may be extremely disgusting, but in fact there are worse bacteria in the kitchen sink.
Throughout the trip to Europe, Wright spoke to doctors and health workers about the increase in gut bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, none of the licked brought him more than a bad taste in his mouth.
Wright became known for his bowel test, traveling the world and eating strange and amazing things.
From public railings at the train stations to the toilet flush button, this task undoubtedly experienced its immune system
In the film he shot, he said, "Since I was completely carefree in relation to my health and I drew a lot of things to my mouth from the ground, eating worms and dirty water."
He certainly proved his reputation during the film.
The only thing he refused was a dirty Russian public toilet.
Its test smear showed a luminometer value exceeding 4000 units.
For comparison, the hands just washed should be within 60.
But there was one Russian public toilet he refused to lick, after the value of his luminometer was more than 4,000 units, while the newly washed hands show less than 60
Wright and Finnish dairy producer Valio have made a film about a traveler called "Lesson Traveler's Guide on the Inner Strength," which shows the number of bacteria in different places, for example in the toilet
In the film, he said: "It's close to one of the worst things I smelled in the toilet."
There is nothing more dirty than that!
I'm not going to lick anything because it's disgusting.
"The Guide of the Traveler-Lizun on the Inner Force" was removed along with the Finnish dairy producer Valio.
The company provided Wright to Valio Gefilus, which contains fermented milk bacteria, as well as vitamins C and D, to help accelerate the growth of human gut bacteria and develop the immune system.
Valio's senior Vice President for Snacks, Juices and New Categories Nicoo Vuorrenmaa said: "We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
What would be interesting to see and at the same time could explain the benefits of probiotics.
We had a brainstorming that culminated in the idea of "let's call Jan."
They claim that interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in greater context: good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of gut health, and how it is linked to the immune system.
A growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon, and with this documentary, we were able to provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting form.
I also think the film shows that we have a good sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who was the director of the film, added: "Let's just say I'd lose respect for Jan if he licked some of the things I asked for, such as the disgusting Russian toilet that's shown in the film."
Naturally, some things to Jana was easier to lick, and some were quite tough.
I'm glad that some of these licks we managed to film."
In a 2015 Valio survey, 84 percent of respondents linked fermented milk bacteria exclusively to good stomach and intestinal conditions, and 58 percent said they consumed, at least sometimes, products containing added dairy bacteria.
The family of hooligans destroyed Saltash, the municipal house of Cornwall, on the eve of the eviction
The hooligan family left their municipal home with a loss of 50,000 euros after they were evicted for intimidating their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Sean Trebilkok were kicked out of their property in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long list of complaints against them.
After they were forcibly evicted from the property, shocked officials of housing and construction cooperatives found this property in a condition requiring repair.
The walls were left with gaping holes, the floorboards were opened, the garbage was dispersed on the floor and the walls were dirty graffiti.
The family is now resettled and, supposedly, lives in a private apartment.
Donna McAvoy, a resettle in Cornwall Housing, said she's afraid she couldn't save him.
She said, "It was an absolute nightmare for people here and I don't think people should live that way.
There are many things to weigh because this property is likely to be known as not a very good aspect of Cornwall.
This family enjoys a bad reputation, and their name is notorious.
The couple had three sons who lived in a property object from time to time, and police report that the kingdom of the horror caused by the family included fights on the street with baseball bats, intimidation of residents of nearby areas, drug use, drug trafficking, excessive screams, disputes and swearing.
Skeldon, 47 whose name was on the lease, received a warrant for anti-social behavior in June.
In several rooms of the house, which can be demolished, found old garbage
Floor boards in the house in which drugs were sold in the past were pulled out
Neighbors say they saw fights on the street and regularly called the police
Cornwall Housing forcibly evicted her and her partner from her home this week after they were given an extended 11-week period for voluntary departure.
The eviction with relief was welcomed by neighbors who said that their lives had been turned into a living hell.
One said, "They weren't worried anyone."
We've been with them for 20 years, and it's always been bad.
The number of times we've seen the police here is incredible.
"This morning we couldn't sleep."
We got up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to it!
Now that they're finally gone, it'll be fine.
Adam Fitzpatrick, head of the Cornwall Housing Neighbourhood, said the family was unable to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, with the police, and by which they regularly called the police
Garbage and old toys were scattered below on the overgrown side of the municipal house
He added: "It's a shame that the tenant could not accept any responsibility for the behavior of her and her family, since eviction is always the latest method of action that Cornwall Housing is considering.
It was a very difficult case, as the behavior was the ultimate, and their actions must have been terrifying for her observing neighbors.
I appreciate all the work my team, the police and members of the Devon and Cornwall community, who bravely acted to give us information.
I hope that this development will give a little comfort to the neighbors and send a signal that asocial behavior will not be allowed.
Fitzpatrick reported that all three sons lived in the house at different times, but said that they were all at that time a little more than 20.
Dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the bedrooms at home after eviction
Resettlement workers will now have to remove the piles of garbage that surrounds the house.
In 2014, the police raided the house and found more than 70 g of hemp, as well as scales, corresponding supplies and 1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined after pleading guilty to class B drugs for the purpose of supplying.
She said the money went to pay for the gravestone for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car crash in 2013.
After being made homeless, there is evidence that Tanya and her partner now live in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms of the house were dirty graffiti on the entire surface.
Police say they will try to evict tenants who do not obey the rules of renting the premises
Angela Crowe, from Devon and Cornwall police, said the eviction sent a clear warning to other tenants who continue to break the rules.
"This is a message for those who feel that they can behave without accusations of the prosecutor, as well as those who are harmed by such behavior," she said.
Criminal and anti-social behavior will never be tolerated by Devon and Cornwall police, who will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal were terrified when a low-flying military plane almost touched the beach
In the city of Aveiro in Portugal, tourists who love to soak up in the sun, were terribly scared for their lives
The P-3C Orion aircraft of the air force of Portugal flew incredibly low
The Air Force reported that he was carrying out a training flight, but insisted on the lack of safety risk.
Here's the moment when frightened tourists start panicking, while the moment when a low-flying plane was spicing over a crowded beach.
Dramatic footage shows a military aircraft flying almost at a distance of touch from the hunters on the strip from sand to Aveiro, northern Portugal.
Vacationers jumped to their feet as soon as they became understandably concerned about the noise of the aircraft's engines, but not being able to see that they are moving in their direction through the clouds.
The incident occurred last night near the city of Aveiro in Costa Nova.
Daniel Fernandesh, one of several holidaymakers who posted a video of a shocking flyby on social media, said: "He flew very low twice, and there was a moment, at some point it seemed that it would break."
Nuno Arrozha added: "I was surfing and I swear, it felt like the plane was about to fall on me."
Tourists on Aveiro's beach were terribly scared when the plane appeared out of the fog and flew at an extremely low altitude.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was carrying out a training flight to detect fishing vessels off the shore, and was forced to fall so low, as it was the only way to check them out.
The pilot said the plane flew a little lower than usual due to insufficient visibility caused by smoke from nearby burning forests, but the air force insisted that no one was in danger.
This summer, forest fires damaged the mainland of Portugal, and also claimed the lives of four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force made a statement today that the pilot had to fly so low due to the circumstances of the thick fog and smog from forest fires that worsened visibility.
The plane carried out a training flight, and the pilot was instructed to find fishing boats as part of the mission.
The system "HASSP" for more than a year is mandatory for catering, but most cafes and restaurants in St. Petersburg have not yet implemented it.
Checks are becoming more active, and the business is threatened with fines of up to 1 million rubles.
For more than a year, the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP, in the Russian version of HACCP) - risk analysis and critical control points - is mandatory for use by manufacturers and carriers of food, as well as catering companies in Russia, as a member of the Customs Union (CU).
Inspections of the business of Rospotrebnadzor for compliance with these norms in St. Petersburg began in February 2015.
But so far, officials have issued fines only for individual violations of the regulations (see para. "List of documents...").
Failure to comply with the regulations as a whole will cost the company 600 thousand. rubles for the first violation and in 1 million rubles - for the second.
HACCP as a system that takes into account the risks of working with food and prevents them was invented in the United States in the 1960s.
It was about food safety for astronauts.
Now the system is used in all food enterprises not only in the United States, but also in Canada, and in the European Union.
Since February 2015, HASSP has been operating on the territory of the CU.
For the development and implementation of the system, the business was 4 years (the requirement of HACCP appeared in the technical regulations of the CU in 2011).
However, both the entrepreneurs and officials admit that most companies have not even heard about this norm.
Unfortunately, we have long been sure that the norm applies only to food production, not restaurateurs, - explained the head of the Public Council Elena Tsereteli.
Now everyone is trying to catch up.
The expected time for the resumption of charter flights to Turkey is the end of August - early September.
But they will not cause stirring demand, as their target audience - families with children - is already preparing for school, experts say.
The Alliance of Travel Agencies yesterday sent a letter to the government asking to allow charters.
"For many Russian tourists, the issue of the selection of high-quality and affordable sea recreation is intractable, since in the resorts of the Krasnodar Territory and the Republic of Crimea, most of the accommodation facilities have already been booked before the end of September," the authors of the letter note and emphasize that the opening of charter flights in August will not significantly affect the already existing demand for Russian sea tourism products.
As reported in the North-West regional office of the Russian Union of Travel Industry (PCT), if the aviation agencies of Russia and Turkey quickly agree, the resumption of charter flights to Turkey can be expected within a month.
Clear understanding when charters will be resumed, so far, it depends primarily on the aviation authorities.
Technically, planes can fly in September, even in August, if tour operators quickly build programs and agree with airlines on the right flights," says Pavel Rumyantsev, Deputy Director for Communications and International Projects of the North-West Regional Branch of the PCT.
According to him, the possible resumption of charters is good news, but will not greatly affect the balance of power in the market, because the main buyers of charter tours - families with children - have already returned from rest and are preparing for school or spend a vacation in other countries.
In the velvet season, tours are mostly bought by single travelers and couples.
Charter programs can count on those who have the opportunity to relax spontaneously," - says Pavel Rumyantsev.
"Turkey has a chance to attract a lot of tourists, if it will now give very budget proposals - 50-60 thousand. rubles for a tour for two, because there are people who are purposefully waiting for very cheap tours," says Valeria Rosenthal, CEO of the travel agency Optio-Travel.
Otherwise, it is not worth relying on the hype - the bulk of travel has already been planned.
Pavel Rumyantsev also believes that, since there is demand for regular flights to Turkey, charters will also be in demand, but the hype is not worth waiting for.
"For Turkey, the launch of charters now is a rehearsal for the next season," says Pavel Rumyantsev.
"The opening of charters to Turkey is positive news for the next season," Mr. Rubtsov said.
The tax code provides for exemption from personal income tax established by the legislation of compensation payments within the limits of the approved norms related to compensation for harm caused by injury or other damage to health.
Issuance to employees engaged in work with harmful working conditions, milk is provided for by the established norms. 222 TC RF.

London schoolgirl who joined ISIS killed in Syria
Kadis Sultan, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS reportedly died in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnim Akunji said her family had learned of her death in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.
It is believed that she was killed by a Russian air strike in Raqqa, the group in the country, as reported by ITV News on Thursday.
The sultan was 17 years old, and, according to her family, she died just as she planned to leave the war-torn country and return to England.
"We can only hope that the only advantage of this is like a tombstone and a will to others, that these are the risks that we are talking about when traveling to the war zone - to dissuade people from ever making the same choices," Akunji said.
In February 2015, the Sultan and two other schoolgirls from East London boarded a plane to Turkey and then bus to the Syrian border.
The Sultan's family said she married an ISIS fighter in Syria and became a widow for months.
Reid says Clinton will remain loyal to Garland as a candidate for the post of Supreme Judge in the event of election
Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid says he is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if elected president.
The Senate's Republicans blocked Garland's claim, the way President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
Senate Majority Group leader Mitch McConnell says the next president will elect the person who can replace Supreme Court Justice Antonina Scalia.
Reed said at a conference call on Thursday that he predicts that Clinton will choose Garland "with some degree of confidence."
Reed's spokeswoman later said he didn't speak directly to Clinton about whether she would be pushing Garland, and just made assumptions.
He praised Garland and said that Clinton's team would not want to "sway the boat" with a new choice.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the United States Court of Appeal for the District of Columbia.
Reed said Republicans who block Garland's nomination were "harassible" and "assistants" of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump was not suitable for the job.
Treats claims that erotic calendars for 'women, as well as for men'

Treats President Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine with a lot of nude models is different from old-fashioned Playboy because "Playboy is for men."
I make it for women.
Obviously, he thinks the calendar too.
"We need to go back to demonstrating an eternal and classical nude figure where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired by these images of the female body," the show said in a press release announcing the calendar.
Women will want to be a part of this project because it is a wonderful work of art.
Models can serve photos online or in person at open castings in Los Angeles and New York.

Thus, the corporation violates the h. 1 st. 10 Federal Law "On Protection of Competition" (abuse of dominant position).
We are sure that the implementation of the order will provide an opportunity for the development of competition in the mobile software market in Russia, which will have a positive impact on our consumers.

The ultimate consumer of vinyl: who actually buys records?
Lonely middle-aged men love vinyl.
And until you rushed to clog the section of the comments with rude insults under the pseudonym NeversOdinocyeMenSredich, this statement follows from the factual data.
According to YouGov, so much the resurgence of records discussed is due not to the boom among the generation of two thousand, who want to feel the novelty of the material object, but the nostalgia of middle years.
Those who recently bought a vinyl album with a high probability are between the ages of 45 and 54, according to data.
Moreover, those who belong to the age group 18-24 years are the least likely.
It's also not just an act of gathering by amateurs - it has an emotional meaning: older vinyl buyers are somewhat more likely to keep their feelings in themselves (56 percent vs. 53 percent) and enjoy loneliness (69 percent vs. 66%.
But are YouGov results correct?
If this blog was a television news report, the camera would follow me while I walked the center of the busy Soho Street, in a modest gray suit and gesticulating before the stop, folding your hands and saying something impressive like, "So, let's see."
Okay, let's see.
While Soho's heart is slowly being stripped of its charm and dirt - hotels, cafes, the Paperchase shops are now flooded with buildings once occupied by independent sellers - several music shops with fantastic specialists still remain.
I would probably ask the camera to stop for the next scene in which I am close to the various people in some of these stores and try to appreciate their age and emotional mood with observation.
A native of Glasgow Stewart, 55, followed by Sister Ray (data count: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (counting for data: eight middle-aged men, one woman is probably over 20), in London for half a day to have a meeting, and shopping to take a few hours.
He's a collector, I'm asking?
"I think so," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These records, shown above (he sent me an e-mail picture, I did not chased him to the house), go lines on the walls of his living room.
His reason for acquiring so many albums and singles partly follows from his disposable income: he can now buy records that he couldn't afford when they just came out and buy the items he sold when he was young and broke.
"A lot of what I'm acquiring is the end of the '60s, the early '70s, the things I came out when I was 11 or 12, things I was probably too young to buy," he says.
He agrees that those who buy records are most likely introverts who like their own company, adding: "I don't smoke, I don't drink a lot.
This is my fault.
Wez, 25 years old who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of the customers he meets are in line with YouGov's profile.
He, however, noticed a new wave of people under the influence of hype in the media, people who heard about the return and felt the duty to buy their old records.
Judging by the conversations I had, people got rid of their collection, usually around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their vinyl to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their records," he said.
This may explain the boom among the rebirth of vinyl of a certain age.
What about the supposed emotional importance of records?
It is enough to spend a few seconds in a store like Phonica to understand that record stores offer a comfortable society to people with similar views.
According to Wez, some older customers, in particular, are insulted by a cashless payment system.
Some vinyl lovers may feel shocked by the digital world and prefer to retire to the constancy of familiar envelopes for records, items that awaken memories of a serene youth.
"I think sometimes it can be filled with emptiness or possession of material things as a kind of calm," says Wez.
Since I'm a collector myself, I have it, and I think a lot of people have it, too.
It's a simple way to take your head.
"We are like their social workers!" - said a colleague from the shelving records.
An ICM survey in April found that nearly 50 percent of the people who bought the vinyl album last month did not listen to it yet.
The survey also found that 41 percent have a player they never use, while 7 percent, of those who buy vinyl, don't have a record player.
At this stage of the news report, I would probably look seriously puzzled, scrolling through the rack with Boshanov's collections.
The "traffic" aspect of rebirth is what Johnny has noticed, 42 years old, who works at Sounds of the Universe (counting data: three middle-aged men).
"Someone came back recently and said, "I don't have a record player, but I want to buy a Radiohead record so we can put it on our shelf," he says.
That's not a big percentage, but it's definitely the same.
More part of the part of the part, less music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
These are younger people, not the elderly, they are a little less than twenty, who are just getting acquainted with it.
Fopp, which has now taken away almost the entire vinyl, has a much more diverse audience when I arrive.
There are couples over 70, tourists who are photographed, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Although the atmosphere is less relaxed than in the aforementioned stores - the last synth and sexy-pop Wild Beast, not jazz improvisation, makes its way through the speakers - it's nice to see the diversity in their customers.
None of them look particularly lonely, but it is difficult to establish a painful psychological trauma with 30 seconds next to someone.
Eleanor, 27, went to Fopp for a few minutes, looking at the various records available on sale.
She's looking at the goods, not spending money.
She does not earn much, according to her, so to collect records is not a very suitable option.
It's expensive.
Listening to music on a computer or other device is simple, but the beauty of vinyl is . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 
I don't know how to explain - it's really unique.
My last stop is a store that is said to have contributed to the emergence of a new generation of wine lovers: City fashionistas.
As long as I'm creating the illusion that I'm looking at denim tight-fitting shorts, I'm watching a group of teenage girls gathering every minute around the Polaroid camera before the father and his daughter start discussing the purchase of a Crosley player.
On the left is a staircase, the wall of which is set by Adele's records, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mack: a mixture of modern style and classics, mandatory records for any average collection.
No one looks - possible because they are just a decoration, some are so high on the wall that it would be impossible to touch them.
This is a real "artistic vinyl."
But given that any attraction of attention to these items can mean more money for the industry and send several customers to the hinterland for some time, there is almost nothing to complain about.
Not surprisingly, a layer of a population that is more likely to have more time and money than most people have is the layer that spends most on luxury goods like vinyl.
But while my findings suggest that YouGov's results are accurate, at least in Soho records stores, they do not rule out the existence of a huge number of women collectors and vinyl lovers that exist in reality, in records stores and online forums.
These people are probably working in school or offices.
But they clearly don't spend Thursday morning, shopping at the Berwick Street records, scrolling through the records and avoiding the eyes of an unpleasant 30-year-old fake host who hangs over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.

A French court rejected the offer of the Calais authorities to demolish dozens of homemade shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
At a court hearing this week, the Calais authorities said that the state should be able to demolish a total of 72 homemade shops where people inside the camp sell goods from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer to cut or sell tea for 50 cents (40p) or simplest meals for several euros in homemade restaurants.
Calais Prefecture said that these places should be demolished because they represent a parallel economy that does not pay taxes, and because they carry fire and sanitation.
Humanitarian groups told the court that shops and restaurants are vital, saying that the free dishes offered by the pro-government association and other groups do not provide enough food for the growing number in the camp.
They said that homemade shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food to those in need.
Lille's court ruled that there was no legal basis to expel people managing 72 homemade shops, but said that the problems of Calais' prefecture "were fully understood."
Judge Jean-Francois Molla said that the groceries, cafes and restaurants played a much greater role than just feeding people who "live in extremely shaky conditions."
He said that the space provided calm points of meeting between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places that was threatened with demolition was the Jungle Children's Cafe, which does not work for profit and offers 200 lunches a day, English and French language classes and asylum counseling for hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people signed a petition to protect the children's cafe.
The letter sent to the Guardian stated that its closure "would have been a disaster for these children, some of whom are under eight years old."
Two charities, aid to the refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants on Friday estimated that the number in the Jungle camp grew and exceeded 9,000 people in history - the highest in history - after a sharp increase in new arrivals during the summer.
The libraries of microdistricts invite young freemen to educational programs.
This week, the library-branches will hold meetings dedicated to the City Day, the Year of Russian Cinema and even the Day of the Physical Athlete.
The programs are aimed at children's audience, so for the most part will be in a game form.
Today, August 10, the library-branch No. 2, in the lining neighborhood, invites you to the cruise presentation "My Town is small."
On August 11, the library-branch No. 1 will host the local history hour "I live in this city, I know this city."
The library-branch No. 2 on the same day will be a multimedia lesson "Land of the native fate."
And in the library-branch No. 4 in Surazhevka - the game program "Film, film, film."
On Sunday, August 14, for the guys from the northern neighborhood library-branch No. 3 will hold a game program "Fizult-hello!"
Britain stops in silver in rugby-7, after the master class of Fiji allows them to take gold
The UK's impressive Rugby 7 series was crushedly halted at the Fiji team's final finish on Thursday night, when they were completely defeated at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji gave a master class on possession of the ball, sliding, evasion, support of the game, running lines and brute force to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat came with not too poor consolation in the form of silver - the third in Britain for the day - and they could be proud of their efforts in the first Olympic tournament in Rugby-7, in which they defeated New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa on the way.
The painful beating of Boks, 7-5 in the semi-finals earlier on the same day, could return to adversely affect them in the final.
But, no matter what, Fiji in this form won the team of 15 people in this form.
It may be some consolation for the UK - but probably not - that at least one Briton will hang a gold medal on his neck tomorrow: Fiji head coach Ben Ryan, former chief of England from Wimbledon.
It was a trip for the UK.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game on the Adelaide Sevens.
They lost only one here.
These blows will hurt, but the progress is astounding.
Fiji began great, for the sake of fun, beating off the UK's attempts to intercept the ball.
It was like pushing a column of moving buses for Captain Tom Mitchell and the company, and the World Series champions went up 5-0 when Osea Colinisau dived into a corner.
Having four minutes on the clock Jerry Tuvay added another touchdown on the right-winger that was implemented.
12-0 and the United Kingdom barely touched the ball.
A gorgeous attempt to intercept Mitchell kept Leon Nakarawa man from scoring a third, but it only detained Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jas Veremalois made a touchdown in the right corner, and Britain lost 17-0.
Nakarawa added another after the resumption and the clock was still more than a minute. in the first half.
Vathemo Ravovo then broke through a few more sluggish attempts to intercept the UK and stormed the line to get a point.
The implementation led to 29-0 in the break.
It looked as if Fiji were born to play rugby-7, while Britain was still mastering the craft.
Which is pretty much the case.
Britain made mass substitutions for half the game, and they clogged the Fijian dam. for all four minutes, which by the standards of the first half was good until Joshua Tuisov passed after several brilliant Fijian interactions.
Dan Norton grabbed an attempt for the UK, making a touchdown in the left corner to score 36-7, but the game has long followed the way of the South Sea islanders, whose fans sang, waved flags and dance in the stands.
It was impossible not to admire Fiji's full joy.
Mata William embellished the Fijian cake, which did not need to be painted, another attempt in the last seconds.
There was a whistle, the Fijians hugged, and Britain fell on the lawn, completely defeated.
Earlier that day, Fiji defeated Japan 20-5 in its semi-finals, and the UK slightly bypassed South Africa in the tense semi-finals of one attempt to each - the difference British implementation.
Kyle Brown brings Boks forward in the first half, but Dan Norton with some magnificent leg work tore the line and scored under the beams in the second half.
The brilliant last attempt to intercept from Marcus Watson, brother 15 in the direction of England's team, Anthony, secured a victory - and ultimately a silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning are inspired to win the rowing coach's fight against cancer
There won't be any more exciting gold at these games, and that says anything.
From the first motion to the last, 220 heavy ascents in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found the additional significance of their golden moment on Estacio da Lagoa.
Although they were the two who pulled the oars, there were three voices in this boat, the echo of coach Robin Williams was always there while they sought the second consecutive Olympic gold in women's couples, the first women in the annals of British sports that reached such a height.
Their superiority was absolute, in the end it was their 39th undefeated performance, again unprecedented.
What we see, two brilliant athletes sliding on the surface with the elegance of the swans, do not fully reflect the nature of triumph.
Behind every gold rowing, a battalion of finished hands that contribute to the progressively increasing victories that are important, and there are no hands that were more important than the hands of a coach who 30 months ago, when he was diagnosed with cancer, did not know whether he would live to see the day.
As he said, it was a dangerous case.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of what they can operate, and they did.
If they don't, he goes everywhere.
It could have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes your views a little for the future.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio were lucky that he could begin treatment in early 2014 in the off-season, keeping the schedule gap minimal if it could be the right expression in circumstances like these.
I needed payment, so I needed to get better quickly.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and walked around the ward - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time, although they said quite a few steps.
That's how it starts.
Rowing itself is a journey, but it makes it a little more.
The moment after the victory, their first thoughts were about Williams, who spent a nervous morning talking a little more than usual in an attempt to overcome their own experiences.
Stanning, captain of an artillery regiment with service in Afghanistan behind the shoulders, said: "I was an emotional ruin this week, maybe it's a little too much, but it means so much."
It only confirms how much it means to me, how much I and Helen worked, and Robin too.
It was a fantastic three years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we would be nobody, so thank you very much to him, he is the best coach in the world.
I couldn't ask for a better partner to train or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning did not lose a single race in five years.
This couple set a tense rhythm that their competitors could never match.
Even at the last 500 meters, when the teams of New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stinning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were in the phase.
Helen called: "Stay in the process, stay in the process."
It's important not to get carried away now.
We had a good start, and at the same time we didn't try to do anything amazing.
We weren't waiting for fireworks today, we were just waiting for us to be able to pad well and win this race, which we did.
It will take a year for a couple to decide their future.
Glover needs to be at the wedding next month, on her own with television adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't want to say this was my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
It took about six months in London to realize that I was an Olympic champion.
It was all so new and I was so tense.
It took about four minutes.
I feel so better," she said.
The government has extended the period of destruction of sanctions products

The panel of arbiters of the WTO found that Russian import duties on paper, refrigerators and palm oil contradict the rules of the organization.
The import rates exceed the commitments made by Russia upon accession to the WTO.
"This is the first time that the WTO has made a decision against the Russian Federation," - stated in the message on the official website of the organization.
However, the arbitrators stressed in their conclusion that the European Union did not provide sufficient evidence that Russia's measures "were systematic" or "were of a comprehensive nature."
Russia, in turn, promised to adapt import duties on paper and refrigerators in the near future.
This is stated in the message of the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia.
On July 4, it was reported that Kiev intends to complain to the World Trade Organization on the actions of Russia, which imposed additional restrictions on the transit of Ukrainian goods.
This is stated in the statement of the government of Ukraine.
In May, the Financial Times reported that U.S. behavior in resolving controversial issues in the WTO undermines the principles of discussion adopted in the organization.
A similar statement was made by Brazil, Japan, the European Union and other WTO members because of the refusal of the Americans to approve for a second term the South Korean judge Chan Son Hwa.
In this regard, Russia will not appeal to the WTO on the issue of Western sanctions imposed against the Russian Federation.
The WTO is an international organization established in January 1995 to liberalize international trade.
It now consists of 162 countries.
Russia joined it in 2012.
In the presidential administration changed the head
Russian President Vladimir Putin appointed the head of his own administration of former Deputy Sergei Ivanov Anton Vaino.
Vladimir Putin reshuffled the presidential administration and expressed hope that the new head of his administration will contribute to the constructive work of the government and the Kremlin.
In turn, Anton Vaino during the meeting said that he considers the anti-corruption work that began to be carried out as the head of the administration of the President Ivanov, and promised to cooperate with the government.
Earlier, "Izvestia" wrote that experts consider the situation with the resignation of Sergei Ivanov from the post of head of the administration transparent and understandable and reshuffle will not fundamentally change the activities of the Kremlin administration.
They note that the head, who worked in the presidential administration for a long time, effectively built the activities of the AP.
Instead, the deputy head of the administration Anton Vaino came - a person who knows the specifics of this work.
In Poland, they admit that they will not buy fuel from Gazprom.
The state-owned Polish oil and gas company PGNIG does not rule out that in a few years, gas supplies from the Russian Federation may become unattractive for it due to reorientation to fuel from Norway and other countries.
This was reported by the vice-president of the Polish company for finance Boguslav Mazhets.
His words are conveyed by TASS.
"It may happen that we will not buy gas at all (at Gazprom), we are now diversifying our supplies.
Within the next four years, the main areas of supplies for us will be the East, raw materials from LNG-terminals and Norway," Mazhets said.
Currently, Gazprom occupies a dominant position in gas supplies to Poland.
On Friday, August 12, PGNIG reported that the Russian supplier in the first half of 2016 supplied it with almost 5.3 billion cubic meters. gas, which is 30% higher than the level of 2015.
The share of the Russian gas giant in the purchases of PGNIG grew to 49.8% compared to 40% a year earlier.
Recall that on July 22, the antimonopoly department of Poland did not agree on the creation of a joint venture between Gazprom and its European partners for the construction of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.
At the same time, Poland left a request to Gazprom for the supply of 11 billion cubic meters. gas on the "Nord stream-2."
This was stated by Deputy Chairman of the Board of the holding Alexander Medvedev.
The auction for the capacity of Nord Stream 2 will take place in 2017, and in the autumn of 2016 it is planned to hold an auction for its laying.
At the end of May, it was reported that Gazprom does not plan to take any action in connection with the intentions of the Polish side to abandon long-term contracts for the supply of gas from Russia after 2022, said Deputy Chairman of the Board of the company Alexander Medvedev.
He recalled that in the first quarter of this year, the Poles only increased by 42% of the purchase of gas from the Russian Federation.
The deputy chairman of Gazprom added that the fact that the fact of filing the Polish PGNIG application to the Stockholm arbitration court does not yet mean the termination of negotiations.
Earlier, the Polish company appealed to the court to achieve a reduction in the purchase price of Russian gas.
The Commissioner of the Government of Poland on gas and energy infrastructure Peter Naimsky said that the Polish authorities decided not to renew the contract with Gazprom for the supply of gas.
Poland's contract with Gazprom was signed in 1996 and expires in 2022.
In March, the Polish government's commissioner for gas and energy infrastructure, Peter Naimsky, said that his country could abandon the supply of blue fuel from the east in six years.
According to him, Warsaw plans to build a new terminal for deliveries of liquefied natural gas Baltic Pipe, which will connect the country with the Norwegian shelf.
Nord Stream 2 provides for the construction of two lines of the offshore gas pipeline with a total capacity of 55 billion cubic meters. gas a year from Russia to Germany on the bottom of the Baltic Sea.
The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) has increased the number of observers near the border of Ukraine with Crimea.
This was reported by the first deputy head of the SMM in Ukraine, Alexander Hug.
"I can confirm that the SMM has increased the number of observers in this area," he said, answering the relevant question of journalists.
According to the OSCE, the situation on the border of Ukraine and Crimea is calm, incidents affecting security are not recorded there.
Observers tracked what was happening at three checkpoints across the Russian-Ukrainian border.
In the Network appeared a video of the passenger plane Yak-42, which landed at the airport of Ufa, which rolled out the runway by 400 m and fell on the left wing.
The video was published by the TV channel "360."
The incident occurred at 4.30 Moscow time.
The flight of the airline "KrasAvia" arrived from Sochi.
They were quickly evacuated to a safe place, there were no casualties.
The aircraft itself was transported to the parking lot.
Ufa Airport is operating as usual.
The Volga Investigative Department on the transport of the TFR was engaged in clarifying the reason for the hard landing of the aircraft of the liner.
The UN is investigating the use of chemical weapons in Syria.
A UN Special Commission is investigating the possible use of toxic gas in rebel-held areas of the Syrian city of Aleppo.
All parties to the conflict deny the use of chlorine, but the UN special envoy for Syria, Steffan de Mistura, believes that the fact of what happened is undeniable.
Similar statements were made on the eve of the third round of intra-Syrian talks, which are due to begin in late August in Geneva.
UN experts have launched an investigation into reports of the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian city of Aleppo.
The first information about the terrorist attack using toxic gas, presumably chlorine, appeared on August 2.
Then the opposition said that in the area where the Russian military transport helicopter was shot down the day before, the aircraft dropped bombs with a poisonous substance, but in Moscow these charges called a dump.
Later, the Russian Ministry of Defense accused the opposition group "Harakat Nur al-Din al-Zinky" in the incident.
It soon became known that the bombs filled with toxic gas were two.
This was confirmed by the BBC by one of the victims.
"A few minutes later, I felt the smell of gas, the beginning to burn my eyes, it became difficult to breathe," the eyewitness said.
As a result of the attack, at least 7 people were killed, 23 were hospitalized.
If the use of poison gas is confirmed by experts, the actions will be regarded as a war crime.
The UN Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura told reporters: "There is a lot of evidence that this really happened."
The inadmissibility of the use of chlorine for military purposes is prescribed in the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).
Despite the fact that all parties to the Syrian conflict deny the use of toxic gases, in 2015, human rights activists recorded 35 cases of use of chlorine by the Syrian army against the "moderate opposition."
The situation in Aleppo is complicated by the fact that shelling of its areas is carried out daily, and terrorists prevent the withdrawal of residents from the city.
According to Reuters, the UN expects Russia to establish a "humanitarian pause" in military operations.
The current three-hour lull regime in the organization is considered "insufficient to help nearly 2 million civilians trapped."
Staffan de Mistura Humanitarian Adviser Jan Egeland said a 48-hour ceasefire would be required to deliver aid to the city and evacuate sick and wounded people every week.
"We have to send bulk cargo from a column of trucks in the area where the roads are almost destroyed, and those that remain, mined," - said Mr. Egeland. "But the Russian delegation has confirmed its readiness to sit with us at the negotiating table."
Consultations in Geneva between U.S. and Russian representatives on the establishment of a "humanitarian pause" continue.
How Russia opened "humanitarian windows" in Aleppo.
In the face of the ongoing battle for Aleppo - the second largest Syrian city - Russia on August 11 announced the introduction of a three-hour cessation of hostilities, which will operate daily from Thursday.
The creation of "humanitarian windows" is designed to provide conditions for the delivery of medicines, food and basic necessities to the city.
The decision of the Russian Defense Ministry was made against the background of increasing international pressure on Moscow with the demand to curtail the military operation and contribute to the resumption of the negotiation process.
As a result of a series of explosions in the resorts of Thailand killed four people.
Several explosions exploded in southern Thailand on Friday morning.
As a result of the attack, four people were killed, 19 were injured.
The epicenter of the explosions fell on the city of Hua-Hin.
Among the victims were ten foreigners, citizens of four states, Russians among them are not.
None of the terrorist groups have so far taken responsibility for the incident, but the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the country hastened to say that the Islamists were not involved in it.
Several people have already been detained on suspicion of organizing the explosions.
According to preliminary data of the local police, the scale and features of the explosions indicate that they were directed against the military leaders.
The attacks took place at popular tourist resorts, including Patong Beach in Phuket and Hua Hin, Trang and Surat Thani.
After the arrival of the military junta to power in the country in 2014, economic growth fell from 7.2% (2012) to 2.8% (2015), but tourism remained one of the few industries that demonstrated development.
In 2016, 14 million people have already visited the country, which is 1.5 million more than in 2015.
The first suspects in the preparation and organization of attacks have already been detained, police colonel Chrisan Patanacharoen said.
It is too early to talk about the goals, he added, but the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the country "are confident that they are not associated with international extremist groups."
It is too early to draw conclusions, Mr. Patanacharoen said. the
But we know for sure that these incidents are not directly related to any kind of terrorism, in fact, these are local sabotage, and we are trying to identify the identities of those behind them.
The explosions occurred on the birthday of Queen Sikerit of Thailand.
The Thai junta considers the defense of the monarchy one of its main priorities, so the incident is likely to be directed against it.
According to police general Sithichhai Srisopacharanate, the bombs were detonated remotely with a half-hour difference.
They were hidden inside trees on busy streets filled with dining in restaurants by tourists.
It is already known that one of the four dead was a Thai girl who traded street food.
The identities of the other victims are still unknown, but it is known that they are residents of four foreign countries.
According to the Royal Thai Police, including four German citizens, three Dutch nationals, two Italian citizens and an Austrian citizen.
There are no Russians among the victims of the explosions, the press service of the Federal Tourism Service reported.
Local experts also attribute the explosions to the referendum held on August 7, at which 61.4% of the country's population supported the draft new constitution.
It was prepared by the Commission for the Drafting of the Constitution, appointed by the military junta.
The voters needed to decide whether they supported the system in which the upper house of parliament was fully appointed by the military and had a significant role in the election of the country's prime minister.
The new system was adopted and will be tested for the first time in the 2017 parliamentary elections.
We will remind, on May 22, 2014 in Thailand there was a military coup led by the commander of the army of the country Prayuth Chan-Ocha.
This step, he said, the army was prompted by an ongoing political crisis and the lack of progress in negotiations between the government and the opposition.
The military created the National Council for Peace and Order, imposed a curfew and censorship, dispersed the protesters and the upper house of parliament.
How Bangkok was in a state of emergency
The Thai government, led by Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, announced a state of emergency in Bangkok and adjacent provinces in January 2014.
The regime lasted 60 days.
Two explosions occurred in Bangkok.
In January 2014, in the center of Bangkok, at the Victory Monument, where one of the main protests took place, two explosions occurred, as a result of which 28 people were injured, five of them were in critical condition.
The explosions were made by unknown on motorcycles.
The authorities increased security measures in the capital and attracted military forces to protect the demonstrators.
In the Dry Log began the development of conditions.
As it became known "Kommersant," the government was asked to agree on the draft conditions for the auction for the Sukhoi Log gold ore deposit, while maintaining two key restrictions.
It is proposed to prevent a company where 25% or more belongs to foreigners, and those applicants whose capital will not be at least 25% of state participation.
Industry participants do not expect the government to rewrite the conditions, noting that many players do not risk taking up a difficult and expensive project.
The auction can be announced in August and held in October.
The Ministry of Natural Resources submitted to the government a draft order and conditions of the auction for the largest undeveloped gold deposit in Russia Sukhoi Log (Irkutsk region, reserves and resources - 130 million ounces), said two sources "Kommersant," familiar with the situation.
The project was introduced on Wednesday evening, one of them clarifies.
The Ministry of Natural Resources confirmed that the project was submitted to the government.
The representative of the supervisory subsoil use of Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Khloponin told Kommersant that the official's office has not yet received the project.
"The auction can be announced in August, immediately after the issuance of the order of the government, and taking into account the time frame for the collection of applications of potential participants (at least 45 days) the tender may take place in October," the Ministry of Natural Resources said.
According to Kommersant, the project retains two key requirements for potential participants, prescribed in the version, which was sent for approval to the ministries and FOIVs in July (there is a "Kommersant").
The first is the presence in the capital of applicants at least 25% of state participation.
The second is the denial of access to the auction for companies under the control of foreign investors, based on the understanding of FZ-57 about foreign investments in strategic societies.
According to the two articles of the Federal Law specified in the draft, as already written "Kommersant" on August 2, companies whose beneficiaries (25% of the shares and above) are not tax residents of the Russian Federation or have dual citizenship - can not allow the auction.
The government has the right to impose such restrictions, since the Dry Log belongs to the depths of federal significance (stocks of more than 50 tons of gold).
The Ministry of Natural Resources confirmed that the project "contains restrictions on the admission of foreign companies," but refused to comment on the details before the government's order.
The demand for state participation in the capital of the auction was put forward by the Irkutsk region, said in December 2015 "Kommersant" in the Ministry of Natural Resources and confirmed later by the Governor of the region Sergey Levchenko, noting that it was sent to the Ministry of Natural Resources by his predecessor Sergei Eroschenko, "who had agreements on investment projects with Rostec."
Who lobbied the restriction on the admission of foreigners, the interlocutors "Kommersant" do not specify.
"But this is in the spirit of the time: not to give control in the largest gold deposit in Russia against the background of Western sanctions," - says the interlocutor of "Kommersant," familiar with the preparation of the auction.
The head of the Ministry of Natural Resources Sergey Donskoy on August 1 said that foreigners "can go to the consortium" if the applicants attract them "as a financial structure, technological partners."
The interlocutors of "Kommersant" believe it is unlikely that the government will adjust the conditions.
The main contender for Sukhoi Log in the industry is a consortium of the largest gold miner of the Russian Federation PJSC Polyus, controlled by the son of Suleiman Kerimov Said, and Rostec.
As Kommersant wrote, in July, the partners created the joint venture "SL Gold," where Polyus has 51% of the shares, the structure of "Rostec" RT-GR - 49%.
Rostec declined to comment, Polyus said that "certainly, they are interested in this asset" and have all the necessary competencies and resources for its development.
"But the final decision on the possibility and format of our participation will be made after the announcement of the conditions," - added in the "Polyus."
ALROSA may participate in the auction, but the decision is with the government of the Russian Federation, Kommersant sources said.
The possibility of participation in the development of the Sukhoi Log was stated by the Russian GV Gold and the Canadian Kinross, which is developing assets in Chukotka, while Polymetal and Nordgold, according to Kommersant, are not interested in the asset.
The head of the Union of gold industry of the Russian Federation Sergey Kashuba in December 2015 estimated "Kommersant" investments in Sukhoi Log at $ 2.5-4 billion.
Most potential applicants scare away not only the amount of investment, but also the complexity of the project: you need serious additional exploration of reserves and technology of work with complex ores, explain the interlocutors of "Kommersant" in the industry.
The largest M&A transaction - "KIT Finance Pension Administrator" started on the pension market - the KIT Finance Pension Administrator launched the process of merging the four controlled NPFs.
As a result, on the basis of the "Gazfund Pension Savings" will be created NPF with an amount of savings of about 373 billion rubles.
On the launch of the procedure for combining four pension funds - "KIT Finance," "Promagrofund," "Heritage" and "Gazfund Pension savings" - said yesterday the owner of 100% funds of LLC "KIT Finance Administrator."
"Reorganization is carried out in agreement with the Central Bank in compliance with the requirement of failure to impair the terms of existing contracts," - stated in the message of the company.
The association is held on the basis of the "Gazfund Pension savings."
As noted by the general director of this NPF Oleg Byaloshitsky, the unification of funds allows to solve several problems: expanding the geography of presence, concentration of resources for development, cost reduction, replication of the best practices of each of the funds and optimization of corporate governance.
According to him, the approximate deadline for the completion of consolidation is the second quarter of 2017.
As a result of the merger of NPF "Gazfund Pension Savings" will become the largest player in the OPS market.
As of March 31, the amount of pension savings of merging funds exceeded 373 billion rubles.
As follows from the reporting on the website of the funds, the beneficiaries of their owner - "KIT Finance Pension Administrator" - are currently Anatoly Gavrilenko (through the controlled LLC owns 65%) and NPF "Gazfond" (35%).
However, the group itself launched the group much later than competitors.
So, controlled by the group O1 NPF "Future" absorbed "Stalfond" at the beginning of this year.
Currently, this combined NPF is joining the funds "Uralsib" and "Russian Standard."
"Association into a single structure, in addition to reducing costs, is necessary to solve structural problems," - said the Director General of NPF "Future" Nikolay Sidorov.
Active work on the consolidation of funds from April is also going on in the pension group "Safmar" - NPF "European," "Education and science" and "Region fund" should join the NPF "Safmar" before the end of this year.
In 2017, they will be joined by NPF "Trust."
"The combination of funds will have an effect of increasing control over risks, operational processes and expenses," - noted in the pension group "Safmar."
The pause in the pooling of funds, which was withstood by the "KIT Finance Pension Administrator," can be caused by several reasons, experts say.
Until recently, the NPF could not buy back more than 40% of the volume of the issue of infrastructure bonds, which were actively placed by the group.
After amending the resolution of the Central Bank in March this year on a number of issuers that meet the requirements of the regulator, there are no more such restrictions.
If necessary, the entire issue can be bought by one major player," - said the director of the rating group of financial institutions ACRA Yuri Nogin.
Several NPF leaders from the top 15 on assets are another possible reason for the pause of the spheres of influence and, as a result, personnel appointments in a single fund, which were to be agreed by the owners of the group.
Yesterday, Anatoly Gavrilenko was inaccessible for comment.
The request "Kommersant" in the NPF "Gazfond" also did not respond.
Although the consolidation of funds is a time-consuming and expensive event, at a long distance, this decision will be justified.
As noted by the general director of the consulting company "Pension partner" Sergey Okolesnov, the "Gas Fund Pension Savings" less outflows, the connection will stabilize the base of other funds of the group.
At the same time, a more successful experience of NPF KIT Finance and Promagrofond in building retail sales of OPS, as well as the use of more modern software, will be in demand.
The requirements of the Central Bank for the processes and personnel of the NPF are constantly growing, so it is impractical to duplicate the infrastructure on four funds with a single investment policy, says Pavel Mitrofanov, Managing Director for Corporate Ratings at Expert RA.
"The effect from the reduction of duplicate functions will unambiguously overlapping the possible costs of unification," Mr. Mitrofanov said.
The cost of combining four funds Sergey Okolesnov estimates at 30-50 million rubles.
"Expenses for the maintenance of four funds of such sizes are about 400 million rubles. in the year, with consolidation in the medium term, the budget is realistic to halve," Mr. Okolesnov is sure.
In the Russian rental came the preconfid Disney cinema "Pet and his dragon."
Beautiful species of New Zealand, a pitiful dragon, a heartbreaking history and country-style songs are enough to believe again in the old-fashioned magic, says ELENA KRAVTSUN.
The frightened little boy was picked up by a dragon, who became a human babysitter and a gentle babysitter, and a devoted friend.
Pete calls his friend Elliot, after a puppy from the book of fairy tales, plays catch-up with him and falls asleep in a hug.
Six years later, he, who overgrown and in a loincloth, is no longer distinguished from another clever forest tornado - Mowgli.
In this form, Pete discovers the red-haired female hunter Grace (Bryce Dallas Howard), while Gavin's (Carl Urban), her husband's brother, is aggressively rolling the forest.
Now she will have to not only believe in the existence of the dragon, but also to help save him.
Pete is taking an accelerated course of "being human" surrounded by idyllic Americans who wear shirts, a moral code in the heart and smile more dazzling than any advertisement.
No character looks or acts too terribly so that the viewer really began to hate or fear him.
Even Gavin, who opened the hunt for an atypical inhabitant of the forests under his control, is far from an incorrigible villain.
The huge furry dragon also turned out not at all terrible, with the good face of the Bulldog, the airliner's wing's scope and the ability to become invisible.
The dragon murmurs funny, purr, even grunts and, fortunately, does not speak, but he always wants to be petted, it is advantageous to distinguish from all the famous cinematic dragons.
The visual image of Elliott and his manner of holding up provide such a high degree of emotional involvement that in the most tense moments begin to cry desperately in three streams not only small viewers, but also adults.
Surprisingly good is Oaks Figley in the role of Pete, torn between a possible family and a real friend.
And Robert Redford virtuoso gives out a canonical grandfather, who would be happy to have literally every child.
How did director David Lowry manage to shoot a fantastically cute remake of the forgotten Disney film "Petha's Dragon" of 1977, mediocre from nose to tip the tail and remembered only by a mix of animation and feature film, and make it the most sincere film of this summer?
It didn't help a miracle.
In his painting, Lowry from the original, in fact, took only two things: the orphan Pete and the dragon.
There are musical numbers and most of the strange jokes.
In this good fairy tale read the features borrowed from "Bambi," "Alien" and many other cute children's paintings.
Disney Studio continues to successfully expand the gallery of high-quality remake of the 21st century.
Of course, "Pet and dragon" is not as stunningly beautiful as the same "Jungle Book," and there is no skillful villain in it, which was Cate Blanchett as the stepmother in the new "Cinderella."
But this naive film no less successfully helps to believe in miracles and good in the best Disney traditions.
By the way, the keys to the magical Disney Castle director Lowry will receive once again - for the artistic film adaptation of the story about "Piter Pan."
Drewed in "Fly and his dragon" tandem David Lowry and screenwriter Toby Halbrooks entered a new ambitious project about the unadriving boy of the eponymous tale of James Barry.
RBC journalist Alexander Sokolov will be charged with new charges
Lawyers of RBC journalist Alexander Sokolov, accused of organizing the activities of the extremist structure, said that the prosecutor's office found shortcomings in the case of their client.
The fact that the prosecutor's office made such a presentation, we learned from the investigators just yesterday.
We were scheduled to participate in the court session on the issue of limiting acquaintance with the materials of the criminal case, but the hearing did not take place in the end, and the investigators informed us about the submission made by the prosecutor's office," - quotes the words of the lawyer Olga Dinze.
She said that the prosecutor's office pointed to the investigators for the discrepancy between the qualifications of the case and the materials collected.
Now the investigators will have to eliminate the gaps in the evidence base and bring a new charge to Alexander Sokolov.
Either another article of the Criminal Code (CC) will appear in the case, or it will remain the same, but with other arguments and new evidence, Mrs. Dinze clarifies.
As reported by Kommersant, Alexander Sokolov was arrested on July 29, 2015.
In June of this year, it was reported that the investigation excluded from the accusation the wording of the RBC journalist about "shaking the political situation in the direction of instability" and "the overthrow of the authorities illegally."
The correspondent of "Kommersantboscosport" ALEXANDER ZILBERT lived the life of an Olympian in the Olympic village, inspected the house of the Russian team, lunch in the local dining room and even passed the WADA test after that.
Life doesn't seem to be freezing here for a second.
Even at night.
The last starts sometimes end in midnight, after which the athletes need another hour and a half or two to return to the Olympic village.
In addition, without stopping, there is a check-in and eviction from the village, since some athletes complete their performances and leave Brazil, and some, on the contrary, only come here.
Well, at 7:30 in the morning, the heads of all the Olympic delegations are drawn to one of the temporary awnings.
At these meetings, we usually discuss some operational domestic issues, - says the head of the sports delegation of the Olympic team of Russia Igor Kazikov. - Despite the fact that the house in which ours was located, consider it exemplary - it was put into operation one of the first and demonstrated to all inspectors, even in it there are some defects.
With hot water problems, then, sorry, with toilets.
We fought for cleanliness for a long time.
At first, no one came to clean.
Then the clergy began to come, but only they embossed with some substance on the floor, and that's all.
You see, you see, there are some innovative floors.
You can't wash them in a human way.
We know these floors - ordinary laminate!
In general, they achieved a change in the cleaning company and now everything is OK with this.
The Olympic village is a Yuzhny Butovo, a sleeping area, fenced on one side by mountains, with others - an impressive moat, flooded with water.
Well, for reliability there is still a two-meter iron fence throughout the perimeter, along which the machine gunners walk.
In total, the village can accommodate up to 17 thousand. people in 3604 apartments located in 31 houses.
On one of the 18-storey buildings hangs a huge Russian flag - this house is completely given to the needs of our team.
Looking at a small foyer at the entrance, you can immediately determine what problems, apparently, are the most urgent for the domestic team.
At the reception there are two ads: printed "Please, do not throw paper in the toilet!" and by hand, "I will accept as a gift of badges.
The rack itself is drowned in booklets.
Their cheerful color contrasts with the titles of the brochures: "The memorial for infectious diseases for those traveling to Rio de Janeiro," "The first aid for drowning, getting a foreign body into the respiratory tract, loss of consciousness - stages of cardiopulmonary resuscitation," "The first aid for burns, heat stroke, fractures and bleeding."
The text inside is generally encouraging.
For example, this: "Infection is accompanied by fever and subsequent cure.
However, a favorable outcome awaits not everyone.
Of course, in the location of the Russian national team there is a medical center, which at any time is ready to provide the residents of the house with qualified assistance, including relaxing and sports massage.
Opposite the medical center is the headquarters of our delegation.
Next to the door is an inspiring poster "Despite anything, we will win!"
And, of course, poems:
All arguments are absolutely nonsense!
Only those who fear believe in them.
Let us less, the sweeter taste of victories, Russia will not retreat, will not break!
And for an even greater elevation of the spirit hangs an ad: "Dear brothers and sisters!
With the blessing of His Holiness Patriarch Kirill of Moscow and All Russia, the spiritual care of the athletes of the Russian Olympic team is carried out by Archpriest Andrei Vladimirovich Alekseev.
You can order a prayer and other requirements by phone...
In general, the village has a Center for Meditation and Religious Rites for representatives of all faiths.
But the Russians, it turns out, in a privileged position - they have their own chapel.
Due to the load of the elevator from the ninth floor to the fourth, I decided to go down the stairs, which is recommended to be used during the fire.
And in the dark stumbled on the bodies lying on it.
Apparently, they were sleeping employees of the new cleaning company.
I believe that they are ready to throw themselves at any time to wash the innovative floors, they decided to arrange a quiet hour directly on the cold steps.
On the fourth floor I was waiting for a meeting with a longtime acquaintance - Vitaly Fedorovich Dubko, the coach of our trampolitans, who led them to Olympic gold 16 years ago in Sydney.
He and the pupil, European champion Yana Pavlova, kindly agreed to show his rooms.
To complain by and large, there is nothing to complain to, - shares the impressions of the honored coach of Russia. - We live two, the beds, of course, almost stand in the corner, but it's not critical.
The bathroom is one for four, but spacious.
The cabinet, of course, funny, of fabric, does not cause trust, but things can be put.
"No, you're guessing, they're out of tea!" - hands the tennis player Svetlana Kuznetsova, met me in the main dining room.
The main thing is called at least because it is a space of 2.7 thousand. The sq.m. I am ready to accept 5,000 at the same time. The visitors.
They give 60 thousand to the mountain. servings per day for free.
The menu options are as follows: "Best of Brazil," "Kitchen of the World," "Asian dishes" and "Pizza, pasta."
The last option, as I saw, is very popular with our volleyball players.
At the same time, let's say, I found no soups in any of the divisions of a giant restaurant.
What kind of soup? - Kuznetsov is surprised. - Nice is not!
It's good that I took Chinese with me, custard.
And a kettle.
But in general, so that you understand, we have food on the courts even worse.
There's something you can choose, despite the unbearable monotony.
I personally picked a couple of cod and meatballs in tomato sauce.
Next to each dish there is a plaque with its name in three languages - English, French and Portuguese, as well as indicating the nutritional value of the product and the presence of allergens.
Well, I'll be honest, it was edible.
I don't even know why this queue is always at the local McDonald's.
Sent, relaxed, we can say "warm" athletes at the exit from the restaurant await our best friends - representatives of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
They lure cleverly - a quictora, the winner of which gets a shirt.
Provoking, you might say!
To receive a gift, you need to answer at least eight questions out of ten.
There are questions in Russian! - I was attacked by a girl from WADA.
But the wrong one was attacked.
That is, I got in a patriotic rush, of course.
The situation escalated on the second question: "If I received a notification of doping control, should I immediately go to the doping control?"
I stopped at the B option: "No, I have one hour."
Lost, so to speak, vigilance.
Foregoing that WADA can not wait for the easing.
In general, we must be immediately.
Well, at the seventh stage of the quiz, my position became quite critical.
I somehow thought that if it would be difficult for me to follow a balanced diet because of my busy schedule (and by the way, it's hard for me!), then I can use supplements to get "additional nutrients to improve my performance."
An no, they don't!
More precisely, the answer is formulated so that they are not strictly forbidden, but it is imperative that several sentences be dissuaded.
It's not fair to play WADA!
How are you, Russia? - humiliating asks the quiz.
There is nowhere to retreat - behind Efimov, Isinbayeva and all our bloodless team.
So I focused and from the last forces I won the unfortunate T-shirt.
Know, as they say, ours!
In a victorious mood, I wandered to the fitness center next door.
I was caught up with the simulators.
I lost 250.
He noted with surprise that no Russian athlete was found in this heap of treadmills.
But maybe it's right?
Let the one who does not know how to play!
But in the nearby polyclinic, one of our guys was sitting.
In the queue for the oculist.
Don't worry, not the shooter.
In the polyclinic, however, as well as throughout the village, where it is spit, there is a device for issuing condoms.
It contains an inspiring call: "Holi then be with the condom."
Then it remains only to twist the iron, resembling the handle of the door lock, and the condom, made of natural latex Amazon, readily falls out of the apparatus.
I took one to remember.
The athletes will not die - they brought them 450 thousand.
Just for a festive and idle pastime in the Olympic village there is a whole entertainment center.
Near it, just in case, there is an informative plaque, reminding that the International Olympic Committee spends $3.25 million a day on athletes in various ways.
The center is flooded with video games, billiards and tennis tables, table football and hockey and some strange devices similar to video simulators.
What is that? - I am interested in a comrade in the form of a Ukrainian team, who actively uses an outlandish toy.
It would, of course, be just to say that he does not want to talk to a person in the form of a Russian national team, and that's all.
Here, by the way, by some strange coincidence of circumstances in the eyes ripple from the guys in the chewing-blakite.
The most playing team, it turns out.
To get around the whole village, looking into each of its corner, it takes at least three hours.
But, if you walk, and not ride on electric cars, you will open the house of the Canadian team with a moose at the entrance and a tent with a restorative bathroom, and a ticket office, and laundry, and hairdresser, and a flower shop, and a shop with everyday goods, and a mail with unique stamps (only you can still not wait out the queue from the Chinese philatesters, and the bank.
And late in the evening, you, exhausted, you will sit near an olive tree, hung with colorful ribbons in memory of the friends and relatives of athletes who left this world.
And you will be under the accompaniment of a machine that indiscriminately spraying the liquid for the killing of insects, think of the eternal.
It's about the Olympic movement.
Which in this village does not stop for a minute.
While the rest of the Russian world was watching how the Australians almost punished the American Dream Team, the real fans went online.
Few people know: the news that Inna Deriglazov won gold in the rapier at the XXXI Olympics, I got first.
Maybe I'm even the only Muscovite who saw how it happened - not counting those, of course, who watched the competition in Carioca that evening.
Only a real fan can understand.
Imagine a deaf Moscow night.
Neighbors from below - as always by 1 a.m. - wake up and begin to escalate, but very loudly shout at each other.
And threatening to move the furniture.
The kitchen flows the crane - there is no time to go to the market and buy, as asked by the plumber, new.
The TV schedule is not clear, so he simply kept the "Match," "First" and just in case "Russia" - although it is almost meaningless.
"Russia" is the birthplace of repetitions, all the sport there for some reason in the recording.
The series are broadcast live there.
Hope, of course, at the "Match" - the whole evening the young man shouted in the news releases first about the great semi-finals of Deriglazov--Shanayov, then about the upcoming battle for gold.
It would be logical to show.
But instead, basketball is the US-Australia.
I can't say anything bad about this decision.
The Australians were on an equal footing, the first half won.
They put in the place of the rogues of the Americans who were mad.
As a result, they lost, but, as they now say, the basketball Olympic tournament will no longer be the same.
It's all good, but a fight with Di Franchiskaya is approaching, and on the screen without change.
In a slight panic, I'm starting to scroll through the channels.
It feels like this for the second time in a row.
All right, let's go deep into the cable.
There is no fencing on any of the thematic "Matches."
And, in my sense, the fight is about to begin.
The text and tweets of some sports sites do not suit me.
Surf surfing gives an unexpected, but brilliant result.
On the website of the "First," it turns out that there is a direct technical broadcast of all the competitions that take place at this time.
I'm on fencing, I get a fight for gold.
Deriglazov perfectly counterattacks, goes forward on glasses - and obviously begins to take time.
The Italian plays off almost the entire gap.
Our one point in front, just over two seconds to the end.
Di Franchiska rushes to Deriglazov, she retreats, time ends, the Italian puts an injection.
A victory!
A couple of seconds, the Olympic messenger on the phone reports the fourth gold medal.
I was the first to see it with my own eyes.
Mad, loyal, involved.
The Spiritual Administration of Muslims (DUM) of Tatarstan refuses to use the Russian language in mosques.
Yesterday, the DUM plenum ordered its imams to conduct Friday sermons only in Tatar in order to force young Tatars to "study their native language."
The administration declares that it "in no case infringes" the rights of Muslims of other nationalities.
In some mosques, Kazan complain that the Tatar language is not understood by up to 60% of parishioners, including foreign students, migrants and the Tatars themselves.
The imams fear that their sermons in the Tatar "will not reach the whole audience."
Yesterday, the plenum of the DUM of Tatarstan unanimously decided to hold Friday sermons in the mosques of the republic only in the Tatar language.
As stated by the mufti of Tatarstan Kamil Samigullin, this should be an incentive for young Tatars to "study their native language."
"For those who say that "heavy," in every large mosque we intend to organize lessons of the Tatar language absolutely free," - said Mr. Samigullin.
He added that "the decision has already entered into force" and today in all mosques the sermon "must be in the Tatar language."
He recalled that the DUM of Tatarstan publishes the magazine "Shura" with typical sermons in the Tatar language.
The imam, who does not speak well in plainclothes, "can prepare thoroughly on them."
The DUM of Tatarstan unites more than a thousand parishes in all municipalities of the republic.
According to the mufti, in the areas of Friday sermons are conducted exclusively in the Tatar language.
At the same time, in Kazan, a number of mosques previously used mainly Russian.
In particular, as the mufti pointed out, this was practiced in the Burnaev mosque, Zakabannaya and "Eniler."
However, Mr. Mukhametshin stressed, the leadership sets the task that all students speak both state languages of the republic, regardless of nationality.
"There can be no question of infringement of non-Atam Muslims," Mr. Mukhametshin stressed, explaining that the preaching itself "is not a mandatory, the main part of the prayer."
At the same time, the prayer itself will continue to be read in Arabic, lectures and lessons in Russian will remain in mosques.
At the same time, Rafik Mukhametshin told Kommersant that there was no serious threat of displacing the Tatar language from mosques.
In addition to Russian and Tatar languages, such as Uzbek or Tajik, according to him, are not used in the preaching in the republic.
The decision of the DUM was actively supported in the Executive Committee of the World Congress of Tatars (VKT).
The head of the VKT Executive Committee, Rinat Zakirov, said "Kommersant": "The moves are an important part of our national life."
It would be sad if the Tatar language had left this sphere.
He noted that preaching only in the Tatar language "the desire of the imams themselves," but in the VKT Executive Committee "considered it right."
The imams interviewed by the "Kommersant" who preached in Russian are ready to fulfill the decision of the DUM, but they believe that the parishioners will have difficulties with the understanding of the clergymen.
The Tatars and the Russians go to the mosque.
Many people don't understand the language.
Of course, they will be tight.
"We will have to rebuild," says the imam of the Burnaev mosque Farhat Mavletdinov.
According to him, sermons in Russian are closer to even many Tatars, because "Russian in both schools and kindergartens, on the radio - everywhere initially."
However, he believes that the mosque will be able to continue lessons and lectures in Russian, which are held on other days.
We rely on God.
Allah will show you that the situation is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is
But about 60% of us do not know the Tatar language.
These are Uzbeks, Tajiks and Azerbaijanis.
A lot of foreign students go to us: Africans, Arabs.
"So we went to Russian for four years," he says imam.
He believes that in the Tatar language, the sermons will "reach a narrower circle and will not reach the whole audience."
But we will obey the decision of the plenum.
The results of the sermons will be different.
But time will tell.
"For example, it will only be easier for me, because the Tatar language is my native language," concluded Gabdulla Galiullin.

Egor Konchalovsky wants to create a network of cinemas only for domestic films.
"I would create a network of cinemas exclusively for Russian cinema, tickets for which cost 2-3 times less than for films of foreign production," he said.
Mr. Konchalovsky notes that it is difficult for Russian films to compete for the viewer with large Hollywood films.
In our country, more than 100 paintings are made per year, of which 20-25 ribbons reach the screens.
"And even they find it very difficult to compete with the Transformers and the Iron Man, in the promotion of which huge budgets are pumped," the filmmaker said.
Recall that on July 1, the All-Russian Youth Educational Forum "Tavrida" began to work in the Crimea.
Among the participants are teachers of creative professions and young professionals of various creative and humanitarian areas from all over Russia and a number of countries near and far abroad.

The Russian Copper Company (RMK) is ready to take on social responsibility and pay more attention to the environmental aspects of their business.
This is confirmed, for example, by the fact that the RMK took up the modernization of one of the oldest and most environmentally "dirty" enterprises of the country - the Karabash copper smelting plant.
The Karabash copper smelter was founded by the English joint stock company headed by Leslie Urquord in 1910.
In Soviet times, it was a significant industrial enterprise for the country's economy, and it actually ensured the vital activity of the whole city.
However, in the 1990s, due to financial problems, production was halted, which led to serious social problems in Karabash.
In 1998, it was decided to resume the work of the Karabash copper smelting plant.
It was also necessary to solve one of the main problems of the Karabash plant - environmental.
By the early 2000s, Karabash was already infamous as an environmental disaster zone.
The situation on "Karabashmedi" began to change in 2004, after the company was under the management of the Russian Copper Company.
The company began to modernize production, which began to gradually reduce the environmental burden on the environment.
This was recently noted by the Governor of the Chelyabinsk region Boris Dubrovsky, who visited in the first days of July "Karabashmed."

WSJ: The United States is considering the introduction of sanctions against Russia because of the hacking of the servers of the Democrats.
U.S. officials are considering introducing new sanctions against Russia in response to the hacking of the servers of the Democratic Party, writes The Wall Street Journal, citing sources.
It is reported that in order to impose sanctions, the administration of US President Barack Obama will have to officially accuse the servers of Russia or hackers supported by the Russian authorities.
According to sources, the FBI and other US intelligence agencies are almost confident in Russia's involvement in the cyberattack.
The WSJ notes that the United States usually prefers not to mention by name those who carry out hacker attacks.
The exception is the 2014 hacking of the database of Sony Entertainment Pictures, the responsibility for which was officially entrusted to the DPRK.
However, last year, Obama issued a decree simplifying the imposition of sanctions on those who carry out or promote cyberattacks.
It was originally directed against China, but can be used against other countries.
The process of making a decision on sanctions can be long, the publication writes.
Even if officials came to the conclusion that the hackers acted with the support of Russia, before making a decision on the disclosure of information, they will have to weigh the possible consequences.
They will have to determine whether the incident is so serious as to exacerbate tensions in bilateral relations.
Earlier it was reported that the administration of Barack Obama allows the possibility of applying sanctions against the state, the hackers of which hacked the servers of the National Committee of the Democratic Party.
The WikiLeaks website has published an email from the National Democratic Committee.
The media reported that hackers working with the Russian authorities may be involved in the hack.
In the Kremlin, such reports were called absurd.

The "anim" Snapchat effect is criticized as a cartoon of Asians
Snapchat says the filter is inspired by anime, but some columnists say it's racially intact.
With the help of the "Linza" tool, Snapchat allows about 150 million users a day to change the reality and play with individuality in ways that border on the absurd.

The lenses are rough, twisting traits tools that create more than 30 million corrected selfies per day.

On Wednesday, messages spread and a trail of indignation in the reports on The Verge and Motherboard, the day after Snapchat said it had removed the feature.
The company commented: the lens was conceived as a reverence for the characters of the anime, and not as a caricature of the Asians.
But experts who know about racism for the firsthand, the lens reminded of offensive stereotypes in action.
Others have completely rejected the comparison with the anime.
In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet about the photos were actively shared, said the lens was "insulting and at least awkish."
She added that "it is difficult to argue with a comparison side by side of a very rough caricature of Asians and filter effects.
This shows that the filter is not just yellow-faced, but in a highly derogatory yellow-faced.
Snapchat is not the only company that passes through these cultural bridges.
American culture seems to be involved in an endless struggle for diversity and inclusiveness, ranging from corporate meeting rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all carry.
And the huge audience of young people on Snapchat - which are more racially diverse than their older generation - could mean they'd be more likely to be expected to be understood.
When one of the Snapchat lenses creates an image offensive to the user, then, said in an interview on Thursday 25-year-old Katie Zhu, "it's much harder to go unnoticed as it used to be."
On Thursday, Zhu, a product manager and engineer who works for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In an article for Medium and in a telephone interview, she said she believed that racial controversy was the cause of insufficient diversity in picking in Sneptchat.
Zhu criticized the company's predominantly white management, consisting only of men and finished her article with the hashtag: "DeleteSnapchat."
As Zhu, who is of Chinese origin, wrote: "Either in the state did not have enough non-white people who could make such decisions, or they employ non-white people, but they do not occupy such positions in which you can safely and openly speak."
Other reviewers share her point of view, expressing dissatisfaction with the fact that Snapchat did not answer most of her questions.
The company does not publish information about the representation of national minorities in its state, emphasizing its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the racial origins of its staff, but according to a confidant, the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented segments of the population and active attempts to engage in domestic resources.
For her part, Zhu said that she would keep her Snapchat account closed, adding: "I'm wondering if they really need more users like us to tell them that it won't work like that."
Military leadership distorted intelligence about ISIS, according to the congressional commission
Officials from the U.S. Central Command have been altering intelligence reports to present a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the ground on the ground, a congressional commission said in a report released on Thursday.
The interim report of the operational team established by the Republican chairs of the House Committee on Supreme Court Affairs, the Intelligence Committee and the Military Appropriations Subcommittee found "widespread dissatisfaction" among Central Command intelligence analysts who claim that the leaders corrected their assessments of U.S. actions aimed at defeating the Islamic State.
The Central Command, known as Centcom, is the main military administration in Tampa, Florida, which controls U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The intelligence documents approved by the Centcom High Command tended to provide a more optimistic image of U.S. anti-terrorist actions than evidenced by real data from the scene, and were consistently more optimistic than the analysis provided by other intelligence agencies," the report said.
"What happened at the Centcom is unacceptable: when the top leadership is unreliable, our military suffers," said House Rep. Ken Calvert, a California Republican.
Problems with the leadership in the Centcom reach the top of the organization.
The 10-page report examines in detail the shortcomings that constantly arose in 2014 and 2015 in the description and analysis of American actions aimed at training the Iraqi armed forces provided by the Central Command.
Although it does not contain definitive evidence that members of the Obama administration's leadership ordered falsification of the reports, he argues that analysts felt that the Centcom leadership was forcing them to pose a more optimistic view of the threat from the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
"During the first half of 2015, many press releases, statements and testimonies of the Central Command in Congress were significantly more optimistic than real events," the report said.
For example, a Centcom official publicly said that a major military attack aimed at Mosul's return could begin in April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, remains under Islamic State control.
"After months of investigation, that's for sure," House Rep. Mike Pompeo, a Kansas Republican, said in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the top U.S. Central Command intelligence service forged intelligence command intelligence to downplay the threat from ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans set up a operative group when they learned that analysts expressed concern that intelligence on the Islamic State had been falsified.
As the investigation progresses, the report, published on Thursday, will be followed by more detailed data.
An additional, unfinished, investigation into the Centcom intelligence is carried out by the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defense.
Representatives of the Democratic Party in the House Intelligence Committee of the U.S. Congress published their own data on Thursday, which are consistent with some of the conclusions of the Republican task force.
"Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom has created an overly closed procedure for conducting intelligence assessments regarding ISIS and Iraqi security forces," House Rep. Adam B said in a statement. Schiff, the Democratic Party's chief representative on the committee.
This procedure, according to Schiff, "stagnated the release of intelligence documents," caused damage to the morale of analysts and "not sufficiently reflects divergent views."
But Schiff and the Democrats claim that they found no evidence that the White House was trying to force Centcom analysts to fit their detentions under a "set or political interpretation."
Preliminary results of the Congressional investigation were presented on Tuesday by the portal The Daily Beast.
Last August, The New York Times reported the existence of an investigation by the Pentagon's chief inspector, which was opened after Centcom analysts.
Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on the congressional report while the investigation by the chief inspectorate was ongoing.
But he said that "experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of the complex data, and the intelligence agencies and the Ministry of Defense welcome a healthy dialogue on these vital topics related to national security."
The consequences of the investigation go beyond the question of whether the US-led bombing in Iraq and Syria (as more and more representatives of the Ministry of Defense now claim) is achieving the target.
But last year's statements cast doubt on whether President Obama could rely on the Central Command to provide truthful assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis points.
Criticism of intelligence across the Islamic State echoes the controversy that took place more than a decade ago, when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker wrote a research paper claiming that President George Wocker's administration over the protest of many analysts supported a small number of troops in Iraq and did not think that the 2003 invasion would follow.
Hooker also played a key role in the protest sparked by intelligence on the Islamic State.
Last year, officials said Hooker's team concluded that despite public statements to the contrary, airstrikes on oil refineries belonging to the Islamic State did not lead to a significant deterioration in the financial situation of the terrorist group because it built temporary refineries to sell oil on the black market.
But the opening was not circulated outside the Central Command, the Times reported in September.
The then Centcom Commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, criticized last year after testimony in the Senate, which many MPs found to be an overly optimistic assessment of the war.
General Austin resigned in April and was replaced by the Central Command Gene. Joseph L. I've been ridding.
The United States wins 4 times in a row in women's field hockey, thus approaching the decisive battle with Britain
Scored once three goals in the match, which ended with a victory over Japan with a score of 6-1, Katie Bam opened the score on Thursday with the first two goals for the US team in the US women's field hockey, when the Americans defeated the team of India with a score of 3-0.
Five goals in two games should be a memorable achievement, but Bam, who is 27, says she wouldn't be sure if she'd ever do something like that.
"I won't add," she said.
I'm not really one of those people who track their goals.
Here's what she knows: the 4-0 Americans score in the Olympic tournament, and they compete for first place in their group with Britain, which remains invincible after Japan's loss with a score of 2-0 on Thursday.
The teams of Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams are claiming the quarter-finals, and the result of the game will determine who will take the first place in their group of six teams, and who - the second.
The winner will avoid meeting with a strong team of rivals from Holland, the leaders of another group, a little more until the games of the quarter-finals begin.
However, Saturday's game shows that the Americans here made a noise of their unexpected series, four years after they took the last place among the 12 teams in London.
Bam was on that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, first took a field hockey stick when she was 3 (she was 3 (she's older twin sisters played this sport in Drexel), and joined the national team at the age of 16, becoming her youngest player in history.
She missed the 2008 Olympics when she didn't qualify for the final line-up.
Then came in 2012, when everything did not work out with her and her teammates.
The following year, Coyg Parnham, an Englishman, was appointed coach, and everything began to change.
"Cultural change, psychological change, a change in physical training," Bam said.
In London, we didn't have the kind of productivity we have now.
We have completely changed our views.
On Thursday evening, Bam opened the score in the first half of the game with a throw from an uncomfortable hand for a short distance.
India approached the game without a single victory in the tournament, but the team showed itself surprisingly tough and kept the score 1-0 until the end of the third period, when B'Bam took the initiative.
She made a long pass with the ball down the left side of the field, then in a spiral went to the middle and sharply sent the ball to the goal, thereby giving the Americans an advantage of 2-0.
Melissa Gonzalez added the final goal in the middle of the fourth period.
The "dry" victory was the first in the tournament for U.S. goalkeeper Jackie Briggs, who missed one goal in each of the first three wins.
She's on a punch.
Same as B's.
"We're in a good position right now," Parnham said, but how good it depends on Saturday's game.
In the midst of the frenzy of the Olympic Games - ?dsen jumps on the trampoline
Wherever you are, no matter how long it is, it's the Olympics.
The events in Rio de Janeiro seem unchanging and inevitable, a frantic combination of competition and aspirations.
As if the Olympic flame itself is the burning torch, which is transmitted from the archer to the swimmer, to the gymnast, to the triathlete.
You can't turn on the TV, read the newspaper, or overhear your neighbors in turn in a coffee shop and not hear about Simone Byles, Katie Ledecki, or the feud between Michael Phelps and Chad de Clo.
And there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who participated in the Olympics for the first time, handsome with dimples on the cheeks, could well be among those celebrities who are shown in prime time, promoted by sponsors and life-affirming commercials, if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even a fencer.
But 28-year-old Dooley from Lake Forest in California is fighting for gold in the Olympic trampoline jumping.
The Olympic flame does not cover all events in the same way.
Further from the center, partly in the shadows, are those sports that are not generally recognized: shooting from an air pistol, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
The trass will always be with us, his long reign.
But if I am allowed to speak timidly in defense of your personal addiction, allow you to pay your attention to the modest charm of the trampoline jumps.
Although trampoline jumps have been an Olympic sport since 2000, when they debuted at the Sydney games, over the past 16 years they have received so little recognition that many people I interviewed were not aware that they were at all related to Olympic sports.
It could be regional ignorance.
Although the United States sent athletes to the competition, they never won medals in trampoline jumping, and their athletes did not reach the final until 2012.
The Chinese and Russians, as a rule, share men's awards, and the Chinese and Canadians - women's.
Dong Dong from China and Rousey McLennan of Canada will defend their London gold medals this year.
But jumping on the trampoline has the charm of an outsider, in particular because for an unenlightened ear is more associated with a circus college than with the Olympic Games.
I have to admit here that I'm not an expert, I'm not an expert, but a landed enthusiast.
They really have comic potential - this caricature flashing of endless jumps - but also the elegance of gymnastics and jumps into the water, two sports that they mostly combine.
The word "traat" comes from the Spanish word "el trampolen," meaning "spring for jumping into the water."
Applicants to win jump on a giant trampoline, taking off in the air almost 30 feet, and must perform a series of acrobatic tricks (turns, folds and flips) until the final landing on its feet.
They are evaluated by execution, complexity and "flight time," according to the official program of the Olympic Games.
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will compete in Rio.
The most common Olympic course is ahead.
Applicants on the medal should go further, faster, higher and higher in the pursuit of gold, sometimes to the finish line, and sometimes back and forth, back and forth on the field.
They strive not only to the finish line or the starting wall, but also, in sight of the cameras, to another teasing frontier: the world or the Olympic record.
This stubborn aspiration is noble, admirable, even fanatical - and it is enough to make even the viewer to see eache.
But it, in my opinion, is somewhat tired when watching the Games.
From him jumping on the trampoline give a respite.
Direction of the trampoline - up.
Moving forward is not the goal.
He or she jumps, it seems weightless, like an astronaut, flying up, then down, then effortlessly again.
And in them, of course, it is not without competition or difficulties, but throughout the program there is no mad zeal to the finish, there are no long jumps, only a wonderful, elegant disappearance of time and gravity.
This is the closest Olympic sport to Zen.
Women's qualifying competitions, and then the final will be held on Friday afternoon, broadcast at 1 p.m. Eastern European time; men's - on Saturday, also at an hour.
NBC will broadcast the final as part of the daytime program starting at 14:00 on both days.
In the midst of the Olympic madness, a calm, beautiful moment is expected, which can be easily overlooked in a common landfill.
And if the growth of consciousness can only be achieved by exposing male athletes to desired views and objectification - as, according to the Wall Street Journal, recently suggested by male gymnasts from the United States, - Dooley is only waiting for his new admired crowd of fans.
"Generation Protests" in Ethiopia, a long ago U.S. ally
The Fierce Protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators demanding political change in Ethiopia have faced a fierce opposition from the government.
Eyewitnesses say dozens of protesters were fatally injured in clashes with police.
Is Ethiopia really on the verge of splitting?
Over the past decade, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a firm ally of the West with a rapidly developing economy.
But in recent months, anti-government protests have shaken the country, spreading to an increasing number of its territories.
In the past week alone, thousands of people have taken to the streets demanding radical political change.
According to human rights defenders, the Government's response was brutal.
Eyewitnesses claimed that police officers had shot and killed dozens of unarmed demonstrators.
Videos from the protest sites, allegedly shot at the end of last year or earlier this year, show security officers beating young people with sticks when they put their hands on the wall.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights is now calling for a thorough investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country from disintegrating, and it will continue to be even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, head of the African Horn project in the international crisis group.
Ethiopia is Africa's second-centred country after Nigeria, and its stability is maintained by the West.
U.S. military and intelligence services are working closely with the Ethiopians to deal with terrorist threats in the region, especially in Somalia, and virtually no country in Africa receives such support from the West.
Ethiopia's economy is developing at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has improved significantly - there is even a new suburban train in the capital Addis Ababa.
And its streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia was hardly a model of democracy - human rights organizations constantly mention government repressions - the opposition on the territory of the state was stopped, due to the fact that dissidents were actually silenced.
Many of them were exiled, imprisoned, killed or expelled to remote deserts.
But that could change.
"If people are constantly suppressed and left no option other than to protest, a revolt will rise," said Seyum Teshome, a university lecturer in central Ethiopia.
All young people are protesting.
The generation is protesting.
Complaints are numerous, ranging from land use, to the seizure of power by the government coalition.
After widely criticizing the elections last year, the government party and its allies completely supplanted the opposition and now control 100 percent of Parliament.
At the same time, tensions along the border with Eritrea are growing; the struggle for this uncertain, controversial border claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups that have been more or less destroyed in recent years, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may try to exploit unrest and re-equip.
A number of factors explain why bitter feelings, boiling in the depths of the soul for several years, flash now.
The first, it would seem, completely harmless: smartphones.
Only in the last couple of years, a large number of Ethiopians were able to communicate on social networks, as cheap smartphones became commonplace, and the Internet service became better.
Even when the government closes access to Facebook and Twitter, as is often the case, especially during the protests, many people still find the opportunity to communicate through proxy servers that hide where they are.
Several young Ethiopians said that this is how they organized for the protests.
The second is that there is more solidarity between Oromo and Amhara, the two largest Ethiopian ethnic groups.
Oromo and Amhara are not natural allies.
Over the centuries, Amhara from the predominantly Christian highlands of Ethiopia flourished in politics and business, exploiting Oromo, many of whom are Muslims and live in lowland areas.
But it's also changing.
"We will act together under a single level," Moluta Gemechu, leader of Oromo, told Molat.
The largest protests took place in the areas of Amhara and Oromo.
Many of Amhara and Oromo feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group, which constitutes about 6 percent of the population and controls military and intelligence services, trade and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the loss of Meles Zenawi.
Meles, a former rebel leader, served as Ethiopia's prime minister for 17 years, until his death from an unknown disease in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could foresee danger.
Analysts claim that he especially skillfully recognized the first signals of discontent and used scouts to obtain data and neutralize opponents.
"The current regime lacks common sense," Abdi, an analyst at conflict situations, said.
Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desaleni, appeared out of nowhere and took the place of Meles.
Unlike Meles, who was from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam is a southerner.
Analysts say he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.
Many fear that as a result, this will lead to even more bloodshed.
Ethiopia last experienced such unrest in 2005, after thousands of people protested against what analysts said were apparently elections that the government had spurred and then forged the results.
In the ensuing repression, many Protestants were killed, albeit in smaller numbers than the last months, and this period of unrest went relatively quickly.
Development experts expressed appreciation to Ethiopia's leaders for the far-sighted infrastructure development, such as a new long-distance train and significant advances in the fight against poverty.
But it is clear that this did not stop the growth of internal dissatisfaction with the Ethiopian government.
It takes a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, the city in Amhar, attacked Tigray-owned businesses, and anti-Tyligai hate on social media is becoming comprehensive.
Analysts say the protesters are putting the United States and other Western allies in an awkward position.
The U.S. government used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned flights over neighbouring Somalia, although it recently announced it had closed the base.
On the one hand, it is clear that the West wants to support democracy, but on the other hand, it does not want its ally to lose power in an already unstable region.
"And on this stretched rope will be difficult to pass," Abdi said.
Donald Trump explains his statement that ISIS was founded by Obama, "sarcasm."
Donald J. Trump tried to cover up the last conflict that engulfed his campaign headquarters on Friday, arguing that he was joking when he said several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the Islamic State group.
The clarification raised new questions about the ability of the candidate for the post of president from the Republican party to appeal to the American people in a prudent way.
It also put his deputies, who tried to protect him during the period of unrest, in an awkward position, as they had to explain statements that he probably did not mean.
Having made this suggestion at the convention on Wednesday night, Trump strongly insisted on his approval on Thursday, repeating in an interview that he really wanted to say that President and Clinton founded ISIS.
But in a tweet early Friday morning, Trump wrote that he was just kidding.
This post was the direct opposite of the allegation made just a day earlier, when Trump said in several interviews that he was absolutely serious about his accusation.
When radio-conservative Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften the statement, reminding him that Obama wanted to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate did not take the opportunity.
The latest scandal erupted when Trump tried to reorient his campaign to the economy amid a decline in the rating.
Trump and Clinton have made competing speeches about Michigan's economy this week.
On Friday, Trump tried again to return to the topic.
Again, resorting to Twitter, he warned that Clinton's plans would lead to higher taxes, and said he found her speech boring.
Trump has previously used sarcasm as an excuse.
At the end of July, after he drew universal criticism, practically citing the idea that the Russians should hack Clinton's email, he later explained his remarks, saying, "Of course I'm joking."
This approach allows Trump to go beyond the permissible in political speech and take his words back if necessary.
"I think it's his way of testing certain messages that resonate among his fans, watch how they act, and then "explain" them in one direction or another, depending on the reaction," said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who analyzed the language of both candidates.
But I also think he's careful in his statements and knows they're vague enough to interpret them differently.
Instead of softening the statements for the broad electorate, Trump took an even more scathing tone in recent days, while his rating continues to fall.
The new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist rating, published on Friday, showed that Trump is inferior to Clinton by a large margin in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado and is on par with her in Florida.
Although Trump tends to try not to apologise for the provocative things he says, he often accuses his critics of misinterpreting his words and misunderstanding his sense of humor.
But since Trump has become the target of increased attention in the last months of the presidential campaign, his jokes have put his loyal allies in an awkward position: they have to publicly support him, no matter how provocative his statements may be.
Rudolf W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, who is one of Trump's most famous deputies, has made a serious effort to protect the candidate in an interview given by CNN on Thursday.
"I think what he's saying is an acceptable political comment," Giuliani said when asked about the credibility of Trump's assertion that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
It is true in the sense that ISIS was an almost unknown tiny organization, he called it a threat, absolutely unfair, and that's why it happened because he pulled out of Iraq.
Most of the average Republicans assure that the Obama administration, in which Clinton held the post of secretary of state, allowed ISIS to develop, because it failed to resolve the situation in the Middle East.
Before the Pennsylvania rally on Friday, Trump continued on Twitter to attack the media for eroding every word he said and bias toward him.
He mocked the "poor miserable" television experts who are trying to unravel him, and said, "They are weak!"
Some Democrats ridiculed Trump's excuses as superfluous confirmation that he's not in favor of president.
Once abominated coffee shop is back in Greenpoint.
The Verb coffee shop was shattered, taking only a cash place in Williamsberg that had no Wi-Fi, but served good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, she was pushed out of her room with a window on Bedford Avenue.
The store "Soup Sheri," which took the place of "Verb" in the summer of 2014, is engaged in the sale of soap in the form of muffins.
The locals mourned it as the last loss in the renewing city.
The artist Molly Krabap wrote on Twitter: "New York is constantly changing, I know, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel is destroyed, and Verb has now become a soap shop."
But although New York is constantly changing, it is being updated.
The Rev.'s reborn coffee shop opened in November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new Verbe has Wi-Fi and accept credit cards, but there are some of the same employees and a similar simple atmosphere.
Coffee is still good.
At the head of the new "Verba" is Sissko Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old coffee shop, which is the owner and general manager in a new place.
He started working at Verbe in 2001 and was there until the end.
When one of the clients offered to sponsor him in a new place, he said that he would be happy to go.
Rodriguez, who is 36 years old, left a lot in the same form.
"Verb" works with the same distributor of the bases and bought the same model of the coffee machine.
It even has chandeliers from the old "Verba."
But Rodriguez said he would also like to experiment.
He offered new dishes.
The menu includes sandwiches with bacon, egg and cheese, and there are toppings of capers or fried onions.
There are dishes from brown rice.
The coffee shop no longer serves beer, but now they are prepared freshly squeezed juices.
Nine months later, Rodriguez said that he drew attention to the constant flow of old regular customers.
"Many former customers were also squeezed out of Williamsberg," he said.
On one of the recent Sundays, Rebecca Oliveira was one of those clients.
Oliveira, who is 34 years old, used to live in Williamsburg and often visited Verb.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she still went in there.
After the closure of Verba, she said she stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I knew that it was the coffee and the atmosphere that impressed me in Verba," she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, although on that day instead of the usual ice-coffee, she ordered blended tea, another novelty.
Tom Rosenthal, another longtime customer, has been faithfully visiting Verb since 2003.
He went in front of the job and ordered the same thing invariably.
"At fifteen minutes, every day, as by the clock, I came, and for me my badge was prepared with butter and with all the stuffings," he said.
Rodriguez told me that he wanted to experiment and introduced new dishes on the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still makes a regular order, but someday he will change something with the help of bacon, eggs or cheese on a bangle with all the fillings.
Rodriguez said that he was not offended that the shop washed once took possession of the old place.
Moreover, the owners of "Shoupe Sheri" offered to make a special soap for "Verba," using coffee from a coffee shop prepared in a cold way, as an ingredient.
"I think we might agree to their offer," Rodriguez said.
Permanent residents of Greenpoint of Polish origin also fell in love with this coffee shop.
One of these new customers translated the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said that he plans to find a place for him in the window so that his new neighbors feel welcome.
There are other benefits for a new place.
The local point for the sale of juices plans to bottle and sell coffee prepared in a cold way.
There is a possibility that the coffee shop will join the neighboring building.
For many customers, it is enough that the new "Verb" will include their favorite dishes in the menu.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer and shared that he was killed by grief when they closed.
When the coffee shop opened in a new place, Whitt said that by entering and ordering a cup of coffee, he felt like he had returned home.
"How long I wanted to feel this fragrance," he admitted.
Depressed food of depression in "Dense meal"
In March 1933, shortly after the ascension to the presidency, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down to lunch in the Oval Office.
As a gourmet, President Roosevelt loved fashionable Fifth Avenue dishes, such as foie gras and Meriland turtle soup.
Its menu on this day was more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and dessert - pudding from prunes.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with the people who suffered," Jane Siegelman said.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, added: "It was also a message to the Americans about how to eat."
The couple living in Brooklyn Heights are food history experts.
Coke's latest book, "The Ragu in Chinese," was dedicated to Chinese cuisine in America, and Siegelman told the story of her life in a rented apartment in the Lower East Side through food in her book House 97 on Fruit Garden Street.
Their new collaboration, The Goodbike, which will be published on Tuesday by Harper, is the history of American food in the Great Depression.
Showing to some extent their own culinary solidarity, they met a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a tiny simple diner in the Flats, which has been working since 1929, the year of the Exchange crash.
Siegelman, 54, ordered cream cheese and a sandwich with pieces of olives, and Coe, 57, took a turkey, mashed potatoes and a vegetable mixture.
When the reporter ordered the meat roll, the couple considered it a suitable starting point for discussion about food in the Depression.
"The drules were in great demand," said Siegelman.
There was peanut roll, hemp roll, bean roll.
They were made from the main ingredient and cheap products that allowed the ingredient to stretch.
Imagine you've eaten as much peanuts as you need for dinner.
Coe was wrinkled.
"Perhaps he was in the stomach with a stone," he said.
In the years before the Depression, the American table, especially in the countryside, was a buffet.
Groups of women were preparing for the male workers of the farm, and the freshly baked pie was served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War. The "Dense meal" describes how the country coped with the fact that suddenly ceased to be a country of abundance.
"It was a time when food became a central, difficult topic for Americans," Coe said, explaining why he and his wife decided to write about it.
The new budget diet was the same difficult: mysterious dishes, such as rolls and casseroles, became the main food; casserole is a "beautiful way to dispose of the scraps," - said Ziegelman, - because the chefs could hide the unappetizing ingredients under a thick layer of sauce.
Fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dried fruits.
Meat, which for many years was the basis of American food, became economically distributed luxury.
People have tried strange mixtures because energy and nutritional value have become more important than taste and even culinary common sense.
While doing research for the book, which includes recipes, Siegelman prepared a dish of that era: baked onions stuffed with peanut butter.
"This addition to the dining table was not a success," Coe said.
Siegelman added, "It was very strange."
Peacock oil does not suit the baked onion.
This was typical of many homemade recipes.
Ever and never before, housekeeping specialists, including Louise Stanley, the head of the Federal Household's Bureau of Home Management from 1923 to 1943, ruled the country's eating habits.
Publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they advised women to become "budget-makers," take up a challenge and transform the burdock like rubbish spaghetti with carrots into delicious dishes.
"Dense meal" is a feast of curious historical facts.
Especially spicy are the stories about the government's reaction to starving citizens, for example, the position of President Herbert Hoover in the spirit of "let them eat pies."
Publicly extolling the simple farm cooking of the state of Iowa during his childhood, he ate like a refined millionaire, who became.
"He liked the continental cuisine, for example, fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said.
He ate almost in a gilded dining room, wearing a tuxedo.
It was fantastically detached from reality.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not advised him to set an example for his own stomach.
Eleanor Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who was not interested in taste, and this led to the fact that the White House "dused not only the dullest food in Washington, but sometimes the most disgustingly cooked."
Many of the culinary techniques of the Depression era were forgotten as soon as the country got back on its feet.
Their legacy is our constant focus on calories and nutritiousness, says Siegelman, and how science was used in cooking.
The couple say that during the writing of the book they better understood the eating habits of Siegelman - that she could not throw away food, for example.
"She was seriously afraid of the careless attitude to food," Coe said.
Siegelman recalls: "She seriously poisoned people."
There was one unpleasant case of profittrois.
When the plates in Eisenberg's were empty, he and Coe took out the dessert they made at home: the dessert of prunes that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called a musser of prunes," said Siegelman, adding that it was a common technique to give modest recipes catchy names.
There were no whipped cream, only prunes, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly immersed the spoon in a viscous, brown, sticky substance.
Surprisingly, it was not bad.
Coe asked for supplements twice.
With the voice of the confident compiler of the budget, he told his wife: "A little ruble walnuts would not interfere here."
The arrest of the defendants in the case of a mass fight at the Khovanskoye cemetery was extended until November 14
The Presnensky court left until November 14 under the arrest of the defendants in the case of a mass fight in the Khovanskoye cemetery, satisfying the relevant request of the investigation.
14 people are involved in the case as the accused.
Recall that on May 14, a mass fight of several hundred immigrants from Central Asia and the North Caucasus with weapons took place at the Khovan cemetery, which killed three people.
The former head of the cemetery Yuri Chabuev and the lawyer, co-founder of the public organization "Healthy Nation" Alexander Bocharnikov was charged with the organization of the murder.
The issue of the second indexation of pensions in 2016 can be resolved within the next two to three weeks.
This was reported on August 12 by Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation Olga Golodets during a visit to the Bryansk region.
We have specific parameters, how much it is necessary to raise the pension in order to reduce the inflation that exists in the country.
All calculations are made.
Now economists are summing up the results of the half-year, and we will complete this work in the next two to three weeks," - quotes Golodets "Interfax."
Commenting on the scheme proposed by the head of the Center for Strategic Development Alexey Kudrin to raise the retirement age for six months every year, the Deputy Prime Minister said that the Cabinet does not consider this topic.
At the end of July it became known that the Government agreed on a position on the full indexation of pension payments in 2017.
Kamensky and Grigoryan went to the final of the competition in shooting from a small-caliber rifle.
Russian athletes Sergey Kamensky and Kirill Grigoryan went to the final of the competition in shooting from a small-caliber rifle from the position of lying at the Olympic Games in Brazil.
According to TASS, Sergey Kamensky scored 629 points and took the first place - this is a new Olympic record in qualifying.
Kirill Grigoryan became the second - 628.9 was.

Turkish opposition leader Fethullah Gulen is demanding an international investigation into the circumstances of the coup attempt in Turkey.
"I demand that an independent international commission investigate the coup attempt," Gulen quoted the French newspaper Le Monde as saying.
The Turkish oppositionist also said that "if any part of the charges are confirmed, I will return to Turkey."
However, Gulen denies involvement in the coup, stressing that his organization has never claimed political power.
The court of Istanbul previously in absentia arrested the opposition Islamic preacher Fethullah Gulen.
Recall that the attempt of a military coup occurred in Turkey on the night of July 15-16.
Gilead to reimburse attorneys during dispute over hepatitis C patent with Merck
Gilead Sciences Inc is eligible to reimburse the costs of the bar services it has incurred in connection with the litigation on the issue of a patent for a hepatitis C drug with the drug manufacturer Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was exempted from $200 million for infringing two Merck patents related to Gilead's drugs, sales leaders, Sovaldi and Harvoni, after an American judge found a number of violations by Merck, including lying under oath and other unethical acts.
When tried on Thursday, U.S. Federal District Court judge Bethe Labson Freeman said that Gilead is entitled to reimbursement for the costs incurred during the dispute.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which dominates the market for a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case took place in 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other, claiming their rights to the laboratory work underlying the sofosbuvir, the active ingredient of the drug company Gilead.
U.S.-backed armed forces claim to have seized full control of Manbij from the Islamic State.
The U.S.-backed forces seized full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border, after the last remaining Islamic State militants in the city left, a group spokesman said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now clearing the city after the remaining group of militants who were hiding in the city.
They released more than 2,000 civilians held by militants, Sharfan Darwish from the Allied Military Council of Manbij told Reuters.
"The city is now completely under our control, but we are taking clean-up operations," he told Reuters.
Clinton earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 percent of the federal tax rate.
Hillary Clinton released her tax returns for 2015 on Friday that showed that the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband had $10.75 million in income this year and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.
In 2015, the Clintons received $1 million in charitable contributions, mostly to the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton received about $5.3 million in fees, and the former Secretary of State announced $3 million in revenue from the publisher Simon & Schuster for her book about her tenure in the State Department.
Potential Vice President Clinton, Senator Tim Kane of Virginia, along with his wife Anna Holton, has released tax returns for 10 years.
In 2015, they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3 percent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kane continue to set a standard for financial transparency," Clinton campaign chief counsel Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
In contrast, Donald Trump is hiding behind fake excuses and breaks his past promises to release his tax returns.
This is a common case for U.S. presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, although the law does not require them.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers called the inspection of the State Tax Service as the reason for his refusal to release their tax returns.
"Your move," Clinton's adviser to the Clinton campaign, Jan Sams, wrote on Twitter, referring to the declarations of the Democratic candidate.
On Thursday, Trump's special adviser, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to release them until the inspections were completed.
Critics of Trump, including Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican brirels, said his refusal raises questions about his condition, his charitable contributions, his business operations and other ties, including Russia.
Clinton seized on the issue and on Friday released an online video in which the main place was given to outstanding Republicans who urged Trump to publish tax reports.
On Thursday, she raised the issue during a speech about the economy in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what everyone has been doing without exception by a presidential candidate for decades: to release their tax returns," she said.
The newspaper Politico reported that Trump did not pay any or almost no taxes for two years in the 1990s, and the New York Times business columnist on Friday quoted many tax attorneys and accountants who believe that things may be going to be so far.
Federal tax rates were the subject of a dispute in the presidential election.
Clinton backed the rule, named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett, who would ensure that people who receive more than $1 million a year would pay a tax rate of at least 30 percent.
President Barack Obama also supported the proposal.
At a meeting with Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is based there, invited Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he was also under IRS check, and that Trump was "fearing" not by the tax collection agency, but of voters.
Clinton's election headquarters released tax returns until 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, in New York, paid an average federal tax rate of about 32 percent from 2007 to 2014 and an effective cumulative tax rate of about 40.5 percent.
The 2015 Clinton Declaration showed that, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income was the source of wages.
Their main investment was a low-cost index mutual fund, and the Clintons announced dividends and capital revenue of $19,000.

Condoms with chili powder and fireworks increase protection of Tanzanian elephants
Environmental protection fighters in Tanzania are using an unconventional way to prevent elephants from wandering in populated areas - throwing condoms filled with chili powder.
The method proved effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came to mind this idea a few years ago, together with the American Committee for the Conservation of Nature took over its promotion, training volunteers in the villages of northern Tanzania to use a non-violent, four-step-foot-based way to protect their homes and crops without harming animals.
Previously, many people used spears to protect themselves.
On Friday, there will be World Elephant Day dedicated to animal protection.
"Since we've invented the toolkit ... we've seen a change in attitudes within these communities, making them much more confident that they can keep elephants on their fields without harming elephants," said Honeyguide chief executive Damian Bell.
The first two steps are to ignite the torch in front of an elephant that broke the border and signaling with an horn.
If it is not possible to scare off, the so-called "cook of chili" is thrown away.
Chili powder mixed with the soil is placed with a clap in a condom, and its end is twisted, only the wick remains outside.
When igniting the condom, it bursts with a rumbling, spraying the fine dust of chili powder in the air.
One breath is usually enough to turn the elephant in the other direction.
The extreme measure is a launcher that shoots Roman candles into the air, producing a loud, bright explosion.
Thirty-two Turkish diplomats who left the country after a coup attempt in July this year have not yet returned to Turkey.
Such data was provided by Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu in an interview with local journalists.
At the first stage, we recalled 208 staff diplomats to continue their work in the center.
Of these, 32 people did not return without objective reasons and explanations," the Turkish foreign minister said.
Recall that in July in Turkey there was an attempted coup d'etat.
The authorities of the country officially announced that the coup failed, and also reported the detention of more than six thousand people, including the military ranks of the highest and middle level.
As a result of the coup attempt, 290 people were killed, according to the Turkish Foreign Ministry.
The Jewish director sharply criticized the Berlin hotel for the removal of the Israeli telephone code on the "request" of the Arabs - reported the channel RT News
The French director of Jewish origin unleashed a scandal in the media, finding that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin does not have on the list of Israeli telephone code, and employees refer to "requests" from Arab clients.
Claude Lanzman, author of the Holocaust documentary "Shaw," expressed his dissatisfaction with the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin, writing an open letter to the German media FAZ.
During his recent stay at the hotel, Lanzman tried to find Israel on the list of phone codes provided by the hotel.
The country, however, was not mentioned among the countries where you can call directly from the room.
How could it have happened that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel was excluded and eradicated?
Written by Lanzmann.
In return, Kempinski Bristol provides the opportunity to recruit Israel through its own telephone service center.
In search of an explanation, the director raised this question at the hotel reception.
The answer he received there, according to Lanzman, "shocked him."
The hotel's clerk said the measure was "a deliberate decision by the management of the Kempin hotel chain."
The reason behind this step aroused even greater anger of the director.
"Most of our guests are Arabs, and they demanded that the code of Israel be removed," said Lanzman, an employee of the hotel.
Israel's ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, called the case a "terrible shame," the Suddeutsche Zeitung newspaper reported.
We were shocked and shocked by the incident.
It's actually a terrible shame.
What happened in Germany and in this chain of hotels is even more embarrassing.
Explanations are not needed here.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions," the official said.
The case caused a considerable resonance on the Internet; people called it a scandal.
Some claimed that the Kempinski Hotel just "go on the occasion" of the alleged demands of Arab customers.
"Shame," another post said, indicating that the hotel, located on the glorious street Kurfurstendamm, is located next to the synagogue.
The hotel itself hastened to remove any charges, calling the incident "unexperienced" and "apologised" to Lanzman, reports the newspaper Der Spiegel.
"There was no direct order not to include Israel in the list of quick recruitment," said Kempinski hotel spokesman Suddeutsche Zeitung.
She adds that the code has now been added.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters of Brazilian students
Students clashed with police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday when they gathered to protest government reforms in the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters.
The riots began when police officers tried to disperse students, as a result of which the police used rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstration to express their concern about the plans.
According to the proposals of the governor of Sao Paulo, Geraldo Alckmin, almost 100 public high schools will be closed, and 300,000 students will be redistributed to save money.
Some protesters could be seen behind the graffiti walling directed against interim President Michael Temer.
This last protest came just days after protesters took to the streets en masse to support the detained President Dilma Rousseff when the country's senate voted for her impeachment.
Trade between Russia and Iran increased by 71 percent - reports RT Business portal
With the lifting of sanctions, trade between Moscow and Tehran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the previous year, according to Russian Ambassador to Iran Levan Jagaryan.
Since international sanctions against Iran have been lifted, there has been an increase in interest from Russian firms to do business in the country, the ambassador said.
Russian companies are resuming ties with Iran, and new firms are ready to gain access to the market.
Of course, further expansion of trade is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," Jagaryan said.
He noted that in the first five months of 2016, trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $ 856 million.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran grew by 91.5 percent and amounted to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent, to $158 million.
The increase in trade was achieved through the supply of machinery, ground vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
Jagaryan also predicts that a record number of Iranian tourists will visit Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran issued about 35,000 visas, mostly to tourist, to Iranian citizens.
In addition, for the first time, Iran entered the top 20 countries in terms of the number of tourists visiting Russia.
It is safe to say that last year's record for the number of Iranian tourists who visited Russia will be beaten," he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians visit Iran, which the ambassador hopes will change.
"I personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, in which the monuments of ancient Persian civilization are preserved in good condition," he said.
The state continues to tighten the nuts in the military-industrial complex.
The reason for the dismissal was the "systematic non-fulfillment" of the instructions of the general director of the concern "Almaz - Antey," "missing in work" and "loss of trust."
Gennady Bendersky was appointed the head of the NGO for the next three years.
Information about the dismissal of Neskorodov appeared only on Thursday evening and did not cause a wide resonance in the media.
How to explain such silence in the conditions of large-scale rearmament of the army?
Most likely, the Russian leadership does not want to spread any rumors or negative assumptions in a public environment.
This once again confirms that the military-industrial complex (OPC) has many problems and the state does not want to attract increased attention from society.
The removal of Neskorodov is undoubtedly an important event in terms of restoring order in the industry.
NPO "Almaz" is the main enterprise of the concern, which specializes in the production of anti-aircraft missile systems (AMS) of sea and land-based.
Currently, "Almaz" is working on the creation of the air defense system "Polyment-Redut" and "Morpheus," which are planned to be installed on new corvettes, freaks, destroyers and cruisers.
The founder of the portal Military Russia Dmitry Kornev believes that the dismissal of Neskorodov was caused by a breakdown of the deadlines for these projects.
This version is the most logical.
For example, the development of "Morfea" began in 2007, and commissioning was expected in 2013.
"Polyment-Redut" should become the main air defense system on the latest ships of the Navy.
According to the information I receive, not a single successful test has been performed in a few years of testing.
True, as far as I can tell, there is no unequivocal guilt of "Diamond," - said Kornev.
The expert fears that the delay with the commissioning may occur with the S-500 air defense system.
The pilot work on the project has not yet been completed, but during 2016 the first complexes should enter the troops.
The Ministry of Defense assures that "the work is planned and everything will be completed on time," although in 2014 the department recognized the presence of problems with the development of the S-500.
It is extremely difficult to assess the professional qualities of the Neskorodov, who led the "Almaz" since 2011.
Kornev stated that the breakdowns in the deadlines for projects can be both the reason and the reason for the dismissal.
In his opinion, in recent years it has become extremely difficult to obtain information about internal processes in the defense industry and plans of the management of enterprises.
The industry has received long-term orders for tens of billions of rubles, and a lot of money, as you know, love silence.
As a rule, the directors of defense companies leave the posts on their own, under the agreement of the parties or transferred to another job.
In this case, the suspension took place publicly, although it did not get a resonance.
This suggests that the head of "Diamond" was, perhaps, a figure of obstinate and resisted the descending "discharges."
Apparently, with such behavior, the state no longer intends to put up.
With the hands of the shareholders, it will remove those who prefer to argue with the installations of the Ministry of Defense and do not fulfill the tasks.
At the same time, the Russian leadership seeks to punish the recruited managers (machinations on the shipyard "Star").
The President pays attention to the problems of the sector personally.
Vladimir Putin heads the Military-Industrial Commission and periodically holds meetings on rearmament.
The Kremlin protects the ranks of the defense industry managers, seeking to have at hand a loyal composition of directors who will comply with the orders received from above.
This is a far-important policy, but against the background of rampant corruption and the lack of normal competition in the defense industry, the state has no other tools.
The current situation in the defense industry, of course, is not catastrophic, but the current geopolitical situation stimulates the Kremlin to put the Armed Forces in order as soon as possible.
In parallel with the "cleansing" of managers in the defense industry, the leadership of the Russian Federation is taking quite successful steps to improve the professionalism of Russian troops.
The personnel of the army acquired a new quality with the arrival of Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu.
It seems that the president has adopted the well-known saying "Want peace - prepare for war."
During the Cold War, the Soviet Union's military power and nuclear parity achieved in the 1970s led to the conclusion of the Helsinki Pact, which cemented Moscow's sphere of influence on the continent.
For all the shortcomings of the bipolar system, it worked quite effectively.
Proof of this was the absence of wars on the European continent and the relatively stable situation in the Middle East.
The triumph of the "winners" in the Cold War eventually turned into an strengthening of international terrorism.
After a series of terrorist attacks in Europe and the United States in the "civilized world," perhaps, there is not a single quiet corner left.
Despite the common misfortune, the West refuses to talk to Russia at the level of an equal partner.
In such conditions, the only allies of our country are the navy and the army.
The strengthening of military power will allow Moscow to more effectively defend national interests and reach new frontiers of world politics.
Scotsman Callum Skinner rushes on the finish line, as a result of which the British capture bicycle gold
Scotsman Callum Skinner raced for a triumph in a men's team sprint on a velodrome in Rio last night, causing the UK team trio to defend its London title in 2012.
The 23-year-old native of Glasgow was the strongest that his buddy, the Scotsman Sir Chris Hoy made his own, and the young man proudly went down in history, rushing through the finish line to snatch the victory from the team-favorite from New Zealand.
Britain claimed the right to an unexpected win four years ago, winning when Hoy declared the rights to fifth of its six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the trick, after they finished modestly sixth at the March World Track Cycling Championships in London, despite the fact that Hoe has ended his career since then.
The question between Beijing and London was the replacement of a specialist member Jamie Staff.
They did it because at the time when Hindes appeared.
Hoe's departure also created the void that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was a man who was held by British coaches, seeing the potential in the Scotch, which was now realized.
Hindes, Kenny - champions with Hoi four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in qualifying, but the standard was surpassed by New Zealand in the first round.
And the British trio won a duel for gold.
Hindes was exactly behind after his lap, but Kenny pushed the team forward, and Skinner supported.
The change of strategy was a big part of the transformation where Hindes was driving on a larger gear to slow down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to keep pace.
Hoy watched from his place as a guest expert at the BBC and caught the gaze of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they entered the pedestal.
Sunstarr 23, Glasgow, said, "This is a flattering comparison."
I'm here to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set the Olympic record in the final and won the world champions.
It was unbelievable.
There is no better way to win.
After the triumph in London in 2012 along with Kenny and Hoe, Hindes admitted intentionally fell on the track after a failed start.
He later renounced the comment, and there was no way to appeal from UK competitors.
There was no such question this time in the greatest victory.
He said, "I felt like in London, with all those British flags on the podium."
We've all been like the team in the last three months.
We lost so many world-renowned races that winning the Olympics was amazing again.
This is one event, one gold medal for the country that won seven of the 10 races in both Beijing and London.
If this is a barometer of progress made in the last five months, then the velod syndrome is waiting for another five successful days.
With the form demonstrated by Kenny, it is not beyond the opportunity to imagine how he repeats Hoe's feat by winning three Olympic gold medals in one of the Games.
This would make it possible to see how Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoya, who was also born on March 23 (this seems to be a sacred date in British sports, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgreave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) brings his score to six gold medals and one silver.
It would be like Hoi's.
The next time Kenny competes in a sprint that starts today and is played out for three days.
A 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I'm just enjoying it now.
Team competitions are always the best.
You come to win with your comrades.
It's a little lonely to win alone, to be honest.
Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he must get knighthood."
It was the only medal draw in the day, but there was the next good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Stephen Burke and Owen Dull are qualified for the fastest four-kilometer team pursuit race of four.
They finished in 3:51.943.
The world record set for winning gold in London 2012 is 3:51.659.
The first round and final (10:42 p.m.) will be held today, on the second day of the event, where Wiggins will definitely be in the spotlight.
He had a discussion with the commissioners yesterday, on the eve of the qualification race, when officials demanded that he measure his weight.
In the relevant women's event, which is reopening and ending tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rousell Sand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milgawi improved the world record by showing a time of 4:13.260.
The British team came to the fact that he relies on a powerful team of cyclists to take ownership of the average period of the Olympic Games and earn a lot of medals.
After in fact exceptional demonstrations of total superiority in Beijing and London, expectations have eased in gradual preparations for Rio.
There were dramas in the background, not the last - the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April due to accusations of sexism and harassment, and the departure of major figures such as Hoi and Victoria Pendelton.
However, based on the first-night race on the velodrome, it seems that the legendary glory of Great Britain and in reaching the top at the right time, perhaps just repeating itself.
The future of the Portland Metallurgical Plant is under threat due to the termination of the contract for electricity
The future of the Portland aluminum plant in Victoria - as well as the jobs of hundreds of workers - is threatened by the fact that the electric power company, which supplies the plant, according to one of the owners of the plant, is going to terminate the supply contract: it is planned that all supply contracts will be terminated.
The move is a consequence of a decision taken earlier this year by the Victorian government not to extend the subsidies provided to support the operation of the plant.
The 20-year fixed subsidy expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs could be at the Alcoa plant in Portland.
As many as 2,000 jobs - directly and indirectly - may be at risk as a result of any closure.
There may also be additional indirect consequences, as the metallurgical plant consumes about 10 percent of all electricity produced in Victoria.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the metallurgical plant at Point Henry, which led to the closure of the Englesey power plant last year.
Portland metallurgical plant of Alco loses money and risks closing.
These actions were the result of reflections on the future of the plant, which lasted for several years, initially due to the strong position of the Australian dollar, and later due to the price of the plant's products.
AGL, which supplies a large aluminum plant with electricity from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrob Valley, said it expects the other three owners to take steps to terminate the contract.
The controlling share of the plant belongs to the joint short-term company Alcoa and Alumina, and the Chinese company CITIC and Japanese company Marubeni Corp own smaller shares.
"AGL expects the Portland facility to continue to operate, that is, that the physical demand for electricity from the metallurgical plant will not stop," she said.
According to AGL, the contracts mentioned are the so-called "hedged contracts," which were due to enter into force in November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month period of termination, so in fact they will end in 2017.
"Accordingly, AGL still expects these contracts to bring in part of their revenue in fiscal 2017," the company said.
Any potential impact on AGL's profits since fiscal year 2018 is currently limited by forecasts for a strong futures market for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL said it had already reduced the amount of contracts in its reporting by $187 million, in view of the "imminent termination."
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate contracts "does not affect Alcoa's ability to manage a metallurgical plant or to provide electricity to the metallurgical plant."
The U.S. company said it had signed a twenty-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which was due to enter into force in November this year, but it has yet to explain why it terminated the contract.
Analysts feared the possible closure of both the Portland metallurgical plant in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the unfavorable economic situation in the industry.
Turns to analysts earlier this week, AGL Chief of Operations Steven Mikkelsen said Portland uses about 600 megawatts of energy every year and about 900 megawatts of power tomatoes.
If both of these factories leave the market, there will be a significant reduction in demand in the market [electricity].
For us, as a manufacturer, it will be bad," he said.
Not only the star of the reality show Kardashian, Kendall on the cover of the September issue of Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the Kardashian-Jenner clan Chris, appeared on the cover-up cover of the American magazine Vogue.
Kendall, the face of the Estee Lauder brand and defiled fashion weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, said the news on Instagram on Thursday.
"When I was in the room with my loved ones, I looked at this cover and wept," Kendall wrote.
The news of the cover was accompanied by a strange (or simply in the spirit of the Kardashian? family), prepared by a reality video in which the entire family of Kardashian-Jenner (debacle Rob and Caitlin, who also joined them in the universalest uncle of show business, producer of the Kardashian family of Ryan Sekrest, who also joined them in the classroom of the evening, they planned a class of the end of the evening.The prize.
This is the standard storyline of almost all episodes of children's television shows dedicated to the birthday (Sikrus utters the phrase: "You thought we forgot about you?" with the sincerity of a cartoon rabbit from the program at 8 a.m.), but Chris needed this fame in one way or another to get to other girls.
Because with this episode dedicated to the September issue of Vogue, we have undoubtedly entered a new era of Kardashian's show.
Let her older sister Kendall Kim get on the cover of Vogue earlier (she appeared on her with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September cover of the magazine is an achievement in itself.
The September issue is the best-selling release of Vogue for the year.
Thick-like a gift edition, rather than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a huge number of advertisers (according to the calculations of the portal Fashionista, 615 pages from last year's 832-page issue contained advertising).
The news of which of the stars will get on his cover is expected with such an eagerness that in the last two years, the photos of the magazine merged to the official announcement.
The previous women on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, the cover has certainly featured more "celencers that work as models" than "models that are celebrities."
The Oscar winner and Dior's face Jennifer Lawrence was featured on the cover in 2013, a year after that honor fell to Lady Gaga.
But even in the unlikely event that Jenner, which the magazine described as an "outstanding model" of his generation, falls into the first category, it's in a good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of famous people, reality show stars or modern children who know how to make a good video in Snapchat (although Jenner gets into all these categories).
They are really talented women who are successful in the entertainment industry.
For Beyonce, which appeared on last year's cover, this year was one of the most successful in his career in connection with the release of the album Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is happy with Jenner's success.
Jenner's position in the fashion world, due to her past star of the television reality show, should have always been shaky.
In June, one of the first Victoria's Secret models, Stephanie Seymour, criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them "tucks of the moment."
These moods were picked up again after the news of Jenner's appearance on the cover of Vogue.
But it makes no sense to dwell on dissatisfaction.
Kendall Jenner on the cover of Vogue's September issue.
It is a supermodel in every sense of the word.
She defils for Marc Jacobs.
She sells you a tonal cream from Estee Lauder.
She, and all her sisters, sell you their photos in their own apps, available on a paid subscription.
She sells photos of Cindy Crawford's daughter to LOVE magazine.
And in her free time, perhaps to still see her sister Courtney and her children, she participates in a reality TV show.
Public legal centres deny service to 160,000 people a year
Each year, more than 160,000 of the least protected populations are denied service in public law centres, as the sector prepares for an effect that will further cut funding to and already under-appeal activities.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly elderly, immigrants, unprotected workers, victims of violence, people unable to fight the unfair deprivation of property and so on - have already been denied, trying to get free legal aid and representation.
Public legal services, already operating outside of the opportunities, are preparing for further cuts.
From June next year, these legal centers should lose another 30 percent of federal funding.
James Farrell, director of Queensland's Public Law Centers, said that according to a recent census report by the National Association of Public Law Centers, thousands of people are already being rejected a year.
Farrell said that if the federal government's decision was not annulled, the situation would only get worse.
"Queensland's public legal centers are constantly receiving insufficient funding: this means that thousands of people are denied the vital services they need," he said.
People who go out of a violent relationship, people with unmanageable and ruinous debts, families going through divorce, unjustly dismissed workers - all these people have problems of a legal nature, and this report shows that they can't get the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 percent from June 2017, which means thousands of less protected residents of Queensland will be forced to solve complex legal issues without assistance.
We urge Justice Secretary and Senator George Brandis, Secretary of Justice and Senator George Brandis, to annull these funding cuts so that people can get the necessary assistance when they face legal problems.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise the funding for free legal aid to the national average.
Now is the time to pay attention to the needs of public legal centers and communities, their clients, and the government of Palashchuk it's time to invest in this important work.
Donald Trump's election headquarters was sued after the employee allegedly threatened with a gun
According to reports from New York, Donald Trump's campaign was sued: allegedly, the headquarters did not do anything after the report that its operating officer in North Carolina threatened the employee with a gun while driving in a jeep in February.
The incident was described in a lawsuit filed Wednesday in a state court in Charlotte, Wincent Bordini, a former software instructor at the state's election campaign.
Bordini said he had been waiting for several months for the problem to be solved internally, but he realized that "this would not happen."
Director Earl Phillip "removed the pistol, put his right-point finger on the trigger and directed the blow to the kneecap of Vincent," Bordini said.
Reflecting the local and regional administration of the election headquarters, Bordini realized that at least four more people became participants in similar incidents with Phillip, according to the appeal.
"I don't have to shoot for the guns to cause damage," Bordini said in a complaint.
The lawsuit took place just two days after the Republican presidential candidate made a furor, telling the listeners in North Carolina that the "people of the Second Amendment" - understood as gun owners and his fans - could begin to act if his rival Hillary Clinton was elected and able to elect judges.
Trump's election headquarters said the media pulled his words out of context and that he did not speak out of support for the violence.
In his complaint, Bordini is demanding compensation from the election headquarters for inquiring control, and from Phillip - for the threat of physical violence, insulting and causing moral harm.
Trump's spokesman Hope Hicks delays responding to a request to comment.
Attempts to talk to Phillip were unsuccessful.
The WCCB, a local news partner in Charlotte, said Phillip had recently left the campaign.
In response to the call to his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, no one quickly called back.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump conducted a controversial campaign.
Case: Bordini vs. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court, Supreme Court Division of Mecklenburg County District (Charlotte).
Britain should direct the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also bring rebirth and prosperity not only in our localities and in London as a whole, but throughout the country.
As I think it was Heathrow's huge advantage, just as it was with London 2012, where we made every effort to our peoples and regions benefit from the Games.
The Olympics have been of great benefit for Stratford and the East End.
And we'll do this again by creating opportunities for locals and firms near Heathrow.
For our local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new internships, 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment around the airport.
Just as it was before London 2012, there will be those who think that the task of expanding Heathrow is too large.
I have been told that Britain will never be ready for the Olympic Games, and that we will be in a predicament on the world stage.
Skeptics were wrong in 2012 and will be shown wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles that need to be overcome, but Heathrow answers any question asked about him.
Like the Heathrow Olympics, it is an infrastructure project for the majority, not just a narrow circle.
The expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, 211 billion pounds of economic growth, leaving a legacy of skills and employment around both the airport and the United Kingdom.
We have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented the 11 billion pounds of infrastructure investment program in a timely manner and within the budget, from the T5 - selected by the airport's best terminal for five consecutive years, to T2, built in the middle of the world's two bus stations.
Now they are ready to provide the third runway, confirmed by 16 billion pounds of private investment.
The 2012 London Olympics were a huge success for the UK, and I'm sure Heathrow's expansion would be.
It is time for us to channel the Olympic spirit in the right direction and expand Heathrow, ensuring our trade future and creating the legacy of the skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Dayton - Heathrow Council Chairman and Former Treasury Trade Attash
Adblock Plus, Facebook play "cat-mouse" on the issue of blocking advertising
For companies that make money on online advertising, attempts to bypass ad-block software are a cat-and-mouse game, according to one of the companies that creates such software.
On Thursday, just a couple of days after Facebook announced it was going to block ad blockers on its desktop version of the site, Adblock Plus posted a blog post that users could update their filters in the program to block ads on the social network again.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that the desktop version of the site will change the layout around its ads so that it becomes more difficult for ad blockers to recognize which parts of the page are ads.
But Adblock now says that it was able to bypass the new code.
In a blog post, Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote that "a kind of reciprocal struggle between the open source ad blocker community and those trying to get around it continues since the invention of the ad being blocked," and it is possible that Facebook will present its own solution in the near future.
The fact that the world's largest social network has entered the fight is a clear sign of how big the problem has been by ad blockers for the industry.
Worldwide, about 200 million people use ad blockers, according to last year's Pagefair and Adobe study; almost four times the number of those who used such software in 2013.
With 1.3 billion daily active users who access Facebook via mobile, mobile ads now account for 84 percent of Facebook's ad revenue.
However, the company is hunting ad blockers on the desktop version, as mobile ad blockers are ineffective in Facebook's mobile applications for the social network and Instagram, according to the representative.
But still, advertising in the desktop version is a sufficiently profitable article for Facebook to consider such a step a profitable investment.
Also on Thursday, Facebook announced that it was going to update its "advertising preference" tool to give people more control over how they target advertising.
Facebook said on Thursday that the new Adblock filters are worrying, as they will also block some non-advertising content on the site.
"This will not be a positive experience for people, and we plan to solve this problem," a Facebook spokesperson said in an official email.
Advertising blockers are a rough tool, so we instead focused on creating tools like Advertising preferences to hand over control to the people.
The woman moved on a Swiss motorway in an episode of obvious suicide
The victim was on the motorway in the middle of the night.
Police are urging witnesses after the woman moved several vehicles on the motorway early Thursday morning in a clear suicide attempt.
The incident occurred on A1 near the Morgue in the canton of Vaud immediately after midnight on Thursday.
The woman lay on the road in the dark "in a gesture of despair" and she was hit by several vehicles, police said in a statement.
Clearly trying to kill themselves, the victim, a Swiss woman at the age of 49, hit several vehicles, including a truck.
She died on the spot.
Several drivers have already been interviewed, but the identity of some has not yet been identified, police said, which is calling on them and someone else who has witnessed the incident to respond.
A criminal case was opened, a "logical" step in such a situation, said lawyer Gilles Hofstetter Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be seen whether any of the drivers involved will be charged.
Was it possible to avoid a blow?
That's what the prosecutor has to determine," said Hofstetter.
Two other similar cases in the past five years suggest that drivers will not be found to be responsible.
In each case - both of which involve a person walking in the dark on the highway - was sentenced that motorists can not expect a chance to meet a pedestrian on the middle of the night, the newspaper reports.
Last year, the officer was acquitted of causing death by negligence after she hit and killed a man lying on the A1 near Payern in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim drank and lost consciousness on the road, hearing the court.
The court found that a female police officer - who responded to an emergency call - was driving the vehicle in a way that was justified and that the presence of a person on the road was "a perfectly exceptional and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone who has information about the incident on Thursday near the Morgue should call the police at 021,644 83 46 or 021,644 44.
Climate model of NASA: Venus was once inhabited
Venus may have once been habitable, according to estimates of a new climate model by NASA.
Scientists from the Goddard Institute for the Study of the Earthrad developed a model for the study of Venus's past, using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climatologists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, with its hot anhydrous surface and an atmosphere oversaturated with carbon dioxide, could someday have conditions like the Earth's.
Scientists previously assumed that the small speed of rotation of Venus was due to its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could probably have a sparse atmosphere like the earth, and still rotate slowly.
The model also looked at the topography of early Venus.
There were probably more arid regions on the planet than on Earth, but it once had enough water and geographical variability to create conditions for life and prevent rapid evaporation.
Early Venus was also the benefit of the sun, which was 30 percent dimmer.
"According to the GISS model, Venus's slow rotation puts it on the daytime side of the sun for almost two months at one time," GISS scientist Anthony Del Henio explained in a press.
This warms the planet's surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds acting as an umbrella that protects the planet's surface from a substantial part of solar heat.
The result is average climatic temperatures, which, surprisingly, are a few degrees colder than they are on Earth today.
The model shows the history of Venus, similar to the development that previously assumed by experts in the study of planets.
Although Venus may have been habitable, it has been exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet radiation for several billion years.
Its oceans evaporated and its water vapor was burned out by ultraviolet radiation.
When its hydrogen faded, only a dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect remained - that is, Venus as we know it today.
The researchers shared the results of their new climate model of Venus in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy leaves the post of coach of the team Avalanche
Patrick Roy left the post of coach and vice-president of the hockey activities of Colorado Avalanche on Thursday, citing a lack of influence during the decision-making process in the team.
Executive Vice President / Chief Executive Officer of the Colorado team Joe Sakik confirmed the news and noted that the club will begin to look for a new coach immediately.
"Over the past three years, I have served as head coach and vice president of Colorado Avalanche hockey with energy, passion and determination," Roy said in a statement.
During the summer, I had long and diligently thinking about how I could improve this team to give it the depth it needed and raise it to a higher level.
To achieve this goal, the vision of a coach and vice president of hockey activities must perfectly coincide with the vision of the organization.
It should also have the right to vote when making decisions affecting the work of the team.
These conditions have not been met at the moment.
Sakik, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick informed me of his decision today," Sakik said.
We appreciate everything he has done for our organization and wish him success in the future.
Roy won the Jack Adams Award as the best league coach during his first season with Avalanche in 2013-2014.
He led the club to 112 points and a victory in the Central Division, but Colorado was defeated by Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs and lost the playoffs for the last two years.
The Avalanche team announced a score of 39-39-4 in the 2015-2016 season and fell five points behind the Wild team in the fight for the second preferential ticket to participate in the Western Conference.
The goalkeeper from the Hall of Fame, Roy won four Stanley Cups - two each with Montreal Canadiens and with Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers resume negotiations and suspend strike
Workers" strikes on the salaries of oil workers in the North Sea have been suspended, and all parties to the discussion are embarking on a new round of negotiations, the leading representatives of the parties said.
Strikes against the oilfield service company Wood Group were sporadicly organized on platforms in the North Sea run by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group and Unite and RMT unions can confirm that we have agreed to resume the negotiation process to resolve current disputes," the statement said.
We will hold several full-day meetings for the next few weeks, starting at the beginning of next week to look at the problems with a fresh look.
The unions reported that their recent stock, which they said was the first in more than 25 years, was directed against potential pay cuts up to 30 percent.
Wood Group this year cut rates paid to contract employees working in the North Sea by about 9 percent due to negative market tensions.
The company's rate cuts came after a 10 percent cut in rates for contract employees working on the shore in 2014.
According to the company, additional cuts will give it the space it needs to overcome the market decline.
Shell, for its part, has reduced thousands of people and announced plans to stop oil and gas activities in countries by up to 10, as it streamlines its activities due to its mega-merging with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to lower prices for untreated oil: the economic situation has deteriorated due to the decision to leave the European Union, adopted by the UK in June.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with trade union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labor conflicts that have emerged in the North Sea in our era.
The North Sea, he said, is vital for the regional economy.
"In the North Sea, and across the country, we need an economy that works for the majority, not just for some," he said.
Less than $1.4 billion in North Sea projects is expected in 2016, in contrast to an average of about $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measures the speed of star rotation in the Pleiades cluster
The last mission of the Kepler Space Telescope helped astronomers to collect the most complete catalog of the rotational speeds of stars included in the Pleiades cluster.
The new data help astronomers understand why the stars in the cluster rotate at different speeds, and how the rotation periods are correlated with the formation of planets.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of the star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Louise Riball, a researcher at the Center for Infrared Processing and Analysis at the California Institute of Technology.
The Pleiades is found 445 light-years from Earth.
Many stars in the cluster are now only reaching maturity; they were born about 125 million years ago.
They rotate as fast as they will never be.
At their peak rotation speeds, these adult-growing stars eject large amounts of stellar wind.
Traveling through the magnetic fields of stars, these winds exert a inhibitory action on the stars.
As the stars age, its speed of rotation begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotation speed of each star, tracking the time between the appearance of recognizable stellar spots, such as sunspots.
The newest velocity catalog suggests that more massive stars orbit more slowly than less massive stars.
Riball compares the stars with dancers: larger make pirouettes more slowly than smaller ones.
"In the "ballet" of the Pleiades, we see that those that rotate slowly are usually more massive, whereas those that rotate faster usually refer to very light stars," Riball said.
Since the Plelyad cluster is so close, it serves as an ideal space laboratory to match the properties of stars with rotational speeds.
"The star cluster of the Pleiades provides a starting point for theoretical models of rotation of stars, both younger and older," Riball said.
We still want to learn a lot about how, where and why stars slow down the speed of their rotation and hang their "dance shoes" on the nail, figuratively speaking.
Riball and her colleagues detailed their latest analysis of the velocities of the Pleiades in three new articles, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
The investigation, related to the activities of a group of Ukrainian saboteurs detained in Crimea, are being conducted by two departments, writes "Kommersant."
The FSB collects evidence of the involvement of detainees in the preparation of sabotage in the Crimea.
As previously reported, a confession was given by a resident of the Ukrainian city of Energodar Yevgeny Panov, who agreed to cooperate with the investigation.
According to him, as objects for sabotage, he considered the chemical plant "Titan" in Armenian, the oil depot in Feodosia, the Kerch ferry, the gas pipeline, as well as one of the military airfields.
Law enforcement officers believe that not all accomplices of the saboteurs were detained.
This, in particular, became the basis for the arrest of suspects in the Kiev district court of Simferopol, the publication notes.
The head coach of the Russian national football team was Stanislav Cherchesov
At the meeting of the Executive Committee of the Russian Football Union, a decision was made to appoint Stanislav Cherchesov to the post of head coach of the Russian national football team.
The contract with him will be designed for two years - until the end of the 2018 World Cup.
On August 11, the Executive Committee of the RFU appointed Stanislav Cherchesov to the post of head coach of the Russian national football team.
This is a well-known footballer who previously played in the Moscow "Spartak" in the position of goalkeeper, as well as a coach with solid experience, who was the mentor of such Russian teams as the same "Spartak," "Pearl-Sochi," "Terek," "Amkar," "Dynamo," as well as the Warsaw "Legia," which became the winner of the national championship and the country's cup.
It is reported that the contract with Cherchesov will be signed in the near future and is designed for two years.
Thus, it is his duty to prepare the national team for the 2018 World Championship.
It is known that his coaching staff will include Miroslav Romashchenko, Gintaras Stauche, Vladimir Pannikov.
There is information according to which the salary of the entire coaching staff will be 2.6 billion euros a year.
According to media reports, the leadership of the RFU set a goal for Stanislav Cherchesov to bring the Russian team to the semi-finals and win medals.
As stated by the coach, as a priority task, he considers the creation of a competitive environment in the team and is going to give players the opportunity to prove themselves.
Also, according to Cherchesov, he is glad that the choice fell on him.
The first match under the leadership of Cherchesov, the Russian team will hold on August 31 in Antalya - it will be a friendly meeting with the Turkish team.
Earlier, the post of head coach of the Russian national football team was occupied by Leonid Slutsky, who combined him with coaching in the club CSKA.
He announced his resignation after the failed performance of the national team of Russia at the Euro 2016 in France.
At the same time, he took responsibility for the poor result of the team on himself.
Crushed between Angola and South Africa, Namibia suffered greatly during the long struggle against apartheid.
However, since independence from South Africa in 1990, this country with a population of 2.4 million has made tremendous strides, especially in the past few years.
The main reason for Namibia's success is that the Government pays great attention to education.
While people in developed countries take for granted free primary and secondary education, in many poor countries in secondary and even primary schools require tuition fees.
Moreover, governments are often advised to provide tuition fees for "costing."
In Namibia, however, primary schooling is free.
Moreover, secondary education has also become free of charge since 2015.
The authorities are also actively working in other important areas.
Efforts to eradicate malaria have reduced the number of annual cases by 97 per cent in the last 10 years.
Contrary to the international trend of inequality, it is declining in Namibia.
Compared to 1993, the Gini ratio, which is the standard indicator of income distribution inequality, has fallen by 15 points.
Then, 23 years ago, this figure was one of the highest in the world.
The poverty rate fell from 69% in 1993 to less than 30%.
Numbers of people living in extreme poverty (less than $1.90 a day) also declined, from nearly 53 percent to less than 23 percent.
Namibia also has the highest rating of free speech in Africa, according to Reporters Without Borders.
The country is far ahead of the United States and other rich states.
In addition, the country has a favorable rating - one of the highest in Africa - in the "Corruption Perceptions Index," which is made up of human rights defenders from Transparency International.
Even now that commodity prices are falling, Namibia manages to maintain high growth.
At the same time, the debt-to-GDP ratio is about 25%, which is less than 1/3 of the level of debt in the United States and most European countries.
Of course, Namibia has some problems.
The unemployment rate, at least on traditional valuation methods, remains high enough - almost 28%.
And, like other countries in the region, Namibia has a high incidence of HIV/AIDS - almost 17 per cent of the population is infected.
According to the World Bank, Namibia is among the above-average income countries, but the authorities insist that their state is actually a developing country.
Namibia certainly faces some of the difficulties inherent in poorly developed economies.
The state has to develop a very large and arid country with a small population.
On the territory of the country in the deserts are inhabited by isolated nomadic tribes of hunter-gatherers, which in one way or another must be integrated into modern society, without losing their identity.
The integration of the people who a quarter of a century ago were on the periphery of the world economy is not an easy task for any country.
For Namibia, this is even more difficult: just like any other country in the world, it is facing the effects of climate change.
However, Namibia did not think to put its hands down, the country is solving the problems facing it.
Almost immediately after independence, the authorities engaged in the creation of a diversified economy and a cohesive society.
It is noteworthy that competing political factions have come together to work for the common good.
Indeed, Namibia provides cheap medical care not only to its own citizens, but also to its neighbors.
About 15-20% of visitors to medical institutions in northern Namibia are Angolan citizens.
No one in Namibia is talking about building a wall that would separate the country from poor and corrupt neighbors.
The Namibians realized that neighbors were not chosen, and therefore decided not to conflict with them, but to cooperate - to share scarce water resources, to participate in regional medical projects, to encourage investment and exchange of students.
In addition, the Namibian government rightly reasoned that rich natural resources could easily become a curse, contributing to the enrichment of the few at the expense of many.
The authorities understand that the revenues from the natural resources of Namibia need to be invested in infrastructure and production facilities.
They are also aware that it would be irresponsible not to seek maximum profit from the sale of the country's resources, and are revising investment laws and production contracts to make sure that is the case.
Transparency is crucial for this process, so strong government support for freedom of speech is so important.
As the head of state Hage Geingob noted, the media often say what he does not like.
But after the struggle for freedom from apartheid in South Africa, Namibia must protect the freedoms they have been obtained, the president says.
Not all of Namibia's key resources are exhausted.
Some - such as fisheries - are renewable, and the government is making every effort to preserve and strengthen them.
Every year, more than a million foreign tourists visit the country.
Namibia shows that even those countries that begin with serious flaws - racism, colonial system, inequality and low levels of development - can embark on a path to general prosperity.
Its achievement deserves international recognition and imitation.
Many have heard about the "Gold of Varna" - the oldest golden objects created by man (4600 - 4200 BC).
Perhaps it was the loudest archaeological sensation of the 1970s: in Bulgaria, during the excavations of the Varna necropolis, a fantastic number of gold artifacts were found - more than three thousand with a total weight of 6 kilograms.
Only one burial, known as "the grave number 43," was extracted 990 gold objects with a total weight of more than 1.5 kg.
However, the official status of the world's oldest gold may soon go to a non-descript bead found by archaeologists in July this year.
And again in Bulgaria - in a prehistoric settlement known as Tell Yunacite.
Unlike Varna, the port city, Tel Yunacitet is located far from the sea, near the village of Yunatite of the Pazardzhik district.
The bead is a golden strip rolled in a ring.
Yavor Boyajiev, the head of the Tulle Yunacit excavations, dated the find 4600 BC and stated that she was older than Varna's gold for at least 200 years.
The treasures of Varna, we recall, date from about the same period, 4600-4200 years. before our era.
Technologies that allow you to date the metal with impeccable accuracy does not exist at present.
What is the confidence in which gold is older?
Obviously, Professor Boyadzhiev knows more than he told Reuters: "I am quite sure that Yunatit's gold is older than Varna's gold."
This is a find of extreme importance: it's a tiny object in sight, but it's big enough to take a proper place in history.
In an interview with Reuters, Boyadzhiev said that in the near future scientists will analyze the composition of the metal, as well as again and more thoroughly study the archaeological layer where the gold artifact was found.
This will help to date the bead with the highest possible accuracy.
The location explains a lot of things.
Tel Yunacite is a famous settlement, even if you have never heard of it.
Currently, Tell Yunacite is considered the oldest "city" of Europe.
Tellle was founded by the descendants of people who migrated to Europe from Anatolia (modern Turkey) in the 7th millennium BC.
Over the following centuries, the processing of metals, from the development of the first metallurgical skills to the creation of a full-fledged industry, developed rapidly in this region.
In the national historiography for this archaeological community there is a special name: the Balkano-Karpatik metallurgical province.
In the 5 millennium BC, urban-type settlements began to arise around the centers of metalworking.
They are now known as the oldest cities in Europe.
Of these, Tell Yunacite is perhaps the oldest, as artifacts 4900 BC were found here.
I would call Tell Yunakit a prototype of a modern city, although it is a very ancient settlement, even compared to Mesopotamia.
"This place is a thousand years older than Sumer," Boyajiev says, referring to the generally accepted view that urban culture originated in the south of Mesopotamia - modern Iraq.
There were the first cities in the usual sense of the word.
The excavations of Telle Yunakte have been underway since 1976.
During this time, archaeologists have excavated almost 12 hectares, which is about a third of the estimated total area of the settlement.
The remains of the fortress wall were found, which once reached three meters in height.
Little has survived from houses and workshops, but archaeologists clearly distinguish the streets, public buildings, dense buildings, "business center" and residential areas.
The tel of Yunakite is often called the "bird city": dozens of clay figurines of birds were found here.
All the birds are depicted at rest, hence it was suggested that they were not decorative objects, but an object of local cult.
The "bird's city" was destroyed around 4100 BC - arguably Indo-European tribes that came from the northeast.
The nomads had no cities, but there were horses and weapons.
The three-meter fortress walls did not stop them.
Archaeologists have found obvious signs of a brutal massacre: inside the houses were found the remains of old people, women and children with traces of wounds inflicted by axes.
New findings and new facts appear annually, changing the usual ideas about the ancient history of mankind.
Bulgarian archaeologists are increasingly talking not about individual cultures, but about the "lost" first civilization of Europe, which originated in the Balkans.
A powerful stimulus in the search for this civilization was the "Gold of Varna," found relatively recently, in 1972.
It is logical that Varna's gold luxury had to be preceded by something - something like a tiny golden bead created in Telela Yunacite.
In Porsche artificially aged the model 911 Targa
Officially, it is announced that the 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design is carried out manually by specialists of the division who work with production machines.
"Retro-on" is, for example, in the special color of the body Etna Blue, which was developed in 1960 for the Porsche 356B - this color is painted even the model logo.
In addition, the targa received branded white graphics along the sides and special 20-inch wheels RS Spyder, as well as some body decoration details painted in "white-gold metallic."
In the interior, retro-winter is noticeably smaller: it is different, by and large, gray-shiny gamut of design, new chairs with extended ranges of electrical adjustments and decorated with black anodized steel thresholds with the logo of the unit.
In addition, when buying a special version, each buyer will receive a car case as a gift and a richly finished album with photos of the production process.
The power plant Porsche Exclusive specialists did not touch: the retro-targa according to the characteristics quite coincides with the serial.
It is equipped with a six-cylinder engine with a turbocharged volume of 3.0 liters, developing 420 hp. and 500 Nm.
The most dynamic version of the 911 Targa 4S can accelerate to 100 km / h in 4 seconds.
The Porsche 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design will be released in a limited edition, but neither its volume nor the cost of each particular sports car is reported.
Facebook and ad blockers unleashed an "arms race"
The recent introduction of Facebook technology, which prevented the concealment of advertising on the pages of the social network, provoked developers of solutions to block advertising to retaliatory actions.
AdBlock Plus released an "anti-djourney," but Facebook plans to make it useless soon.
So AdBlock Plus has advertised its new technology, which is likely to remain effective for a short time.
Representatives of the social network noted that, in an effort to deceive the new technology of "unlockable" advertising, the solution from AdBlock Plus along with commercial ads blocks many ordinary posts from friends or pages.
Facebook regretted AdBlock Plus's policy and promised to solve the problem soon.
According to a source among the developers of the social network, TechCrunch, the code that makes AdBlock Plus useless on the desktop Facebook website will be ready in the next few hours.
Thus, the social network and blockers unleashed a kind of "arms race," trying to beat each other, the affected party were users who missed interesting records from friends or saw advertising where they were not used to seeing it.
The ethical aspects of blocking ads have recently sparked heated controversy.
In Murmansk, the rapist will appear before the court - Evening Murmansk.
His case has already been completed to investigate in the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation for the Murmansk region.
The indictment of a 54-year-old man is very serious - the commission of sexual violence.
The investigation found that at the end of November 2015, the accused in the area of Pavlova Street in Murmansk committed sexual acts with the use of violence against a 20-year-old girl.
The sanction of this article provides for a maximum penalty of imprisonment for up to six years.
Dongfeng will bring to Russia crossover Fengguang 370 and pickup truck Rich New - website Behind the wheel www.zr.ru
Dongfeng Fengguang 370 is a representative of the popularity of the car class in China, combining the advantages of a minivan and a crossover.
Another announced Russian premiere is the Rich New pickup truck.
Many Western firms of the Moscow International Motor Show this year decided to ignore, so the void of the exhibition halls "Crocus Expo" will be filled by Chinese firms.
In particular, the Dongfeng Motor Corporation will perform a powerful front, which has great views to the Russian market and intends to offer a number of interesting new products to our motorists in the near future.
One of them will be the crosswig Dongfeng Fengguang 370, which went on sale in China this spring at a price of 55,900 yuan (a little less than 550 thousand. The rub. on the current course).
It is unlikely that the Russians are shining such a price tag, and the question of deliveries to our country is still under discussion.
In China, by the way, Fengguang 370 at the end of June sales managed to reach the 11th place in the list of the best-selling minivans, although due to the great ground clearance (175 mm) and protective plastic kit on the lower perimeter of the body, it can be easily listed as crossovers.
The crossween is built on the front-wheel drive platform of the younger model Fengguang 360, the 370th has the same wheelbase in 2725 mm, but the body is slightly longer (4565 mm vs. 4510 mm), the design is more solid, and the equipment is richer.
The salon is decorated with wooden bars, but the large vertical touch screen "like Tesla" on the center console was only on the early exhibition copies of the crossween, and the cars with "music" easier were on sale.
Five of the seven seats are easily folded, forming a smooth loading pad with a length of 1650 mm, the maximum volume of the trunk is 1500 liters.
The engine for the Fengguang 370 provides only one - 1.5-liter gasoline "atmospheric" with a capacity of 115 hp, docked with a 5-speed manual transmission.
The manufacturer modestly keeps silent about the dynamic qualities of the car, but promises the gentle budget of the owner's appetite at the level of 6.7 l / 100 km.
Pickup Rich New is a well-known Nissan NP300 Navara to the Russians before the last generation, but with a slightly ennobled Chinese stylists design.
Despite the obsolete design, this model is still in stable demand among the Chinese consumer as a reliable and unpretentious "workhorse."
At a similar price, Rich New will certainly interest the Russians, because modern Japanese pickup trucks have become exorbitantly expensive.
Rich New is equipped with two engines to choose from: petrol 2.4 l (137 hp) or turbodiesel 2.5 l (116 hp).
The gearbox - only mechanics, the drive - on the rear wheels, but there are modifications and with a rigidly connected "front."
Will be at the stand of Dongfeng and the new flagship sedan A9, its Russian Prime Minister, the representative office of the Chinese company announced in June.
Minvan-like crossovers in the Chinese market is becoming more and more, one of the latest innovations - Cowin V3 and SWM X7.
Currently, the Russian Dongfeng line consists of two models: the S30 sedan and the H30 cross hatchback.
For seven months of this year, the dealers of the Chinese company sold 696 cars in our country.
Notifications for the transport tax will cease to be sent by mail - website Behind the wheel www.zr.ru
The tax inspectorate has changed the procedure for sending notifications about property taxes.
All Russian car owners are accustomed to the scheme that has not changed for years: in the summer and autumn, they receive mail receipts for the payment of transport tax for the previous year.
However, many will not wait for them this year.
The fact is that the tax inspectorate without too much noise changed the procedure for notifying citizens.
Those who are registered in the "Personal Cabinet of the taxpayer" on the official website of the department nalog.ru, the notifications will be submitted in electronic form.
The inspection automatically considered such Russians online users and erased them from the standard, "paper" mailing.
The innovation will affect all owners of vehicles and real estate.
All others will still receive the usual letters.
However, the owners of the account on the site also have the opportunity to return to the old scheme.
To do this, they will have to visit the department of the tax service during August and write a statement.
On the one hand, the new order is more modern and more convenient.
The notification will appear in the "personal office" immediately after the preparation, while the letter will go a few days and may get lost.
In addition, the number of users of the Internet service of the tax inspectorate exceeded 18 million people, which will allow the department to seriously save on mailing.
On the other hand, the modest news on the inspection website is clearly not enough to inform citizens about the changed order.
Some could have registered in a "personal office" to get a one-time service and have long forgotten about it.
These people will not wait for the notifications by mail and, without knowing it, will fall into the category of defaulters with all the ensuing consequences.
Access to the "Personal Cabinet of the taxpayer" is carried out in three ways: through the account of the portal gosuslugi.ru, using an electronic signature or entering the login and password specified in the registration card.
The latter can be obtained personally at any department of the tax inspectorate (regardless of the place of registration).
We remind you that this year the transport tax must be paid before December 1.
The notifications began in July.
Tuning Mercedes-Benz G-class, in which improvements are aimed at achieving a very high impact, is a thing in itself.
But the controversial concept did not embarrass the masters of the company G-Power, who took up the modification of the sports version of the Mercedes-AMG G 63.
The G-Power is known for its addiction to BMW cars, but nothing human to its masters are alien.
Indeed, why not improve the G 63 - 571-horsepower flying sledgehammer with tank aerodynamics and overclocking to a hundred for 5.4 s?
Pumping the "muscles" of the crazy "helic," the masters took advantage of the 5.5-liter supercharged "eight."
But the dynamics of the acceleration to a hundred improved by indistinguishable 0.1 s, and now the flying "brick" is capable of a breakthrough for 5.3 s.
However, accelerations from the average speeds are probably given to him noticeably better.
The speed ceiling is frightening: if the standard G 63 is faster than 210 km / h does not drive, then the tuning SUV with a deactivated electronic "collar" is able to squeeze 250 km / h.
Outside the car is almost indistinguishable from its factory source, with the exception of other wheels - 23-inch Hurricane RR with a dimension of 305/35 ZR 23.
The Mercedes-Maybach suite announced an astounding 6 m-long conceptual coupe, which will be presented as part of the Pebble Beach Elegance Competition.

In the coming years, at least four environmentally friendly novelties are expected to appear.
