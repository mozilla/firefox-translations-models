Republican Strategy for Re-election of Obama
Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to combat election fraud.
However, the Brennan Center is considered the latter a myth, arguing that cases of falsifications in elections in the United States are more rare than deaths from a lightning strike.
In addition, Republican lawyers counted only 300 cases of electoral falsifications in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new trends will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, such actions partially discredit the system of American democracy.
Unlike Canada, the U.S. states are responsible for organizing the U.S. federal election.
That is why most state governments have enacted laws that complicate the registration or voting process since 2009.
This phenomenon gained a new scale after the November 2010 elections, which brought Republicans 675 new seats in 26 states.
As a result, in 2011 alone, 180 bills were passed restricting the right to vote in 41 states.
The new election laws require the voter to present a photo of an identity card and proof of American citizenship.
In addition, these laws reduce the period of early voting, abolish the right to register the voter on the day of the will and take away the right to vote from citizens who have a criminal record.
Until the 2006 election, no U.S. staff required voters to present a photo of an identity card.
Indiana was the first state to introduce such a requirement.
The U.S. Supreme Court confirmed in 2008 the constitutionality of the Indiana law.
The Republican authorities rushed to extend this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they have initiated bills requiring voters to present photo cards in 34 states.
It is important to note that unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have such a universal identity card as a health insurance card.
Indeed, 11% of U.S. citizens, that is, 21 million people who have reached the age required to vote, do not have an identity card with a photo issued by the government body of their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such a document.
At the same time, the cost of obtaining the required identity card often exceeds a hundred dollars.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people.
In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people earning less than $35,000, 18% of citizens over the age of 65 and 20% of voters between the ages of 18 and 29 do not have the required photo ID.
But that's not all.
Students - voters who are considered to vote for Democratic candidates are not allowed in several states to use a photo ID issued by their school.
But the same states allow members of fishing and hunting clubs, who vote mainly for Republicans, to use the certification issued by these clubs to vote.
Until 2004, no state required evidence of U.S. nationality for voting.
For the first time, such a requirement was introduced in Arizona.
Since 2011, more than a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove that they are U.S. citizens.
These measures are obviously intended to restrict the vote of Latin Americans.
It is believed that two-thirds of Latin American voters vote in favor of the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican lawmakers initiated in 2011 laws abolishing voter registration on voting day in eight states.
They also restricted the right of individuals or groups to provide assistance to those who wish to register.
This restriction did not pass without consequences.
For example, during the 2004 elections, the voter registration campaign helped to list some 10 million citizens.
At the same time, the measures taken since 2009 have resulted in a 17 per cent drop in the level of registration of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers have passed laws in five other states aimed at reducing the period of early voting.
For example, during the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of voters who voted early were African American, although the latter accounted for only 13% of the total number of voters in the state.
The same thing happened to people from Latin America.
Representing only 11% of voters, they accounted for 24% of citizens who voted early.
Unlike whites, which, forming 76% of voters, among those who voted on an early one was only 46%.
Of course, Democratic lawmakers and their supporters are actively opposed to passing laws restricting voter registration.
Several draft laws were vetoed by the Democratic governors.
The most controversial laws were suspended during the intervention of the United States Attorney General.
This has partially limited the negative effects.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have passed laws requiring a photo identification.
However, the new rules that have come into effect will certainly make it difficult to implement the right to suffrage in the 2012 elections.
Democratic critics condemn the bias of the laws that were passed, seeing them as an obvious focus on the impact of the 2012 election in key states.
A 2011 report by the Brennan Center shows that the states that have passed these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes required by the Electoral College to win the presidential election.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes at the electoral system level will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential election.
Only one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, such actions partially discredit the system of American democracy.
Screening of prostate cancer: to take a test or not?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes gives erroneous results, pseudogenergic, and sometimes false-positive, which lead to useless medical intervention.
For men, and so reluctant to undergo a medical examination, have something to doubt even more.
To pass the test or not?
We asked the opinion of two experts.
Studies conducted in the United States have seen numerous cases of infection among the groups of the investigated, so the data obtained are difficult to interpret and it is difficult to make any clear recommendations.
Another study, this time European, found different mortality rates in those patients who underwent screening and those who did not.
This study also found, after a 12-year follow-up, that the likelihood of metastases 30-40% higher in those who did not undergo screening.
Therefore, I would recommend taking the test starting at the age of 50, or with 40, if one of the direct relatives had prostate cancer.
Men of African American descent are also at increased risk.
The key is to make the right decision once the cancer is detected.
Cancer can be both aggressive and sluggish.
The patient needs to clarify the degree of risk of his cancer, offering him possible options, without the mandatory treatment of prostate cancer, which does not pose a danger to life in the long term, but making choices, in these cases, in favor of active monitoring of the disease.
To date, many men who have cancer will not be treated, as their cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a threat to life.
We will offer them active surveillance, and if the disease begins to progress, we will begin treatment.
Increasingly, we are accurately determining the criteria for deciding who should or should not undergo treatment.
So I would recommend that you take the test.
But it's also important to consult your doctor to determine whether or not you need to take this test.
In cooperation with the International Urology Association, Movember has created a tool to evaluate everything pros and against the PSA test.

To prevent the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of research, adherence to a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of the disease.
It is believed that if all people ate well and moved enough, 30% of cases of rako could be prevented.
"If no one else smoked, that figure would have risen to at least 50%," said Andre Beaulie, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Association.
However, it is estimated that 10% of cancers are caused by heredity.
Several types of cancer remain completely inexplicable.
For the Canadian Cancer Association, smoking control remains a priority despite the reduction in the number of smokers.
Smoking is associated with 85% of cases of lung cancer.
And it is a risk factor for many others.
It causes enormous harm to human health.
"Even there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec today," said Andre Beaule, a spokeswoman for Quebec.
An encouraging fact: 10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is reduced by half.
Weight Weight
According to the CAR, overweight and obesity also contribute to the onset of the disease.
They increase the risk of breast, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
"Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer," the association added.
Food Meat
The association also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In too much, it increases the risk of colon cancer.
Sausage products should also be avoided.
Preservation of meat by smoking, drying or drying, can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"The latter can harm the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer," - explained in the Association.
The Vitamines
In recent years, many scientists have been studying the effects of vitamin supplements on cancer.
But at the moment, the results of these studies can not be called unambiguous.
According to SCC, vitamin E studies produce conflicting results.
If one of them showed a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, the other gave the opposite result.
In assessing the impact on vitamin D cancer, it is also not clear.
However, Mr. Pale emphasizes that it is important to discuss your anxiety and family history.
"The analysis does not lead to cancer."
The Higgs Boson in Detail
Last summer, the report that the scientists may have been able to find the Higgs boson, caused a real hype - and not without reason.
It is believed that this boson explains the mass of all the particles in the universe, not much less.
In addition, this is the last particle whose existence was predicted within the Standard Model - our best model, or in any case, "the least of the imperfect" description of the nature and behavior of matter - but which has not been discovered before.
But physicists are not yet fully sure that we are talking about the Higgs boson.
We know, without a shadow of a doubt, that we are dealing with a really new particle and that it strongly resembles the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, the new data presented this week at one major physical congress in Kyoto seem to confirm this, although some data still lacks certainty.
Let's imagine that we are talking about the Higgs boson, because the chances of a mistake seem minimal, and we'll see what that means.
There is, in this world, one law is absolutely inevitable, saying that two things cannot be in the same place at the same time.
There is no way to bypass this rule, don't even try too hard, otherwise you hurt yourself.
But although the physics of elementary particles is a rather strange world, it turns out that it also has one law of this nature: the principle of Pauli's exclusion, which postulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same "quantum state" - this "state" is, in general terms, in some of their characteristics.
On this basis, physicists divide particles into two categories.
In one corner, we find decent citizens, called fermions, who reasonably obey the Pauli principle.
In the other, bosons, a heinous gang of anarchists who have no respect for anything - at least for this principle, which means that they can be calmed down in the same place at the same time.
According to the website (by the way, absolutely extraordinary) Particle Adventure of the Berkeley Laboratory, these bosons are divided, in turn, into two groups: mesons, which we will not talk about here, and "particles of power," through which the main forces of nature are spread and to which in some ways the Higgs boson is spread.
These very bosons, it should be emphasized, not all such exotic creatures as one might think.
In fact, if you manage to read this chronicle, it is thanks to one incredibly banal boson: a photon, or "light particle," which is the "courier" of electromagnetic force.
In fact, when one particle having an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it "disrupts" the electromagnetic field in this particular place, roughly like a stone thrown into the pond.
From this "violation" is born an electromagnetic wave (light, or infrared radiation, or ultraviolet light, etc. d.), and this wave is nothing but a photon - and, therefore, one of the bosons of "power carriers."
A more stable field
The same thing is happening with the Higgs boson, with the only difference that in order for this boson to appear, another field, the Higgs field, must be "violated."
However, the Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; in order to excite it, it is necessary to achieve very, very high energies, as if we were talking about a frozen pond, the surface of which could shake only a very large stone.
That's why a huge particle accelerator is needed, like the one that is operated at CERN - the Large Hadron Collider, which is a ring with a diameter of 27 km! to achieve such huge energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is also useful for explaining the ratio between the Higgs boson and mass.
In fact, not all particles and not all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, interact, others - no: a sheet of paper, for example, will never stay on the refrigerator.
Similarly, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that interact have mass, while others (like a photon, by the way) do not have it.
So, what "can bring" all these studies, asks Ms. Plamonddon?
In science, they are used to test the correctness of the Standard Model (SM), and it also allows physicists to find a discrepancy between observations and SM predictions.
In addition, some of them are eager to find such a discrepancy, that such a discrepancy is revealed. To. The slightest discrepancy can open the door to "new physics" and shut up some of the Model holes.
The latter, I must say, still has significant flaws, without offering any explanation for gravity (Oh!) or for dark matter, which forms about 80% of the universe (ch-ch!).
But so far in CERN have not found such discrepancies.
The consequences
It is more difficult to predict the average person's daily life, but it would be a mistake to assume that it is not.
Look: in the early 60s, the pioneers of laser research in Bell's laboratories could not even have imagined what revolution their work would cause.
They foresaw their applications in science, but nothing more.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Labs, where a laser was invented in 1960, and which itself developed the first continuous laser (previously pulsed) in 1962, said that the laser was originally considered rather as a "laboratory gadget."
Let's get it...
And in addition, the application can be found for the tools that accompany the study.
For example, the same Williard Boyle, during his optical research in 1969, developed a small light sensor.
This sensor, although it was not its original purpose, now serves as an "eye" for all the digital cameras in the world and earned the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
This, of course, does not mean that the work of the Great Hadron Collider will necessarily change our lives, but it only shows, in fact, that everything can be.
Palliative care is the best way to die. "Dolg"
The Commission for a Decent Death in Quebec recently discussed a delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate is due to resume soon, and a bill is being prepared at this time.
However, much remains to be done in this critical area.
"Debt" tried to take a closer look.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. I lived in his apartment in Monterejoy.
The prostate cancer that destroyed it from within gave him a respite for two years.
"I was given five years, I lived seven," he says, between life and death, lying in bed in the palliative care shelter of Victor-Gadbois in Belyui, where he arrived the day before.
"But it's always a shock, it's impossible to prepare for it," he says.
The disease does its job: an incredible weakness, which does not allow you to go to the toilet on their own and even eat on their own.
Sitting at the table on which an appetizing dinner stands, he gives up and agrees to help him eat.
He is invigorating, even manages to smile, talk to strangers who work around him, bring him medicine, lead him to the bath.
Courage before ordinary death.
"My greatest desire to be cured of diarrhea is humiliating," he admits.
A few hours later, the staff found a cure for this disease.
"During our lives, we are taught that a man should urinate standing," says Pierre Broder, a psychologist at Victor-Gadduba's shelter.
Regress to the condition of the child - for some unbearable humiliation.
"It all depends on the ability of man to accept decline," he says.
Since, according to many people engaged in palliative care, important events occur in the midst of this decline.
Patients who enter the palliative care of Victor-Gadbois, all patients with cancer.
Forecasts take them a maximum of three months of life.
At this stage, a team of doctors and nurses does not provide any more help called "medical."
Ms. A, 89, is most afraid to die "in the mind of suffocation."
But the disease allowed me to know my children.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I don't want anything else in life," she says, before letting her put a mask that makes her breath-enable.
She is still waiting in the coming days of her last visit to her son, who came from Italy.
In the shelter, Victor-Gadbois with the help of a group of volunteers provides body care and nutritional care.
This is palliative care, which remains when nothing else can be done.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, for every 11,700 residents, there is one place in palliative care facilities.
That's very small, given that sooner or later we'll all die.
Here life continues in the best conditions that are possible, explains Dr. Christian Martel - one of the shelter's doctors.
Whether it's physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
We will agree to provide or oral rinsing rinses from the dimmer, depending on what he will ask.
We no longer force diabetics to control sugar levels.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night we brought a beer to Mr. H., who died tonight.
In the morning, his son drank this beer in the feet of the deceased.
"We help loved ones, as do patients," says Natalie Savar, director of care for the patients.
In the shelter of Victor-Gadboa, not a single day is like the previous one.
Next to a 93-year-old old man who enjoys his last encounter with his family in the yard, sitting on his pillows while a toast in his honor, a 36-year-old man tragically dies a 36-year-old, surrounded by his parents, his wife and two young children and tried everything to survive.
"In the last six months, three to five beds are always occupied by cancer patients under the age of 45," says Dr. Christian Martel.
53% of patients admitted to the Victor-Gadboa shelter arrive from home and 47% from the hospital.
Access to palliative care
It is estimated that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is, care, which is provided to alleviate the suffering of patients who entered the final stage of their lives, whether at home, in the hospital or in the shelter.
And some institutions, such as the Victor-Ghadbois shelter and the Greater Montreal Palliative Care Society, specialise more or less exclusively on the care of cancer patients.
It is this great gap in the health system of Quebec that makes many palliative care physicians fear the adoption of a law that legalizes euthanasia and aid in suicide.
Since October, a manifesto signed by luminaries in the field of palliative care has been circulating, Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapuant, and testifying to their disagreement with such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christian Martel, Quebec's health care system is not effective enough to ensure the right to high quality palliative care before the transition to euthanasia is allowed.
Recently, she says, "I've seen a patient who spent 14 days in the ambulance, in terrible pain, and no one took the necessary measures to alleviate them.
I'm afraid that patients want to die just because they don't get adequate care.
At the same time, many oncologists until the last day try to save patients, despite pessimistic predictions.
The hopes for survival by Helen Richard were already minimal when she stopped debilitating chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was discontinuing treatment, she told me she regretted that I was stopping fighting, she says.
She told me that my days were numbered.
There is no omnipotent care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients who ask for death are thanked by the medical staff for not fulfilling their request after the palliative care team relieves their pain.
However, it should be noted that palliative care is not absolutely omnipotent in the fight against pain.
According to Elsie Monroe, director of palliative care at the Greater Montreal Home Palliative Care Society, patients are not susceptible to painkilling in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, in which the patient sleeps until his death, or from time to time, or constantly.
You can no longer pretend that we do not know of these sufferings.
Increasingly, patients who fail to relieve pain will be able to have access to palliative sedation.
Sick people suffering from pain always say the same phrase: "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want to be done euthanasia," which means "I want to make me feel better."
The creation of this report was made possible thanks to a journalistic grant from the Institute for Health Studies of Canada.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials responsible for the construction of roads, construction contractors, fundraisers of political parties and specialists in the Italian mafia day after day tell what they know about the colossal "system" that entangles the construction industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and mafia.
The "industry," which cost the taxpayers of Quebec very dearly, especially in 1990 and 2000.
"It is curious how this system is crumbled after all the funds were put into action, jokes Jacques Duceno, MP and former chief of police of Montreal."
It was thanks to him that in 2011 the scandal broke out as a by-product of the investigation of the official crimes related to the road construction contracts in Quebec, to which the Prime Minister of the time from the liberals, Jean Charet, agreed very reluctantly.
The Duceno report established a direct link between industry, the secret funding of political parties and corruption.
"Since the investigation began in 2010, he emphasizes, the Ministry of Transport alone would have saved a billion dollars on contracts," if some had held their instincts to take a share.
The Sharbonne Commission has "deposed the two mayors," he adds, hoping it would be able to "open the schemes behind individual personalities."
Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit established in 2011
The case involved the 2011 Standing Anti-Corruption Unit, which included an extensive staff of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
And, in addition, the employees of the special unit "Hammer," who after 2009 forced the "sewage cartel" of Montreal, to stop overestimating the cost of contracts.
A series of searches have been carried out in recent weeks, and some municipal officials, notably Frank Zampino and Richard Marcott, mayor of a small town, have been charged with fraud and corruption.
On the queue - Gilles Vayyancur, who recently resigned from the post of mayor of Laval, the third largest city in the province of Quebec.
He is suspected of repeatedly receiving bribes when placing state orders.
In addition, several Montreal Railway Engineers and construction contractors of Italian origin, including Tony Akkovo and Lino Zambito, were formally charged.
The latter blew up a real bomb, telling the investigation about the "system" of obtaining state contracts.
For several years, Zambotello gave 3% of the value of contracts in Montreal to a mafia-related intermediary who, in turn, transferred the money of the party of Mayor Gerald Tarmble "United Montreal."
In the 2000s, Zamboto was thrown with money to the right and to the left. He transferred more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to various parties of the province, mainly liberals who were then in power.
In addition, he admitted that he illegally raised funds for the former deputy prime minister from the Liberal party Natalie Normando.
Sewage contracts in which the cost overestimated
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked trouble-free.
Gilles Surprenan, a former civil engineering engineer, described it in detail before the commission: for ten years, he received gifts from construction firms, travel invitations, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and bribes for a total of $736,000 in exchange for sewer contracts, the cost of which he overestimated.
Other officials responsible for the construction of roads admitted that they received a paw, inflating the bills by 30-40% with the help of false additions.
Then one organizer from the mayor's party, Martane Dumont, accused Mr. Trambla of deliberately turning a blind eye to the existence of a parallel budget that filled party cash registers with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Mr. Tumble resigned in early November, placking Montreal into a deep crisis.
Chantal Roulo was one of the first members in Montreal to forget the alarm.
The mayor of the County of Rivier de Prarry in the east of the island, it has been opposing the sale of a municipal site purchased for $5 million and resold for... 1.6 million developers in the midst of a construction boom.
70% of the dirty money in election campaigns
She says that in the investigation, which will eventually be launched, she "will pull by a thread to understand the functioning of the system infested with ants to stop gangrene and identify the perpetrators."
This process is characterized as "painful, but positive."
We are in the process of purgeing the wound, but Montreal will need its own investigative team and observer to avoid the return of questionable practices.
How we clean up at home.
Regularly.
Jacques Duceno notes that "officials stole hundreds of millions of dollars," but he is particularly concerned about the role of "elected officials who knew about this scheme," but not involved in the machinations.
Given that the share of dirty money in financing the election campaign in Quebec reaches 70%, he jokes: "I was told that it was just a pale reflection of reality."
The government of Quebec proposes to limit up to $100 donations to the parties, but, according to him, this will not change the situation: "Unmilible we do not strictly limit the election costs, there will be dirty money in politics."
It requires a complete restructuring of the system of government contracts and party financing: "We cannot go lower; by boldly understanding the essence of things, we will be able to build a house on a more solid foundation, with better control and legality."
If this story casts a shadow on the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duceno urges those who laugh to look into their own yard.
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season you in PSG have achieved an extraordinary scale.
How do you explain this growth?
This can be explained by individual consciousness, but it may also be a new dimension of PSG.
Great players have arrived.
I grow up every day with them.
The technical staff also brought a lot.
These factors force me to raise the level of my game every day.
And during the match, it's easier.
In football, everything happens very quickly.
But I'm not scattered.
From the very beginning, at the NIF's pre-training center in Clerfontaine and until my arrival in St. Etienne, I've always stepped forward.
Thus, you benefit from the competition set by Carlo Ancelotti.
The addition of this summer is not a novelty to play very high-level matches.
They also know that every training is very important.
This leads to the fact that a player like me, wants to be on a level and to give the most.
In addition, Carlo Ancelotti is supporting my positioning.
He's being helped by deputies like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Ancelotti is the master of the position?
Oh, yeah.
Ancelotti inspires respect to all technical staff.
Today in the First League he has no equal and he is among the best coaches in Europe.
He has extensive experience and has won many titles with high-end clubs.
He worked with great players.
I think he will bring new titles to Paris.
I had an encouraging conversation with him in January.
I was away from a series of injuries.
The trust he gives me also explains my accomplishments.
What do you think of the first part of the PSG season?
In the First League, Lyon took the place of the leader.
But we're still ready.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we effectively qualified for one eighth final.
What is the purpose of the club in this tournament?
We'll try to go as far as possible.
Everything can be now.
We can say our word face to face with very good European teams.
We first want to finish first in our group, in front of Porto, to be able to take the return match in one eighth final.
Can PSG become a first-class European club in the short term?
He already has a budget for that...
In order to become a major European club, Paris needs to win titles and consolidate positions for the long term.
It's not like this today.
Financially, PSG has the means to make this project real.
Not taking the title in the First League, as last season, will be a big failure?
Of course, that would be a great disappointment.
This year we really want to get this championship title.
We were close to that last season.
In May, it was disappointing, because we had everything to get to the finish line first.
It was a very good season.
We finished it with 79 points.
As a rule, 79 points assume the title of champion.
But another team, Montpellier, played an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think it'll be okay.
"Even though strong teams like Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux have joined the fight for the title, I think we have the strength to win.
Don't you think the media expects too much from PSG?
It's normal that we expect a lot, given how much has been invested and what players we have.
We are fully prepared for this.
On the other hand, when we win 4-0 at home against Troy and we are still found to be criticized for, of course, it's a bit frustrating.
We are wondering what people expect of us first.
We will never be able to win every weekend with a score of 4-0.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to implement the game project.
The team is formed over time.
We have proved in the Champions League that we can respond to modern challenges.
Look at Manchester United, which has not been able to get into the eighth final for two seasons, although they also spent a lot of money!
Given the invested amounts, we represented you 15 points ahead of you by the winter break.
It would be a disregard for our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not on top last season, were "awakened" by this new PSG.
This shows how exciting the First League is.
I hope that in May we will be able to smile and tell ourselves that despite all the difficulties, as a result, we won.
PSG, it seems, depends entirely on the feats of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
And what if they say that there is some "Zlatan dependence."
This only means that Ibrahimovic is very successful and that he scores many goals.
He came for that and he proves that he is the first-League star.
Everywhere he played, he showed that he was a great player and a world-wide star.
In the group, we respect him as a person and as a player.
He also respects the people around him.
What he did is really exceptional.
This encourages others to improve their game.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also motivates everyone to move forward.
How did you survive Euro 2012 with the French national team?
It's kind of disappointment.
I wanted to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from snatching a little bit of playing time.
I've seen a lot of things there, and I've come out more.
Today I &apos;m playing good qualifying games .
That's what I've been hoping for since my baptism at the Blues.
We have learned from what happened in Ukraine, and now we must behave exemplarily.
What do you think about the first months of Didier Desham at the head of the Blues?
They are effective for him.
He has good positions in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
He is a strict coach, he is close to the players and inspires to win.
What was Laurent Blanc.
But I wouldn't want to compare.
Blanc reached his goal, he qualified us for the Euro.
I hope Didier Desham will bring the Blues to Brazil.
A good well-deserved draw (1-1), ripped out on October 16 in Spain, is this a fundamental match?
This match gave us faith in ourselves.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before this shock in Spain, there were no such matches in my career.
Pay and Sell Without Bank Help - With Bitcoin
The exact opposite of the current money exchange, based on central banks, numbered transactions between the receiving parties with commission fees for their processing.
In addition, as often happens with these technologies, there is a political vision: the belief that the current monetary system, consisting of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudus), is simultaneously a virtual currency (buttoned to dollars, euros ...) and a protected exchange protocol by type BitTorrent, which allows you to exchange files between participants of the same level.
About 200,000 transactions have already been registered with 15,000 computers on the network.
Several thousand sites accept bitcoins for donations or as a means of payment.
The Bitcoin exchange rate, peaking at $30 ($23) in June 2011, fell five months later to $2 before returning to about ten dollars today (the rates are listed on bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing special in comparison with the world exchange of real money or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) in its report on the virtual currency, published in October, became interested in this system.
He describes bitcoin as "the most successful virtual currency," "competing with the dollar or euro" and "like conventional currencies."
Bitcoin is different from other types of virtual currencies, like the "loans" used to promote in a video game that is earned during the game or that can be bought (and sometimes exchanged).
The social network Facebook has also developed a similar system.
But the exchange operations always monitor and handle any central authority.
In Bitcoin, all the nodes of the network are simultaneously holders of the ledgers, auditors, currency issuers, dummy and sellers.
How does this network function?
Each transaction between two users actually happens between two email addresses, like an email.
Only for each new payment, the user can choose a different address, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information relating to this transaction is signed electronically, using a double-key encryption system.
The network can also verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file, it is possible to verify that the bitcoins used in the deal do exist in a public account book sent out across the network.
The key step is to register a new transaction in this book.
It goes through the solution of a mathematical problem sent to computers, which, as if a temporary central bank, receives the privilege of adding this new line.
We are talking about the phase of the hashage of the file, that is, the conversion of a large file to a digital signature, short and unique.
Computers "take" a new transaction and add a number to it before "hashing" all together.
The goal is to find a number that will give a unique digital signature (many zeros at the beginning).
Once this number is found, other nodes are easy to verify that it is correct.
The transaction in this way turns out to be unrorzingly connected to the chain of all other transactions; any modification will change the digital signature.
If, in order to deceive the user very quickly (less than ten minutes) would like to pay twice on the same topic with the same money, only one of these two transactions would be confirmed by the network - and the other would remain unconfirmed, since they have different electronic signatures.
The computer that solved the problem gets 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, the reward is regularly shared in half, probably by the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible to one hundred million, which leaves the reserve.
The complexity of the task also increases with increasing computing power.
The life of the network has already experienced ups and downs.
The sites providing Bitcoin services were attacked and bitcoins were stolen from reserves.
"The defect used does not apply to the protocol itself," says Pierre Nuaza, who recently launched Paymium, a company that makes payments with real money using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reported on the possibility of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But the cash also has that shortcoming.
Major players, such as Wikipedia, refuse to accept donations of this kind.
Others, such as the WordPress blogging platform, allow them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the counting book and found that almost 80% of bitcoins are not in circulation.
"Giant sales" were announced in November.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged," rejoices Jon Holmqvist, who works at Coinabul, which is engaged in converting bitcoin into gold.
Pierre Nuaza, another author of the manual on this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as an operating network.
Its system, Paytunia, is the equivalent of a credit card (in real money) or contactless payment via a mobile phone, but it uses Bitcoin to verify transactions, which is cheaper.
The owner controls his personal data better and can thus be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement for entrepreneurs who do not need to install new devices or software.
It is enough only to tell the address that can be "photographed and recognized" by the phone, says Pierre Nuaza, assuring that he has thousands of users.
There is a general tendency to revise hierarchical systems in favor of more horizontal systems.
"Before Bitcoin is approved, it will take some time, but 2013 may be a turning point," he predicts.
The ECB in its report suggests, by the way, to reconsider the various risks considered to be increased today, if this system succeeds.
We left Afghanistan.
What's next?
French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Capis and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans should follow them at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain control of its territory, and for the Afghans to choose their future, not hoping for us.
We were mainly affected by the Afghan peasants, whom we saw as terrorists.
And we ourselves, with the 88 killed soldiers, and wounded and maimed.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former commanders hiding in Pakistan, but also often of peasants who reject the presence of a foreign army, as it was under the Soviet Union.
They want to protect their traditions, old and archaic, even though they are joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
They are tolerated, they are sometimes helped by local rebels, but they will no longer be, as soon as the West becomes more delicate.
The departure of the French troops from the base of Nijrab, which I observed from the height of the hills planted with almond trees thanks to French credit, passed in order.
The convoys of trucks and armored vehicles, accompanied by helicopters, reached Kabul without being attacked.
From the end of 2014, there will be no Taliban invasion of Kabul .
Circumstances have changed since their insurmountable progress from 1994 to 1996.
At the time, Kabul was empty, the country was in fire and blood because of the struggle between the various groups.
Their taking control of the country was then perceived as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
Afghan women paid for the obscurantism of these peasants, in which they were surpassed by al-Qaeda, but their situation did not improve today.
The former mujahideen, the Afghan government and the current Taliban are united in their desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The main characters of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They turned into dealers seizing state lands to resell them for construction to returnees who had returned from Iran and Pakistan, using huge U.S. subcontracts.
They are discredited; most of them, by the way, did not even fight themselves.
The people, as I heard in the countryside, want a government that wasn't made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as those who managed to do American generosity will leave: the outflow of capital is significant.
Young people are tired of the war and its ideology.
They lived in the modern world during the exile in Iran or Pakistan, they appreciated its advantages.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25; there are now 5 million inhabitants in Kabul, one fifth of the total population.
Public schools in the cities are filled with both boys and girls.
It is necessary to provide jobs for these young people who do not want to return to the obscurantism of the old parties or to the corruption of some leaders.
Everyone, including armed fighters, loves mobile phones, television and Turkish soap operas that represent the modern world and are watching everywhere.
There is an army at the moment.
The authorities that will command her will be considered legitimate?
The old commanders, who led the anti-Soviet struggle, are already taking measures to restore the provincial squads, which would not be subordinate to the central authorities.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with strong local differences, must be decentralized to a certain extent, modeled on Western countries, but the United States wanted to turn it into a centralized state with strong presidential power, abolishing the post of prime minister that has existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, especially before the elections scheduled for April 2014.
But his country, since the 1950s, and even earlier, depends on foreign aid.
The industry has not been put on its feet, no dams are functioning, no irrigation system has been repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except vegetables and fruits.
Priority is given to a private initiative.
In a country destroyed by thirty years of war, state control over infrastructure would be necessary.
There were rumours that Afghanistan had huge mineral wealth.
This only reinforced the feeling that the Western countries were present there only to take possession of them.
Without energy for processing iron or or copper in place, without means of transportation to export through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have almost left the Mes Ainak copper deposit, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to dig up a huge Buddhist complex and remain the province's largest employers.
It is also also necessary that, on a better day, Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which imports and exports depend heavily, must restore normal relations.
The withdrawal of French combat units ended on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the preservation of traditional assistance: lyceum for girls, for boys, the French language faculty at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural spheres, the support of the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in an effort to "conquer hearts and minds" and to fulfill the impossible task of combining assistance with offensive operations, the service of "civilian activities" under the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), abolished in 2012, together with a small French public organization, contributed to numerous community service and activities aimed at restoring agriculture in dozens of mountain villages.
These works, with intensive local labor, were able to help contain the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, restoration of forests, fruit trees, soil protection and the increase in the area of arable land.
What will we leave in memory of ourselves by spending two billion euros on military spending?
A much more modest budget would help to improve the living conditions of the local population, very harsh in these valleys, often located at an altitude of more than 2,000 metres above sea level.
The Embassy has received dozens of written requests for small agricultural work coming from local communities in the province of Kapis.
To get rid of the uprisings led by foreign factions, which the farmers wanted, as they told me, they needed to provide them with a little non-military support that would be well controlled and brought to them directly.
Severe births of the Egyptian Constitution
This is a risky move by President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt is more divided than ever, on the issue of a constitutional declaration that temporarily gives it extraordinary powers, he decided to play all-in.
Outcome everyone by surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote on the final text the next day.
Exactly a week ago, the head of state provided the Assembly with two additional months to finish the work.
It is likely two years now, Egypt is based on a preliminary text that has been amended several times, weakening institutional stability and leads to legal controversy.
This new initiative has only strengthened the division of the country.
According to his opponents, the President persists in his "autocratic delirium," continuing to "break this word" and "free the right."
In the camp, his followers believe that this is a way to end the institutional and political crisis by accelerating the transition process.
The referendum should be held within fifteen days.
A very short period of time that forces the Brothers to abandon the intention to explain the text to the Egyptians, the article, the article.
For the president, it is also a way to restore public and democratic legitimacy, while discontent is raging across the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote positively, as he said in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Moreover, the call for accelerated voting is like an ultimatum to the Egyptian people: "Either you vote for my text, or I leave myself extraordinary powers," which is supposed to be completed after the adoption of the Constitution.
In this strange atmosphere, 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, mostly Islamists, voted in favor of the text yesterday.
Most liberals did not respond to the challenge.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they slammed the door, feeling unable to convey their opinion.
Representatives of human rights defenders, religious minorities or civil society have done the same.
In order for the necessary quorum to be reached, 11 people, reserve participants, were hastily added yesterday morning.
Some are close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
It is not surprising that in most cases the articles were voted unanimously.
Commentators, by the way, amused by the fact that one of the few disagreements of the day arose around the day. time for prayer, as some members of the committee considered that the clock of the Constituent Assembly was incorrectly tuned.
The text on which the vote was still on yesterday consists of 234 articles.
The universal focus, article 2 eventually remained identical to an article from the 1971 Constitution stating that "Sharia principles are the fundamental source of law."
The Salafist parties, for which the introduction of Islamic law is one of the main demands, hoped to replace the "principles" with "rules," which would allow for their stricter application.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is evidence of their goodwill and respect for other members of Egyptian society.
"The hypocritical," the liberals who see this are only PR.
Because, in their opinion, the Islamization of the Constitution takes place through other articles.
They refer, in particular, to article 220, which gives Al-Azhar University a consultative role, in particular with regard to verifying the compliance of Shariah laws.
According to Egypt's specialist, Sophie Pomier, this is alarming. To. "people called to make decisions are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy."
We can see the birth of theocracy."
Many liberals are also excited by the fact that the next rector of this university seems to be much less moderate than the current one.
"At the moment, there is no specific religious intervention.
With this constitution, we remain within the framework of civil law.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not voles, but people with university education, some were trained in the French system," - reassuring Alexis Bloe, who is preparing a dissertation on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he admits that "around article 220 may arise ambiguity, since the terms used in it are borrowed from religious vocabulary.
This applies in particular to the "fiqhs" [Islamic jurisprudence, - ed.].
And in the future, the question may arise, as far as civilian judges are competent to make decisions about this."
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is criticized as it gives broad powers to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim brothers claim that they have decreased significantly compared to what they were under the old regime.
Another controversial point: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the consideration of the defense budget will be held not in the Parliament, but in the National Defense Council.
The trial of civilians in military courts would also not be prohibited, despite requests from associations for the protection of human rights.
The latter also expressed concern about the text, which they considered detrimental to freedom.
Responsibility for blasphemy has been retained, and insult is now prohibited, which can have serious consequences for freedom of speech, and especially for press freedom.
In addition, none of the articles anymore speaks about the protection of the woman, emphasizes Heba Moraef, of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture in article 36.
A word that did not appear in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president was due to be on television last night, the demonstrations are scheduled this afternoon.
Supporters of the head of state, in turn, will take to the streets on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are waiting for holy places, Navel of the Earth and the sea from brine
The Promised Land combines the majesty of biblical truths, modern comfort and primacy of nature.
"AIF" identified five of the most important reasons why you need to visit Israel.
Worship the holy places
It is necessary to visit the Jordan River, where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that all who enter this "bumb" will be merciful to God's grace.
And Galileo is the place of the wonders of Jesus: turning water at the wedding into wine, walking on water, calming the storm and filling the nets.
Jesus appeared before the disciples and after the resurrection.
Most of all, the holy things in Jerusalem.
Believers here pass the Path of Sorrow or the Way of the Cross of Jesus (in Latin - Via Doloroz).
It begins at the fortress of Antony - Pretorium - where the court was, and on the streets of the Old City leads to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on Mount Calvary - to the place of the Crucifixion, the Anointing Stone and the burial place of Jesus.
Here is the symbolic Christian Naution of the Earth, symbolizing the salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem was erected on the place where, according to the Christian legend, the tree grew, from which the cross was made to crucify Jesus.
In Jerusalem is the most holy place for the Jews - the Wailing Wall, which remained from the temple destroyed by the Romans in 70. A.D.
Traditionally, people of different confessions leave here memos with wishes, which are then executed.
Take a trip on the vertical
The ruins of the fortress of Massad remained from a secret refuge from the enemies that Herod the Great built in 25. B.C. for his family.
They are located on sheer cliffs in the mountains at an altitude of 450 m above ocean levels.
And only those who are fond of mountaineering can get to them.
The rest on this historical peak delivers a lift on the cable car.
And in the north of the country at an altitude of 1600-2040 m is the famous ski resort of Hermon, on which in the winter months - a huge influx of tourists.
To him from the foot of the mountain delivers a bus shuttle.
The total length of the ski slopes is 45 km.
According to ancient legend, pagan gods allegedly lived on the top of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
There are about 300 museums in the country.
You can't go to everyone in one trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting, is worth a visit.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, located near the Knesset (Parliament).
It houses the oldest Qumran manuscripts, or scrolls of the Dead Sea, found in the caves of the Judean desert, and about 500,000. archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
It is also necessary to visit the Museum of Art in Tel Aviv.
The exhibition features paintings of Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cezanne, Sislea, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall, Picasso.
You can visit the Al Bashas Ban Museum, which is several halls of ancient Turkish baths with imitations of visitors and banners of the time.
In Caesarea, it is worth entering the unique private Rally Museum, where you can admire the sculptures of Dali and Rodin.
There are no guides and souvenir shops.
Entrance is free and donations are not accepted.
The fifth - the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv - tells about one of the most dramatic pages of history.
The most tragic section - a children's memorial - was built in memory of 1.5 million children destroyed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter it and you find yourself in absolute darkness.
The stars are flickering.
And the names of Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they died are heard.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Evil to
The three main resort areas of Israel are located on the coasts of the Mediterranean, Red and Dead Seas.
Each of them has swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and aquariums.
Interestingly, in the Red Sea they bathe even in the winter months, since the water temperature there does not fall below 21 degrees of heat, and the air warms up to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is still warmer and swim all year round.
By the way, this most extraordinary sea in the world is on the lowest point of the planet - 417 meters below the ocean level.
Cote d'Azur water in it is a brine that easily keeps afloat even those who do not know how to swim.
The landlocks around are unrealistically beautiful.
They go here to undergo treatment with salt water - brine, and healing mud, and to heal health in dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes to clean up the shaken nerves.
Touch the Mysteries of Antiquity
They are kept by the ancient part of Tel Aviv - the town of Jaffa on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea.
Through it passed the famous Sea Route, connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatoly and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it was here that Noah built his ark, and Perseus saved the beauty Andromeda, with whom they lived a long and happy life.
Tourists are very fond of wandering along the narrow streets named after the signs of the zodiac.
They say that if you touch the walls on the street of "your" sign, Fortune will be favorable.
In Jaffa you can meet the newlyweds who come from all over Israel and even other countries at a photo shoot.
And in Caesarea - the city of King Herod - you can wander around the Roman theater, "take" the fortress of the crusaders.
In the Roman period, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of the Roman procurators, including Pontia Pilate.
The well-restored theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
Tourist for a note
Going to Israel, do not worry about your imperfect English: in the country about 30% of the population know Russian.
Money on the trip is better to take not in euros, but in dollars, which are easy to exchange for shekels (now 1 dollar). - 3.8 shekels.)
Urban transport is mostly buses, but there is a high-speed tram in Jerusalem, and in Haifa - the only metro line in the country, consisting of six stations and connecting the Lower city with the Upper.
In fact, it's an underground funicular.
Travel in all types of urban transport costs 6 shekels, for which you can drive with transfers for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to the Jewish tradition, a Shabbat is celebrated on Saturday.
From Friday evening until sunset on Saturday, markets, shops, public transport stop working.
And on Sunday morning, the working week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels - only kosher food, excluding pork, seafood, fish without scales and dishes, which combine milk and meat.
There are a large selection of dishes from lamb and beef, soups and desserts, cooked on coconut milk, traditional Jewish hummus paste, a variety of sauces, hammerheads - bastalel, fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
But a lot of fed cats that waltz "walking on their own."
In the evening, you can see them sleeping even on the roofs of parked cars.
Murlyks love crowded places and do not refuse treats.
Renting a car, depending on the brand, will cost $ 37. per day (Hyundai Getz) to 188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Plus insurance - $ 15. on a day.
And renting a bike will cost 15 shekels. on a day.
Tickets to the museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
the Language of Numbers
In 2012, Israel was visited by over three million tourists from all over the world.
The most travel and rest came to the citizens of the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
On the Promised Land from January to October 2012 visited 118.8 thousand. Ukrainian tourists, which is 51% more than in the same indicator in 2010, before the cancellation of visas on February 9, 2011.
"Great and Mighty" to Moscow will bring: migrants save money for the language
While deputies and human rights activists are arguing that they will give a law on mandatory language testing, fraudsters who sell "lime" certificates have already appeared in the country.
Every year, 13 million guest workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
For the most part, it is the citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to make money to support the families who remain in their homeland.
From December 1, the law came into force, according to which every migrant worker will be obliged to pass the exam for knowledge of the Russian language.
So far, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the field of services, housing and communal services, life and retail trade.
However, over time, - promise in the FMS, - tests will be mandatory for all visitors.
Moreover, you will have to pass not only the language, but also the Russian history and the basics of the legislation.
Knowledge of the language will have to be confirmed both for receipt and for the extension of the work permit.
The exception applies only to citizens of those countries where Russian is the state language.
People who have managed to obtain certificates and diplomas of education before the collapse of the USSR in 1991 are not subject to the law.
Benefit, Doom and Protection of Rights
The network of examination points will work under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute of the Russian Language, the Peoples" Friendship University, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
Migrants will be able to take tests in all cities; more than 160 such centers have already opened in Russia.
The initiative on the introduction of testing was supported by deputies of the State Duma and the FMS.
But human rights activists, before the law came into force, many times had time to ask the press the question: what, in fact, will it give?
What will change the mandatory knowledge of the language for both Russians and for the visitors themselves?
First of all, - the representatives of the migration service answer, - this will reduce the number of people suffering from "employment slavery."
Many are now talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers, explains the head of the representative office of the FMS of Russia in Tajikistan Victor Sebelev.
Protection of their rights must begin before their departure.
Only the system of organized recruitment will solve the problems of foreign workers by 90%.
Problems arise in migrants without a profession, education, who do not know the language, who do not have a medical examination.
Without understanding the language, the future migrant is doomed to face unscrupulous people who, under the guise of help, will put him a "voucher" in a creepy cramped bark, where he and dozens of people like him will languish for months without food and documents, incubating 12-14 hours a day.
We receive a lot of complaints from our migrants.
"In their homeland, they are promised one, and upon arrival they are deceived, passports are selected, they do not pay the promised salary," Toliib Sharipov, head of the Main Department of Labor Migration of the Ministry of Labor Migration of Tajikistan, confirms.
Don't fight, navyatnik!
However, while many citizens of the Central Asian republics, going to earn money in Russia, admit that not only do not know the language of the country in which they aspire, but also write their own.
Of course, this is not so much their fault, but the trouble: few Turkmens, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford even a sensible primary education.
After all, their families have nothing to even feed children, not to mention the decent clothes of them, shoes and equip them in school.
Growing up to adolescence, such guys at the first opportunity go to work.
It is difficult if it is bad with knowledge of the language, they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
However, in relation to the law on the language, human rights defenders note one important point.
Testing will be carried out only for those migrants who have legal status.
If there is no status, there will be no exam or subsequent official work.
Meanwhile, most of the guest workers still live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome, or unauthorized entry is forbidden"
Many of the visitors claim that getting official status in our country is not so easy.
The reason is in bureaucratic obstacles and all the same language difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
But a fake registration can be done quickly and for only a thousand and a half.
Russian police officers know that we have mostly false documents, no registration, hence cases of extortion.
"They ask a hundred, two for cigarettes, tea," - shared with journalists the citizen of Tajikistan Umed Khushkadamov.
"Let, don't bore, buy painting"
On the first day of the entry into force of the law on the language, it became clear that not only migrant registration documents were false.
Several "lime" certificates of language tests have already been seized by FMS employees.
Fake papers are printed on a regular color printer.
Of course, they got the new owners not for good: each of the migrants, hoping in this way to facilitate the task of passing tests, paid seven thousand rubles for the document.
This is more than two times more expensive than the procedure of official testing: it will cost a migrant laborer three thousand.
The fact that the main task for the near future is to protect the system from corruption, so that the "curves" could not be simply bought, the authorities and human rights defenders converge.
In the meantime, the authorities can promise guest workers who have not been able to successfully pass the test from the first time, the time to study the basic language course.
In addition, visitors who do not know Russian will be offered work in areas that do not involve active communication with people.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs does not take into circulation the illegal arms market
The proportion of crimes with legal weapons is extremely small
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation proposes to tighten the law against the owners of civilian weapons.
This is the reaction of the authorities to the recent incidents: Press shots at weddings, when there were no casualties, and the massacre, arranged by the Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, as a result of which the killer seven people.
The police want to ban the wearing of injuries in public places and raise the age from which you can get a license for weapons - from 18 to 21 years.
The idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee on security and anti-corruption Irina Yarovaya and promised that amendments to the law on weapons will be made to the state Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is happy that the Russian authorities are trying to fight the problem by "twisting the nuts."
An open letter appeared on the network, the authors of which - representatives of various public shooting organizations - demand to abandon "meaningless tightening."
The percentage of hooliganism with a registered weapon is minimal, said the Russian service of the BBC lawyer-criminalist Vasily Lesnikov.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, for six months of 2012, 142 crimes were committed with the use of firearms registered in the internal affairs bodies, while in just the same period, 1,168 thousand crimes were recorded.
The authors of the open letter are sure that the tightening of legislation in the field of civilian weapons does not place the criminal to go to the "black" market.
Now, according to them, in Moscow you can find any weapons at a low price.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Internal Affairs claims that they control the situation with the proliferation of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The "black" weapons market is replenished through several channels.
The main such channels are five, says retired Colonel Victor Baranets, who worked for ten years in the structure of the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of the site accepting orders for weapons
The first is a "army or military trace," that is, weapons that were stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were dragged by both Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves," Baranets said.
The next type of "black weapons" - stolen by criminals from representatives of law enforcement agencies.
Baranets explains that this includes both those carried out from police warehouses and stolen from law enforcement officers directly.
Illegal "barrels" go on sale from military warehouses.
In many military warehouses, explosions were often caused.
"There are proven versions that some of the arson were made specifically - to cover the shortage," - says the former military.
Their contribution, according to Barants, are made by arms manufacturers.
"Now private weapons factories are breeding, which do not withstand competition in the international market and throw weapons from under the floor to the black market, including Moscow," - says the expert.
Another source of the "black" market is smuggling.
Especially a lot of pistols and machine guns from poor countries, for example, Kyrgyzstan.
"There is its own production, sometimes handicraft, and the mafia was formed, which organized the flow," - explains the former military.
Where did the gun come from?
Experts calculated what is the approximate share of each of the sources of the supply of illegal weapons to the "black" market.
The report on this was prepared by the Center for Problem Analysis and Public Administration Design in 2011.
Experts analyzed the reports of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Rosstat, criminological literature and open data of portals on weapons topics.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, the researchers write, comes from the army and law enforcement agencies.
Half of all the weapons on the black market were there "contained by officials whose work is related to weapons," the report said.
According to the researchers, 17% of cases of weapons come from places of armed conflict, in 14% of cases there are thefts at the stage of production of weapons, 5% are "black archaeology."
The salesman-consultant of one of the weapons stores, who asked not to be named his name, assures that the weapon found by black diggers, for a long time no one has been buying - too old.
Most often, as he says, behind the new batch, sellers go to a military warehouse.
Through the ensign, a person buys a unit, for example, a TT pistol.
He's discharged it, passed it through the fence.
"He's transporting her to the city and here sells 900 euros apiece with two shops," he says.
"Truly, the police are aware of all cases, so periodically, when the plan for the detection of crimes is on fire, conducts a control purchase from traffickers of illegal weapons," the consultant adds.
"Like in a Luxury Store"
The seller and the buyer most often find each other through acquaintances.
I looked at the sites, blogs, until a friend responded, who offered to come to the platform "Begovaya," where there will be a person who will take me to the "corner" where we will bargain.
I only found out the price of the trunk there.

To get the barrel I need a friend who has a way out, - says the salesman-consultant. I have such a friend, but I'm not sure about it.
There are sellers in the markets, but you also need to come there, conditionally, "from Ivan Ivanovich, who asked to convey that the daughter had a tooth fell out."
I'm even taking a couple of castets now through a person I'm sure of.
He's only supplying them to me, too, because he knows I won't turn it in.
Beginners are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military officer Viktor Baranets tried himself as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when he was preparing to publish an article about it.
The schemes, he said, have not changed.
He was given an album with photos where "everything was anything."
"I felt like in a luxury shop," the military recalls.
The buyer, according to Barants, is not offered a cat in a bag - everything can be tried.
I, a potential client, not just buy - we go with the seller to the woods, put a target there.
"I am allowed to shoot, and when I make sure that the weapon hits well, we begin to bargain," the expert describes.
Shop on the couch
Searchers on the Internet bring to sites and groups in "Vkontakte," where they offer to buy weapons "for different purposes."
This does not require any documents and personal meetings.
"It is enough to have a certain amount of money," - write in the advertising hat on the website "Buy a combat gun or machine gun."
Users leave their applications and ask questions.
Will the minors be sold?
"Without a license of course," asks the user "Ivan" (the ormography is preserved).
"Kupju TT.Moscow" - succinctly formulates the request of "Fedorenkov."
The Federal Security Service has now scattered a huge network of shell sites and wanting to buy combat weapons with a shovel.
People go like hungry fish for lure, and then mined coal in Siberia.
military columnist and former military officer Victor Baranets
I've heard of such schemes: the site is usually registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People take orders.
The buyer makes payment through the ATM.
"In response, they send a photo and instructions where the weapon is hidden," - said the press Secretary of the public organization "Right to arms" Dmitry Kislov.
Victor Baranets claims that leaving the application on the site, you can be left without weapons and get to jail.
The Federal Security Service has now scattered a huge network of shell sites and wanting to buy combat weapons with a shovel.
"People go like hungry fish to feed, and then extract coal in Siberia," he says.
Makarov for $100
When buying illegal small arms, according to experts, you can meet the amount of 100 to 900 dollars.
According to Dmitry Kislov from the organization "Right to weapons," Makarov's pistol can be purchased for $ 100-300.
You'll have to wait a month and a half.
It is shipped from long-term storage by the management of these medium-level warehouses.
According to the official statistics of the department, in comparison with January-October 2011, the number of such crimes in Russia as a whole decreased by 7% and amounted to 22.9 thousand, and the number of revealed facts of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
Fast food workers and supermarkets in the United States
Up to a quarter of all American teenagers go through work at the McDonald's cash register
In recent days, there has been a wave of protests against low salaries in Walmart's department stores and popular fast food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendis and Kentucky Freed.
So far, no one is going to predict whether this wave will turn into the ninth shaft or it is destined to be exhausted in the early stages.
The actions are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing public organizations.
In addition to raising the modest salaries that Walmart's employees and fast food systems receive, the purpose of the protesters is to create trade union organizations in them.
So far, this sector of the economy is almost not covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The shares began last week, after Thanksgiving, on the so-called "Black Friday," when America was hit by an orgy of cheap sales, which captured millions of ordinary people and sometimes accompanied by brawls.
On this day, some employees of Walmart Corporation, which employ 2.2 million people around the world, left their jobs and picketed together with trade unions and left-wing activists, the company's stores, whose goods are designed for people of modest and middle-income.
Walmart sells everything in the world, from diapers, hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
On average, 8% to 27% cheaper in stores than in large supermarkets.
Therefore, many low-paid Walmart workers only stay at work.
The availability and range of products made Walmart one of America's largest corporations.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell the goods to a leap in part because it pays little to its employees.
The latter also complain about the difficult working conditions, for example, the shortage of forklifts or hand scanners.
The participants of the action on "Black Friday" demanded a raise in wages and complained that the cost of medical insurance provided by the corporation jumped from $ 30 to $100 per month.
A typical Walmart worker who receives $9.5 an hour, this expense is not affordable, they said.
Scientists from the University of California, Berkeley, prove that if Walmart raises the average salary to $12 per hour, it will cost the corporation $3.2 billion.
That's about 1.1% more than she spends on wages now.
If Walmart completely shifts the salary growth to the shoulders of buyers, then every visit to the store will cost them only 46 cents more expensive.
For the year, they will spend on some $12.39 more than they are now.
Walmart's supporters say the protests took place in just nine states and did not cause minor damage to corporations.
Black Friday continued in its stores from 8 p.m. on Thursday until midnight the following day, while Walmart sold about 5,000 goods per second.
In total, its cash registers produced almost 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
Corporation spokesman Dan Vogelman claimed in an interview with the Huffington Post's left behind a total of "less than five" Walmart employees, and that the protest was just an "other PR trick" that organized the union.
"Free cash desk!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where their target was not the Walmart department store (they are not welcome in this progressive city, and therefore they are not here yet), and McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonalds says he sells billions of servings, and after that he doesn't even give you sick and pays you honestly!
Jumaine Williams, New York City Council member
At the moment, the minimum wage, according to federal and New York law, is $7.25 per hour.
Fast food restaurants increase it over time, but not much, and on average, their average employees receive $8.90 an hour in New York.
No one earns less than them in this expensive city.
How to exist in New York for such money, it is incomprehensible to me.
Once through the McDonald's passed almost a quarter of American teenagers who worked for their shelves after school, while living with their parents.
Few people saw the main source of food in this or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now I am constantly talking about interviews with McDonald's workers who complain that they should live on this salary and sometimes even feed her children.
On the other hand, the Wall Street Journal forum has a comment, the author of which notices that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know what you will feed them.
Protesters, which began at 6.30 a.m. on Thursday at McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashiers and cooks of the fast food system start to pay at least $15 an hour, more than double their current minimum earnings.
They also demanded that trade union organizations be established in the field of fast food.
U.S. law prohibits administrations from preventing and punishing trade union activists in bullying and dismissal.
The administration rarely makes life easier for them.
But it is difficult to cover fast food by the trade union for objective reasons.
One of the main is the extraordinary turnover of personnel.
The Dissenting
Noisy protests took place on this day and at a number of other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of the rally in the middle of the day at McDonald's near Times Square, which was attended by several local Democratic politicians, in particular, a member of the city council Jumaine Williams, who said: "McDonald's" says that he sells billions of servings, and after that he does not even give you hospitals and pay you honestly!"
The demonstrators were supported by other prominent New York Democrats, such as Mayor candidate Bill De Blasio, who said that "we must amicably join in supporting fast food workers so that they can achieve the fair pay and economic well-being that every New Yorker deserves!"
As the New York Times described it, it was the largest of its kind in the history of the American fast food sector.
But it involved only a few hundred people, and not all of them were employees of fast catering, in which tens of thousands of people are employed in New York.
It is not clear whether this spark will create the flame of the mass movement.
"So far, it is medium-sized that of the brain."
Popular among fans of modern technologies, the theme of augmented reality in recent years is customary to be perceived mainly through the prism of special glasses.
First, at the summer, at its annual conference, the current model was shown by Google, and then in November it became known that the application for the corresponding patent was filed by Microsoft.
However, from a conversation with the head of the group of interactive 3D technologies at Microsoft's Cambridge laboratory, it follows that for scientists of this company, glasses are a passed stage.
They are lured by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with bare hands, creating virtual open spaces.
- Please tell us what your research team is doing in general terms?
- We are engaged in the interaction of a person with machines, but at the same time we are trying to push the boundaries of this interaction.
While humanity in the masses stuck at the stage of working with pixels on a flat screen, sometimes poking in them with a finger.
We want to look at 5-10 years ahead and anticipate the radical changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox today without Kinect is not sold, because everyone is interested in gesture control.
What else is ahead of us?
Despite the fact that Kinect has moved the interaction to the physical level, much still happens on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information has improved (the system receives more data), and the conclusion is not so much.
We are trying to change this, we are working on truly 3D display systems based on various technologies, including projective technologies.
We need to release the computer world in ours, physical, to make it more tangible.
To do this, however, you need to recognize not only the user, but also the space around it.
Then we will be able to complement the real world with virtual objects in a much more convenient form.
And first of all - to hell with these stupid virtual reality helmets!
What do you think of voice control?
A popular thing, but don't overestimate it?
"It is definitely not a panacea - the question of privacy arises, because you do not always want to notify others about their actions and intentions.
In fact, all kinds of interaction with computers are good, but each in their niche.
For example, to control devices in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not on the swabs, but over such a stingy, short.
At the same time, the gestures were removed not by the camera of the device, but with a wristband bracelet that fixed the movements of bones and muscles.
So far, it is large, but theoretically it can be reduced to the size of the watch.
But in general, the future lies with a mixed type of management, for example, gesture + voice.
- What's that?
- For example, how would you ask me to hand you this can of soda?
You will say and show at the same time.
- I usually just say.
- Oh, it'll be very hard to recognize.
- So you want to get users to adapt to what a car can or can't at the moment?
It's not necessary, but it's a mutual rapprochement.
I think that in the near future we will mainly have to work on the development of new types of sensors that will allow us to more accurately determine the human reactions.
It can be, for example, laser sensors, they give a good resolution in depth, it is very important.
- If we talk about your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your complaints against modern cameras?
Lack of permission, depth or something?
In principle, the current generation is something that can be pushed away in our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at a speed of 1000 k/s.
But it's not about the megapixels themselves, it's about the megapixels themselves, but as a matrix and depth.
From the last point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us - this adds work to the designers of algorithms.
That is, we must remember not only the permission for the X and Y axes, but also about the resolution of the X and Y.
The speed is also very important, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and the current 30 fuse is frankly small, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betices of our Redmond Laboratory made a touch sensor with adjustable processing delay - from 1 to 100 ms, with modern serial sensors closer to the second (60-100) indicator.
Not everyone understands how much it affects the interaction of humans and machines.
I would be very useful in my work the equivalent of such a device, only not requiring touches, so that the frames per second were more.
Do you need to increase the number of cameras?
- Kinect now has three "cameras," one of which is actually an infrared emitter, and the second is a receiveder of the reflected signal.
But the third camera is, in fact, the usual sensor of the visible range.
It is not used to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially more cameras could solve the problem...
Or exacerbate it by increasing the required amount of calculations.
It would be nice to create a flexible analogue of Kinect, to play with the curvature of the location of the cameras and see how it will help in the three-dimensional definition of the position.
- As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present its glasses to the public.
Do you think that from the point of view of the everyday use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, all the time to walk, holding the smartphone in the hands raised, is not very convenient, but here is what I think: the coolest option would be "transient" augmented reality, when on the basis of a cloud platform you could switch from points to a smartphone, projection display and further everywhere.
Glasses are a very personal device, in this their strength (private things you see), and at the same time weakness - augmented reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
Let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only Tony Stark from "Iron Man," but also to the simple mortal.
There is one problem that critics often point to this idea: there is no tactile feedback!
Hands don't feel anything!
What answers does your group prepare for this challenge?
- In my lectures, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction of man and machine.
I think the eighth may well be the addition of tactile sensations.
In the meantime, one of the interesting tricks is the use of the second hand as a kind of substrate for the image.
She's recording the presses perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are really aimed at giving these "pictures in the air" of achitation - for example, the interference of several directed ultrasonic rays at a certain point where the finger is located, gives a feeling, but so far it is very weak - as if you were plowed on the pillows.
There are bracelets on the wrists that affect the nerve endings in the fingers - also a promising direction.
- Have you tried to fool the brain?
Make him think he feels what he seems to feel when he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried that yet.
Here is another task, which will have to be fought for a long time - how to force a person who is physically physically in a very limited space, to believe that he is going on an open, almost infinite - we are working on the concepts of treadmills (not at all, as in clubs), moving platforms, as well as huge balls.
While deceiving the brain is medium, work is still very many years.
This is what makes working on virtual reality so appealing to the researcher - many things in an absolutely infancy.
Vsakovshchina instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "Peterburg avant-garde," dedicated to the citizens who are ahead, in the avant-garde of culture and art.
This top list has already included bright figures of the art scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements go beyond the city, often finding recognition in Europe, bypassing all-Russian fame.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the outrageous artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, a bearded man dressed in all red, who meets both at the Russian Museum, then at the Summer Garden, then on fashion parties and vernissages.
The paintings of Kirill Miller always gather crowds of spectators, wherever they are not exhibited.
Kirill Miller is one of the purely St. Petersburg socio-philosophical storytellers, creators of new mythologies.
Kirill Miller is a bright man of the St. Petersburg avant-garde of the late 80s - early 90s.
In addition, he is a man of the city, with his appearance on the streets, causing a smile from citizens, raising everyone's mood.
Recently, he took a charmer and became a St. Petersburg charmer, as he was ripe for this difficult role with all his bohemian existence, philosophy and image.
- Kirill, why do you still walk around the city in all red, and not in yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I chose red as a fashion designer engaged in appearance and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between the artist, image maker and society.
Although in society everything that is a little bit of gray, causes aggression and arousal of unkind.
But my provocations are about starting the conversation.
The whole history of my provocative actions is an invitation to the discussion.
When did you know you should be an artist?
- At the exhibition in DK Nevsky, where my works were exhibited.
I knew this was my way.
Then the wave of old free unofficial artists passed, and new, free type of me were incomprehensible.
I became friends with the artists of the new wave, with postgazone, which led to the "Pushkin-10," and there was no more wave.
I am thrown into the theater, clothes, music, in all genres, except the word.
- And all this came together in your Art Clinic... - It was important for me to find myself in the center of culture of St. Petersburg, where all the best creative forces should gather.
In 1995, I occupied the territory on Pushkinskaya-10, and there, until there was no repair, there was a musical and artistic club, a bohemian club, the house of the St. Petersburg bohemian.
Many were born there: NOMS, Tequila-jazz, I remember how the cords were brought with the project "Wan Gogh's ear."
The cord and his friends sang light songs under the plywood, they were in a tight tight tight, among them was the now fashionable composer Igor Vdovin.
When the band played alive, she became "Leningrad."
Trachtenberg was the leading many programs until the Hali-Galelian era.
We gave them Trachtenberg, and his great career went, and he received basic education and upbringing from us.
Gallery "D 137," the club "Griboyedov are echoes from the Art-clinic.
Our workers and the regulars are gone.
I am the hero of yesterday, when culture meant something.
In 2000, the survey was in the press, the prize was "People of our city."
In the nomination "The artist of the year" I was named, my culmination ended.
In the new times, according to the old rules, it is inconvenient to work, I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In our years, it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are divided, you can be popular, but not very cultural.
Your works have a recognizable manner.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they are clearly relevant and sharp.
I will have a program exhibition, "Russian Museum in Clowns."
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be social, now to be so - it hurts and scares.
But in the clowns everything is smeared, tragedy is removed.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, saving the world by totalitarian dressing in order.
Now on clothes are met, focusing on the external mechanics, and not on the inner person.
Or maybe he can't give a hand and you have to spit in his face.
And the deception will be removed with the help of changing clothes.
- And recently we saw you as a city charmer. The cultural city should have such a hero.
To whom, not me, they will be.
- Can commercial art be beautiful?
- Now commercial art must be neat, tactful, sweet.
The culture is disintegrating.
Previously, people lost in packs, bohemian one loved one, the prose is another.
Now everyone is divided into microcommunities, now it is difficult for everyone to like.
I'm not a hundred-dollar piece of paper to like everyone else.
Now you have to think who you'll like.
Now every cult hero has 100 fans.
- And a few thousand come to Stas Mikhailova!
- They're throwing at him, there the sex and social sphere works.
And on the basis of cultural soil, 300 people will come, and 10 thousand. will not come, and in the end, less management, money, everything will stink.
I have fans, the main thing is not to deceive them, not to spoil what I have earned.
In my youth, I painted such paintings that one collector they were on the wall next to Falk and Larionov hung.
I started with paintings that usually end.
They often confuse the concepts.
They say that culture is spiritual, culture of consumption.
There is no culture of consumption, it's from another opera.
I am a man of culture of yesterday, grew up on the examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refused money for painting paintings.
I'm for a culture like this.
- Kirill, what is missing from St. Petersburg?
Good cultural experts.
There is such a thing: an official from culture.
But not all of them can engage in culture.
With the right kings, everything was not so, the kings, perhaps, did not understand very much in culture, but they understood that it was necessary to keep the right experts.
There are good consultants in Moscow.
We have people in St. Petersburg who could be experts, but they will be pushed, as we need higher experts who will correctly appreciate these experts and give them the way.
The taste is now flourishing.
The same Erarta, but they are distinguished by the fact that they honestly say that not all modern art we accept, there are artists who should look for other museums.
What is it for you - St. Petersburg?
- St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital, there is much more culture in Moscow, there is soil.
And on our stones, art is difficult to grow.
We need cultural soil, and we have more writers than readers, which is wrong.
There are a lot of people curious in Europe. who go to the exhibitions, concerts.
We have that layer of thin.
We need to make art fashionable, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project was implemented with the funds of the St. Petersburg grant
Birth in space
The earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with an asteroid killer.
Caravans of spacecraft with earthlings on board are sent in search of a reserve planet.
To preserve humanity, the main question arises, how to continue its genus in conditions of weightlessness or on the same reserve planet?
I think the choice is small.
In fact, there are only two real planets that can be developed hypothetically.
"This is Venus and Mars," said a senior researcher at the State Astronomical Institute named after P.K. Sternberg (GAISH) Vladimir Surdin.
But if the conditions on Mars are more suitable for life, then on the surface of Venus - temperatures of 500 degrees.
You can live only at high altitude or in orbit of Venus. in space.
To approach the issues of reproduction in space began with the flora.
We conducted experiments on plants half a century ago.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit were no different from their terrestrial varieties.
Then - the in orbit of insects, tiny fruit flies-drosophila.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent to space to test how the embryo develops in weightless conditions.
We get a perfectly normal chick at the exit.
But then the problem begins.
"The problem associated with the fact that this chick must find a support, he must stand on his legs and start moving," - explains the head of the laboratory of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems (IMBP) of the RAS Vladimir Sychev.
Not finding support, the chicks indiscriminately tumbled.
And after 10 hours, the newborns had a complete atrophy of instincts.
The birds did not respond to the light and sound.
And there was trouble in the fact that after four days they just died.
"And twice we hatched chicks, after that we refused, because it is simply impossible to work with them there," - says the failure of the experiment with chicks in space Vladimir Sychev.
With animals, the last time the biological "minicochrac" flew to orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, on the biosatellite "Bion" will be only same-sex individuals.
There was an experiment with rats that were sent into space with the fruit.
In principle, they found nothing supernatural.
"It was just on biosatellites, but again it is an isolated experiment, and such research should be carried out," - said Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, space rats had offspring.
But it is not yet possible to approach the problem of reproduction directly in space.
It's not an easy task.
Animals, losing the habitual habitat, simply cannot realize their sexual instinct.
A person, unlike animals, in principle, can.
Homo sapiens has abstract thinking, and is able to create an appropriate emotional background.
For ethical reasons, such experiments are not conducted.
But women have been flying into space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was Tereshkova.
And the most precious thing that humanity has is a female body.
Our Seagull flew away, and no one on Earth could say: will it last after the flight into space.
Will she be able to have a baby after this flight?
"No one answered this question," says veteran of the rocket and space industry Vakhtang Vachnadze.
In June 1964, just a year after the flight into space, the first woman cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to a daughter.
The father of the child Andriyan Nikolaev was also an astronaut.
In 1988, the second woman cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, who twice was in orbit and even worked in outer space, had a son.
However, the risk remains.
We have few, there are a few cosmonauts, who, after long flights, everything cost, and a healthy generation is growing.
"And if more, it is dangerous even during orbital flights," sums up the pilot-cosmonaut, Hero of the Soviet Union, Russian Hero Valery Polyakov.
And yet, humanity needs to look for some new ways in biotechnology, protection from radiation, the creation of artificial gravity.
Hydrolaboratory of the CPC is a mandatory stage of preparation for flight.
Here, in conditions of zero buoyancy, cosmonauts practice the skills of working in outer space.
Water mimics the weightlessness.
If for adults water, albeit comfortable, but still alien to the environment, then for infants - a native element.
Little ikhthidans seem to confirm that life on land came out of the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is about 9 months in the mother's contaminated fluid, it is easier for him to get used to the water.
In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth, from the moment of the first bathing, only 2 weeks passes.
"It's very little to forget something," says infant swimming instructor Marina Aksenova.
In short, if for a born child weightlessness a more natural condition, then for a woman - you need gravity, gravity.
Very quickly in weightlessness decrepit the muscles of the abdomen, the pelvis, the ability to push the fetus falls.
Well, let's put that down, relying on stimulants of labor.
You can, of course, in a special cell to go to childbirth, she will push it out.
"And then what?" - asks non-trivial questions Valery Polyakov.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Not feeling terrestrial attraction, the body will not form a skeleton and muscular system.
It is impossible, as an adult, to wear a special load suit for training in orbit.
He will be deprived of what is vitally necessary.
"And this experiment, which we will go to, allowing the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead to the fact that we will bring to Earth a disabled person, a fully maladapted person," - foresaw the head of the Committee on bioethics of the IMBP RAS Igor Pestov.
The birth of children in space is a matter of theory.
However, later this will be a reality when the earthlings on their ships will go to a distant planet that will become home to their descendants born in space.
Chief of the Main Control and Audit Directorate: Checking the schwarts system failed due to the fault of politicians.
In the public procurement industry, the Czech Republic has good control bodies and, despite the availability of quality legislation, lags behind in its application.
This is a statement by Miroslav Kal, Vice President of the Supreme Audit Office, from an interview for the website of Aktu?ln.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but it should be applied correctly, which, in my opinion, we do not have enough," - said the current situation of Kala.
Such conclusions are provided by the joint inspection of the Czech and German control bodies.
As an example of mismanagement, the approach of Peter Nechas to the so-called Schwartz system cite.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the State Duma (Civil Democratic Party) will not bother entrepreneurs with inspections - is it prohibited or allowed?
"The law should be in any way established, and if it forbids something, the Prime Minister cannot oppose the work of institutions that are required to verify and enforce obligations," Kala said.
At the meeting of the Audit Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you talked about a joint project between the Czech and German parties, within which the legislation on public procurement of both countries was compared.
What exactly was it about?
I mean the parallel check that we started, probably two years ago.
Simply put, it is a question that European law approves how public procurement should be made, followed by national legislation and then also put into practice.
All the information was collected and, even with an unfinished inspection, interesting differences were found - in other words, the legislation can be "exact and unmistakable," but in the practice of application we are inferior to Germany in some parameters.
It follows that it is not enough to create more and more refined rules, it is necessary to focus on the application of the law itself.
And how can this project help you, what does it mean to you?
It is this joint control that can contribute to the efforts to stop clarifying the laws, reduce and improve restrictions, because this does not lead to a positive result.
The economy means getting the appropriate thing for a reasonable (but not always low) price to avoid enrichment and possibly criminal behavior.
But it's not the fact that we will achieve this by lowering the order restriction.
Perhaps this system will be overflowing with "papers" so that those who want to find loopholes in this system will be found much easier than if the restriction did not decrease.
You are talking about internal problems of practical application of public procurement legislation.
How does the control system in Germany work?
Is there an organization like our KRU (Control and Auditing) or does it work differently?
As for the institutions, there is Bundesrechnungshof, arranged on our principle, there is also a collegium that works a little differently, but mostly both institutions function in the same way.
In addition, the powers are similar to a certain extent, but since Germany has a federal structure, there are audit units and at the level of the federal states - this is somewhat different from ours.
BRH can only manage federal money, we have public funds.
Public funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled at the level of federal counting chambers.
As for local legislation, it is easier than we have?
In general, I would not like to compare without specific data, but in some respects Germany can be taken as a sample, but it is not certain to say that it is better in everything.
Isn't that because they're better at coping with control?
Definitely not, but I repeat, I don't like that comparison.
But I must say that even exemplary countries face many problems.
Otherwise, they wouldn't have any advantage from cooperating with our office, would they?
If we talk about domestic legislation, how did the amendments to the Public Procurement Law affect your institution, in some way the consequences are manifested?
Given that the legal force of these amendments is quite short, it has not yet manifested itself in our control work.
Since we are monitoring the fact, some delays must be taken into account.
We take this into account only in the process of preparing future inspections - we began to use our new tool "detection of the risk of non-equity," through which we drove almost 14,000 government contracts. We analyzed them. Of course, these changes will be manifested, because the restrictions change, the conditions of some types of tenders change, and so on.
Do you think that the approval of this law will benefit or additional burden on the bureaucracy system?
I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope it is confirmed.
The problem that may arise is that the rules "will be cautious" and cannot be observed.
In the functioning of the previous rules, controlled enterprises are tied to the supplier (for example, regional operational programs - with the regional council) in that any non-compliance with the law on public procurement means a violation of budgetary discipline.
Should the law be tightened in this way?
I don't think that way.
The system should exclude those who want to capture and abuse, but not punish those who make a formal mistake that does not affect the decision.
Such a system would only create even more pressure on the bureaucracy.
And how to get out of this situation?
Let's be aware that this path will not lead to nowhere.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the State Duma of the State Duma will not bother entrepreneurs with inspections of the so-called schwarz system. What does that mean?
Is the Schwarz-system banned or permitted?
The law should be in any way established, and if it forbids something, the Prime Minister cannot oppose the work of bodies that are required to verify and enforce obligations.
You can say, "We will change this law and allow it," but we cannot say that we will pretend that nothing is happening.
The Public Procurement Act contains fairly strict rules, how and what should be formally carried out, and this is right. This will protect public procurement.
But, on the other hand, it's tragic when a candidate with the best offer is disqualified only because of formal flaws.
The law will never be perfect, but it should apply correctly, which, in my opinion, we lack.
The roads are slippery in some places, but mostly passable.
In some places in the Czech Republic, the roads are frozen and snow-capped.
Mostly they are traversable, but in some places with more caution.
Karlovy Vary Region
This morning in the Karlovy Vary region, the roads were passable, but in some places frozen and snow-covered.
The temperature fell from five to ten degrees below zero, but during the day should light a little.
Snow in the region has stopped, only in the lowlands lies a small layer.
However, on the ridges of the Rude Mountains lies about 30 centimeters of snow.
From the information received from the regional road workers, it became known that in some places there was a lower visibility due to fog.
High-stage highway R6 and first-class roads in the region are currently movable without restrictions.
However, care is needed, for example, on bridges, where the surface can be frozen and slippery.
Also, all roads related to the second and third class, including mountain trails, are traversable.
But in some of their areas are still the remains of frozen and in places of the sunshine.
You need to be especially attentive on the roads located on the hills.
Pardubitsky and Kralovgradets Krai
The management of the roads and highways of the Czech Republic on its pages on the Internet informs that some roads in the eastern Czech Republic are threatened by ice, and on mountain roads and roads located on the highlands, there may be a broken layer of snow.
Regional road workers warn drivers about the ice, which can be formed especially on the hills of the Pardubitsky region.
The ice can be near Lanschkron, Usti nad Orlice, Polichki, Svitavi or Whiskey-Mito especially on the roads of the second and third class.
The roads I/43 and I/34, located at Svitavi, are treated with chemicals.
Especially snow lies on the roads of Krkonosha and the Orlitz Mountains.
The broken layer of snow is located on the roads located on the hills in the areas of Rikhnov nad Knezhn and Trutnov.
In the Eastern of the Czech Republic today variable clouds without precipitation.
The temperature usually varies from minus three to plus one degree Celsius, light wind.
Plzensky Krai
The roads in the Plzen region are movable this morning, but in some places you need to be careful and adapt to the weather.
In the morning it is frosty, the temperature ranges from three to nine degrees below zero.
After snowfall and subsequent cooling in some places may be slippery.
In some places, drivers may collide with fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
The information was provided by regional road workers.
The D5 highway is now almost without restrictions, however, the road managers recommend caution between 80 and 131 kilometers.
Most of the first class roads have a dry and frozen surface.
In the southern Plzni and Tahov can come across frozen areas.
The roads of the second and third class are humid, and in this case there is a warning in connection with the possibility of slippery areas.
Drivers should be cautious, especially on few roads used in the Shumava area.
Olomoautskyi Krai
Drivers heading to the elevation of the Olomoutsky region, today should take into account the snow porridge on the road.
It remained after the use of chemicals in the Chervenogorsk saddle and on the road in the direction of Videlsky Krzyzh.
At night, snow forced to go out to the street of road workers, according to information from the road management, in Shumperka fell about three centimeters of snow.
In other areas of the region, the roads are usually traversable without restrictions.
"On the hills of the Shumperka are the remains of snow.
Drivers heading towards Jesenika, should bear in mind the presence of snow porridge in the Chervenogorsky saddle," - said today CHAND (Czech Agency of news) dispatcher of the Noiseper road management.
At night, their colleagues from Yesenik also went to clear the roads, they assured that the roads on the highs after processing the chemicals remained naked and wet.
In Olomouc, roads are traversable, but in Sternerka, drivers should be attentive to forest areas, where humidity is still maintained.
Ustetskyi Krai, Liberetsky Krai
This morning, road workers from northern Bohemia report that there are several difficult places left.
According to information from the police database, in addition to several places with ice or fallen snow, a mountain road is closed on the section from Telnica on the Clinic in the Ustets region.
Also, the temperature remains negative in the lowlands, so snow and ice remain on the roads. In the lowland, especially to the south-east of the Czech Middle Highs, on the contrary, there are no problems, the road is mostly dry.
The complications on the roads have not yet been reported.
Road workers report the appearance of ice in the vicinity of Steti.
According to the meteorologists, perfect conditions were created for its formation at night - all day it rained and snow melted, the sky cleared up and frosts began.
It is reported about unfavorable conditions on the main highway and on the I/13 highway on the border of Ustetskyi and Liberets Krai.
Due to the winding branches of trees under a layer of snow, the roads were forced to close the road in Telnica on Kninitz.
Shimon Ornest: At the concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
What do you think about the end of the world in less than a month?
It's just one of the many disturbing news that we humans are so easy to get caught on.
Together with the band The Tap, we are constantly joking about this and saying that we are the only band in the world that can collect enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
Moreover, in December you are going to give absolutely unique three concerts against the end of the world.
Could you tell the readers about this in more detail?
We are talking about a nationwide fundraising event, which we have been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential that the Mayan calendar has, the end of which was announced on December 21 at 11:10.
The day before this event, December 20th at 21:00 in parallel will start three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end, roughly speaking, at a time when on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific Ocean, the time zone of which is 12 hours earlier than ours, the May calendar will end.
Who came up with this idea?
Initially, it was my idea, then we all came up with our artist Gonza Augusta.
In addition to the fact that we want to accumulate enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want to think with the public about the state of this world we will one day hand over to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the May calendar, we created a unique collection of items made of shoes, T-shirts, bags and original keys against the end of the world. These things can be purchased on the website www.e-tap.cz and thus provide us with support.
The band The Tap Tap, along with other musicians, also performed an anthem against the end of the world, which is called "The End of the World is Cangoed."
Will the YouTube-loving anthem already loved by YouTube at these benefits concerts?
Of course, at the very end, if in the end everything will work out and the end of the world will not come.
He will be sung by all the performers at all concerts at the same time.
The hymns will also sound live on Czech television.
The lyrics to this song were written and played the role of Jesus in the video Tomasz Ganak, also involved in the performance of Xindl X.
How did you start working with them?
We also cooperate with other people of Czech cultural life, as we hold many charitable events and concerts.
We try to actively connect them to these projects.
It turned out that many people like to work with us, they are interested.
What will the proceeds from the concert against the end of the world?
For the purchase of equipment for the barrier-free educational center STUDEO, for the sixth year we have been working with the civil association Tap at the Institute of Edlikka.
Teachers regularly attend students of the schools of the Institute of Idlicchka and conduct fun and interesting events with them.
The students themselves do not have the means to go to the teachers, and we try to give them this opportunity in this way.
Within the framework of the project of additional construction of the Institute, a separate building will arise separately, in which we will move with this project.
Several musical bands and performers will perform at each concert.
What were the selection criteria?
We tried to create a program that will interest all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague will perform Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bart, The Tap Tap, Mariana Bango and Jiri Suhi.
All details can be found on the website www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning any such "grandmary activities" in the future?
In May, we will perform for the first time at the festival "Prague Spring" and here, of course, we will prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year we would be happy to have a show at the Czech National Home in New York, and I personally, if we are in the United States, I would very much like to speak in Washington and Chicago.
As for abroad, you have serious plans, you have already performed in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you cope with the road in terms of organization and logistics?
It's not as scary as it seems at first glance.
We have five participants on electric wheelchairs, their strollers must travel in the luggage compartment, plus a large number of cargo and boxes with tools.
However, while they were able to cope with this without problems. Czech airlines and British Airways have always been excellent for us, which has been surprising for us, which has been surprising to me how many times.
Even in Moscow, where we recently returned, everything went without problems.
Thanks to travel abroad, you can compare different countries in terms of accessibility, public attitude to the disabled, and so on.
What have you faced so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other countries, where everything functions better than ours, in Russia we have witnessed that the East is still at the basic level.
Compared to Prague in Moscow, there are a lot of barriers, and here is still the outlandish of an independent movement of a person on an electric wheelchair in the city center.
Also there are not in the course of such banal things as to give way to a disabled person in an elevator.
Fortunately, there are already public organizations that try to draw people's attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
And what, on the contrary, we must constantly catch up with advanced countries?
There are a lot of things that are far behind.
But it is important to clarify that the improvement and improvement of the situation always depends on the efforts of those people concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is quite normal that people with severe disabilities move on their own on the streets, can go to the toilet, to the museum, and anywhere.
It is not very common that a large number of people with disabilities are actively involved in public life, in this we are with The Tap Tap a little ahead of them!
Respect for the public or barrierlessness is one thing, but at a time when well-known athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers will appear among us, then everything will really begin to change.
So far, these are isolated cases - people with strong will.
The band The Tap Tap is now very popular, but let's go back two years ago, what made you organize in 1998?
I went to the Edlich Institute as a teacher, there were a lot of young people around me who wanted to do something.
And since I am a musician myself and play on the saxophone, together with my colleague organized an interesting musical circle.
Well, and over time, as our presenter Ladja Angelovich says, it got out of control a little (laughs).
Has the popularity come only in recent years, or am I confusing something?
It is true, we were helped by the fact that we began to join the famous singers and actively work on the propaganda of the group.
We have come to the conclusion that a job that no one can appreciate is essentially as if they don't exist.
Thanks to the European Union, we can afford qualified teachers, equipment and so on.
Was your goal to promote The Tap Tap so well?
From the very beginning, I felt their potential in the ability to do something extraordinary.
The show business is full of things that imitate one another.
It's logical, everything new is taken with caution, and it lasts a long time.
There are very few rare things, but I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us, of course, pity, is natural.
But this pity is completely superfluous, because people with disabilities are not some suffering and all the abandoned personalities that we should regret.
They are people who can live a full life and develop, of course, only if they have the necessary resources.
I say that if people with disabilities do something, it's a shift not only for them, but for the whole society.
Did the success ensure that you are a strict leader, as many believe you?
If we want to do a job qualitatively, we must be in many things uncompromising and keep a certain discipline.
But I think it's normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic performance and fly in the clouds, and when they find out that they should go to rehearsals twice a week, attend preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the road, very quickly lose enthusiasm.
But that happens in any group that wants to work and achieve something.
It currently has the band The Tap Tap twenty.
How many were there in early 1998?
Only one Ladja Angelovich.
We are an open group, people come and go, it is impossible to prevent.
For those who have the will and power of will, our doors are always open.
It will take place the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21.00.
The concert will be held in Prague at the Incheba Stadium, in Brno - in the club Flida and Ostrava - in the center of Plynojem with the participation of 12 bands and other musicians of the Czech Republic.
At the end of the concert, all three cities are connected by a teleconference at the time of the performance of the song "The end of the world is canceled."
The purpose of this project is to raise funds in the amount of 25 million kroner for the purchase of multifunctional barrier-free equipment for the STUDEO educational center at the Edlicchka Institute in Prague.
A ticket to the concert costs 400 CZK, for children under 12 years old admission is free. Tickets can be purchased in advance at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and the space.
Last week, at a meeting of European Space Agency's ministers, Poland was adopted by the twentieth member of the European Space Agency as the second country from the former Eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of ESA on September 12, 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and took an active part in several of the agency's projects over the following years.
But Poland began the path to space much earlier.
Even before the Second World War, Polish enthusiasts were engaged in flights to space, but this was not always met with understanding.
Let me remind you, for example, of lectures A. Sternfeld, who on December 6, 1933 represented at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory ideas from his innovative work "Introduction to Cosmonautics."
Ideas of a young engineer (1905) left the audience indifferent, after several years Sternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadom was interested in his work.
In 1934, in France, Sternfeld won the Robert Esno-Peltri and Andre Luis Hirsch Award for "Introduction to Cosmos."
Dr. Jan Gadom (1899-1966), mentioned above, later became a great propagandist of astronomy and cosmonautics.
He has published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and has written a number of books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadom became a well-known world propagandist of cosmonautics, and his contribution was appreciated, among other things, by the fact that one of the craters on the far side of the moon was named in his honor.
Already in 1925 in Poland was built a railway rail, equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of this idea remained unknown, as well as the details of the project.
It is not even clear that a rocket was to be used for overclocking or braking the cart.
Information about this trunk is known only from the press of that era.
In 1933, Polish artillery began to think about rocket arrows.
The research was carried out by the Armament Engineering Section in cooperation with professors Mechislav Wolfke and Gustav Mokzytsky.
From the surviving materials it is clear that the research has reached the stage of practical tests.
But with the arrival of the German troops, the work was interrupted.
In 1937, the idea of a photovoltaic fighter rocket, which was proposed by the engineer Rogozinsky, appeared in a specialized seal, and the next year the work "Air Torpedo rocket and an aircraft bomb" of the author Levey-Kzhivoblotsky.
Both projects were developed for the military use of rocket engines.
Before the war, all the projects of the military use of missile technology were carried out by the Interim Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy), which coordinated all the work.
The committee was established in 1937, but after two years of its work, the work ended due to the outbreak of the war.
The next scientific work on cosmonautics appeared in the Polish press after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Society of Astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time, the society is mentioned in the November 1954 issue of the journal "Problems," which publishes four voluminous articles on astronautics.
One of them is Professor M. Subotovich proposed to organize a society that will deal with space exploration.
At that time, the projects of artificial satellites were already gaining momentum, and it was clear that space research was a promising industry.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Society of Astronautics (POA) tried to join the international federation of astronautics (founded in 1951), and in the autumn the POA became its full member.
And the following year, the first chairman of the POA Kazimezh Zarankevich (1902-1959) became Deputy Chairman of the International Federation of Astronautics.
In this position, he remained until his death, which occurred in 1959.
Since 1956, the POA has made a significant contribution to the development of a very successful meteorological missile RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket to perform scientific research.
The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on 10 October 1958.
The rocket, capable of overcoming the distance of 1800 m, was about 80 cm long, and its weight was less than 5 kg.
Subsequently, an improved version of the RM-1A was built, and in the summer of 1959, a two-stage RM-2 missile was tested at the Bledov wasteland.
This rocket was about 1.4 m long, and its weight was about 11.5 kg.
The next version of the rocket was already able to engage in real scientific work - the RM-34 missile could overcome 14.5 km, and its task was to monitor the high-altitude wind.
But in 1962, further development was suspended.
The heir to the first RM missiles was the Meteor-1 missile, developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was conceived as a two-stage, its total length was 510 cm, and the initial weight - 32.5 kg.
Three types were developed (designated as Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which differed in the size of the chamber for scientific equipment.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a space of 0.4 liters, Meteor-1V - 0.34 liters, and Meteor-1C - 0.62L.
The maximum flight range of all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Aviation Institute, and its first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket with a starting weight of 380 kg was capable of delivering a payload weighing 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
Then versions of Meteor-2N and Meteor-3 were built.
It is also worth mentioning the entry of Poland into the COSPAR (Committee on Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of the national committee of COSPAR two years later.
In addition, as part of the Intercosmos program, Poland participated in the exploration of outer space on Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslav Germashevsky became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remek.
The repeal of the public works law is not a solution.
Last week, the constitutional court annulled the law on public works.
The decree caused a lively discussion in society.
Undoubtedly, it will be interesting to look at the issue from a broader perspective.
Liberal-oriented economic systems in the EU, as well as in a globalized world, are based on the principle of multiple, unregulated economic competition.
In essence, this means that individual economic units, national economic systems, are in constant conflict with each other.
This is due to the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital, together with unbridled financial speculation.
As a result of the significant difference in the cost of labor (wages), price stress arises.
Under this concept, it is necessary to understand the state when the producer, through the delivery of a cheap product, tries to withstand economic competition by "killing" the value of the competitor in order to take over most of the market and thus increase its own income.
On a massive scale, this means for most entrepreneurs either the transfer of production abroad, or cheap purchases abroad, or disappearance. As a result, unemployment increases in those countries where the cost of labor, compared to others, is high.
Since private capital does not bear any social responsibility, including for the unemployment it has produced, the inevitable expenditures of the state for social needs are growing.
In general, the situation increases the unwillingness of the gentlemen of the entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thereby compensate for the social economic and social damage caused by them in pursuit of profits.
The situation is so well known that it is not necessary to provide specific statistics.
The unceremonious methods of private capital create a situation at the level of the economies of individual states, when governments of countries are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially reduce the social level of their population in order to attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments give their own people to private capital, despite social decline.
This is reflected primarily in the changes in the current legislation.
The aim is to economically compel their people to submit to the dictates of private capital, especially in the field of wages.
This acts as a system of economic coercion in the case of prolonged unemployment and at the same time serves as a tool to reduce the rights of workers in the field of labor legislation.
As a result, the poverty rate rises, and the difference between the poor and the rich.
In Germany for several years there is a public distribution of products to the poor, which are not able to feed themselves with their own labor.
The number of these people is already approaching a million.
As part of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, there are always cases when employed people receive such a salary that the state must pay them extra money for them to receive the subsistence minimum.
A similar scandal became known to the public in the case of additional employees of the Bundestag.
Economic measures in virtually all the southern EU states undoubtedly lead to the same state in which people under the pressure of the catastrophic fall in social status are forced to either emigrate, as it was in the 19th century, or to exist on a poor salary on the outskirts of society in the hope that private investment capital will someday come to the country.
However, it is asked where he will come from?
If capital comes from other EU countries, then poverty will move from one country to another, or it will not come at all, as the Chinese, Hindu, Brazilian, Turkish, Moroccan, Egyptian, African still works for a share of European wages.
This applies to the whole of Latin America.
The liberal theory and the media argue that the state cannot participate in the capital of its own economy, that a managed economy leads to an economic catastrophe.
Private capital insists that the state should not interfere with the economics.
It is necessary to answer the question whether private capital, now practically the manager of politics and the whole state, for its own selfish purposes, does not operate.
The unequivocal answer is yes.
The evidence is the existence of virtually omnipotent and ubiquitous lobbies in all states.
As a result, we have a hopeless situation in corruption, mutual benefits, in legislation where almost everything deserves punishment, but is not a crime.
In Germany, the situation is that state ministries, due to a lack of financial resources, entrust the development of bills to private law firms that are closely related to industry.
Then these bills are approved by the Bundestag.
All power comes not from the people, as the Western-type constitution says, but from financial and powerful groups that prefer their own interests.
It is obvious that the liberal-oriented democracy is now quickly in such a situation, as described by Appian in the work "The Crisis of the Roman Empire in the Days of Caesar and Pompeii": "The state has long been disintegrating, and the agencies are engaged in violence.
Bribes, illegal to receive mercy with stones and swords.
Bribery and corruption flourished without any prohibitions, and the people went to the elections with a pre-sold voice." .. .. "Seriously began to say that the only salvation in this terrible situation is autocracy and the need to choose an energetic person." Appian thought it would be Pompeii, but it was Caesar, who finally changed democracy to autocracy.
As in ancient times, modern society has its own reckless interests without taking into account the public interest.
Private capital is not inherently intended for social applications.
The present result is no different from the past: the unparalleled decline of the elite without any effort to carry out reforms of a deeper nature.
So the cause of the fascist and communist regimes we must seek in the reckless liberalization of economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
To date, the absence of these regimes and the existence of a liberal-type democracy can be perceived as a certain pause, after which the next round is expected.
First of all, it is tragic that the current elite completely ignores the consequences of hundreds of thousands of victims in the future, the humanitarian and social catastrophes that we are already witnessing, along with crimes against humanity, as we know from the old and new history.
The repeal of the public works law is not a decision or at least not forever.
Under the pressure of competition at both the international and national and European levels, the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to further reduce the social level.
Thus, this trend is systemic.
The solution is targeted political and social reforms, which will strengthen the share participation of the state in the economy, strengthen the role of citizens in the governance of the state and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society in favor of the state.
Israel: The Chaos Laboratory.
"Nothing will come out of the violence, and it can never come out" - Sting, the song "Fragile," where the main verse of the Refren is the words: "We do not forget what we are fragile."
"If my sons did not want wars, they would not have been." - Goutel Schnaper, wife of Meer Amschel Rothschild.
The latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip has always elicited a lot of responses.
Some are in favour of Israel, arguing its position that it has the right to self-defence, and the Palestinians are defensive, while others support the Palestinians, arguing in the racism of the Israeli State, the genocide committed against the Palestinian Arabs, and the Israeli State is credited with the role of a terrorist State.
I do not want to reflect on who in these repetitive waves of murders are a criminal, and who the victim, in the end, today's citizens of Israel, including self-governing territories, were born at the time of the current political situation, and were not witnesses to the beginning of violence.
My goal is to invite readers to look behind the curtain, to look at who, first of all, the tension that has been lasting 95 years (considering from the signing of the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small plot of the land of the Middle East.
Some of my reasoning is supported by historical facts, some of them derived from my own understanding of who or whose group of people is the main engine of events in modern history.
The history of mankind is, above all, the history of the struggle for power.
In every epoch we can find the same Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so clear is whether these people have always taken their own steps on their own, or whether someone who directed their actions to predetermined goals stood behind their throne.
It should be assumed that we live in a period when world wealth is concentrated in the hands of several persons, and that this concentration of money and the power that derives from them could not have occurred in the life of one generation.
Among the astronomically rich families, there is one that could be seen as the head of the octopus (I don't know if anyone is above them, but that's not ruled out) - Rothschilds.
They are not written much.
Of course you are.
The first Reuters bought the first news agency (Reuters) in the 90s of the 19th century to stop the rumours linking their name to criminal acts in the higher realms in the shadows of which they were, and which always led to the strengthening of their power, increasing wealth, or at the same time, for both.
They have large stakes in almost all central banks in the world, and against countries in whose central banks they do not have their share, they are waging or preparing a war (before the invasion of Afghanistan there were only 7 countries, after the invasion of Iraq became 5 countries, after the overthrow of Gaddafi remained only four, but at the same time the Russian government took the central bank of its country in their hands).
Anyone who tried to resist this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to retain the status of the central bank for the Rothschild Bank of America, during the civil war, he began to issue his own (understand - government money) and was killed in 1865 in the theater.
John F. Kennedy began issuing his own money and wanted to cancel the FED (the federal reserve system), was killed in 1963. MP Luis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the FED for unleashing the Great Economic Crisis in 1929.
Their thirst for world power between 1859 and 1871 led to the development of a plan of three world wars created by the great Masonic 33 level Albert Pyak.
The first war was the destruction of monarchical states in Europe, the second was to destroy colonial domination, especially Britain, and the third should lead to a reduction in the world population to about 0.5-1 billion. man (so many slaves will be sufficient to ensure their comfort and luxury, and they will not consume many resources), the creation of a single universal religion (ecumenism can be nothing but a prerequisite for such a project) and the final seizure of absolute power.
The method by which a group of wealthiest families, led by the Rothschilds, is the challenge of the crisis and the subsequent proposal of solutions (order ab chao - order out of chaos).
But these decisions are false and always lead to a worsening situation. The FED is the reason for the FED, which was to prevent the recurrence of the crisis they caused in 1907.
Thus, after they managed to unleash the First World War by killing the Habsburg heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed Tsarist Russia, starting the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended with the sudden, unreasonable, military and economic surrender of Germany (there was no longer the need for war to destroy tsarist Russia) and, as a result, there was a fragmentation of the Central European Power, Austria-Hungary.
To facilitate the outbreak of World War II, the bankers and politicians created a hidden conflict situation, superimposing huge military reparations on Germany, which created the precondition for the radicalization of the impoverished masses, then it remained only to throw the Germans a strong enough, denouncing the guilty and proposing the chief's simple solutions, to further create a multinational Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which was to play, and really played the function of the fifth pillar of the war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds provoked the foundation of the Zionist movement, one branch of which sought to create a Jewish state, preferably in the area of historical Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
Balfour's above-mentioned declaration created a precondition for mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, and the first clashes with the local Arab population began to occur.
Terrorist attacks have occurred on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, it is difficult to assess whether Hitler broke out of the chains in which he was originally held by the bankers, or whether everything he did was planned, in any case, the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the prerequisites for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, just as Germany was provoked by military reparations for World War II, the State of Israel was proclaimed to create a hotbed of war for the third.
If international bankers manage to unleash it, the Jewish people, as in the Second World War, will become victims of hostilities on the front line, now, together with the Arab or, more simply, Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a gigantic laboratory, a source of discord and chaos not only inside the country, but also at the international level (to take only the sharp division of people into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is to blame, and who is the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where resentment creates resentment in an endless chain of violence, if it all began with the greed of individuals and their desire for world power?
It is necessary to distinguish the ordinary people of Israel from their leaders, because, like ours, international bankers lend only their own candidates to vote in the elections.
Israel's current hawk Prime Minister Netanyahu is a typical example of a fascist, fascist, loyal to international bankers, who does everything to start a war with Iran, which, thanks to Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan ...), will threaten to escalate into a global conflict, and given Iran's control of the Strait of Hormuz, containing 20% of all world oil reserves (the world corridor is only 2, the world's is only 2.
In what light is now manifested by the words David Rockefeller in 1994: "All we need is a general crisis, and people will accept a new world order."
The new world order in their representation is the world of lords and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves a handful of financial aristocracy enjoying comfort.
A world where every birth-born organism is implanted with a chip with which it becomes a creature under total control.
And it compels all the small and great, rich and the poor, free and slaves to have on the right hand, or on the forehead a stamp, so that a man who is not placed by the name of the beast, or by the number of his name, could neither buy nor sell.
This is wisdom: everyone who has a mind can calculate the number of the beast.
For it corresponds to the name of man, and the number is six hundred sixty-six.
"Operation Argo": When there is no worse, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob of Islamist demonstrators seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the deposed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled after the U.S. revolution, which had been patron of his regime for decades.
For the US administration, the situation was not expected - it could not afford to throw the Shah overboard, because it could fundamentally undermine the confidence of the allies in other countries.
However, to achieve the release of hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was unable.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later reinforced by an unsuccessful attempt to free the hostages by force.
The prisoners were finally released 444 days after negotiations with the mediation of the Algerian government.
Their fate caused a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment at home.
The defeat in Iran greatly contributed to the defeat of Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election culminating in the election of Ronald Reagan.
The film, directed by actor Ben Affleck, "Operation Argo" describes one of the episodes of the story that brought America small victories.
Shortly before the embassy, six workers managed to escape.
After the difficult vicissitudes, they finished their journey at the residence of the Embassy of Canada.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, managed to pick them up from Iran, while the extravagant legend of the cover helped, according to which they went on Canadian passports as members of the film crew, who were looking for a place in the country to shoot a science fiction epic.
Combination of genres
The plan, which was invented by the expert on "evacuation" Tony Mendes, demanded the cooperation of Hollywood.
In order for the legend to be reliable, in specialized magazines it was written about the project of the film, press conferences were held, a fictional production company had a real office.
Details of the operation have been kept secret for a long time, the film is based on the memoirs of Tony Mendes.
Affleck's film is a special combination of several genres.
On the one hand, the real political thriller, the so-called "movie-kinopus," the story of a successful idea, scam - an example can be a number of films about Ocean's friends.
The film constantly changes the mood - on the one hand, documented scenes from Tehran (the credits show iconic historical photos of events and how the same situations were demonstrated in the film - there are no big differences in this).
On the other hand, lighter Hollywood excerpts, intersecting with irony and moderate exaggeration.
And then the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in costumes discuss the situation at the negotiating tables, on the stairs of institutions, on the phone ...
Ben Affleck was able to make a restart of his career.
From the ridiculed actor became a respected director, and his game ceased to be the object of ridicule.
"Operation Argo" his third feature film, after the dark detective "Farewell, Baby, Goodbye" (2007) and the thriller "City" (2010).
At the same time, it is Affleck's first film that is not filmed in the director's hometown of Boston.
The feeling of the atmosphere of the place refers to the qualities that raised the director's earlier films over the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck shows it in Argo, where Tehran "plays Canada.
The best scenes in the film take place on the streets, when reconstructing real events - the introductory scenes of the fall of the embassy impress with their clarity, which also conveys the emotions of confusion and unpreparations that arise when the story suddenly changes.
A similar effect Affleck and his colleagues achieve in the scenes of fictional (a forgery headquarters at the Tehran bazaar).
Too many processes in too many places.
The director had to deal with the fact that the narrative does not involve many exciting scenes of cinematic significance.
He works quite successfully with this little, sometimes something is thought of - there it all comes out not so elegant (the scene in which the phone call in America prevents the impending crisis at the airport of Tehran, and the pursuit on the runway looks quite far-fetched).
The disadvantage of "Argo" is the distraction associated with the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman as Hollywood colleagues are really charming, but their characters would deserve more space, and they are not the only ones in the film.
Affleck's film lacks a bit of drama, a film that can be watched with moderate interest, evaluating the production and retro style recreating the thrillers of the seventies.
But it's hard to catch.
However, this is enough to remind one, still in a sense of living history, as well as for evidence of how exaggerated the notions of the almighty and all-knowing intelligence services.
Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and circus
The portal www.bankovnipoplatky.com, conducting an annual survey of the most absurd bank fees, has now decided to announce a competition for "the most absurd or project from the EU workshop."
"We were encouraged by the latest event in which the EU plans to adopt a 40 percent quota for women in the administration of large European companies," said Patrick Nager, the organizer of the questionnaire.
Among the already nominated absurdities is the recent decision of the European Court of Justice to combine the rate of insurance premiums for men and women.
So far, women have had life insurance benefits because they are objectively less at risk for insurance companies.
"Further incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be nominated for the competition until the end of this year.
The vote itself will take place before the end of February 2013," Nager said.
The disputed EU orders include, for example, the mandatory addition of biocomponents to the fuel, which harms the nature, as well as a ban on the use of reliable mercury thermometers only because they contain a relatively small number of dangerous substances, or a directive on the size of the cage for chickens, as a result of which this year the eggs have risen significantly.
The actual ban on the use of the term "sandwich oil" or the removal from the sale of classic light bulbs was also criticized.
Qualitative bananas should be 14 centimeters long.
The pan-European apparatus often makes a decision under the pressure of a trade or industrial lobby, whose positions in Brussels are usually protected by any state or group of states (thus the Czech Republic now defends the demands of its banks).
The interests of the lobby are as follows: for example, bananas of the highest quality in the European Union had to reach a length of 14 cm and did not dare to show "anomal curvature."
At the same time, the European Commission was justified by the fact that it only harmonizes the existing disparate national rules that complicated trade.
The EU, despite the resistance of some States, has eased standards for fruits and vegetables, citing the fact that existing directives will lead to waste of products.
The candidate for the winning in the survey can be last year's EU ruling, according to which the sold balloons must be provided with a warning that children under eight years old can not inflate them without adult supervision.
The EU has turned to U.S. research, according to which balloons in the game are a potential cause of death of children through suffocation.
Such a restriction now applies to children under the age of 14, who are forbidden to blow into fair-marked dudets.
Funny ideas are born and at home.
The rule concerning European officials themselves is rather absurd: anyone who has any official position in the EU cannot, given the sensitivity of the topic for Greece, use the name of Macedonia, and should instead say "Fairship" (the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The portal Bankovn-poplatky.com, in cooperation with the association of liberal economists "Laissez Faire," proposed for voting, in addition to the above-mentioned absurd rules, for example, the EU rule on the volume of food supplies in the territory of the member state.
The EU has set the maximum amount of food supplies that may be located in the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of its accession to the European Union.
Subsequently, the Czech Republic exceeded, for example, the established volumes of canned mushrooms, for which she threatened a large fine.
The organizers of the questionnaire were also interested in the idea of paying some countries for the fact that they do not have the sea, and the idea of granting subsidies for subsidies for subsidies.
But these ideas originated in Prague, not in Brussels.
"We are at a disadvantage because we don't have a sea.
We will ask the European Union for compensation," then Minister of Agriculture Yaroslav Palace (ESD) said in the autumn of 2004.
As an argument, he pointed out that the country had a high yield of grain, and as a result of the so-called interventional purchases, the state had full stock depots that needed to be exported.
For the fact that the Czech Republic is far from the ports, the EU, according to the Palas, had to pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
As a result, the European Commission went to meet the Czech Republic, organizing a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that are not accessible to the sea.
The subsidy for the subsidy was offered to the villagers by the Ministry for Regional Development, headed by Minister Pavel Nemz (US-DEU), in particular, such subsidies were to be made to draft subsidies from Brussels.
EU: Fancy orders are an exception
Although the rulings in member states are easily criticized, EU regulatory efforts, as well as the EU's more effective functioning and development, many experts believe, deserve recognition.
A serious problem, according to experts, is the drawing of EU subsidies to projects that do not even have a hint of something in common with the deepening of European integration, but which Member States have achieved in the discussion of the budget.
It is emotion among the Czechs and the fact that, as in other EU countries, the Czech Republic should fight in Brussels for the right to specifically identify its traditional products, and it does not always win in this competition.
Although the Czechs after six years of fighting with the Germans and Austrians preserved the name "Olomoucian cheese," but "Tuzemsky rum," the traditions of which in our country go back to the 19th century, our producers had to rename to "Tuzakak."
Only products from cane distillate, and not sugar beet products can be called rum.
In the official list of registered products of the EU, along with the world-famous cheeses "feta" and "gorgondzola," marzipan from the German Lubeck or Parm ham, already turned out to be, for example, the Carlo-Bulvar croutons, the Pogorjelic and the trchebon carp and the zhetek hops.
Also, the European Union's trademark can be proud of the pardubik gingerbread and Gorzhysky straws.
"People want me to protect the republic, but I'm a lover," Okamura says.
Mr. Senator, how does a man think of running for president?
I don't think of becoming a senator or president.
If everything in our country was without problems, I would not run anywhere.
But I can no longer see how the country has been stolen over the past 20 years, how thieves are fussing, people are raising taxes and the retirement age.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something I don't like, I try to find a solution to how to change it.
And since I am forty years old and I am an independent person who is not a party, I have no other opportunity to influence things other than to run for a senator or president.
You went to the Senate, but you soon went to the presidential castle.
Are you turning your back to the people who have chosen you?
I've always said that I will be involved in the fight for the presidential castle, depending on the outcome of the Senate election.
Later I said that if I was elected a senator, I would run for president.
My goal is not a position, a position is the instrument by which I can carry out my views.
So I need the most influence and the widest powers.
But the difficulty is not only that we, as a nation murmuring in our bar or at the TV, but are ready to trample anyone who will try to change something.
To this are added to the media, which denigrate a person, and which confuse freedom of speech with freedom of lies.
For example, they told me that I was bribed to journalists, or that I was an adviser to Jiri Paroubek.
Let's move on to your views.
You began the struggle for the presidential castle with theses about the material and criminal responsibility of politicians and the inverse property declarations in the amount of more than twenty million.
To do this, the law must be changed.
You do not have such powers as president, and only an entire senate can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When I lobbied as a citizen for the tours to become free enterprise, it was possible to promote it.
The problem is politics - when someone comes with a good offer on the left or right, they are deliberately obstructed, and it restrains citizens.
As an independent non-party man, I have much greater potential to get support from all parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that without party folding on the shelves, without looking at the dogmas, I can take from every party what is best for our country, and apply it.
Do you consider yourself a person who is more related to the right or the left?
From the Czech point of view, it seems to me that people refer me to the left.
It doesn't matter to me at all - a little to the left or a little to the right.
It is important to me that we go forward.
It's not that someone's right-handed, it's someone to the left, I want to bring people together.
I will always support any good decision for society, whether it will offer it to the HREM or the GDP, and I will also oppose a bad idea.
You get angry when someone says you're a populist.
But do you not prove this by what you said?
When you create a business plan for a company, you also have some perfect goals and views.
And you try to get closer to that.
You can call it populism, but all the proposals I'm talking about are already functioning in the world, or they are spoken of by prominent experts.
But without the support of the Parliament, you will have only slogans.
And with this in politics, you will not last long.
Or do you think that when you go out to people and talk to them, you will be able to implement criminal and financial responsibility?
I don't have another opportunity.
Just convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to lure them to our side so that we can achieve ours.
If I were elected president, there would be no problem of organizing a live television broadcast in which I would like to appeal to the presidents of the parliamentary parties to legitimize material and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
And they, in case of refusal, will have to tell you why they do not want it.
If there is a strong personality that voices the abuses, then it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
Take the direct presidential election - it was a merit of the pressure from the public.
I am directly telling you that I am an amateur, not a genius or an intellectual.
I try to find allies to defend my beliefs and beliefs.
I am only a novice in politics, and for my program I will try to get the support of the majority.
I'm trying to push on my own; if it doesn't work, I'll finish it in six years and get back to the private sector.
It partly sounds like Okamura has to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know I'm not going to do anything alone, so I bypassed a number of famous people with an offer to run for the Senate.
I went to the Radium of Janchout, he refused due to a lot of work.
I also at least supported the leading investigation journalist Jan Lorentsov, who uncovered fraud with light fuel oil products.
I put forward my candidacy because people are really dissatisfied, but now I feel on the scales.
Sixty percent of people did not go to the election, and most of those who went to choose the establishment.
There are only two of us independent in the Senate.
People chose the Senate so that the changes will be carried out with difficulty.
Despite this, I will fight for my views, for example, for the direct election of mayors and governors.
Do you think of the foundation of your own party?
I haven't thought about it yet, because I don't have time to check the purity of every potential supporter of the past, and I don't have money for it.
There is no money for the presidential campaign, only twenty thousand kroner in my transparent account.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about property declarations, and how are your own affairs with this?
Personal property is estimated at approximately 60 million.
I have a plot in Prague worth about 25 million, an apartment for 10 million, another apartment for 8 million, an art collection of about 10 million, astons Martin for 3.5 million and Skoda Superb for a million, and a few more million on the account.
By the way, Aston-Martin I had, because it was my boyish dream - I always liked James Bond, who was driving, was haranttened with women, and at the same time fought against meanness and lawlessness.
Do you drive Aston Martin, own property for 60 million and don't have money for a campaign?
You say you want to change the republic, but you don't want to invest your own money in this.
It's not very convincing.
I don't have $15 million on the campaign.
Should I get into debt?
I have already invested 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have sponsors indicates that my program is not so interesting.
And I don't have to pay for the campaign out of my pocket.
The cost of the campaign will in fact be covered by the senatorial salary.
But with this money I would not have lived, for example, I could not pay my son for an English school, which costs 30 thousand monthly.
If I wanted to make money, I wouldn't run anywhere.
So you'll continue to be in business so you can live?
Didn't you say that you will reduce this activity?
But it does not depend on the size of the salary.
As I promised, I partially reduced my activities.
For example, the managing director of the travel agency in the spring will be my deputy.
People would like to be an imbumer who will keep the republic.
But I need to live on something, too.
How much, as an entrepreneur, are you used to getting monthly?
From two hundred to four hundred thousand that I get further.
And if I were president, I would have finished my business.
A full interview you will find in the Saturday issue of the newspaper "Pravo."
MVRDV architects prove that real adventures are not only in imagination - on the example of Speikenis and its newly built Book Mountain - 2 photos
"This building seems fun to me, it looks futuristic, finally we can see something interesting again," says Lisette Verheim, a passerby on the edge of the road.
And Stefan Spermont, an IT specialist at a nearby large enterprise, believes: "No, this building is really beautiful."
But I ask myself, why do we need another library today?
Everyone has the internet, iPad and e-books.
Now no one voluntarily goes to such old-fashioned libraries, right?
The gamenceisse, an unremarkable sleeping town under Rotterdam, owns an unusual record.
Its population of 80,000 has the lowest education in the Netherlands.
To combat this annoying circumstance a few years ago, it was decided to contribute to the general education and build seven fictional bridges that are depicted on the euro banknotes, in the form of picturesquely painted miniatures of reinforced concrete.
The success of this educational initiative was modest.
And then the city's fathers realized that they had the only opportunity to overcome the statistics: to build a library here!
Vini Maas of the Rotterdam architectural bureau MVRDV, master of bold columnar diagrams and author of witty, sometimes even cynical buildings, treated the task with his usual equanimity and appeared at a competitive audition in 2003 with five books under the armpit and grin on the face.
And while the members of the jury looked confused and shrugged their shoulders, the daring Maas folded the pyramid from his original gift in size and completed the speech in defense of his project with the following words: "Dear citizens!"
Here it is, my suggestion: "Book Mountain" in Spaikenics, the so-called Bukenberg!
Nine years later, this mountain, worth 30 million euros, grew.
It is part of the revitalization project, which also includes an underground garage, a supermarket, a post office and several adjacent residential buildings and townhouses for a total of 50 apartments.
In early November, the Book Mountain was awarded the second prize of the contest "Best Library of the Netherlands 2012."
The project also participates in the national Dutch competition of wooden structures in 2012.
Thus, the faceless suburb, which previously could not offer anything but the postmodern pedestrian zone and the surprisingly ugly town hall, the white facades of which suggest the idea of the dairy, became richer on one modern work of architecture.
But most importantly, the first in the history of this town appeared the first in the history of this town a public building for cultural purposes.
The Long Road to the Book
First impression: book Eldorado under the hood for cheese.
There is only one elevator taking place in the center of the mountain range, because real fans of architecture and reading will prefer to explore this area on foot.
The glazed room on all sides is light and easily visible, floors of burned brick and elegant street lights unmistakably create a sense of public city square.
The urban environment is perfectly recreated.
The look is involuntarily looking for benches, dogs and boys and girls playing football.
And everywhere - books, books, books.
"Usually, book shelves stand along the facades, and in the middle there is a large dark hall, usually inconvenience and faceless," says Vini Maas.
We put the classical configuration of the space on its head and pulled the reading area from the inside out.
The inner space of the book mountain is used skillfully: in the center there are offices, Internet library, chess club, environmental center and technical premises.
Especially pleased black bookshelves, which serve as the decoration of the walls, the parapets, the stair railings.
Their appearance, texture and smell are unusual.
Even sophisticated architects and civil engineers are lost in guessing what the unknown is.
"We sought to work with secondary materials," explains Jop Trauborst, project manager representing the Speikenisse community, according to the standard.
And once at one agricultural enterprise in Friesland we met a suitable by-product of agriculture.
For many years in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands, artificial fibrous material of millimeter thickness is used as a lining under the roots.
It's cheap and saves time.
Thin textiles serve one or two seasons, after which it can be thrown away.
For the library, this canvas - for the first time in such volumes - was compressed in a panel four centimeters thick.
Under the influence of heat and pressure, the so-called Landbauplasto (KLP) turns into a dark, uniform, durable material, smelling a little like a new car and a little sneakers.
105 steps lead to the top.
The one who will overcome the path of almost 500 meters long will be rewarded in a literary cafe not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also by Dutch croquettes and wood wicks in pots.
They care about the atmosphere, and first of all about the right air humidity on the literary mountain.
Costs of a new soul
"It's hard to believe, but this building, despite a lot of glass surfaces, is an exemplary project in terms of ecology," says Trowborst.
The heat of the earth is used for its heating and cooling.
Although the Book Mountain stands under a glass cap, even on clear days the sun gets inside only briefly.
Wide farms made of glued wood, located perpendicular to the glass facade, give shade and take over most of the sun's rays.
The climate in the room is very pleasant.
The rest of the protection is provided by fully automatic roller blinds.
Stephen Spermon, mentioned above as a skeptic from the IT sphere, has already visited a new library.
Lisette Verheim was already here.
And also a teacher of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogard, who called Bukenberg "the soul of Speikenisse, which has long been missing."
Cause: A few weeks before the opening, each resident received an invitation to donate one book from his own collection.
These books were supposed to take empty spaces on the shelves of an unfully staffed library - at that time it had 70,000 books.
The idea worked.
The shelves are made upstairs.
"There's nothing worse than a half-empty library," says architect Vini Maas.
"I think that thanks to our invitation now every resident is somehow connected with this new house.
Everyone knows that their book is part of this building.
Even if it is only for the decoration.
Thus, MVRDV managed to solve the royal problem, which on a professional jargon is called the creation of identity.
Speikeniss wrote his literary history.
Let them be very young and uneducated.
This is only the starting point for building identity.
Sabo: "The Germans must play a more important role"
Germany abstained from the vote on the recognition of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on relations between the United States and Europe, in doing so, Berlin is balancing on a narrow diplomatic track.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany first made it clear that it would vote against the Palestinian application for observer status with the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained in the vote.
Why? Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support the Israeli actions in Gaza.
Germany must now be cautious about its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I believe that it does not support the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - not being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained from voting on the introduction of a no-go zone for flights.
NATO eventually held this proposal.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on complex international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
The fact is that it is in the process of transforming its foreign policy, namely, it moves from the policy, which, so to speak, was ruled by the United States, to the German foreign policy itself.
In addition, the situation is complicated by the fact that Europeans do not have a coordinated unified policy.
Thus, the Germans are again between the two fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I believe that so far they are only groping their role, but are on the way to a "more normal" foreign policy.
The foreign policy that France or Britain conducts.
What exactly does "normal" foreign policy mean from the German point of view?
It is a willingness to take a position in its national interest, independent of the position of the United States or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy depends on economic policy, that is, on exports and ties with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are very different from that of other major states, and Germany must therefore defend its interests.
Did these economic interests affect the position in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
First, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Gulf states.
It must therefore be cautious in order not to offend the public and the elites in the Arab countries.
In any case, it plays a role.
But I wouldn't give it too much of that, it's not a completely one-sided connection.
But in any case, this plays an important role in the calculations of the Germans.
Did Germany have harmed its relations with the United States, refraining from making important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I am sure that in Europe and even in the United States, the understanding of the German position prevails.
So I don't think it was as dramatic a breakdown as it did in the Libyan question.
Germany may even gain some respect.
After all, this signals that it should be taken seriously as a player in the international arena and that her interests should be taken into account.
There are different views on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
The United States, on the contrary, clearly spoke in favor of the veto.
Is there a divergence of opinions between the US and many European countries?
Because of American domestic policy, such differences have always existed.
I believe that the Obama government deep down has a sufficient understanding of the European position.
But due to the local political situation, the government, of course, cannot openly take such a position.
I believe that the significant differences of opinion are not as significant as it always seems.
If you consider the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is not at all excited about Netanyahu's policies.
Is it easy for Germany to combine its close ties with Israel and the United States on the one hand and the position of a crucial partner in the EU on the other?
I think that's what makes the situation so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be somewhat easier for the Germans if there were a single, consistent European policy, but now it is not.
They are therefore unable to act within a broader approach and are forced to act instead, based only on their own vision of the situation.
That's what they do with the euro.
I think that in the future Germany will take the lead in developing a common European position.
It is clear that this is not easy for Germany, at least because of ties with Israel.
This topic has always been tickling.
But I think it's clear to the Germans that they should play a more independent role.
If Germany sees itself as an important international player - will it really take the lead?
Or is the leading role still hard for Germany?
Germany is not yet accustomed to this, it is still unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult to play a significant role.
Consider, for example, the euro crisis - every time Germany takes on an important role, a variety of anti-German feelings are manifested.
The Germans don't just deal with it.
In fact, this is an old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much worse situation than the United States.
It should take into account a variety of neighbors and opinions, and this is not easy.
So, the influence of the US in European policy is constantly weakening, but at the moment the EU does not fill this vacuum, who remains?
The Germans will have to play a bigger role.
Even if you don't like it, unpleasantly or increases your dislike for you - that's life!

"Protection Security" in China: When Puma and Armani Will Suddenly Become Chinese
Armani is a world-renowned trademark, Polo Ralph Lauren, too.
What is Armani Polo?
It is a completely officially registered name in China that has nothing to do with the firms from whose names it is formed.
However, it will be guarded until the owners of the original names are sued.
But it is not clear whether they will be able to defend their rights.
"It's getting harder for foreigners to defend their trademarks in China," says Thomas Pattlech, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing, a trademark infringement in the Far East.
On my desk every week appears on a new case of this kind.
It is enough for simulators to add just a couple of letters to get the right to register their trademarks.
So from Gucci is Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada you can register Prada-Kny.
German businesses, such as the manufacturer of sports goods Puma, are legally copied in this way.
Pattloch opens a folder with records of the trademark registration department in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, the Chinese company registered the Zegna DF Puma trademark, the artificial name that also used the name of the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
The fact that the Chinese are world champions in copying and infringement of intellectual property rights is known.
In large cities there are multi-storey department stores that sell almost exclusively fakes.
But Pattloch's cases are not. On the instructions of his principals, he opposes that Chinese enterprises will officially receive from the department of registration of trademarks the right to use the name, which is already protected somewhere else.
The Chinese call it "ban minpei," a passenger brand.
This word is associated with "bab dakuan."
This is the name of women who hunt for rich men.
Chinese authorities do not admit guilt
"This is detrimental to the business, it is necessary to fight against this," - said Pattle.
"The trade mark is blurred, the unique position is lost, the image suffers very much."
Financial losses and procedural costs in the affected industries are estimated at millions, especially in the case of expensive copied products.
According to the CLSA market research company, China with sales of 15 billion euros per year is the third-largest and fastest growing luxury market.
However, it is difficult to achieve the removal of dubious records in the register of trademarks, and it is expensive.
The process can last up to nine years, with an unclear outcome.
Pattloh talks about cases in which the court rejected the lawsuits, since after a long time the protested name became "the real estate of the market."
If the plaintiff is not lucky, he will even have to pay the plagiarist, as he has caused damage to his trademark in China, says Pattle.
Sometimes the law of the jungle rules.
There are also famous graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a lawsuit with the manufacturer of construction machines Sany, a company that recently acquired the manufacturer of concrete pumps Putzmeister.
Therefore, the Chinese still have the right to use the emblem, similar to the star Mercedes.
The purchase of Volvo Geely originally used a blue-and-white logo reminiscent of BMW; the process was successful, Geely had to change it.
The manufacturer of fashion products Lacoste lost in China to simulators from Hong Kong and Singapore, whose famous crocodile looked the other way.
The Chinese authorities do not consider themselves guilty.
The CTMO Trademark Registration Office in Beijing confirms that in 2010 due to the lack of staff and equipment of the premises there were difficulties.
But last year there was a "return from an emergency in the work process to the norm."
Thus, the number of unprocessed cases on objections decreased by 22 percent.
Nearly 57,000 such cases were closed, 75 per cent more than last year.
However, 81,500 claims are still awaiting production in the department.
It's expensive to fight it.
As often in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million applications for the protection of trademarks, almost a third more than in 2010.
This is a record and means that China for the tenth time in a row topped the list of new registrations around the world, the agency reports.
The same applies to the total number of real trademarks, only 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan was paid.
If simplified, it means that each registration costs an average of 1,280 yuan or 160 euros.
It is worth protesting many times more, as the case of the German family enterprise Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the concern has been fighting against the Chinese plagiarist.
The Germans managed to ensure that the illegal production of fake car parts he was eliminated.
However, the simulator secured Chinese rights to the trademark Freudenberg.
It was its own omission, as the names in Germany are not protected, says Hanno Wetzler, chairman of the board of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
And the CTMO trade marks registration department rejected the Munichers" claim.
True, in both the following instances, Freudenberg won, but the opposing side continues to fight so far.
You must be on the vigilance.
The issue is now under consideration in the Supreme Court.
Wentzler hopes to bring the matter to a good conclusion and praise the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, "The process is extremely expensive and it takes a lot of time, money and nerves from us."
The internal costs are hardly accountable, the company's archive had to be viewed even acts a century ago to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg unsuccessfully offered the opposing side "a large six-figure amount of euros" for a settlement.
"It is clear how expensive it is for us," says Wentzler.
The dangers of the Far East threaten to spread even to Europe.
In the event that the simulators register unprotected trademarks.
So, one Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather goods.
The concern has long stopped production in these areas, but despite this, it was able to prevent registration.
"We need to be on the vigil," says Wentzler.
Both he and Pattloch's lawyer recommend that German businesses be very cautious with China.
It is not enough to rely on international provisions on the protection of trademarks, rather, foreigners should "everything worth protecting, registering in China as well," says Wentzler.
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg loses in the last act of its drama about the trademark, he will have to pay the opposing party license fees for his own name, Wentzler explains.
Otherwise, we will be driven out of the market in the disputed segment.
World AIDS Day: to trample, to sing, to help
In Heidelberg rehearses the choir of Imbbha - and in Swaziland orphans rejoice in this.
The history of relations that covered the distance of more than 8733 kilometers.
First, flooding is heard: cowboy boots, basketball sneakers, ladies' boats and men's slippers pick up the tact on the parquet floor and quickly find it.
One or two or three or four.
Only after that, the voices of the singers - alto, bass, tenor and soprano - slowly grow, faint and follow each other.
And Fite Hopf, a 29-year-old conductor, almost pops up from his mother-in-laws when he leads them with flexible and expressive gestures.
Monday evening, in the music hall of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the Imbongi choir rehearses a new song.
At the rehearsal came fifty participants of the choir from 23 to 69 years, from a specialist in human genetics to a janitor.
"Om "Obani" is not an easy thing, every voice of the choir has its own text, in a completely foreign language: Zulus, which is spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in some parts of Swaziland.
Self-help assistance
According to the assessment of Unaids, the United Nations AIDS programmes, there are about 34 million HIV-positive people worldwide.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
There are 245,000 AIDS orphans in Swaziland.
At the same time, more than 40 percent of the population is HIV-positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esijency, the association Voices for Africa found chefs in Germany.
70 of them attend a school preparing for further education.
For 15 or 20 euros per month you can take over the patronage.
It guarantees the child money for school, school uniforms and daily hot lunch in the Goga Center.
Imbongi in the Zulu language means a narrator or praiser.
In this room they do not speak fluently on the bantu, but they know how to sing.
For almost ten years, the choir learns songs in this foreign soft language and from time to time even bringing them back to where they first appeared: to South Africa.
After all, at a distance of 8,733 kilometers from Heidelberg, in the north-west of the kingdom of Swaziland, is the village of Esitri, which depends on the voices of the German choir.
Infected by 40 per cent
There are about 2,000 people living there, some still in simple huts of clay and straw, among the inhabitants there are many children.
More than 300 of them were left without parents who died from the IH virus.
In Esitrigeni, the disease of Swaziland is reflected in miniature: the highest HIV infection rate, the world's lowest life expectancy according to UNICEF.
Circumcision of the foreskin in men, which has proven to reduce the risk of infection by half, is almost not accepted among the population.
More than forty percent of the population of Swaziland carry the immunodeficiency virus, death in the middle of the fourth ten is not uncommon.
The choir opened this village on a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, but previously Imbunghi saw many children on the streets who lacked not only parental care, but simply food, clothing, education.
Without schooling, there is no chance for a person in a poor country.
At first, it was a private commitment of individual participants - for a few euros a year to send the child to school and give him the opportunity to get hot food once a day.
But a year later, the choir founded the Voices for Africa association, which has since taken almost professional care of AIDS orphans in Esitrizhe.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlahidyosis and trypper (gonor).
Frequent viral STIs are HIV, human papillomavirus, genital herpes and hepatitis.
The forehead lice and scabies are parasitic STIs.
What are the main affected groups?
Syphilis and gonorrhea are found mostly in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute assumes that in at least four out of every five cases of syphilis reported in Germany, the transfer occurs as a result of sexual intercourse between men.
Heterosexual adults with frequently occurring sexually transmitted diseases are chlamydia infections, trichomoniasis, candidiasis (fung) feud, gonorrhea and human papillomavirus.
The prevalence of HIV among heterosexual adults is relatively low - but about 20 percent of new HIV infections occur in this group.
Among young people, chlamydia infections are more common than among other population groups.
According to European data, three-quarters of all infections affect young people from 15 to 25 years.
We also have human papillomavirus among young people.
How do the number of infections change?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to mandatory registration.
The incidence of syphilis, according to the Robert Koch Institute, more than doubled from 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been declining since 2007.
There were about 2,700 cases in 2011.
That's about one-tenth less than the previous year.
What symptoms indicate a venereal disease?
In infectious diseases, ulcers can occur in the genital area, complaints during urination, discharge, pain in the lower abdomen, as well as bubbles or seals.
However, they are often not accompanied by pain and other symptoms and remain unnoticed.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but do not provide 100% protection.
After all, part of the causative agents of sexually transmitted diseases can also spread through a contact infection and with close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend a regular examination, especially with frequent change of sexual partners.
With early diagnosis, most STIs can be cured and long-term effects can be avoided.
The chef, donations and not least the fees for the performances of the choir throughout Germany allow you to collect something.
"In total, we have sent about 200,000 euros to Esitrizhen," said Annete Lennartz, chairman of the association.
In the village, money from Germany is managed by Tsodva Dlamini, a conscious and active woman.
She also takes care that orphans are well arranged, for example, with one of the grandmothers.
Gogos, as the Zulhus old women is called, is the back of the village.
Some of them have received up to 14 orphans, give them a roof over their heads and take care that children in uniform appear in time in time.
Those who do not have a family go to the shelter to Haniyil, a lonely woman who receives a salary from the association, as well as two cooks, who every day prepare for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, the Association "Voices for Africa" organized a garment school, built two chicken coops and, together with the American health organization, PSI organized an HIV test for many villagers.
It is difficult to imagine, but the disease, which is so obvious throughout the country, prefer to be deeply silent.
King with 14 wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annete Lennartz, "because it's related to sexuality."
It is quite unusual for a country in which the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his love of excesses.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
In particular, the state-sanctioned lifestyle is also the fault of the fact that the IH virus spread so quickly in the past years.
But it also lies on stray workers who carry the virus across the country.
Free condoms are literally on every corner, says Anneta Lennartz, "but they are almost not used.
Another culture is flesh to the flesh."
To support a little cultural exchange, the chorus Ibmoni every two to three years makes a trip to the south of Africa and sings songs full of sadness, morale, confidence and black identity, which many in the southern edge of the black continent know since the time of apartheid.
A bus full of whites who sing songs in black - such recognition not only brings a good mood and joy, but even, it happened, caused tears in the eyes of the harsh border guards.
The trip always leads to Esigeni, where singers visit sponsored children.
Despite the fact that the small village can hardly be found on the map, in the valley of the Eszalveny River it is more than known.
"Go to Esitrizheni, there is light," the people here say.
And after the 8733-kilometer flight back to Heidelberg, when the singers return to the rehearsal hall on Bergheimer Street, you can see that this light is also burning here.
Messenger: NASA opens ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence that Mercury has ice on the planet.
Ice cover can have a thickness of up to 20 meters.
The US Space Department of NASA has proved the presence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the Sun, there is also frozen water, as evidenced by three studies published on Thursday in the special journal Science.
The Messenger probe found evidence that the world's constantly shadowed region is covered with ice.
Its thickness should be at least 30 centimeters, and perhaps even up to 20 meters.
Presumably, water comes from a comet or possibly an asteroid colliding with Mercury.
No one associates the discovery of ice with the existence of life on the planet, said the scientific director of the probe Sean Solomon.
The temperature in Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
However, these discoveries could help explain how water and other building elements of life hit other parts of the solar system.
Indescribably for the inhabitants of the Earth, telescopes and small robots, such as the Phoenix, explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time they send images to Earth: small boxes in endless distances.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
Eight planets in our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres, according to a new definition of the international astronomical alliance of 2006, is not a "planet."
This fragment of the infrared image of the Spitzer telescope presents a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars in the form of blue dots, it is more difficult to identify pink "newborn" stars in the stellar circle.
This region of star formation - scientists are notromantic called it W5 - discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation Cassiopeia, 6,500 light-years away.
This overflowing heat of a dying star was photographed by NASA's Spitzer telescope.
A donut-like ring consists of material that the star threw away in the process of dying.
In the giant triphide nebula, 5,400 light-years from Earth, new stars emerge from gas and dust.
NASA's Spitzer telescope took this photo of the galactic maternity hall.
The Pleiada star cluster, also called the "Seve Sisters," can be seen with the naked eye at night.
Of course, the color with the telescope is better.
How the red eye winks the observer the Snail Nebula in this infrared image.
It is located 700 light-years in the constellation Aquarius.
The similarity with the earth's continent brought this nebula the nickname "North America."
The combination of normal and infrared photography provides expressive color reproduction.
This new star in all its beauty was photographed only with the help of infrared sensors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and its rings: How did they arise - one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
It may be a fragment of the moon of Saturn that disappeared without a trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the greatest and clearest images of the Hubble telescope: the Whirlpool Galaxy
Depending on the color of the transfer, images of spiral galaxies turn into real works of art.
The picture published by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifide nebula, remote several thousand light-years in the constellation Sagittarius.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (three-sided, tri-separated), as the dark stripes of dust are divided into three parts by the hot heart of the cradle of stars.
In the constellation of the Serpentine, astronomers photographed the harbinger of the cosmic collision: at a distance of 400 million light-years from Earth, the nuclei of two merging galaxies are rushing to meet each other and will inevitably collide.
This is the birth of the star's Hubble telescope was filmed in the spiral galaxy M83.
Anyone who doesn't like technical abbreviations can call it the nickname "Southern Tsevochny Wheel."
A photo of the Hubble Space Telescope shows a fragment of the Iris Nebula in the constellation Cepheus.
The nebula, remote for 1,400 light-years, consists of dust particles, the size of which is ten to a hundred times less than that of ordinary house dust.
This image was composed of optical and X-ray images of various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, 430 million light-years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, was photographed for NASA by the Hubble Space Telescope.
Scientists call the large spiral galaxy UGC 1810.
In this star nebula is the brightest group of new stars in our Milky Way.
The star cradle is constantly creating new stars.
This stellar cloud, coupled with the Rosette Nebula, is also constantly creating new stars - at a distance of 5,000 light-years from Earth.
This brightly luminous galaxy with a small black hole does not yet have dust, only gas.
The researchers suggest that it originated shortly before the Big Bang, when the universe was mostly hydrogen.
Our Views in the Universe: Most Important Telescopes
The telescope was probably invented in 1608 by Hans Lippersge - even before Galileo Galileo began observing the stars a year later.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have become more and more - and the spaces available to their eyes are deeper and deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale Telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror here was five meters in diameter.
In Arizona, USA, there is a "Big Binocular Telescope."
It allows you to look into space with two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
"Gran Telescopolio Canarias" has a giant internal device - the diameter of the mirror alone is 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the "Great South African Telescope" in South Africa is segmented - for the sake of reducing the cost.
However, in diameter it reaches about eleven meters.
The lack of inexpensive structural design: the telescope is rigidly bonded at a vertical angle - this limits its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberle telescope in Texas also has a fixed vertical angle.
Its feature: high light-cashing ability.
It reaches - despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror - the parameters of the world's largest telescopes.
With the help of a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico), researchers listen to extraterrestrial signals in space.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
Participating in the project "Search for an Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI), any computer owner can help by providing their computing power.
A view of the European Astronomical Service (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here stands "Very large telescope" - fully corresponding to its name.
Its four mirrors allow even the middle infrared spectrum to be illuminated in the visual tube.
The Chilean observatory ESO also plans to install the European "Very Large Telescope."
Its main mirror should be 42 meters away - and will be composed of almost 1,000 mirror elements.
However, the photos should not be expected until 2018.
Until 2007, both Keek telescopes on the Hawaiian Mauna Kea volcano were considered the largest in the world.
They have two mirrors with a diameter of ten meters.
The Kecke telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which, along with them, looks into the sky also with the help of the Subaru and IRTTF telescopes.
In addition, a new giant telescope should appear on Mauna Kea - with a mirror of thirty meters in diameter.
You can see them in the illustration here.
However, the most important species from space is supplied by the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has been supplying paintings of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been looking for planets outside the solar system - primarily those on which life is possible.
On February 2, 2011, NASA reported that 1,235 candidate planets had been discovered since the mission began.
The photo shows the latest preparations of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be sent into space not earlier than 2018 on board the Ariane 5 rocket.
The main mirror of the infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the telescope's tasks: it should look for the Big Bang by the light of the first stars and galaxies.
Scientists suggest that there is ice at the south pole of Mercury.
However, there is no reliable data about this, as the Messenger rotates closer to the north pole of the planet.
Radar measurements have pointed out for decades that Mercury has had ice.
Thanks to the 2004-launched Messinger probe - the first to revolve around Mercury - scientists are now sure.
Drink oil every day and live up to 168 years
In southern Azerbaijan, many residents reach a biblical age.
There is even a museum of longevity.
Search for a solution in a country where 97-year-old elders seem still relatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many residents reach a biblical age.
There is even a museum of longevity.
Search for a solution in a country where 97-year-old elders seem still relatively young.
A trip through the Talysh Mountains can be called wild and romantic.
A minibus with a rumbling rolls along a winding road past the hills, stormy rivers and simple peasant houses overgrown with dense forests.
Everything around is so green and bright that you might think that you are in the Black Forest.
But this is the southernmost region of Azerbaijan, the Iranian border is only a few kilometers away.
Here live the Talysh - one of the peoples of the Caucasus, about which little is known, is only that they speak fine in Farsi and Azerbaijan and differ in longevity.
The end point is Lerick.
The small town is flaunted by the Soviet-era too heavy architecture, which does not harmonize at all with the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe almost do not come here, the road from the Azerbaijani capital of Baku is too tiring.
It takes 323 kilometers for eight hours, as the road has only one lane.
The legendary wealth owed to the Caspian Sea oil owes here to the province until it has reached.
However, Pilata Fatulaeva (48) is convinced that there is something to interest tourists in Lerik.
"In May, Baku became famous for the Eurovision Song Festival - and next year we will have a festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulaeva.
She is the director of the museum of longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here is a biography of about eight dozen talits from these places, which are more than 100 years old. Fatulaeva points to a black and white photo.
This is my grandfather, he's 120 years old here.
At the age of 136, he had another child.
But the disputed star of the museum is the chaban Shirali Mueslylumov, who allegedly turned 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And taking into account the fact that the oldest person, whose age is confirmed by documents, turned 122 years old, Muslyumov's age seems extremely doubtful.
"He was born in the area in 1805, died in 1973," explains Fatulaeva.
The man was married three times, and he had 23 children, at the age of 136 he had a daughter.
So did chaban Muslyumov add a couple of decades to his age?
After all, even Rembrandt Scholz, an age researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, heard about the centenarians in Central Asia.
"Awesome elderly people can also be found in some areas of China, Japan, or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," Scholz said, "there are also extremely many very old people living in Sardinia."
However, due to the lack of documents, scientific confirmation of age is impossible, since there were no registers of civil status.
Every day a glass of ghee
However, there is a fact that people in the Lerik area are strikingly often reaching biblical age.
There are now 20 people over the age of 100.
Why are there so many centenarians here in the south?
Azerbaijani guide Farid Muhimzadeh explains this with special genes of Talysh.
The director of the museum Fatulaev, on the contrary, believes that it is a matter of nutrition.
Talyshis love meat, bread and dairy products the most, many of them drink a glass of ghee every day. However, it is unlikely that such a high-calorie diet can be healthy from a nutritional point of view.
Or is it a matter of primitive way of life that keeps people youth? In Chengemiran, a tiny village near the city of Lerik, Rubaba Mirzoyev lives.
At the age of 97, she was still relatively young for these latitudes.
Mirzaeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasian region.
She sits on the floor with a barrel of butter, which tirelessly rolls back and forth.
Here, eight people live under one roof, including one of Mirzaeva's sons and daughter, who have long had their grandchildren.
Two children are also running nearby.
In the kitchen, guests are prepared with tea, which is served in typical buzzing glasses of armuma.
Mirzaeva has perfectly flat and sturdy white teeth, under the head handkerchief she hides long dark brown braids that her son proudly reveals before us.
I'm always my hair milk, so they've never fallen out and kept it color.
"And I never used a shampoo," says Mirzaeva.
Monthly pension is enough for a living
She always ate only what she grew up in her own yard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
I've never bought food in a store in my life.
Then she talks about her husband, who served in the army.
The hardest thing was after World War II.
But it became better when "favorite father" Heydar Aliyev stood at the helm.
Propaganda does not often sound in the speech of an old woman.
However, the cult created around the figure of the father of the nation, who ruled the country as a dictator, in Azerbaijan knows almost no borders.
He was in power until 2003, then the reins of government was accepted by his son Ilham.
However, there is no poverty among the Azerbaijani old people.
230 manats (about the same amount of the euro) Mirzayev receives monthly as a pension, for local conditions it is the amount for which you can live well.
And, perhaps, Mirzaeva's long-grown son is also right: "The old men in our culture are deeply respected."
They live in a large family, loved, surrounded by care and happy.
No reason to stay alive as long as possible
The word "human right" is not in the constitution.
The revolution returned to Cairo.
The rival demonstrations in Cairo testify to the country's deep division.
The future constitution, based on the Shariah, met a fierce rebuff.
The Egyptian president did not skimp on pathos.
We must create a transition.
"And his success lies with my responsibility to the people and to God," he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to all people, but primarily to Christian Copts, liberals, enlightened Muslims and non-religious Egyptians.
After all, they are all hopelessly divided in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of the religious state on the Nile on the mercy of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohammed Morsi, almost apologizing, said he temporarily cut the jurisdiction of the constitutional court and expanded his competence "to save the revolution."
However, what a 61-year-old engineer who has a doctorate from the American University of Southern California does not really want to save is not clear to the Egyptians and the world.
Will the judiciary be stripped of power?
In fact, the 234 articles managed to drag in a 15-hour night jump with obstacles to the Islamist constitutional assembly of 100 participants, and this is partly a concern.
As in previous constitutions, the draft states that the proceedings are based on "the principles of Islamic law."
What do "principles" mean?
It was and remains a matter of interpretation, and one may fear that the Islamists will use the vague wording and the legal backlash that arises in connection with it for a more rigorous interpretation of the Shariah.
At least, this is hinted by one new article: in all cases relating to Shariah, Al-Ashar University, the country's most important Islamist institution, which enjoys great authority in all of Sun-Ni's Islam, should be involved for the council.
This should not, but it may mean that the clergy oversee the law, that de facto would result in restricting the judiciary.
Much of the draft constitution is the subject of interpretation.
Another problem: the jurisdiction of civilians to the military court must remain.
These courts during the Mubarak period served to suppress the opposition.
After the overthrow of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were in military detention.
Also, as stated in the draft, the state should protect the "true essence of the Egyptian family" and "support its morals and values."
Legally, this is formulated so vaguely that state institutions with the help of this article will be able to control even the content of cinema and literature.
This means nothing more than censorship.
In general, no article establishes the equality of men and women.
But the other forbids insulting and defamating the Prophet Muhammad and his messengers.
But what an insult is and how it should be punished remains unclear.
It is also doubtful that it is forbidden to "insult people."
Will there be enough caricatures of the president or jokes about the jurisprudence?
The question of interpretation, as well as much in this draft, which Morsi proposes for signature and which, according to him, "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians for a referendum.
"The Revolution is Back"
The opposition against the superiority of the Islamists has been formed for several weeks.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in the unusual unanimity of Friday evening in Tahrir Square in Cairo and swore to destroy this document before it could enter into force.
"The revolution is back and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, who took third place in the presidential election.
Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former head of the international Atomic Energy Department Mohammed ElBaradei said the draft constitution is a place "on the landfill of history."
Through the short news service of Twitter, he accused Morsi's supporters of wanting to lead a "putsch against democracy."
"If he announces a referendum, we will go to his palace and shoot him," said opposition leader Yasser Said.
"We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers has not yet been venerated," Egyptian media quoted opposition politician Khaled Ali.
Many judges also reported that they do not want to watch the referendum, which would make it invalid.
"The Qur'an is our constitution."
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, in turn, called for the opposite demonstration, but, out of precaution, not in Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other bank of the Nile before Cairo.
It was attended by a large number of women under the bedspreads and adherents of the Salafists, who shouted: "The people require the use of God's law."
They demanded from Morsi, "Purify the country!" and said, "The Qur'an is our constitution."
The struggle for power over the symbolic square on which it all began provoked a state of almost civil war.
Morsi's followers obviously didn't want to take that risk.
The Muslim Brotherhood said that both opponents and supporters of the draft constitution spoke out loud and clear.
Now it is time to allow the people to decide at the ballot urn, in which direction the country should go.
Most for the project of Islamists, this is considered a solved case.
"The concept of "human rights" is never mentioned.
Hafiz Abu Saed is furious with this forcing constitutional process, which, in fact, was to last until February with the participation of all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and the chairman of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOPR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison or brought to justice under Mubarak.
Not because he shared their worldview, but because human rights are indivisible to him.
For this he was beaten, sentenced, arrested.
And now the words "human rights" are never found in the new constitution, he regrets in an interview with "Welt am Sonntag."
The expansion of Morsi's influence on all three branches of government in the state disappoints the lawyer.
These measures represent clear blows to the democratic rules of the game and will lead the Egyptians to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening the civilian state, the president de facto annulled it," Saed regrets.
Without civil society organizations, democracy cannot function.
Saeda feels that everyone has left him, even an international community that looks at the ideological struggle of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
There may be retribution for that.
A Tahrir Square demonstrator warns: "You create a monster you can't control."
Norwegian Raqfisk: the worst smelling fish in the world?
Norway's five million people have one of the highest living standards not only in Europe, but also in the world.
Perhaps the mystery of this country's success is somehow connected with the local bias to one extremely elustic fish dish?
Take some overripe pieces of cheese.
Put them in a bunch of dirty and sweaty sportswear.
Leave them there for a week.
You will get a smell off the smell of raffis - one of the most famous Norwegian delicacies.
I'm in a small town called Fagernes, a three-hour drive from Oslo.
Around the snow-covered picturesque views. It is very beautiful, but in the air will spread an indestructible characteristic smell.
Rakfisk is a trout sprinkled with salt and wandered in water for up to a year, depending on what kind of sweetheart you need to achieve.
As the twilight is thickened and cold, the crowds of Norwegians gather for the festival in Fagerunse, dedicated to this, let's say, exciting dish.
"She's eaten raw and drank with a glass of aquavit, a local cumin vodka," explains Howard Halvarsen, a local firefighter by profession and part-time "extraffic general" who runs the festival.
Everywhere around us, people eat fish sliced in small cubes and wash it with considerable portions of alcohol.
"Someone likes aquavit more than aqfisk," Havard says.
This drink can kill the smell.
I'll try a couple of pieces.
If you manage to carry a piece under your nose, then everything is not so bad - it is not much different from the portion of land that you have been taking with you on the bus for a long time.
Rakfisk is a Norwegian product from completely different times, times of poverty, when, even before the appearance of refrigerators, fish in the fall was soaked in hermetically sealed barrels with salt water.
Then in the deep winter, when the fish already well and thoroughly wandered, it was extracted and, muffling the perception of alcohol, was eaten.
Even in the memory of the past generation, the fact that thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and emigrate mainly to the United States.
Now the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, who are attracted to jobs, high salaries and a developed social security system.
Residents of Sweden (a long-time rival, and not so long ago and a much more prosperous neighbor) massively come here to work.
Rakfisk is perceived as some important symbol, imminent, albeit somewhat stinky element of the past of Norway.
This is one of the most expensive local dishes.
On the other hand, everything is expensive here - a small glass of beer or sandwich will cost you 9 pounds ($14).
Norway rarely appears in the world's news, and most of the country's residents seem to be satisfied.
People here are still reluctant to mention the name of Anders Breivik, a racist and right-wing extremist who killed 77 men and children last year.
Without mentioning his name, the attack is called "the July 22nd."
It is very difficult for Norwegians to believe that in their peace-loving country one of their fellow citizens was capable of such atrocities and murders.
Norway's well-being is based on the growth (from the early seventies) of one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world.
"However, oil is not the only reason for our prosperity," says Anna, our waitress, a heated trait with aged Raqfi, a woman with long blond hair and strikingly blue eyes, the incarnation of Nordic well-being.
We are such a people - as you call it - sensible.
Like most Norwegians, she speaks English.
We don't like to show, we're not bragging.
Norway is very careful with its oil - most of the revenues of the oil and gas industry are invested in a special fund created for the benefit of future generations.
In the years leading up to the global financial crisis, when everyone was driven by money they did not have, Norway was leaningly counting all the costs.
"While you can ski in the winter and go hiking in the summer, it's enough for happiness," says Anna.
"And there's a raff in," she adds with carefree laughter.
I'm standing in the snow in line for some food - the rhafish from me's enough.
Here is a hamburger with elk meat - it's definitely exotic, delicious juicy meat.
But in the evening we are waiting for an even greater number of the same fish with an unforgettable smell.
My hotel hosts a special dinner dedicated to the rhafis, during which visitors by vote determine the best or perhaps the most fragrant fish.
There is a live television broadcast, which shows the host in a tie-baby, surrounded by plates with Raqfisk.
It's like the Eurovision Song Contest.
"So, Tor-Jurgen, what grade did you rate for the best fish in your mountains?"
"Yes, Havard, here is our assessment..."
Everyone laughs and applauds.
Someone falls off the chair, perhaps after crossing the aquavit.
Or maybe just inhaling the smell of this fish.
Mexican President Enrique Penha Nieto will have a difficult start to a career.
While Mexican President-elect Henrique Pena Nieto is preparing to take office, BBC correspondent Will Grant invites us to look at the difficulties he will face and the mixed expectations of his country's population.
Road traffic in Mexico City is now in a particularly deplorable state.
This city is overloaded with transport and at the best time, and since Monday, steel fences have been erected, cut several key highways to the capital and caused chaos on the roads.
However, this was not done in order not to allow people to get to work from the suburbs, but to prevent the protesters to get to the parliament building.
On Sunday, the new head of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, will wear a presidential bandage and accept the reins of the country.
It faces a difficult task.
Mexico has achieved good economic performance under the administration of Felipe Calderon, which is now resigning, but the country is mired in the war on drugs, which has already claimed about 60,000 lives in six years.
"My government tells the people of Mexico their willingness to fight violence," Mr. Pena Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama in the White House's occupancy earlier this week.
I'm going to propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve this goal.
Prior to such statements, Mr. Pena Nieto's political career was developing as governor of his home state of Mexico.
In his homeland, in the densely populated and vast state surrounding the country's capital, opinions about the new leader were divided.
Straight Man
In the idyllic town of Valle de Bravo, for example, it is remembered with warmth.
Residents give him the revival of tourism, the development of the resort sector and the creation of infrastructure.
The city can be reached by one of the new highways built by Mr. Pena Nieto, which are strikingly different from the roads with potholes and holes that were previously in this place.
Tablets with his name hang on the modern building of the sports center and at an impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
"We are with him hopes for real and serious changes," says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olver Hernandez, a state congressman from the Pena Nieto-Armenian Revolutionary Party (PRI).
We expect the real and decisive changes that are so urgently needed by our country, primarily in the field of security and economic development.
After 81 years of continuous tenure, the PRI party was supplanted by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Congressman Olver admits that after his 12-year absence from the presidential palace of Los Penos, the party has high hopes for Enrique Pena Nieto.
In addition, he denies the accusations of idleness, which the opposition has put forward to the new president.
He is very direct and very devoted to the fulfillment of his vision of the future of the country.
He is an excellent statesman, and above all a person who knows how to listen.
But in another part of the state, many people had a different idea of the former governor.
The municipality of Nesahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Nes, is a striking contrast to the cobbled streets of Valle de Bravo.
Hidden under the overpasses of highways, it is in many sense the suburbs of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the municipality are also severe in the nature of this metropolis.
Troops were recruited earlier this year to appease the drug-trafficking gangs in these areas; and violence against women is particularly acute.
In the wasteland near the vast landfill alone, dozens of bodies of murdered women have been found in the past two years alone.
More than a thousand women were killed in the state of Mexico during the governorship of Mr. Pena Nieto - a significant figure in the infamous violence of the city of Ciudad Juarez, whose name became a household name when it comes to the killing of innocent women.
According to Mr. Pena Nieto's opponents, it can be said of him at best that during his tenure as governor he could not cope with the problem of killing women.
In the worst case, his administration is accused of completely ignoring the problem.
A resident of a concrete house similar to most houses in this dilapidated area, Irendia Buendia barely restrains tears, showing me photos of his late daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of Mariana in 2010 committed suicide.
However, her family believes that she was killed by her cohabitant.
"When I got to her house, it looked like her body was washed before," recalls Ms. Buendia.
There were signs that she had been beaten, and the body was already calculating.
Mariana's mother retells this story, and the portrait of her daughter looks at us from the wall, where he hangs next to the crucifixion, which inscribed only one word: justice.
This, they say, was denied to this family.
"The state's officials treated me like an old gossip girl, dissatisfied with the tranquilizer.
They want people to just accept everything they say and keep them quiet.
But this is wrong, it is impossible, especially when there are so many violations and shortcomings around," she says.
Having put on the presidential band on Saturday, President Pena Nieto, along with her, will take a difficult responsibility.
Over the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have affected violent crimes, and the new president has pledged to make the solution a priority during his reign.
"I'm hoping he'll be the same president as he was the governor," said Olvera, a congressman from Valle de Bravo.
However, this is what the families of victims in Ciudad Nes fear most.
Bradley Manning did not complain of ill-treatment, the accusation.
The prosecutors are trying to refute Bradley Manning's statements about poor conditions of detention.
During the hearing, increased attention was paid to Manning's stay in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense requires that the case be closed on the grounds that Manning's terms of detention were brutal.
A U.S. Army is accused of kidnapping several thousand secret documents.
On Friday, the prosecution tried to prove that Private Bradley Manning, accused of the largest leak of classified material in U.S. history, did not take advantage of many opportunities to file a complaint about ill-treatment, which he said he had to postpone while in a military prison.
During a cross-examination at a pre-trial hearing in Fort Meade, Maryland, military prosecutor Major Ashden Fein said that records of Manning's weekly visits by representatives of the prison administration for nine months of his detention in Quanticko, Virginia, did not contain complaints of ill-treatment.
Cross-examination as part of the defence's motion to terminate the Manning case on the grounds that the terms of his detention were brutal and by themselves a sufficient punishment were carried out the day after Manning stated that while he was in custody, he intended to commit suicide.
A military intelligence analyst arrested in June 2010 is accused of kidnapping several thousand classified documents while serving in Iraq.
These materials were subsequently published on the Internet on the WikiLeaks website.
The WikiLeaks did not confirm that the source of the information was Manning.
During a hearing on Friday, Fein's prosecutor, along with Manning, reviewed reports that were filled out after Manning's visits by administration officials during his time in Kvantico prison, where he was on strict detention from July 2010 to April 2011.
During the visits, the prison officers asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When prosecutor Fein asked the reports on Friday, Manning admitted that he was assessing his treatment by the prison administration as "excellent," and the general conditions of detention as "very professionally organized."
The reports did not contain complaints of ill-treatment, despite the fact that Manning was directly asked about the conditions of his detention, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had expressed oral concern about these problems and that the administration &apos; s representatives who had visited had discussed the problems with him and had stated that they would be engaged in but not recorded in writing.
"They recorded "there are no problems" (after discussing my complaints), but that doesn't mean I didn't raise this topic in conversation," Manning said.
The military judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he had not complained about the wrongful treatment of him in January 2011 during a meeting of the commission examining suicidal intentions, which he expressed in writing a few months before.
Manning replied that during that meeting he wanted to get him to be lifted from the "injury warning" regime and eased the conditions of detention.
Representatives of the military leadership explained that a limited detention regime - lower than the regime of supervision to prevent suicide - was introduced to protect the prisoner, as well as for the safety of others.
"I wanted to let the administration know that I'm all right to cancel the injury prevention regime. that the level of my life improve, from my point of view," Manning explained.
On Thursday, Manning testified to his arrest in Iraq and the transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for almost two months before being transferred to a naval base in Quantiko, Virginia, in July 2010.
He reported that thoughts of suicide appeared in Kuwait, and that one day he lost consciousness due to the heat.
He explained that psychologically it is very difficult when you are not allowed to know how your fate is solved, and what is happening in the outside world.
"My world squeezed to Camp Arifjan base, to the size of my prison," Manning said.
I thought I was going to die in that cage."
While in Quantiko, Manning, he said, spent most of his time in a small cell - at least 21 hours, and often even more than 23 hours a day - alone.
Manning reports that he was allowed to leave only a mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, several items of clothes and glasses.
He says he tried to move, as he was trying to sleep or even just lying down in the daytime forbid rules.
According to Manning, during a sleep in his eyes, he was constantly hit by a light penetrating outside the camera.
If the guards did not see his face when he turned in bed at night, he said he was awakened and forced to turn over on his back.
Manning's lawyer filed an official objection to Manning's mistreatment in January 2011.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to a military prison in Fort Livenworth, Kansas.
In addition, on Friday, the judge asked Manning about the statement he made during his testimony on Thursday that after being forced to sleep naked in his cell in Kwantiko, he was forced to stand naked in front of guards and other prisoners in the morning.
Manning said he could not cover up with a blanket during the inspection.
Responding to the judge's questions on Friday, Manning said that he understood from the order of the guard that he should throw a blanket that could cover, but admitted that no one directly ordered him to abandon him.
On Thursday, Manning said that he was forced to sleep naked the previous night because of his attempt to show the officer that he was not in danger to himself.
Manning said he told the officer that he could use the panties or flip-flops to injure himself, but did not.
That night, according to Manning's testimony, his underwear, flip-flops and glasses were taken from the camera.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account what he had to endure during his detention, and will significantly reduce the sentence if Manning is found guilty by a military court that is due to begin his case early next year.
The defense said it plans to offer Manning to plead guilty for less serious crimes, and other charges to challenge as excessive.
The resumption of the hearings is scheduled for this weekend, and is expected to insist that the conditions of detention have been acquitted.
The Pentagon claims that Manning was held in Quantico in accordance with the rules governing the detention of those arrested with the most stringent regime.
Among the charges brought to Manning are aides to the enemy, illegally facilitating the disclosure of data on the Internet, the transfer of information relating to national defense, and the abduction of state property or documents.
If he is convicted on all counts of the indictment, he may face life imprisonment.
My crisis of national self-determination is a story of an American of Mexican descent.
According to the author, many Mexicans were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities to realize themselves.
Mexicans tend to blame those who left because they remind the people of the country about difficult times.
Ruben Navarette believes that Mexicans of American origin are torn between two cultures.
During a recent trip to Mexico City, I walked down the corridor for arrivals, approached the border control zone and froze on the spot.
The signs pointed to two queues: one for Mexicanos (Mexicans), the second for Extranjeros (foreigners).
I stood in front of them for a few seconds, not knowing where to go.
I grew up in central California and I've been called a Mexican all my life.
It's just a conditional name, just like my friends in Boston call themselves Irish, and friends from New York consider themselves Italian.
Later I stopped at the complex design of "American of Mexican descent."
But I was here in Mexico.
Here, in my grandfather's homeland, there was no need for conditional names or complex structures.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to ask questions or answer them.
But my vocabulary is poorer than my native speakers, and I can't get rid of the American accent.
That's why I got my American passport and I'm in line for Extranjeros.
I remembered this story a few days ago, when Mexican newly elected President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House and met with President Obama.
On the agenda were the usual issues for the meetings of the presidents of these countries: immigration, drugs and trade.
President Penha Nieto was willing to talk about the rise of the Mexican economy, which would allow the Mexicans to stay in Mexico with the same success, instead of moving to the United States.
He wants to conclude a partnership agreement with the United States and Canada and create a North American trade bloc like the European Union.
In addition, President Pena Nieto promised to continue the war against drug cartels in Mexico, but no concrete proposals were made.
For Mexico, relations with the United States are a difficult and executed old question.
Most Americans never thought that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and at gunpoint forced its leaders to abandon half of its territory.
But the Mexicans think for centuries, not minutes, and see reminders of those events in everything.
Therefore, it is necessary only to some US statesman to be told at least a word of criticism towards Mexico, in the press and among the elite of Mexican society there are immediately complaints that the Americans encroach on the sovereignty of their neighbors.
And the descendants of Montezuma are filled with belligerence.
At the same time, Mexico's relations with more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States are the most difficult.
You want to talk about resentments?
They're enough.
In Mexico, there are winners and losers, people who find opportunities in this country, and those for whom there are no such opportunities.
In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, so many people of Mexican origin are for only one reason: at some point in their family history, someone - a father or grandfather - did not have the opportunity to realize himself in Mexico and was forced to go north.
Most often they were Mexicans of a certain type - swarthy, poorly educated, from poor peasant families.
We are their descendants, and we remember it.
They see it differently in Mexico.
Today, our life is the embodiment of the American dream, we studied in good schools and got a good job, but we do not forget that even this dream is American, not Mexican.
Our national self-determination is confusing and unclear, but we know which country to consider our own.
United States of America.
In addition, we know that most of the representatives of the Mexican elite and the ruling class do not like us.
We answer them the same.
They see us as a reminder of humiliating defeats and treat us as second-class people as untrue Mexicans.
We don't speak well in Spanish, and our ties to Mexico are not strong enough.
Our very existence is due to their failures.
If our ancestors had succeeded in Mexico, they wouldn't have left.
We would not be behind the silk curtain, finding a full life in the United States, but losing spiritual ties.
My wife was born in Guadalajara and moved to the United States as a child, and this reminds me that there are certain frictions between real Mexicans and Mexican-Americans - Mexicans understand their national identity, and Americans of Mexican descent are hurting.
She is a U.S. citizen and believes that it belongs to both of these countries.
At the same time, many of my acquaintances of Mexican origin do not feel belonging to any of them.
We listen to the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but we love Bruce Springsteen.
Getting the best from two worlds, you inevitably lose root.
We are Americans in Mexico.
In the United States, we are called Mexicans.
Now, as I found out during my trip, as if our relationship was not confusing enough, some Mexican leaders and intellectuals want to restore relations with the diaspora.
They want Mexican-Americans to work as Mexican ambassadors and represent her interests in the United States.
We could tell our American friends about what a beautiful country it is and how great it is to visit it, and we could convince political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yeah, of course you are.
It's not gonna work.
Too much resentment in the past.
And given the gap between the rich and the poor, the rampant corruption and drug trafficking, many of us do not consider this country so beautiful.
Sorry, but deal with it yourself, Amigos.
And that's fair.
If some Mexicans still can't forgive the United States, as they did to Mexico a century and a half ago, they will have to accept the fact that some Americans of Mexican origin are still offended for how recently in Mexico treated their relatives.
I------
We probably have more in common than I thought.
Old Battles in the New Middle East
The ceasefire agreement between Israel and the Hamas group could be a fragile foundation for further peace
Is lasting peace possible between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East?
The next round of bloodshed pushes us to conclude that such hopes are futility.
Sounds familiar, meaningless controversy over who first started; many buildings have been turned into ruins; more than 140 Palestinians have been killed, most civilians, and six Israelis; for the first time in the conflict, rockets fired from the Gaza Strip have fallen in the vicinity of the Israeli capital, Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
However, despite the fact that the Israelis and Palestinians are hopelessly bogged down in their perpetual conflict, changes have come to the Middle East.
This can be treated differently, but the events of the "Arab Spring" swirl in a rebellious storm of many established realities, and the Palestinians and the Israelis could not stay away from the vortex that shook the region.
Perhaps, as a result, their struggle will become even more bloody than before.
There are, however, reasons for the hope of a way out of this deadly impasse.
War without winners
At first glance, the current situation does not give reasons for optimism.
Even if the ceasefire, which was signed on 21 November, will be implemented, this week's clashes only strengthened the positions of the security forces on both sides.
The leaders of the Islamist Hamas movement, which came to power in the Gaza Strip in 2007, will say that they forced Israel to back down despite the losses they suffered.
Despite the fact that some of the group's leaders were destroyed, and 1.7 million inhabitants are blocked in one of the most densely populated and problematic corners of our planet, Israel failed to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is increasing its popularity in the West Bank, another Palestinian territory now controlled by the more moderate Fatah movement.
Moreover, Hamas leaders may well come to the conclusion that time is working for them.
As the influence of Islamist movements in the Arab world grows, Hamas has new powerful and wealthy friends.
Turkey's resurgent regional leader, which was once Israel's closest ally among Muslim countries, supported Hamas; Qatar, one of the richest and dynamic Gulf states, followed suit.
Hamas's celebrating the creation of an Islamist crescent around Israel - from Lebanon in the north, ruled by the Hezbollah paramilitary group, to Syria, in which increasingly pro-Islamic rebels are about to overthrow the power of Bashar alsad, and further to Jordan, where the king's authorities are threatened by Hamas's allies.
The most significant change in the balance of power in the region occurred on the southern borders of Israel, in the most populous and important Arab country, in Egypt, where under President Mohammed Morsi strengthened the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood.
Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years and was deposed in 2011, was a secular dictator who did not pay much attention to Hamas's support.
The Muslim Brotherhood, on the contrary, are an organization similar to Hamas, and their leaders are more prone to populism.
In future diplomatic arrangements, Hamas could become a significant player whose voice will not be able to drown even Israel and America.
At the same time, supporters of the "hard" line in Israel will come to the opposite conclusions.
In the military sense, Hamas was defeated.
The Israeli Iron Dome anti-missile system justified the cost of its creation and successfully destroyed many of the Hamas rockets launched.
Israeli citizens can sleep peacefully, at least for a while.
As for diplomacy, the US remained in its unaligned position; many European countries also blamed the start of the last round of violence against Hamas.
Another important factor is Israel's economic prosperity, especially under the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, which largely ignored the peace process.
Even though since 2004. Some 30 Israelis were killed by rockets fired from the Gaza Strip, and Israel has managed to minimize the problem of suicide bombers, in part by the wall that enters the West Bank - a large part of the unrecognized Palestinian State - and protects Jewish settlements, which continue to expand despite the illegality of such actions in terms of international law.
The position of Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party - in preparation for the January 22 elections - merged with even more aggressive conservatives under Avigdor Lieberman's leadership.
What's the point of indulging the Palestinians and giving them their own state?
If they give all the power in the West Bank, will they not launch rockets in the direction of Israel, as do their brethren in the Gaza Strip do?
It is better to keep them behind the wall and severely suppress any attempts to raise their heads.
Perhaps the supporters of the "hard" line will win; however, their calculations can be refuted by the Arab spring.
Despite the fact that the Islamists who come to power in Egypt and other countries do not have the warmest feelings for Israel, their priority will be internal problems.
The defense part of Israel's budget is greater than that of all of its Arab neighbors combined.
Unleashing a war with a regional superpower is unlikely to help Arab governments strengthen their own economies.
The pragmatism of the President of Egypt, Morsi, who worked with Barack Obama on a ceasefire, is a good sign and can mark the beginning of change.
Israel, to a no lesser extent, must take into account the long-term implications of its policies.
As the democratic change in the Arab countries advances, the Palestinians' right to self-determination is a time bomb that will explode sooner or later in the territories occupied by Israel, like the bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
The repression is already undermining the foundations of a democratic order in the Jewish state, and the demographic aspect - the growth of the Arab population - only exacerbates these problems.
The bloodshed operations, which are conducted every few years in the Gaza Strip to suppress the Hamas movement, have to pay the growing discontent of the international community.
Both sides need an external impulse.
The only solution remains to be called by sensible representatives on both sides, as well as most of the rest of the world and our newspaper: the formation of two states and Israel's concessions in exchange for security.
There is hope, not too impressive in the short term, the hope that a ceasefire will allow other countries to influence the parties to the conflict more effectively.
Egypt, which is high time to decide to cut arms supplies to the Gaza Strip, as well as Turkey and Qatar, have a more advantageous position than ever to convince Hamas to recognize the borders of the Jewish state adopted since 1967, taking into account the exchange of territories and the sharing of Jerusalem.
Other Arab countries should also make efforts to reconcile the Hamas and Fatah movements.
This would do more to create a Palestinian state than the upcoming UN vote, which could result in recognition of the virtual statehood of Palestine.
President Obama should play a role in putting Israel at the negotiating table.
During his first term, he never presented his own peace plan.
After returning to the White House, he still demonstrates the reluctance to connect to this problem.
This is a catastrophically short-sighted position.
The United States has a vital interest in stability in the Middle East.
This is possible only in the case of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
In Australia, the law on unified packaging for cigarettes came into force.
Warnings about the dangers of smoking and the images of affected body parts of the body are contrasted on dull green boxes, the same for all brands of cigarettes.
The first Australian law on the same type of packaging of cigarettes and tobacco products came into force, replacing the logos and color design of different brands with the same box of dull-click color with creepy pictures of the affected body parts and images of children whose health is undermined by smoking their parents.
In addition to different pictures and inscriptions warning of the dangers of smoking, the only difference between the packs, introduced necessarily from this Saturday - the names of stamps that are printed in the same small print.
These are the most severe conditions in the world for packaging tobacco products.
The federal government of Australia says that the aim of this measure is to keep young people from smoking, depriving this harmful habit of buzzing.
The basis of this decision was the results of studies that showed that people who did not start smoking before the age of 26, in 99 out of 100 cases never become smokers.
"Obviously, even at the youngest age, children understand the meaning that tobacco companies are trying to convey with the help of packaging," Health Minister Tanya Plibersek explains, citing studies that, for example, the crown in the logo is associated in children with the idea of the princess.
Australia is one of the countries with the world's smallest share of smokers, so these changes will not affect the profits of transnational corporations, but other countries are already considering the possibility of such measures.
Representatives of the tobacco industry strongly opposed the enactment of this law.
Tobacco companies claim that this will only increase the black market share, which will sell cheap and affordable cigarettes.
"This law will lead to serious consequences, different from those that were conceived by its initiators," said Scott McIntyre, a spokesperson for British American Tobacco in Australia.
Manufacturers of counterfeit products from China and Indonesia will supply much more of these products for sale on the streets of Australia.
For someone, on the contrary, the new laws contribute to the growth of business.
Sandra Ha, of the small family-owned company Zico Import Pty Ltd, claims that the demand for cigarette cases and silicone cases hiding unpleasant pictures on the packaging has grown rapidly (almost from scratch) since two months ago, such as British American Tobacco, British Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Tobacco lost the case in the high court of Australia, where they tried to appeal the law.
According to Sandra Ha, Zico has already sold about six thousand products to wholesale enterprises and is waiting for a new batch.
It's a good business for us.
The potential hindrance to the effectiveness of such measures is, according to experts, the popularity of social networks among the part of the population to which these measures are aimed.
After the adoption in Australia of a number of laws that illegally advertise cigarettes and support for sports events, as well as prohibiting sellers from putting cigarettes in a prominent place, tobacco advertising has moved to the Internet.
The Australian government has banned local companies and websites from posting ads online, but it cannot restrict foreign sites.
"If you're selling tobacco products and you only have this little loophole left, the idea of promoting your merchandise online will seem extremely tempting," explains Becky Freeman, who is looking at public health issues at the University of Sydney.
Freeman is seeing an increase in the number of reviews for trademarks written on behalf of alleged ordinary users on social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
The question arises - is it really the work of an ordinary citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes so much that he spared no time and made a video, or is the advertising company behind it?
The Australian branch of British American Tobacco claims that the industry is now more engaged in adaptation to the new rules than advertising.
Tobacco industry officials have even taken measures such as sponsorship of Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge new rules: these States are making claims within the World Trade Organization, stating that trade has been subject to unfair restrictions, despite the fact that trade relations of all these countries with Australia are very small.
The WTO is expected to decide by mid-2013.
According to Tanya Plibersek, the government discussed with other countries the possibility of adopting similar packaging laws.
In 2001, Canada was the first to introduce mandatory placement of photographs warning of the dangers of smoking.
This rule is now adopted in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The possibility of tightening laws is being considered in the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia are demonstratively disobedient to innovations.
These pictures don't hurt me.
I just don't pay attention.
"You just snatch a cigarette and hide a pack in your pocket," explains Victor El Haig, who buys cigarettes with a photo of an oral tumor on a pack.
Honestly, the only thing that can make me leave is my little daughter.
James Yu, head of the King of the Pack tobacco store in downtown Sydney, says the same packaging has complicated the task of putting goods on shelves
"I used to have an hour to unload the new party, and now it's four hours," he complains.
"The government had to take and completely ban cigarettes, we would then say: what to do, all the end, close the store," he says, throwing his hands up.
Bringing up electronic networks and permanent connections is not that bad.
On this Thanksgiving Day, I suddenly had to spend five hours at the airport, because our plane had mechanical malfunctions and replaced by another plane, which we waited for.
So I had enough time to think about the nature of boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Half a day at the airport waiting for the flight is really boring, and here it will not help much books, magazines, iPhones, or even duty-free shops.
Recently, however, more and more scientists and specialists in children's development are speaking in favor of boredom.
They say that in certain situations, it is not so bad for us and for our children.
This forces the brain to be distracted by interesting related topics, which may contribute to creativity.
And since in the modern world we are all constantly in front of some screen, the advantages of boredom pass by us.
Maybe we should be bored?
Oh, yeah.
And at the same time not.
We'll get back to that.
I used to believe, like many, that boredom was an invention of relatively recent times, when people had more free time.
This is not the case, says Peter Tui, professor of Greek and Roman history at Calgary University of Calgary, author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Boredom: A Lively History, Yale University Press, 2011).
"In fact, boredom can boast of a very ancient history," he says.
On the walls in Pompeii found Latin inscriptions about bore, dating from the first century.
The question of how we understand boredom remains open.
The problem is, says John D. Eastwood, an associate professor at York University in Ontario, Canada, that the understanding and vision of boredom has often changed.
After examining the research materials on this topic and asking a question to a target group of 100 people, ProfessorsEaster and his colleagues came to the following definition: boredom is when people "want, but can not do what would bring them satisfaction."
The difference between boredom and apathy, he says, is that a bored person doesn't do anything he wants to do.
I don't want to do anything with apathy.
The main thing in the troubled, he says, is "a disturbance of attention and the resulting deterioration of mood and the feeling that time is slow."
By the description of boredom, it may seem very similar to depression.
However, Professor Isstwend argues that despite the possible connection between these states, bored people see the causes of problems in the world and the circumstances, and people experiencing depression see problems in themselves.
Sometimes we feel bored when it's actually hard for us to focus on something.
In their study, "The Unoccupied Mind: Determination of Beverage from a Look Attention Point," published in the September issue of Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor East Wilder and colleagues refer to an earlier experiment whose participants listened to a recording of the voice reading the journal.
Some participants also heard loud noises not related to the case of a television program included in the next room, others heard the same sounds at low volume, so that they could hardly be disassembled, and the third group listened only to the recording of the voice without an outsider soundtrack.
Those who heard a low-volume TV noted that they were bored, more often than others - they found it difficult to concentrate, but they didn't know the reason and was awake.
When we try to focus on a difficult or exciting task, interruption of attention can cause boredom, says Mark J. Fencke, associate professor of neurology at the University of Guelph, Ontario, and one of the authors of this study.
On the other hand, when we do something uninteresting, "for example, looking into the flow of products on the conveyor in the search for marriage, distracting music can help avoid boredom."
It is believed that when people start writhing on a chair or drawing scribbles on a sheet of paper, they do it from boredom, but now we know that in fact such actions just help not to relax physically.
"The study showed that children who are not forbidden to fidget and spin, learn better and memorize more information than children who are required to sit still," says Professor Fencke.
At some points, we all experience boredom: if the flight is delayed (as in my case), listening to a monotonous speech, watching an uninteresting film.
However, different people show different degrees of inclination to boredom.
In the 1980s, to measure such individual characteristics, the researchers developed a special "scale of the propensity to boredom."
To determine the assessment on such a scale, questions and statements are used, for example, "Many of what I have to do, monotonously and monotonously" or "I'm too interested, so there is not enough time for anything."
With the help of such questionnaires, the researchers determined that boys miss girls more often, - says Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida - especially in the presence of a variety of external stimuli.
In general, however, teenagers are often bored.
In 1991. Reed Larson, a professor of personal and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted a pager with nearly 400 teenagers and their parents 7-8 times a day.
It received the following results: 32% of teenagers said they were bored at school and while doing their homework, and 23 percent said they were bored outside the school.
Only 3% of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson notes that he does not have data on what such data would be like now, 21 years later.
However, he knows that "the teenage age has a peak of the tendency to boredom," mainly because children and adolescents are not allowed to fully decide what to do.
Back to my original question: is boredom useful?
Sometimes not, because in extreme manifestations, it, as studies show, can push people to absurd and dangerous physical activities, risk gambling or substance abuse in an attempt to get rid of boredom.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers have thought about the connection between boredom and creativity, says Professor Vodanovic, who devoted more than two decades to study this problem.
"So our brain tells us that something else should be done; that's boredom," says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at New York University.
However, this brain does not always know what it is better to do.
If you get bored and you put that energy on guitar or cooking experiences, you'll do better.
However, if you watch TV, you will only be better off for a while, and soon it will pass.
So if your child misses and you give him an iPad, he will stop being bored, but he won't learn to fight boredom on his own or in any other way to manage his time and employment, says Professor Fencke.
"And such self-regulation skills are used in a variety of situations," he says.
Your child learns not only to do something on his own, he also learns self-control in general.
I don't think boredom needs to be extolified somehow.
However, it is not worth considering it bad either.
Rather, you should learn to feel comfortable even outside the continuous flow of action and technology.
Professor Eastwood agrees with that.
"We see it in such a way that we need to be bored more often, even though boredom is an extremely unpleasant, unsatisfied desire to do something meaningful," he says.
In fact, people are eager to somehow disconnect from constant worries and just relax.
"In the modern world, we are accustomed to constant over-stimulation of the senses," he says, "and when silence comes, we lose and do not know what to do."
It is not clear how the new law on the legalization of marijuana in the state of Colorado will be applied.
Anthony Orosco, a nineteen-year-old football team player and a college student in southeastern Colorado, is charged with a criminal offense that it will soon be perfectly lawful throughout the state: possession of a small portion of marijuana and a tube in which he smoked it.
Mr. Orosko said that one day in September he and his friends were in Lamar and driving in a car on the prairie near the border with Kansas when they were stopped by police.
After the policeman found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orosco came to the court for possession of drugs and possession of a drug-ustaining device - minor offenses, for which a fine of $100 is due - and a court date is set.
"We are treated like criminals," says Mr Orosco.
But is he a criminal?
As a result of the uncertainty that has been going on for several weeks after Colorado voted to legalize the use of marijuana in small quantities for entertainment, the decision of hundreds of small court cases depends not so much on the law as on the place of consideration.
Accusations of minor marijuana-related offenses are already being filmed in hundreds of cases here and in Washington State, which has taken a similar measure.
The police stations have already stopped accusing people aged 21 and older for possession of small doses, which will be considered legal as soon as the law comes into effect in a couple of weeks.
However, in the more conservative districts of Colorado, prosecutors decided to consider existing marijuana-related cases and continue to be held accountable for the possession of the drug.
At the same time, in some cities, Denver suburbs to mountainous areas of the West are voting to prevent the emergence of new marijuana stores in their places.
"It's all going on so fast that I don't even know what to expect next," Daniel J. said. Oates, chief of police in Aurora in the east of Denver.
Representatives of the supervisory authorities in the state of Washington are also puzzled to scratch their heads.
They will have to form rules to determine the procedure for licensing the cultivation, processing, distribution and sale of marijuana, and all this needs to be done before December 1, 2013.
They say that Colorado, whether good or bad, is ahead of most other states in settling marijuana issues, first for medical purposes, and now for fun.
"A more orderly market in Colorado, so they will serve as a good example," Brian E explains. Smith, a spokesperson for the regulation of the production and sale of alcoholic beverages in Washington State.
But now no one can do more, admits Mr. Smith, than putting forward any proposals and hope that it will work.
"We don't have a real precedent that we can focus on," he says.
The Washington state bill, called I-502, will enter into force on December 6 and for a whole year will plunge the state into a state of uncertainty when the state's licensing system is not yet available, and the ownership of marijuana has already been legalized.
And there are still difficult technical aspects that need to be solved during this period, for example, how to find a balance between the order of the state on "adequate access" to licensed marijuana with a ban on trade it at a distance of 1,000 feet from schools, parks, playgrounds and kindergartens.
"It will be particularly difficult to place licensed marijuana businesses in cities, particularly in Seattle and its suburbs," explains Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the newly established Marijuana Legalization Center.
On November 21, the police chief of Oates of Aurora sent an e-mail to his subordinates that the city's prosecutor's office would no longer be held accountable to those who were 21 years old, and that the police stopped catching people in these violations "starting from now on."
Police chief Oates said police would monitor compliance in the city with the rules governing marijuana for medical purposes and prosecute illegal traffickers and drug dealers.
Weld County prosecutor in northern Colorado, Ken Buck, presents a stricter approach to the matter.
After the vote on the bill, he stated that the prosecutor's office would continue to hold marijuana accountable, mainly to encourage persons to undergo treatment.
At the moment, 119 persons have been charged with possession of two or less ounces of marijuana, although many of them are accused of other violations.
"The duty of our institution is to prosecute for acts that are considered criminal at the time of their commission," Mr. Buck said in a statement.
The reaction was mixed even in places such as the rural district of Mesa, where voters rejected the proposal to legalize marijuana.
The Grand Junction police, the largest city in the county, no longer prosecuted adults for possession of a small amount of the drug.
District Attorney Pete Hautzinginger supported the decision, but also decided not to remove charges on already open cases related to the possession of marijuana.
"I believe that to enforce the law until it changes is our direct duty," he says.
Despite the fact that 55% of the residents of the state of Colorado, who took part in the vote, supported this decision, the inclusion of marijuana for entertainment in the state and legal system will not be easy.
And the contradictory reaction of residents in different places of the state exposed the ambiguity of the attitude of local authorities to the state experiment with marijuana.
"Driving district prosecutors have a cultural barrier in this matter," explains Sean Macalister, a Denver lawyer representing the interests of those convicted of marijuana possession, and a local representative of the National Marijuana Law Reform Organization.
"They've been chasing people for it for so long that they can't really accept the fact that it's no longer a crime," he says.
Colorado and Washington - the first states in which a small amount of marijuana is treated in the same way as alcohol - is destined to become an experimental field nationwide to test the very idea of drug legalization.
Proponents of legalization and state officials are planning to expand the territory of legalized trade, but at the same time they are afraid of instructions from the federal authorities, who continue to plan to consider the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Proponents of the legalization of marijuana hope that the Department of Justice will give way to this issue.
Despite several highly resonant arrests of traffickers and patients who used marijuana for medical reasons, the federal government in most cases gave good to the marijuana trade in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
Agents of the Drug Enforcement Bureau are unlikely to break into homes to confissure a small bag of marijuana, but they will hardly turn a blind eye to the state-regulated shops of recreational marijuana, which are allowed under the new law, according to Kevin A. Sabet, a former anti-drug adviser in the Obama administration.
Some cities in Colorado did not wait for the actions of the federal authorities.
Even before the presidential election, some local administrations approved a moratorium on the opening of new marijuana shops, which could not have been opened sooner than a year later.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the western state, put forward a six-month ban on marijuana trade, which is likely to be approved next week.
"We don't want to be in such a position that we will give someone a license, and then it will cause serious problems at the federal level," says Bob Nicholson, a city council member.
Our city voted against this amendment.
And now we have a contradiction between the results of the local vote and what the state voted for.
There are still many unresolved issues.
Petronella Wyatt: I've been out of Oxford for being conservative.
Persecution of university students for their views did not begin today.
For as long as I can remember, I've always dreamed of going to Oxford University.
My father and older brother studied at Oxford and described him as the best educational institution in the world, a modern analogue of an ancient symposium that lays two foundations of civilization - freethinking and tolerance.
And yet, two weeks after studying at the Faculty of History at the University of Oxford University of Wuster in the late eighties, I collected suitcases and left, which resulted in the first real scandal in my life.
My father couldn't stand it and wept.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard claimed that I dropped out of college because I didn't like my classmates having sex in the next room.
The writer E. Norman Wilson joked that I left because I had to drink from the shirt cups.
It wasn't really that funny.
I ran away.
Yes, I ran away because I was systematically bullied and bullied.
Not because of my rather unusual name or that I was in a private school.
I was poisoned for only one reason, and in this famous cradle of enlightenment it seemed like a true barbarism and blind fanaticism: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a well-known adviser to Margaret Thatcher, and I myself was a supporter of the conservatives.
You ask, why remember this now?
According to the latest data, a new generation of students adhering to center-right views is subject to the same harassment.
This institutionalized and ever-growing hatred of conservative students in Oxford is so strong that last week a group of such students demanded the same protection of their rights as those provided to disabled people, sexual and ethnic minorities.
Conservatives from the College of Christie College in Cambridge say that they are "often actively isolated, subjected to personal attacks and make them feel unwelcome" because of their political views.
They want to introduce an additional representative to the College Equal Rights Committee to ensure freedom of expression.
Their situation was only exacerbated by the BBC 2 documentary on student politics, Wonderland: Young, Smart and Right, in which conservatives were presented by eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
The film featured Joe Cook, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association, who rides in the Rins Euros, wears a silver suit and a cane with a silver baldashnik.
In other universities, conservative students complain that they make "scapegoats because of the increase in tuition fees."
Luke Black, 20, vice president of the Nottingham University Conservative Association, said in an interview with Sunday's newspapers that "the skew towards leftist views is increasing in the university environment.
People who don't even know us consider us brazen and with impunity the children of rich parents."
Samuel Roberts, 21, a student at the College of Christie College, in which a petition for increased protection was filed, calls this atmosphere "uncustable," and Stephanie Cherill, 19, the new president of the Oxford University Conservative Association, says that the attitude of members of the student club to the media of center-right views has deteriorated significantly.
"This poses a threat to both the atmosphere of intellectual discussion and simply for the normal lives of club members," she says.
The first few weeks in Oxford I was not just in the minority, I was alone.
I entered there in September 1986, a timid and shy eighteen-year-old girl.
Oxford was feverish from hatred of the Conservative party.
A year earlier, the university by voting deprived the former student Margaret Thatcher of her honorary degree due to a reduction in budget allocations for higher education.
In such an atmosphere, it would be uncomfortable even for Stalinists.
In the first days of the freshman's weeks, when students get to know each other and with teachers, I felt for the first time what was waiting for me.
I did not yet know that teachers not only looked through their fingers at the harassment of conservative students, but also themselves with pleasure took part in it.
Political issues - the miners" strike, the government's privatisation and disagreement to impose sanctions on the apartheid government in South Africa - penetrated the wall of the audience sheathed with wooden panels.
At my first seminar I had to translate the French text of the eighteenth century into English, and I was not ready for what followed.
"Miss Wyatt," said the teacher, the late Harry Pitt, "Please translate the first paragraph."
The text was hard on me, I stabbed.
Harry Pitt was a very bile man with a face like a cake.
"Thethatcherists do not teach French or are they just not in their brains?" - he asked.
Other students giggled.
There were tears in my eyes.
"I advise you to take some initial lessons of French in your free time, if you are certainly not very busy, revolving in society," Pitt said.
I went back to my room as completely miserable.
I was alone at college that night, I was sitting at lunch; then someone patted me on my shoulder.
It was James, a second-year student from the English language faculty, who introduced himself as a member of the University Conservative Association.
"I know who you are," he said friendly.
- Unfortunately, the situation is as follows:
Anyone suspected of sympathy for the Conservatives will be bullied.
It's not easy for me, and in your case, they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so you'll find it harder.
Most freshmen-conservatives pretend they are Labour."
Later, at a local pub, I tried cowardly to hypocritically.
I insisted that I didn't agree with everything Margaret Thatcher was saying.
The trick didn't work.
A first-year student of the Faculty of Philosophy, Politics and Economics, who himself studied at Eton, said: "You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You are contagious."
Other students picked up his words.
I was spoiled, dirty.
How do conservatives have sex? - One of them asked.
- They're punching each other, right?"
I felt the way I should have felt like homosexuals before I had abolished criminal prosecution in the sixties.
Can I ever live a normal life in Oxford?
Or am I only having to meet the like-minded people under the cloak of the night?
Will I be forced to become a Labour and hide my true beliefs?
The three years ahead of me began to seem like hell, full of persecution and loneliness.
The only teacher at my college who did not hide his conservative views was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history.
He was hated not only for being Conservatives, but also for being Thatcher's foreign policy adviser and one of her speechwriters.
He hardly appeared in college.
He despised him for his provinciality, pettiness, and commitment to Marxist-determinist view of history.
In 1997, he took a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You're not happy here," he told me.
I began to travel to Oxford from my parents' home in London, trying to find refuge among relatives and unbiased metropolitan friends.
I told my father I hated Oxford and explained the reason.
He didn't believe me.
During his studies in the forties, any political views were taken there.
"But it's the best university in the world," he said complaining.
- There's not that, but not in the city dormant spires...
Even my fellow Communist friends have always behaved flawlessly."
His humid eyes clouded.
"Don't make hasty decisions.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
You'll break my heart if you leave the university."
I was exhausted by my constant trips to London and my emotional defense has weakened.
My friend, also a conservative, could not withstand the pressure and refused his beliefs.
The next week, during the seminar, when another history teacher seriously called me "enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Burning in the soul with shame, I admitted that "I braindry my parents," and called them "old fools."
The respite was short.
The last nail in the lid of my career coffin in Oxford was destined to score my father.
At that time, he wrote two columns for publications belonging to Rupert Murdoch every week.
My door was locked.
I didn't, and five minutes later, my persecutors gave up.
When they left, I picked up my suitcase and got on my first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me a cry and a rag.
But at the age of eighteen, no one should become the object of such anger and intimidation in an educational institution.
The sadder that it was Oxford, which not only released fourteen Tory prime ministers, but to this day is hidden behind the undeserved reputation of the university, which values equality and freethinking.
"Valentine prefers elegance to glory"
About the exhibition "Valentino: master of sewing," which opened this week in London, ABC talks with Nathi Abascal, Fiona Thiessen-Bornemica and other famous clients of the Italian designer
Somerset House, the former residence of Queen Elizabeth I of England, the only place in the British capital worthy to host the exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
The designer recognized this during the opening of "Valentino: Master of Sewing," a triumphal retrospective exhibition that brings together more than 130 high fashion dresses created by his "home" over the past 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his unique Italian accent.
This exhibition is the final part of the story, whose only character is "il-signor" Garravani, but it could not be written without his famous clients.
Valentino has always felt fascinated by the rare and distant world of the nobility.
In the first hall of this exhibition, opened until March 3, personal letters and photographs are filled with personal letters and photographs signed by the most noble aristocrats, from Princess Salima Aga-Khanh to Lord Snowdon, including Mari-Chantal, Princess of Greece, and Margaret, Princess of Great Britain.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social upsurge: from a humble tailor from the city of Voger in northern Italy to the idol of the international "elite."
To be in love with the royal court is nothing wrong with it.
"They don't even extinguish their cigarette butts about your gorgeous carpet, as some beautiful pop stars do," says Baronessa Fiona Thyssen-Bornemitsa.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is an unparalleled host and receives guests with generosity and elegance.
"We all really liked to come in his chalet in Gstaad," explains the former wife of "Haini" Thouses, a close friend of forgotten beauties like Marella Agnelli or Eugenia Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to fame.
And yet, he is the star.
Valeria Mazza, representing Valentino
Argentine model Valeria Mazza recalls a charismatic fashion designer.
One day we went to dinner with his house, it was after the fashion show in the Spanish Square in Rome, many years ago.
Among the twenty guests were Sharon Stone and John F. Kennedy, Jr.
The style of Valentino manifested itself in everything - in every detail of his apartment, in her decoration, in food, in music.
"Each of the guests Valentino was made to feel important and loved," recalls the "top model," whose work with the designer began in 1995 during the Fashion Week in Paris.
"He never goes out of fashion, because his sketches are real works of art," she concludes.
Ceremacy of Pedigrees
Garavani's life is a story not of obsessors, but love with full reciprocity.
He loves people with good upbringing and high titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been turned into a glamorous podium of sixty meters long, which offers a change of roles: the visitor takes the place of models and must defile on the podium, contemplating "spectators" of the mocks that sparkle with masterpieces from Valentino, such as the dress that Jacqueline Kennedy chose for his wedding to Aristotle Onassis, the costume he used to wear a .Fara Diba.
In this public, the models are shining names such as Sybilla Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn Tun und Taxis, Mette Marit from Norway, Rosario from Bulgaria or Sofia Habsburg.
Nathi Abascal and fashion designer, in 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentino - like the first love, "cannot forget."
I remember him beautifully.
They were pants, a shirt, a "vehicle" and a jacket from the collection of autumn-winter 1971-1972.
"It was the gift he made to me," says Nathi Abascal, one of the designer's muses.
"I prefer him to the rest of his femininity, for his great love for women, because he emphasizes our beauty," adds the former Duchess of Feria.
I really like the colors he uses: they have a lot of light and they "fit" to his face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess and fashion legislator Patricia dlla Govampaola d'Arenberg, too, can't forget the first time she dressed in Valentino.
When I was a teenager and lived in Italy, I dreamed that I would have an age and a reason to wear one of his evening toilets.
Finally came that hour in the late 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino dress to wear it for a party at my cousin's house, Prince Edward de Lin.
It was a red dress, with a skirt with frills, "corsage" in a fold and a strapless cut.
"It was a dream that came true," says the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
"Valentine is indifferent to fashion, his passion is timeless," explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg keeps her festive dresses from the designer with "maximum caution." because the dress is not just a dress, it is also a collection of memories accompanying it."
The King of Fashion
The great finale of the exhibition at Somerset House is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress for her wedding to Pavlos from Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "girls" (as the designer calls his sewing) to make this outfit of ivory silk with inlaid pearls, twelve types of different lace and a train of four and a half meters.
According to journalist Susie Menques, the greatest authority of the specialized press, the dress is a milestone of high fashion of the late 20th century, "the return of clients from the upper world."
Stunned for many years the "living style" of the elite, now Valentino himself is her best representative.
The Grand Cross (sign of distinction of the highest rank in Italy), the Cavalier of Labor, Commander of the Order of Arts and Literature, awarded the Order of the Legion of Honor, Garavani collected as many honors as any of the spouses of his clients.
"Always my attention was attracted by his sophistication, his calmness, his neat and impeccable appearance," recalls d'Arenberg.
The last time I saw him was at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was sitting at a table with the Countess Jacqueline de Ribe, my big friend.
"He was impeccable, time does not exist for him."
If that's what the princess says...
The heaviest profession in the world: miners from Kawah-Ijen
For four euros, Indonesian miners risk their lives and health, dragging 70 kilograms of sulfur to the top of the volcano on steep rocky paths
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others literally work in hell.
Among them is Anto Vijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn a living by mining sulfur in the Kawah Ijen volcano, located in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
Every day, Anto descends to the bottom of the crater, where sulfur gas rising from the depths of the Earth freezes when in contact with the air.
The breakdowns of huge pieces of sulfur, the total weight of which can reach 70 kg, he puts them in two bamboo baskets, sucks baskets on the shoulders and carries them up on a cliff rocky road.
To the top of the volcano, the height of which is 2.386 meters, is only 250 meters, but it takes more than 40 minutes for eminent loaders to climb the turtle, barely keeping the balance and gently groping the road so as not to stipble and fall off the cliff.
They know that one wrong move can cost them their lives, as happened with a French tourist who fell off the rocks of Kawah Ijen a few years ago.
Miners from Kawah-Ijen earn 5 euro cents for every kilogram of sulfur that is mined
Once at the top, they pave the way between tourists who photograph them, as if they were apes from the circus and, tiredly carrying heavy baskets, walk three kilometers to the scales that the mining company placed a little higher, at an altitude of 1,850 meters.
We are talking about the PT Kandy Ngrimbi, an enterprise that has been operating this volcano since 1960 and, better and not to say, its workers, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 euros) for every kilogram of sulfur.
It then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 euro cents) to petrochemical plants, because this mineral is common in everyday life and is used to make matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to whiten sugar.
"Since the norm is the carrying of 70 kilograms, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each walker," explains Anto, who usually performs three daily carryings.
He spends three hours on each of them and at the end feels broken, but they allow him to accumulate 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) by the end of the day.
Although it seems a miserable for such an inhuman effort, it's three times more than what he would earn in the field.
"The fee to miners is very high by local standards, where 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) per day are paid for the collection of coffee and the average monthly earnings are equal to two million rupees (167 euros)," the loader, who used to work as a stoneman on the tourist island of Bali, explains.
There his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day and the plot was not as heavy, but Anto returned with his family to Banjuwangi, a town near the volcano, which in Indonesia is as crushing as sulfur: "I married a girl from Bali, where the Hindus, and brought her to Java, so she could accept Islam."
Anto's asthma, he's breathing with difficulty, coughing constantly, and his eyes will tear off due to toxic gases.
At the age of 27, Anto spent three years, risking herself in Kawah Ijen, whose sulfur had already begun to affect him despite the presence of masks and special glasses.
He has asthma, he breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly, and his eyes will tear off due to the toxic gases that the volcano emits.
This is the price he has to pay for achieving his dream.
"I'll be working for another two years because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French," he promises in more than acceptable English.
Punished by life, this pleasant and intelligent young man could be a tourist guide, waiter, or a hotel referee, but instead he does the work of a mule.
The detachment is a dirty wooden hut with other porters, it gets up every day at two in the morning, because the sulfur does not cease to flow at night, when its characteristic yellow color turns blue and shines in the midst of darkness.
Throwing a challenge to the shadows, Anto descends into the crater, illuminating his way with a small lantern connected to his helmet, which he himself bought with his money.
About 400 porters drag baskets with gray on their shoulders from the bottom of the volcano
Despite the high profits, the mining company has not mechanized sulphur production to save costs and does not provide any equipment to porters who work on their own account and with such deprivation.
In fact, they do not even receive part of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) of the photo fee, which, along with the entrance ticket for 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), the guards of this reserve charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its mules.
"This work is for livestock, not for people," says Badrusin, a 42-year-old bearer who has spent three decades on Kawah-Jen since he left college.
Able to raise to 110 kilograms, he assures that he will endure the job "as much as he can," because he needs money to educate his three children aged 18 to 10.
I won't retire, I'm going to die here, because the volcano is my whole life.
Although sulfur burns the throat and burns the eyes when the wind suddenly changes and catches miners in the dense pillars of smoke coming out of the volcano, they are so hardy that no one complains about their serious illnesses. more serious, obvious than their habitual breathing problems, arthrose, knee pain and ulcers on the shoulders that were deformed under the weight of the baskets.
Balancing a basket on its back, Unainick can now only lift 50 kilograms at his 53 years.
Every day, he and his comrades take 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which are transported by three trucks to the warehouse in Tamansari, covering a distance of 18 kilometers along a narrow path among the thickets.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano is my whole life," Unainik says, opening a mouth that lacks a few teeth.
Of his five children, the eldest, 30 years old, also works as a sulfur carrier.
Time passes, but poverty perpetuates from generation one of the heaviest occupations in the world: what human mules from Kawah Izhen are doing.
Singapore looking for children to save the economy
Singaporeans blame their careers, stress and housing prices and education for the absence of children.
"The population of Singapore needs to grow."
I am a patriot's husband, you are my wife patriot, we will fulfill our civic duty and create life!
It may seem unbelievable that these lines are part of mint cake advertising, but despite this - or perhaps because of this - this video became a hit on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
These phrases are part of rap, which uses local sayings like "Let's put a bauze in the stove" to laugh at Singapore's birth rate.
The advertising agency that made this video, BBH, cherishes hope that with the help of advertising they will be able to draw attention to this problem in an entertaining form.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music to make people fulfill their "national duty."
This thing is exclusively for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
This is the main problem in the country.
We are the worst in the world in the reproduction of our own kind, so we felt that this is the topic that we should be touched upon.
We knew that the government was trying to do a lot, such as launching perfumes with pheromons or organizing fast dating parties.
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but not necessarily worked.
So we thought, why not make the most creative thing possible to solve this problem, namely, rap?
1,2 children
Those who don't take it so lightly is the government of Singapore.
It spends $1,300 a year on policies to inspire citizens to have more children.
The state package for married couples and parents provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and provides tax benefits.
But all of this has low efficiency.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech city-city state in Southeast Asia, also known for its leadership's conservatism and strict public control.
The birth rate in Singapore, according to its National Population Authority, is currently at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was below 2 - known as the replacement percentage in 1976.
Why don't Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Min, director of the Marital and Families Policy Office of the National Population Authority, said the reason for this was "improved education" and "a wider range of career opportunities."
"This allowed people to have a wider range of options for life goals and priorities, in addition to wedding and family creation," she explains.
These changes in social norms contribute to the increase in the number of bachelors and the postponement of marriages and the birth of children, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, immigration policies, which aim to dramatically increase immigration to counter populations, are outrageous among the local population.
Singapore has websites where barely concealed xenophobia is flourishing against many new immigrants, especially the Chinese, who are criticized for keeping wages low and reluctance to integrate.
The rise of immigration is also seen as one of the reasons Singapore's ruling party has won the worst result in elections since independence last year.
After the election, there was an attempt to solve the problem, with the help of quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the fall in the birth rate has a known impact on the nation's economic growth, tax revenues, medical spending and immigration policies, the Singapore example is also beginning to have some unexpected consequences.
The government is not making much housing.
This has begun to affect the real estate sector.
The urban development guide has shifted to controlling the number of small apartments known as the "shoe box" that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments of 46 square meters are sold very well.
However, it is believed that they can contribute to a single lifestyle and deprive the incentive of developers who want to build large family housing.
But Lim yu Sun, CEO of the home-building firm EL Developers, says their "shoes" boxes are sold much faster than more spacious copies.
They are more popular, in the sense that such apartments are sold out for a few days, even weeks, faster than apartments of larger size.
As a result, our cash receipts are increasing.
However, he admits that the new rules provide clearer benchmarks for developers who used to be hampered if they wanted to offer too many small apartments in the project.
Too stressed
Singapore is a city-state.
While these new rules may be a step toward an increase in the national birth rate, after talking to Singaporeans who are working in the center's financial quarter, it seems that they will not have much effect.
"People are very overstressed, expensive housing, as well as education, and because of this, many people postpone it," says the young manager.
Other people can have children.
"But it's important for me to have my own money and time," says another young man 20 years.
Men and women mention their careers, stress and housing prices and education as the reasons that prevent them from having children.
So, no matter how hard the government is trying to encourage its citizens to have children, with regard to childbirth, the last word remains with Singaporeans.
Offline - personal online
The privacy.
According to the Royal Academy of Spanish, it is a property of private or "the sphere of personal life that they have the right to protect against any interference."
What is personal for a minor under the age of 16?
How does he apply this definition in his daily life and on social media?
Does he understand the dangers that he is exposed to when discussing online situations that I would not have shared outside the Internet?
elPeri-dico interviewed five children from ten to 15 years old, frequent users of the network.
In four cases, they associated the term with "something very mine," in the personal plane, and "the password and username" when they applied it to social networks.
"My biggest secrets I wouldn't upload to the post," Jorge says ten-year-old when he tries to explain the meaning of personal on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he's got accounts for two years.
"It's very secret secrets, my mom can know them, but not the whole world," he says.
On FB I upload beautiful pictures or pictures from the games.
I also have fun with my acquaintances.
"I wouldn't share a photo that's not mine or someone who's beating stupid," he says.
The boy realizes that it is bad to publish indecent photos of naked people, crimes or to write offensive or fierce comments.
Jorge assures that he knows 35 friends he has in the FB and nine of his followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
The mother knows, she has a password to one of the accounts.
I started Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they're answering me, I'm just loading them," he adds.
"Social networks are fun, I can talk to distant relatives or with my friends in a quick way," he said.
Without hesitation, he replied that he would never accept a request from an unfamiliar person.
I wouldn't count anyone who would recommend him to a stranger.
The case of the 14-year-old Jose is different.
This teenager has open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and the latter admits that he does not know the 20 people added to his list of friends.
"It doesn't scare me because we have something in common, music, for example," he said.
According to the boy, no one rubbed his trust and did not ask for his home address or phone number.
"If they put them pressure or demand me, I'll just remove them from my account," he admits.
Jose became a follower of Ask after reading the recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is not alien to the experience of what is known today as cybermobbing.
One friend of mine was blackmailed on a social network.
He was threatened and extorted money.
"He never knew who it was," he said.
The victim, according to Jose, did not delete the account.
"Only turned on confidentiality."
It then explains the sequence of steps to configure an account in a secure manner.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or emfusy situations.
Yes, I would have done it if I don't like a person or if I want it.
"Although I know it's a cybermobbing," he says.
Key issues
Marijelos Porras, an English teacher and specialist in education and training, believes that in order to guide children and adolescents, you need to understand that the goal of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet appeared as a means to search for information, but with the advent of these sites, the rules of the game have changed," she notes.
Porras points out that academician Mark Prensky, a master of pedagogy from Yale University and author of the work of Digital Aborigines and immigrants, invented these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital Aborigines are they, the children and the youth who were born in the age of technology.
"We are digital immigrants who have to teach them while we are still learning," she says.
He explains that this topic is complex, "because we ask them to have a certain criterion of what can or can not be distributed, published or spoken, at an age when maturity is not enough for this."
"Also that they are selective, while the most important thing for them to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," she adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to show privacy to children and adolescents is is to ask questions that make them think.
"Telling them so they don't do it is useless," she adds.
Then Porras lists some options: there are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, so why are you doing it online?
Or would you like it if you'd post a picture of you like the one you published about your friend?
Do you know that others are posting about you?
When you sign pictures from parties, do you ask other people to celebrate them?
And one more, do everyone need to know what you're doing at every moment?
Another point is to let them know that they have to behave online in the same way as they do offline.
The rules are the same.
"Outside the Internet, a person behaves with respect, responsibility and other principles, the same must be on social media," she says.
The Vigilance
Estwardo Guardia, a university professor of primary education and education consultant, explains the need for heads of families to read social media policies in good faith.
By understanding each of the points, they have good grounds for interviewing children about the prerequisites for opening an account online.
"For example, age and what is allowed to be distributed or published," he says.
According to Gaurdium, the key question is to remind children of the lesson "don't talk to strangers."
The UNASUR summit ends without the Lima Declaration
The 6th Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) ended today in Peru without the promulgation of the Lima Declaration, previously and theoretically signed by seven mandatory participants.
Efe has repeatedly tried to gain access to the document signed at the VI regular meeting of Heads of State and Government of UNASUR, but sources from the Office and the Presidential Administration indicated on the main page that it would be handed over after the closure, but then confirmed that at some point it would be published on the Peruvian Government's website.
On questions about the text, they pointed out that the contents were set out by the President of Peru, Ollante Umala, during brief statements to the press.
Journalists" access to the Summit information was limited all the time.
During the day, it was only broadcast, in the press room, a video of the presidential assembly without a sound with a message "closed meeting, sound is prohibited."
Few information that circulated among reporters was provided by the press secretaries of some UNASUR Governments present at the meeting, but not Peruvian.
The only document circulated during the day was a list of participating presidents, which caused dissatisfaction with hundreds of journalists from various national and international media, who asked for more information.
Subsequently, the administration of the President of Peru sent an e-mail to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but we are talking about the statement of Umaly, and not an official document that ended the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the III Summit of South American and Arab Countries (ASPA), and that time, despite the fact that the press insisted that this was insistent, the so-called Lima Declaration, which was previously announced, was also not circulated.
On the official ASA website, you can check that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities tried to provide a system of transmission for all journalists, but limited the receipt of information as much as possible.
The summit also concluded with a joint decision by Chile and Peru to pass the verdict of the Hague Court, which will settle the territorial dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Umala, and Chile, Sebastian Pinera, gathered at a regional meeting and ratified that they would abide by the decision of the International Court of Justice, which began on Monday in The Hague a hearing of the statements of both sides as part of the accusation that Lima brought against Santiago.
"We will respect and implement a decision that will clarify the differences that we are currently submitting to this international court," Umala said, next to his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile was, and will be a country that respects international law, a peaceful resolution of differences, covenants and international tribunals," Pinera added, and greeted Umala with a shank against the background of the flags of the two countries.
The two presidents &apos; confirmation that they would be subject to the International Court of Justice came as soon as Colombia protested this week the Pact of Bogota, according to which it recognized the verdicts of this international court following the decision on maritime borders with Nicaragua, which it found to be erroneous.
The summit took place in the absence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chavez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Christina Kirchner.
Paraguay, whose membership in UNASUR has been suspended since 2011 following the impeachment of its former President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host president, Ollianta Umala, was responsible for the opening of the discussions in the morning and closing the summit, a little later than noon in Lim time.
The head of state read the final document, in which he reported that 16 agreements were adopted and the directions of action for 31 projects among South American countries were approved, the estimated investment amounted to $ 17 billion.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the countries of UNASUR will take "important steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, for which we are expanding residence agreements."
He said action was being taken to improve "cooperation in the fight against the uncertainty of citizens and against organized transnational crime, action to increase the availability of medicines, affordable access to the Internet in all corners of South America and take into account the risks of natural disasters in a cumulative and effective manner."
Since Europe is in crisis, "the economic unification (Latin America) should not have a triumphant basis, but should serve to expand our production framework and anticipate a better future for our cities," Umala added.
"We have decided to give privileges to a group of 31 landmark projects that will improve the connection of South American spaces, especially in the rustic and border zones. bringing together our countries and forming new economic schemes," the Peruvian president said in a read statement.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five belonged to Peru, and were limited to transverse axes on its territory, from coast to Brazil, and two aimed at greater communication with Ecuador, but he did not provide more details.
The final document also affected the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve its rejoining to the Union of South American Nations," from which it is now excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, united, and had good relations between neighbors, was another topic emphasized at the summit.
In this sense, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said before embarking on a regional meeting that he hoped to meet with his Nicaraguan counterpart, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico City to hold a good-governing maritime dispute as a result of the international court ruling challenged by Bogota.
"The day after tomorrow, maybe I'll meet with President Daniel Ortega," Santos said.
"We will reconsider all these paths, they are not mutually exclusive, including the pact with Nicaragua will require discussion with Nicaragua," he said.
"I hope I can tell him that we will cope with this in a most civilized and respectful way," Santos said.
Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico City, where they are scheduled to attend the inauguration of the new president of this country, Enrique Pena Nieto.
Also, within the framework of the summit, the defense ministers of the bloc met in advance for the approval of the Action Plan for 2013, which aims to strengthen dialogue and unanimity on the protection of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay form UNASUR, although the latter's participation is suspended.
Peru has a provisional presidency in the regional bloc.
"South America must learn from Europe on the integration of citizenship": Rafael Correa
Ecuador's president, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of common citizenship is the goal in which "South America, in this case, yes, must learn from Europe."
Correa, who participated in the VI Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), held in Lima, told Peru's state television that the Europeans "killed each other during World War II" and in other clashes, "but now they are almost one fatherland."
He defended, in this context, a South American citizenship project approved by the UNASUR countries.
"We need to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country, as is the case with members of the Andean community, but there are still reactionary sectors that want to bring us back to the past," he said.
The Ecuadorian president has also shown himself a supporter of the resumption of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the precondition of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account those who signed the San Jose Covenant on Human Rights.
Those who lecture never make any commitments, and we South Americans, on the contrary, sign everything.
"It is unclear that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington and funded by the United States," he said, hinting at the political asylum given by Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa assured that he did not regret this decision, because he did not betray his principles with him, but respected his "deep values of democracy and human rights."
He added that at one time "there were some suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and the process would not be observed."
He also criticized Swedish justice for demanding to come to his territory for questioning about the alleged sexual offense, while "Swedish law considers it possible to implement it through a video conference that could be made from the Ecuadorian embassy in London."
Correa confirmed that there is a risk of deterioration of Assange's physical and mental health.
"I haven't spoken to him since he arrived at our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small pulmonary problem, nothing serious," he said.
What really exists is the danger of his physical and mental health being deteriorating due to imprisonment in a small space without the ability to do air exercises.
"It affects the health of any person," he added.
Correa pointed out that the solution to the asylum problem granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, by providing a guarantee of immunity that will allow him to go to Ecuador, is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the European judiciary and stressed that there have been negotiations in London to find a solution to the problem of captivity of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We are not negotiating human rights, we do not use this word in this case, but there were constant discussions.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the European judicial authorities, because Assange's lawyer, Baltasar Garson, is conducting a number of trials in various European authorities," he said.
And he said that "if the UK provides a guarantee of immunity tomorrow, it will end."
And if Sweden, how well she allows her legislation and as she has already done in other cases, will interrogate Mr. Assange at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London or interrogate him on Skype, tomorrow this problem will be exhausted.
Correa took the opportunity to prove himself as a defender of press freedom and stressed that he did not tolerate "mediocrity, bad faith and lies that distort freedom of expression."
"The main enemies of press freedom are not spoiled villains-politics, but bad journalists who support money, blackmail and extortion," he said.
In this aspect, he was satisfied that neither these journalists, "neither bankers nor bourgeois hegemon countries dominate Ecuador," and added that, being re-elected, "will deepen the revolution to continue development in the right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to keep Paraguay's veto in UNASUR at least until the next election, arguing that the organization "must be firm and not tolerated opportunism and support for coups under the guise of the rule of law" because in reality "this has destroyed the legality of Paraguayan democracy."
The Ecuadorian president found, in addition, "full-reasonable" the desire of his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos to negotiate with Nicaragua on maritime borders between the two countries after the decision of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which was in favor of Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty.
At the moment, this decision is not being respected.
This is a problem between the South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the desire to go together.
We need to process them together to overcome them and continue to move forward.
He also expressed hope for a good conclusion to the dispute over the maritime boundaries that Peru and Chile are in the same court, and expressed that "it is right for Latin America to apply to international authorities if the two countries undertake to decide, however heavy it may be."
Regarding the opportunity to act as a candidate in the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador to run for a third consecutive term, he pointed out that he was considering this possibility "with great optimism and joy, although sometimes it is quite difficult."
Correa assured that if he loses in the elections in February 2013, he will leave public life.
Personally, I have never been interested in power, but in unfair situations such as in Ecuador, socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
"My political movement felt that I guaranteed this probable victory, so we have to recognize this responsibility," he said.
If it wins, it would be my last term in office as president, and then we leave public life.
If we lose, the same thing.
"This is a decision," he confirmed.
Correa also mentioned a new course of treatment for Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Cuba.
I just spoke to Venezuelan Vice President Nicolas Maduro, who told me that he went for treatment, which had already been planned, routine, and that he was expected to miss the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean exacerbating the state of health of President Chavez," he explained.
The head of the Ecuadorian state took part in Lima today in the VI Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to support progress, equality and security.
Death from AIDS today is the result of late diagnosis
Fabrizio was 21 when he was told that his analysis for AIDS had given a positive result.
"I was stunned," he recalls that difficult, despite the entire doctor's tact, moment.
The young man hid it from his family.
Deciding to cope with the disease on his own, he wanted to know as much about it as possible. And his efforts were justified - he has already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
Fabrizio is one of the "oldest" patients of the HIV department of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), where he got in 1994, overcoming many obstacles.
He has been living with the diagnosis of "human immunodeficiency virus" (HIV) for 22 years. In the early 90s, it would be hard to believe - too few then there were treatment options, too little knew about the disease, too biased towards the patients.
So, even the director of the clinic of the Mexican Institute of Social Protection did not want to say goodbye to him, "because he had a cut."
In other words, having AIDS was a verdict.
Now it is possible to survive with this syndrome and do this without worsening the quality of life.
However, not knowing about their illness, so far many people come when the virus has already caused damage, "exhausted" their immune system and they suffer from opportunistic infections.
31 years after the emergence of AIDS in the world, at least after the first reported cases, "a great achievement at the moment is that the survival of a patient who begins treatment in a timely manner, and the survival of the general population is exactly the same," said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, head of HIV department at HCG, citing the fact that this information was confirmed in April this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectious and HIV/AIDS expert, Andrade Villanueva, explained that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS has not been a verdict since 2008, but the duration and quality of life depend on the degree of damage to the immune system available in patients at the start of diagnosis, with the best life expectancy in those who do not use drugs: up to 30 years with the number 200 CD4, and up to 50 years, when the CD is reported.
Simply put, the foregoing means that someone who is diagnosed with HIV-positive at the age of 25, according to these terms, "by maintaining control, will be able to live without problems up to 75 years," he explained.
To assess this progress, it should be recalled that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is on average 76 years.
Although the mortality rate has declined significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS has dropped from 6,678 in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that 60 per cent of patients in the national database have died since the onset of AIDS.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and there have already been 187 deaths by May of this year; however, it is alleged that there has been widespread access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
Why are there fatalities?
Personally, I don't think the problem is access to treatment.
So I can imagine it, that's what things are in our hospital.
At least the last 12 years, we have not had a shortage of medicines, the problem is that patients come very late, because they do not know about their infected condition, that is, in the later stages of the disease.
He cited crushing data: "Nine out of ten patients come when they already have some opportunistic infection; what needs to be done to have a greater impact on overall mortality is how to diagnose at an earlier stage, and so it is necessary to provide samples to detect on a massive scale, for all people who will ask for it."
In their proposal, experts and officials of the State Council for the Prevention of AIDS in Jalisco (COESIDA), as well as the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who appealed to a private laboratory, prompted only by the fact that his friend did it and, despite his young age, he was already at the stage of AIDS and even suffered from the sarcoma of Kaposhi, a cancerous tumor.
Things change when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're going to die and they don't want to know.
"If I die anyway, I'd rather be ripping three times a week," they say. But not in my case.
There are positive changes, I eat well, do exercises, take medications.
To date, his parents only know that he has suffered cancer.
I live a normal life like any other.
"I work, I have a lot of classes, I travel, I have an active sex life, but with mutual responsibility, I care about myself and about another person," - said Fabrizio, who agreed to share his personal life with MILENIO JALISCO to encourage his statement to those who are now, in the context of the World AIDS Day, are afraid.
Let them check if there is a risk of infection, let them know as soon as possible whether they are HIV-positive, so better, and if they already have a diagnosis, let them know that they can live, like any other person, being responsible.
His message summarizes the theme of the fight against AIDS this year.
Condoms behind the counter
Great gap between health programs and a simple citizen, says Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara, who has tackled the problem associated with HIV.
And the biggest is prevention.
In places dedicated to this task, "in fact, the spread of condoms has increased, we were given one or two, now we are given packets of a hundred, and this is very good, but it turns out that there are those who still do not have access to the condom," he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are teenagers.
"Why do you need them?" It's a popular issue, with equilibrium and condemnation, by social workers, school counselors, pharmacy staff and health workers who don't want to hear by teenagers, the propagandist assured.
I propose to change this inefficient distribution; that condoms are not only behind the counters and that a hundred of them are in the vending machines in public toilets in places that are often visited by young people.
It's not encouraging promiscuity.
We are not talking about paying for beer and motel, said Governor Emilio Gonzalez, when asked if it was possible to distribute condoms under his leadership.
"It's not sexuality, it's best to make condoms accessible to those who already practice sexual activity," he said.
Key data in Jalisco
13,435 cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV) were reported.
The state ranks 4th in the national ranking for new and total cases of AIDS and 13th HIV.
92% of infections are sexually advocated, 6% through blood and 2% to the perinatal pathway.
An estimated 50,000 people can live with HIV, as there are 4 to 5 people on one reported case who don't know.
Given the ratification by the United States Court of Appeal of the decision, which annuls the restructuring of the Vitro Group's debt achieved through competitive proceedings in Mexico, the scenario sets a fateful precedent for any national company with branches in a neighboring country that has solvency problems.
It seems that the procedures in support of the survival of firms that are permitted by Mexican laws are not valid in the country of bands and stars, in conflict with international agreements.
In practice, the approval of Judge Harlin Hale's June 15 in the bankruptcy court of the northern district of Texas leaves the Mexican firms defenseless in the face of the possibility of arresting their property on the other side of the Rio Grande.
However, the ruling opens the door to the leading glass maker in Mexico to appeal to the United States Supreme Court, giving three inconsistencies as evidence.
As an entry, while the judge of the case notes that creditors should be governed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the Fifth District Court of Appeal, located in New Orleans, says the main proceeding concerns a competitive proceeding in Mexico.
The first paragraph implies the annulment of international judicial cooperation in cases of insolvency of enterprises of a transnational profile.
In fact, to this end, the UN Model Law on the Unification of International Trade Law was created, defining the American Institute of Law as the arbitrator.
Secondly, the verdict establishes that without an interfirm vote, recognized in the critical mass of competitive production of debt owed to the parent company Vitro branches would not have been reached the majority necessary for the approval of the restructuring.
However, this possibility is recognized by Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro was not the first time this scheme was accepted.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose inter-firm debts were guaranteed by the Federal Institute of Competitive Productions.
It is also true that filing the votes of the branches, in one way or another, the Vitro creditors who fought against it in the courts of the United States, namely vulture funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have reached the majority.
Voting would be 45 per cent against 37.
The Court of Appeal drops these.
On the other hand, he accuses Vitro of the difficult situation it has faced since 2008, affected by a serious economic crisis that has overtook the United States by striking the country.
So far, the Gonzalez Sada family's firm will appeal the decision to the court of appeal itself, so that the vote reaches his plenum, that is, five judges, because only three voted.
In the event of failure, an application for a certificate would be filed, which would require a review of the proceedings by the highest court, in the present case of the United States Supreme Court.
Worst of all, the court rejected a document sent by the Mexican government as amicus curiae ("friend of the court"), which describes the proceedings that Vitro follows under the Competition Act, signaling that it is exempting itself from compliance with agreements signed by both countries to link it to article 15 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Act.
In addition, it is noted that the country has complied with the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, that is, the rules established for cases of interstate insolvency, which guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
Caramboil from two sides: they beat Vitro and beat the country.
Total balance
Given the complaints lodged for several months placed on the table by the Mexicana de Aviacien unions against the former owner of the company, Gaston Ascarrag Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent management, the Trade Union Association of Aeronaut Pilots has already found a bottled neck.
The court, headed by Carlos Diaz Chavez Morino, has just submitted a criminal case demand against the National Banking and Securities Commission, which is accused of obstruction of justice.
According to this, the supervisory authority systematically refused to submit reports to the General Prosecutor's Office of the Republic regarding the operation performed by the entrepreneur to extract from the trust fund F/589 of IXE 198 million pesos, on behalf of Mexicana Airlines.
The resources would be aimed at buying shares from the Professional Management Company of Hotels.
As you know, Ascarraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
Surrounded by Dragon Mart
Having met at the Caribbean Forum at the Caribbean University, a group of local and foreign environmentalists, scientists, businessmen and members of the common civil society approved the creation of a broad front to confront the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
We are talking, as you know, about the giant center of sale and distribution in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean products of an isolated country, with a residential area near 150 companies.
Previously, Canacintra managed to unite the governors of the south-eastern zone to confront the monumental forces, which leveled with the ground part of the protected areas and pose serious threats against the industry.
The Death of ACTA
Regarding the government's demand to explain under what conditions and circumstances, the Mexican ambassador to Japan signed the Anti-Country Trade Agreement, known as the abbreviation in the English ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property, the case has already been transferred to the archives.
As you know, the action was performed, despite the fact that the Senate itself disqualified the opportunity to view it as infringing on the freedom of expression on social networks.
Homex in the long run

Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
An avid basketball traveler Hector "Hetin" Reyes was associated with this sport for more than 60 years and, thanks to him, traveled the world.
Few in Puerto Rico keep as many basketball stories as Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
And before a brain hemorrhage chained him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in sports for more than 60 years, as a small-grade player, a player in the Higher Basketball League, an authorized and head of BSN with the Cowboys Bayamon and the president of the Basketball Federation.
"I've played a lot of roles in basketball throughout my life, including several at the same time, as when I was president of BSN, the National Team's Director General and Federation President in the 1990s," Reyes recalls on Primera Hora's visit to his home in Bayamon, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for over 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes does not exaggerate by making this claim.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photographs and memorabilia collected for his long journey, testify to this.
Baymon in the heart
With the greatest emotions, he keeps those who remember his journey through the Cowboys, from the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, when his performance as a co-agrigent or contract agent was 15 years old.
"These were my best years that I enjoyed the most because I had the opportunity to be part of eight Cowboy Championships since 1967, as an agent, co-agent or manager.
There were many years of joy, including the five championships that took place from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, the year of Jerome Minsi's debut in BSN.
From that moment, the "Kuko" Ortiz, who was a great administrator, became the leader of the Kuko, who was a great administrator," Reyes said.
I remember that Gene Bartov, who was going here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me, "I have a very strong player for you, 6'7" tall."
"Do you want to?"
And it was the start of Minsi, one of the best players Puerto Rico'ss.
Bartov then recommended sniper Raymond Gauss, who was granted citizenship and became one of our best bombers.
I remember saying that if Minsi brought the Bayamon championship, Gauss would have helped win one more.
I had the championship of Cowboys with Gauss, but at a distance, because by 1988 I was already the head of the federation.
By that time, I preferred to enjoy his achievements and the achievements of Minsi in the national team.
I remember how we won for the first time against the United States during the Olympic qualifying tournament in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we got fourth place and it had to be bronze, if it were not for the Canadian judge who forced us to outplay the final game, Reyes said.
That team from the 1990 World Cup is the best team you've ever seen?
She's among the best, as well as the one that won against Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the one with the Pan-American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold and smashed the U.S. team, which was quite similar to the one that won our bronze at the World Cup.
Not only did Minsey, Gauss, Ramone Rivas, Fico Lopez and Piculina (Ortisa) played in that team, but also young (Chalchier) Colon and James Carter, brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario' Kicheote' Morales, who was unable to participate in 90 years due to knee injuries.
The team, which may not have been the best in terms of personnel, but brought us a gold medal and great joy, was the team of the 1995 Olympic Qualifiers Tournament in Neuken, Argentina.
With role-playing players like Nyevez, Pablo Alice and young Rolando Hurruitner in return for players temporarily suspended for the mess in the Mar del Plata Pan-American Championships, we won gold contrary to all forecasts.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
Without a doubt, it was Pikulin Ortiz.
His performance in international tournaments is impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico dominated that level the way Pikulin did.
And that's without taking into account his career in the various leagues he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
This is a very difficult question.
We had a very good young man, including Julio Toro, Flora Melendez, Carlos Morales, Raymonda Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
From the young, I really like Leo Arilla's work.
What do you think is your main achievement in the federation?
Participate in the most glorious era of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and that in the early 90s in the BSN there were up to 17 teams in the season.
What do you have to do?
There were things I wanted to implement, for example, to regionalization of smaller categories.
For example, so that the boys from Ponce play only in their field and only against teams from other parts of the island in the national playoffs.
Now the guys are traveling and playing too much, and that's too much.
At least I see the fruits of mandatory certification and course for managers, officials and judges.
It gives me pleasure.
What are you doing right now?
Most of all I listen to music, watch music videos of my era on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball matches.
And, of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been with me.
Died actor Larry Hagman
Born on September 21, 1931 in Fort Worth, Texas, he became world famous for his lead role as John Ross Ewing, better known as J.R., in the television series Dallas, in which he embodied a businessman without principles, evil and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as oil tycoon Jay Ar Ewing in the Dallas television series became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. In the new season of Dallas, he died on Friday night due to complications caused by cancer, according to a family statement provided to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., a Dallas-produced studio.
"Larry has returned to his beloved hometown of Dallas, again playing the iconic role he liked the most," he said.
Larry's family and closest friends were with him in Dallas at the Thanksgiving Fair.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original series and in the sequel, was next to Hugman when he died in Dallas hospital, said her spokesman Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, cheerful, affectionate and talented, and I will miss him very much.
"He was an original person and lived a full life," Gray said in a statement.
Hegman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and admitted that he had been drinking for years.
In 1995, he was diagnosed with a malignant tumor in the liver and he had a transplant.
Long before Dallas, Hagn became famous on television for his role of a decent type in the lightweight comedy "I Dream of Jeannie," broadcast by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it, he played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life changes when he meets an attractive gin girl played by Barbara Eden and begins to live with her under the same roof.
He was also the main character of two comedies that rarely appeared on air, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His work in the film included roles well received by critics in The Group, Harry and Tonto, and Primeric Colors.
But it is his workshop interpretation that is delightfully disgusting J.R. Brought Hagman to the top of fame.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and other characters in his entourage aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The slogan "Who shot at J.R.?," conceived to create a hype around an episode full of emotion in which Hagman's character is nearly killed, spawned international discussions and millions of dollars that risked in bookmakers.
It also helped to attract a record audience to the series at that time.
When the November 1980 episode was answered, an average of 41 million viewers watched it and turned "Dallas" into the second most viewing entertainment program in history, after the 1983 MASH finals, which attracted 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s sister-in-law, Christine (played by Mary Crosby), who shot him.
The J.R. She was interrupted and then threatened to accuse her of prostitution if she did not get out of the city, but others also had reasons to attack him.
Hegman played Ewing as an insatiable corrupt man with a charismatic smile: a dishonest entrepreneur and an infissible husband who wanted his wife an alcoholic, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), to be placed on treatment.
"I know what should be on the J.R gravestone," Hagman said in 1988.
It must be said, "A honest citizen of J.R. rests here. Ewing."
That's the only deal he lost.
Victoria Principal, also the heroine of the original series, recalled on Friday Hagman as someone "huge, both on and off the screen."
It is unforgettable and irreplaceable for millions of admirers around the world, and in the hearts of each of us who are lucky enough to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new Dallas release were shown a few months ago with great success on TNT's channel.
The recording of five episodes of the second season and the sixth was in production, the channel said.
Warner or TNT have not yet made statements about what will happen to the series after the release of Hagan.
A native of Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who shone in classics such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan."
Martin was still a teenager when she gave birth to him in 1931 during her marriage to a lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on the theater scenes of New York in the early 1950s, and then served in the British Air Force from 1952 to 1956.
While there, he met a young Swedish artist Mai Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities live.
In 2001, he named his memoirs, "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life.
"I didn't include anything that would find it that could hurt someone or affect them in any way," he told Prensa Asociada at the time.
After a liver transplant, he began to promote organ donation and worked as a volunteer in the hospital to help patients with fear.
"I give them advice, I give them courage, I meet them when they go on operations, and after that," he said in a statement.
I'm trying to offer some consolation like "don't be afraid, it'll be a little uncomfortable in a short time, but you'll be fine."
He also actively opposed smoking and participated in several campaigns.
The course that explores the "End of the World"
Every week, students explore apocalyptic phenomena such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
This semester, when a professor of religion, Stuart Sharme decided to read a course about the end of the world, he knew he had an irresistible bait: the end of the "long countdown" of the Mayan calendar, on December 21, for which many people seized as proof that the end of the world was coming.
But Sharme had no idea what he had expected in the next couple of months: the catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, the financial crisis that some call "dol-armageddon," and the growing conflict where Israel is drawn into a place where Christian theorists of the end believe that the Apocalypse will begin.
"I didn't realize it would be the most apocalyptic semester of all," Sharme told students at Rutgers-Camden University, New Jersey this week.
If we analyze what is happening in the world at the moment, as if we had only 30 days left, it was a really good period.
And remember that the bad is good for those who have an apocalyptic way of thinking.
And he's not the only professor who offers courses on the "end of the world" this semester, theoretically the last in history.
At Temple University, Associate professor Barry Waker reads the course "Medital Media, Culture and the End of the World."
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
"We analyze why these ideas spread over time," he said, and the way in which hypothetical scenarios cause certain human actions are offered.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, students analyzed films on apocalyptic themes and studied how they relate to real-life examples.
"I tried to tell the students that it might be plausible and impossible," Wucker said.
At the main campus of Pennsylvania State University, Latin American history professor Matthew Realple and his colleague Amara Solari, associate professor of art history and anthropology, joined together to read a course called simply the "End of the World."
"We don't add '2012' to always be able to read the course again if the world doesn't end," Restal said.
Despite the "extinct destruction," students must learn, prepare projects and take final exams.
Penn State's final exam will be taken on the eve of the Apocalypse, which leaves students no choice but to work until the very night the world is expected to end," Restal said.
The courses were quite popular.
"The places ended in two hours," Restell said of his course for students with a high average score, which 35 students enrolled.
We received emails for many weeks before the semester began from people who were asking if there were any more places.
Students, in turn, assure that this course is one of the most interesting.
"I like to see what people are doing to comfort themselves," said Bridge Robinson, a 23-year-old student in the Department of Religion and Sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, in Rutgers Camden.
And the apocalyptic way of thought, secular or religious, is only a matter of comfort or absence.
Will Veques, a 25-year-old student in the Department of Psychology and Nursing, said he watched all the apocalyptic films.
"I've never heard of a course that taught it," he said.
- I like him.
But none of the students surveyed - let alone a professor - said they believed in the end of the world on December 21.
"Our first project affected the Mayan prophecy, and in some ways we discredited it," said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old student at West Chesmer University.
Maya never predicted the end of the world; this is just a key moment in the calendar, Restell said.
But he noted that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, dating back several centuries, where people respond to changes around them, predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused an increase in these speculations.
"In other places, people don't think about it," he said.
Mostly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle, who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly answered the question of whether he knew about any course about the "end of the world" there.
"Philippines do not take part in the end of the world," he wrote, hinting at the order of the higher instance.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall noted that for a long time it was said about many days of the last trial, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will immediately begin to think about the next date" or philosophize that December 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period after which the world will end.
Students and teachers carelessly treat this date.
Some said they were going to the "end of the world" parties.
"Maybe I'll call someone from my friends to laugh together," commented Samira Ford, a 20-year-old student at the Faculty of Communications.
