A Republican Strategy for Resisting Obama's Re-Election
Republican leaders justified their policies by the need to combat election fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter a myth, arguing that cases of election fraud in the United States are more rare than deaths from a lightning strike.
In addition, Republican lawyers counted only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new trends will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, such actions partially discredit the system of American democracy.
Unlike Canada, U.S. states are responsible for organizing U.S. federal elections.
That's why most state governments have passed laws since 2009 that complicate the registration or voting process.
The phenomenon took on a new dimension after the November 2010 election, which brought Republicans 675 new seats in 26 states.
As a result, in 2011 alone, 180 bills were passed restricting the right to vote in 41 states.
New election laws require voters to show photo identification and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws shorten the period of early voting, abolish the right to register a voter on the day of expression of will and take away the right to vote from citizens with a criminal record.
Prior to the 2006 election, no U.S. state required voters to show a photo ID.
Indiana was the first state to introduce such a requirement.
The U.S. Supreme Court confirmed in 2008 the constitutionality of the Indiana law.
Republican authorities were quick to extend the practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they have initiated bills requiring voters to show photo identification in 34 states.
It is important to note that unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have such a universal identity card as a health insurance card.
In fact, 11 percent of American citizens— 21 million people who have reached the voting age — do not have a photo ID issued by their state government.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such a document.
At the same time, the cost of obtaining the required identity card often exceeds one hundred dollars.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people.
In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people earning less than $35,000, 18% of citizens over the age of 65, and 20% of voters between the ages of 18 and 29 do not have the required photo ID.
But that's not all.
Student voters who are believed to be voting for Democratic candidates are not allowed to use a photo ID issued by their school in several states.
But these same states allow members of fishing and hunting clubs, which vote mainly for Republicans, to use the certificates issued by these clubs to vote.
Prior to 2004, no state required proof of U.S. citizenship to vote.
For the first time such a requirement was introduced in Arizona.
Since 2011, more than a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove they are U.S. citizens.
These measures are obviously aimed at limiting the voting of hispanics.
It is estimated that two-thirds of Hispanic voters vote in favor of the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican lawmakers initiated laws in 2011 abolishing voter registration on election day in eight states.
They have also restricted the right of individuals or groups to assist those who wish to register.
This restriction did not pass without consequences.
For example, during the 2004 elections, the voter registration campaign helped to add some 10 million citizens to the lists.
At the same time, measures taken since 2009 have led to a 17 per cent drop in the new voter registration rate in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers have passed laws in five other states aimed at shortening the early voting period.
During the 2008 Florida general election, 33 percent of early voters were African-American, although the latter made up only 13 percent of the state's total voters.
The same thing happened with immigrants from Latin America.
Representing only 11% of voters, they made up 24% of citizens who voted early.
In contrast, whites, who, forming 76% of voters, among those who voted early were only 46%.
Of course, Democratic lawmakers and their supporters actively oppose the passage of laws restricting voter registration.
Several draft laws have been vetoed by Democratic governors.
The most controversial laws were suspended with the intervention of the United States Attorney General.
This made it possible to partially limit the negative consequences.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have passed laws requiring photo identification.
However, the new rules that have come into force will certainly make it difficult to exercise the right to vote in the 2012 elections.
Critics from Democrats condemn the bias of the laws that were passed, seeing in them an obvious focus on influencing the results of the 2012 elections in key states.
A 2011 Brennan Center report shows that states that passed these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes needed in the Electoral College to win a presidential election.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes at the electoral level will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential election.
Only one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, such actions partially discredit the system of American democracy.
Prostate cancer screening: to take the test or not?
In fact, the PSA test produces sometimes erroneous results, false and sometimes false positive, which lead to useless medical intervention.
Men, who are already reluctant to undergo a medical examination, have something to doubt even more.
To take the test or not?
We asked the opinion of two experts.
Studies conducted in the United States have observed numerous cases of infection among the groups studied, so the data obtained are difficult to interpret and difficult to develop any clear recommendations.
Another study, this time European, found a different mortality rate in those patients who underwent screening and those who did not.
This study also showed, after 12 years of follow-up, that those who were not screened were 30 to 40 percent more likely to have metastases.
Therefore, I would recommend taking the test starting at age 50, or from age 40 if one of the direct relatives had prostate cancer.
African-American men are also at increased risk.
The key is to make the right decision as soon as the cancer is detected.
Cancer can be both aggressive and sluggish.
The patient needs to explain the degree of risk of his cancer, offering him possible options, without mandatory treatment of prostate cancer, which does not pose a danger to life in the long term, but making a choice, in these cases, in favor of active monitoring of the disease.
To date, many men who are diagnosed with cancer will not undergo treatment, as their cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a threat to life.
We will offer them active surveillance, and if the disease begins to progress, we will begin treatment.
Increasingly, we are accurately defining the criteria for deciding who should or should not undergo treatment.
Thus, I would recommend taking the test anyway.
But it's also important to consult your doctor to determine whether or not you need to take this test.
In collaboration with the International Association of Urology, Movember has created a tool to assess the pros and cons of taking a PSA test.

Prevent illness
Unfortunately, there is no miracle cure to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of scientific research, maintaining a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of disease.
It is believed that if all people ate well and moved enough, 30% of cancer cases could be prevented.
"If no one smoked anymore, that figure would rise to at least 50%," said André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Association.
However, it is estimated that 10% of cancer cases are caused by heredity.
Several types of cancer remain completely unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Association, smoking control remains a priority, despite the decrease in the number of smokers.
Smoking is associated with 85% of lung cancers.
And it is a risk factor for many others.
It causes enormous harm to people's health.
"Even today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," said spokesman André Beaulieu.
An encouraging fact: 10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is reduced by half.
Weight
According to THE CAR, overweight and obesity also contribute to the onset of the disease.
They increase the risk of cancer of the breast, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
"Studies show that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer," the association adds.
Nutrition
The association also recommends limiting your intake of red meat.
In too large quantities, it increases the risk of colon cancer.
Sausages should also be avoided.
Preserving meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"The latter can harm the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer," the Association explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, many scientists have been investigating the effects of vitamin supplements on cancer development.
But at the moment, the results of these studies can not be called unambiguous.
According to the SCC, studies of vitamin E give conflicting results.
If one of them showed a reduced risk of developing prostate cancer, the other gave the opposite result.
The assessment of the effect on cancer development of vitamin D is also not completely clear.
However, Mr. Beaulieu emphasizes that it is important to discuss your concerns and family history with your doctor.
"Taking the test does not lead to cancer."
Higgs boson in detail
Last summer, the announcement that scientists may have discovered the Higgs boson caused quite a stir – and with good reason.
It is believed that this boson explains the mass of all particles in the Universe, no less.
It is also the last particle whose existence has been predicted under the Standard Model – our best, or at least the least imperfect, description of the nature and behavior of matter – but which had not previously been discovered empirically.
But physicists are not yet completely sure that we are talking about the Higgs boson.
We know, without a shadow of a doubt, that we are dealing with a truly new particle and that it strongly resembles the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, new data presented this week at a major physical congress in Kyoto seems to confirm this, although some data is not yet enough for full confidence.
Let's imagine that we are talking about the Higgs boson, since the chances of making a mistake seem minimal, and let's see what this means.
There is, in this world, one law that is completely inevitable, which states that two things cannot be in the same place at the same time.
There is no way to circumvent this rule, do not even try too hard, otherwise you will harm yourself.
But although particle physics is a rather strange world, it turns out that it also has one law of a similar nature: the pauli exclusion principle, which postulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state" - this "state" is, in general terms,  in some of their characteristics.
Based on this, physicists divide particles into two categories.
In one corner, we find respectable citizens, called fermions, who prudently obey the Pauli principle.
In the other, the bosons fuss, a vile gang of anarchists who have no respect for anything — at least not that principle— which means they can end up in the same place at the same time.
According to the site (by the way, quite extraordinary) Particle Adventure of Berkeley Laboratory, these bosons are divided, in turn, into two groups: mesons, which we will not talk about here, and "force particles", through which the main forces of nature spread and to which the Higgs boson belongs in some way.
These same bosons, it should be emphasized, are not all such exotic creatures as one might think.
In fact, if you manage to read this chronicle, it is thanks to one incredibly banal boson: the photon, or "particle of light", which is the "courier" of the electromagnetic force.
In fact, when a single particle that has an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it "disrupts" the electromagnetic field at that particular location, much like a rock thrown into a pond.
From this "disturbance" an electromagnetic wave (light, or infrared radiation, or ultraviolet, etc.) is born, and this wave is nothing more than a photon – and therefore one of the bosons of "force carriers".
More stable field
The same thing happens with the Higgs boson, with the only difference that in order for this boson to appear, another field, the Higgs field, must be "broken".
However, the Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite it, you need to achieve very, very high energies, as if it were a frozen pond, the surface of which could only be shaken by a very large stone.
That is why a huge particle accelerator is needed, like the one operated at CERN - the Large Hadron Collider, which is a ring with a diameter of 27 km! - to achieve such huge energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is also useful for explaining the relationship between the Higgs boson and mass.
In fact, not all particles and not all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, such as magnets, interact, while others do not: a sheet of paper, for example, will never hold on to the refrigerator itself.
Similarly, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that interact have mass, whereas others (like a photon, by the way) do not.
So, what can all these studies "bring," Ms. Plamondon asks?
In science, they are used to verify the correctness of the Standard Model (CM), and this also allows physicists to find a discrepancy between the results of observations and the predictions of the CM.
In addition, some of them are eager for such a discrepancy to be revealed, because the slightest discrepancy can open the door to "new physics" and plug some holes in the Model.
The latter, it must be said, still has significant drawbacks, offering no explanation for gravity (oops!) or for dark matter, which forms approximately 80% of the universe (oops!).
But so far, CERN has not found such discrepancies.
Consequences
The benefits of these studies for the average person's daily life are harder to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that there is none.
Look: in the very early 60s, the pioneers of laser research in Bell Labs could not even imagine what kind of revolution their work would cause.
They foresaw their applications in science, but nothing more.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (the previous ones were pulsed) in 1962, said that the laser was originally seen more as a "laboratory gadget."
Imagine...
And besides, the application can be found for the toolkit accompanying the study.
For example, the same Williard Boyle, during his optical research in 1969, developed a small light sensor.
This sensor, although it was not at all its original purpose, now serves as an "eye" for all digital cameras in the world and has earned the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.
This, of course, does not mean that the work of the Large Hadron Collider will necessarily change our lives, but it only shows, in fact, that everything can be.
Palliative care is the best way to die... | "Dolg"
The Commission for a Dignified Death in Quebec recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate is due to resume soon, while a bill is being prepared.
Nevertheless, much remains to be done in this crucial area.
"Duty" tried to take a closer look.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his apartment in Monteregi.
The prostate cancer that was destroying him from the inside gave him a two-year reprieve.
"I was given five years, I lived seven," he says, between life and death, lying in bed at the Victor-Gadbua palliative care shelter in Beløy, where he had arrived the day before.
"But it's always a shock, it's impossible to prepare for it," he says.
The disease does its job: an incredible weakness that prevents you from going to the toilet on your own and even eating on your own.
Sitting at a table on which there is a delicious lunch, he gives up and agrees to be helped to eat.
He cheers, even manages to smile, talk to strangers who work around him, bring him medicine, lead him to the bath.
Courage before ordinary death.
"My biggest wish is to be cured of my diarrhea, it's humiliating," he admits.
A few hours later, the staff found a cure for this ailment.
"Over the course of a lifetime, we are taught that a man should urinate standing up," says Pierre Broder, a psychologist at Victor-Gadbois' shelter.
Regressing to the state of a child is for some an unbearable humiliation.
"It all depends on a person's ability" to come to terms with decline, he argues.
Since, according to many people involved in palliative care, important events happen in the midst of this decline.
Patients who are admitted to the Victor Gadbois Palliative Care Home are all cancer patients.
Forecasts give them a maximum of three months of life.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses does not provide any more care, called "curative".
Ms. A., 89, is most afraid of dying "conscious of suffocation."
But the disease allowed me to get to know my children.
"I have good kids," she adds.
"I don't want anything else in life," she says, before allowing her to put a mask to make it easier to breathe.
She is still waiting in the coming days for the last visit of her son, who came from Italy.
At the Victor Gadbois Shelter, with the help of a group of volunteers, they provide body care and nutritional assistance.
This is the palliative care that remains when nothing else can be done.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, there is one place in palliative care facilities for every 11,700 residents.
This is very little, given that sooner or later we will all die.
Here life continues in the best conditions that are possible, explains Dr. Christian Martel, one of the doctors of the shelter.
Whether it's physical, emotional or mental comfort.
To the dying, we will agree to provide mouthwashes of brandy or Pepsi, depending on what he asks.
We no longer force diabetics to control their sugar levels.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last night we brought a beer to Mr. H., who died tonight.
In the morning, his son finished this beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help loved ones as well as patients," says Natalie Savard, director of nursing.
At the Victor Gadbois shelter, no day is like the previous one.
Next to a 93-year-old man who enjoys his last meeting with his family in the yard, sitting on his pillows during a toast in his honor, a young man of 36 years dies tragically, surrounded by his parents, wife and two small children and having tried everything to survive.
"In the last six months, three to five beds are always occupied by cancer patients under the age of 45," says Dr. Christian Martel anxiously.
53% of patients admitted to the Victor Gadbois shelter come from home, and 47% from the hospital.
The challenge of access to palliative care
It is estimated that 77 per cent of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is, the care that is provided to alleviate the suffering of patients who have entered the final stage of their lives, whether at home, in a hospital or in a shelter.
And some institutions, such as the Victor-Gadbois Orphanage and the Greater Montreal Society for Palliative Home Care, specialize more or less exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
It is this large gap in Quebec's health care system that has led many palliative care doctors to fear the passage of a law legalizing euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto has been circulating, signed by the luminaries in the field of palliative care, Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lyapouant, and testifying to their disagreement with such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christian Martel, Quebec's health care system is not effective enough to ensure the right to high-quality palliative care before the transition to euthanasia is allowed.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who spent 14 days in the emergency room in terrible pain, and no one took the necessary measures to alleviate them.
I fear that patients want to die just because they don't get adequate care.
At the same time, many oncologists until the last day try to save patients, despite pessimistic forecasts.
Hopes for Helen Richard's survival were already minimal when she stopped the debilitating chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was stopping treatment, she told me that she was sorry that I was stopping fighting," she says.
At the same time, she herself told me that my days were numbered!
There is no all-powerful care
Dr. Martel estimates that 90% of patients who request death thank medical staff for not complying with their request, after the palliative care team alleviates their pain.
However, it should be noted that palliative care is not absolutely omnipotent in the fight against pain.
According to Elsie Monroe, director of palliative care at the Greater Montreal Society for Palliative Home Care, patients are not susceptible to pain relief in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, in which the patient sleeps until the moment of his death, either from time to time or constantly.
We can no longer pretend that we are unaware of this suffering.
Increasingly, patients who fail to relieve pain will be able to access palliative sedation.
Patients suffering from pain always say the same phrase: "I want to die."
But it doesn't necessarily mean "I want to be euthanized," it means "I want to feel better."
The creation of this report was made possible thanks to a journalistic grant from the Institute of Health Studies of Canada.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials responsible for road construction, building contractors, political party fundraisers and specialists in the Italian mafia tell day after day what they know about the colossal "system" that enmeshes the construction industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and the mafia.
An "industry" that has been very costly to Quebec taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's curious how this system crumbles after all the funds have been put into action," jokes Jacques Ducheneau, a deputy and former montreal police chief.
It was thanks to him that a scandal broke out in 2011 as a by-product of the investigation of official crimes related to road construction contracts in Quebec, to which the prime minister of the time from the Liberals, Jean Charé, agreed very reluctantly.
The Duchennault Report established a direct link between industry, the clandestine financing of political parties, and corruption.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010," he stresses, "the Department of Transportation alone would have saved a billion dollars in contracts" if some restrained their instincts to take a stake.
Charbonneau's commission "has already removed two mayors," he adds, hoping it will be able to "uncover the schemes behind individuals."
Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit established in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, established in 2011, joined the case and included an extensive staff of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
And, in addition, the employees of the special unit "Hammer", which after 2009 forced the "sewage cartel" of Montreal, to stop overstating the value of contracts.
A series of searches have been carried out in recent weeks and some municipal officials, notably Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of a small town, have been charged with fraud and corruption.
Next in line is Gilles Vaillantourt, who recently stepped down as mayor of Laval, Quebec's third-largest city.
He is suspected of repeatedly receiving bribes when placing state orders.
In addition, several engineers of the Montreal Railway Service and construction contractors of Italian origin, including Tony Acquso and Lino Zambito, were formally charged.
The latter detonated a real bomb, telling the investigation about the "system" of obtaining state contracts.
For several years, Zambito gave 3% of the value of contracts concluded in Montreal to a certain intermediary associated with the mafia, who, in turn, transferred money to the party of Mayor Gerald Tremblay "United Montreal".
In the 2000s, Zambito wasted money left and right. He transferred more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to various parties in the province, mainly the Liberals, who were then in power.
In addition, he admitted that he illegally raised funds for the former deputy prime minister from the Liberal Party, Natalie Normando.
Sewer contracts that inflated the cost
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked flawlessly.
Gilles Surprenan, a former civil engineering engineer, described it in detail before the commission: Over a decade, he received gifts from construction firms, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches, and bribes totaling $736,000 in exchange for sewer contracts, the value of which he inflated.
Other officials in charge of road construction admitted to getting a kick out of inflating bills by 30-40% with fake add-ons.
Then, an organizer from the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately turning a blind eye to the existence of a parallel budget that filled the party coffers with dirty money.
Following those revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montreal into a deep crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first MPs in Montreal to sound the alarm.
Mayor of The Rivière de Prairie district in the east of the island, she has resisted since 2010 the sale of a municipal plot bought for $ 5 million and resold for ... 1.6 million developers at the height of the construction boom.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
She says that in the investigation that will eventually be launched, she will "pull on a thread that allows us to understand the functioning of the system teeming with ants to stop gangrene and identify those responsible."
She describes this process as "painful but positive."
We are in the process of cleaning up the wound, but Montreal will need its own investigative team and observer to avoid the return of questionable practices.
How we clean the house.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchennault notes for his part that "officials stole hundreds of millions of dollars," but he is particularly concerned about the role of "elected officials who knew about this scheme" but did not participate in the fraud.
Given that the share of dirty money in campaign finance in Quebec reaches 70%, he jokes: "I was told that it was just a pale reflection of reality."
The Quebec government is proposing to limit donations to parties to $100, but it said that won't change the situation: "As long as we don't strictly limit election spending, there will be dirty money in politics."
It requires a complete overhaul of the system of granting public contracts and financing parties: "We cannot sink lower; by boldly getting to the bottom of things, we can build a house on a stronger foundation, with better control and legality."
If this story casts a shadow over the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchennault urges those who laugh to look into their own backyard ...
"PSG are not FC Barcelona!"
You've achieved extraordinary momentum at PSG this season.
How do you explain this growth?
This can be explained by individual consciousness, but it can also be explained by a new dimension of PSG.
Great players have arrived.
Next to them, I grow every day.
The technical staff also brought a lot.
These factors make me raise the level of my game on a daily basis.
And during the match, it's easier.
In football, everything happens very quickly.
But I'm not getting inflamed.
From the very beginning at the pre-treatment centre at the NIF in Clairefontaine until my arrival in Saint-Etienne, I have always stepped forward.
In this way, you benefit from the competition established by Carlo Ancelotti...
This summer's replenishment is not new to playing matches of a very high level.
They also know that every workout is very important.
This leads to a player like me wanting to be on the level and give his best.
In addition, Carlo Ancelotti provides support in my positioning.
He is assisted by deputies like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the master of the situation?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect for all technical staff.
Today in the First League he has no equal and he is among the best coaches in Europe.
He has extensive experience and has won quite a few titles with high-profile clubs.
He's worked with great players.
I think he will bring new titles to Paris.
In January, I had a reassuring conversation with him.
Then I was moving away from a series of injuries.
The trust he places in me also explains my accomplishments.
What do you think of the first part of PSG's season?
In the First League, Lyon took away our place as leader.
But we're still ready.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we effectively qualified for one eighth of the final.
What is the club's goal in this tournament?
We will try to go as far as possible.
From now on, anything can happen.
We will be able to have our say face to face with very good European teams.
We first want to finish first in our group, in front of Porto, to be able to take the second leg in the one-eighth final.
Can PSG become a first-class European club in the short term?
He already has the budget for that...
In order to become a major European club, Paris needs to win titles and consolidate positions for the long term.
That is not the case today.
Financially, PSG have the means to make this project a reality.
Not taking the title in League One like last season would be a big failure?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
This year we really fervently wish to get this championship title.
Last season we were close to that.
In May, there was disappointment because we had everything to finish first.
It's been a very good season.
We finished it with 79 points.
As a rule, 79 points implies the title of champion.
But another team, Montpellier, played an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think it's going to be okay.
Despite the fact that such strong teams as Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux have entered the fight for the title, I think that we have the strength to win.
Don't you think the media expects too much from PSG?
It's normal that a lot is expected of us, given how much has been invested and what kind of players we have.
We are fully prepared for this.
On the other hand, when we win 4-0 against Troyes at home and still find something to criticize for, of course, it's a bit frustrating.
We wonder what people expect from us in the first place.
We can never win every weekend 4-0.
We are not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to implement a game project.
A team is formed over time.
We proved in the Champions League that we can respond to modern challenges.
Look at Manchester United, who have failed to reach one-eighth of the final for two seasons, although they also spent a lot of money!
Given the amounts invested, we represented you 15 points ahead by the winter break.
That would be a disregard for our opponents and for the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not at their best last season, were "awakened" by this new PSG.
It shows how exciting League One is.
I hope that in May we will be able to smile and tell ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, we won as a result.
PSG seem to be completely dependent on the exploits of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
So what if they say that there is some kind of "Zlatan dependence".
It only means that Ibrahimovic is very successful and that he scores a lot of goals.
He came for it and he proves that he is a star of the First League.
Wherever he has played, he has shown that he is a great player and a global star.
In the group, we respect him as a person and as a player.
He also respects the people who surround him.
What he's done is really exceptional.
This encourages others to improve their game as well.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also motivates everyone to move forward.
How did you survive Euro 2012 with France?
Like a disappointment.
I was eager to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from snatching some playing time.
I saw a lot of things there, and I came out stronger.
Today I manage to play good qualifiers.
That's what I've been hoping for since I was baptized by the Blues.
We have learned from what happened in Ukraine, and now we must behave in an exemplary manner.
What do you think of Didier Deschamps' first months at the helm of the Blues?
They are effective for him.
He has a good position in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
He is a strict coach, he is close to the players and inspires to win.
Which was Laurent Blanc.
But I wouldn't want to compare.
Blanc achieved his goal, he qualified us for the Euros.
Hopefully Didier Deschamps will bring the Blues to Brazil.
Is a good deserved draw (1-1) snatched on October 16 in Spain a foundational match?
This match gave us faith in ourselves.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before this shock in Spain, I had never had a match like this in my career.
Pay and sell without the help of banks - with Bitcoin
The exact opposite of the current monetary exchange based on central banks, numbered transactions between the receiving parties with commission fees for their processing.
Moreover, as is often the case with these technologies, a political vision is evident: the belief that the current monetary system, consisting of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros ...) and a secure exchange protocol like BitTorrent, which allows you to exchange files between participants of the same level.
About 200,000 transactions have already been recorded from 15,000 computers on the network.
Several thousand sites accept bitcoins to make donations or as a means of payment.
Bitcoin, having peaked at $30 (€23) in June 2011, fell to $2 five months later before returning to about ten dollars today (rates are listed on the bitcoincharts.com website).
Nothing special compared to the global exchange of real money or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB), in its report on the virtual currency published in October, became interested in this system.
He describes bitcoin as "the most successful virtual currency," "competing with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to conventional currencies."
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies like "credits" used to promote a video game, which are earned in the course of the game or that can be bought (and sometimes exchanged).
The social network Facebook has also developed a similar system.
But exchange operations are always controlled and processed by some central authority.
In Bitcoin, all nodes on the network are simultaneously ledger holders, auditors, currency issuers, buyers, and sellers.
How does this network work?
Every transaction between two users actually takes place between two email addresses, similar to an email.
Only for each new payment, the user can choose a different address, thus ensuring anonymity.
The set of information relating to this transaction is signed electronically, using a double-key encryption system.
The network can also verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file, it is possible to verify that the bitcoins used in the transaction actually exist in a public ledger sent throughout the network.
The key step is to register a new transaction in this ledger.
It goes through the solution of a mathematical problem sent to computers, which, like a temporary central bank, gets the privilege of adding this new line.
We are talking about the hashing phase of a file, that is, converting a large file into a digital signature, short and unique.
Computers "take" a new transaction and add a number to it before "hashing" everything together.
The goal is to find a number that will yield a unique digital signature (many zeros at the beginning).
Once this number is found, other nodes easily verify that it is correct.
The transaction thus turns out to be non-rationally connected to the chain of all other transactions; any modification would change the digital signature.
If, for the purpose of deception, the user very quickly (in less than ten minutes) wanted to pay twice with the same money, only one of these two transactions would be confirmed by the network - and the other would remain unconfirmed, since they have different electronic signatures.
The computer that solves the problem receives 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, the reward is regularly split in half, probably until the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible to one hundred millionth, which leaves another reserve...
The complexity of the task also increases with increasing computing power.
The life of the network has already experienced ups and downs.
Bitcoin service sites have been attacked and bitcoins have been stolen from reserves.
"The defect used does not concern the protocol itself," says Pierre Noise, who recently launched Paymium, a company that makes payments in real money using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reported on the possibility of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash also has this drawback.
Big players like Wikipedia refuse to accept donations of this kind.
Others, such as the WordPress blogging platform, allow them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed a ledger and found that nearly 80% of bitcoins are not in circulation.
"Giant sales" were announced in November.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged," rejoices Jon Holmqvist, who works at Coinabul, which converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noise, another author of a manual on this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as an operating network.
Its system, Paytunia, is the equivalent of a credit card (in real money) or contactless payment via mobile phone, but it uses Bitcoin to verify transactions, which thus comes out cheaper.
The holder has better control over his personal data and can thus be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement for entrepreneurs who do not need to install new devices or software.
It is enough just to provide an address that can be "photographed and recognized" by phone, pierre Noise specifies, assuring that he already has thousands of users.
There is a general tendency to revise hierarchical systems in favour of more horizontal ones.
"It will be some time before Bitcoin takes hold, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicts.
The ECB in its report suggests, by the way, to revise the various risks that are considered to be elevated today, in the event of the success of this system.
We left Afghanistan.
What's next?
French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans should follow in late 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain control of its territory and for Afghans to choose their future without relying solely on us.
We suffered mainly Afghan peasants, whom we viewed as terrorists.
And ourselves, with 88 soldiers killed, and wounded and maimed.
The Taliban consist of foreign extremists, former commanders hiding in Pakistan, but also often peasants who reject the presence of a foreign army, as was the case under the USSR.
They want to protect their traditions, old and archaic, even if they are joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
They are tolerated, sometimes helped by local insurgents, but they will no longer exist once the West behaves more delicately.
The departure of the French troops from the Nijrab base, which I observed from the height of the hills planted with almond trees thanks to French credits, was in order.
Convoys of trucks and armored vehicles, accompanied by helicopters, reached Kabul without being attacked.
From the end of 2014, there will be no Taliban invasion of Kabul.
Circumstances have changed since their insurmountable advancement from 1994 to 1996.
At that time, Kabul was empty, the country was in flames and blood because of the struggle between different factions.
Their taking control of the country was then perceived as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
Afghan women paid the price for the obscurantism of these peasants, in which they were surpassed by al-Qaeda, but their situation has not improved today.
The former mujahideen, the Afghan government and the current Taliban are united in their desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The main characters of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They turned into dealers seizing state land to resell for development to immigrants who had returned from Iran and Pakistan, taking advantage of huge American subcontracting contracts.
They are discredited; most of them, by the way, didn't even fight themselves.
People, as I've heard in rural areas, want a government that doesn't consist of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have managed to american generosity: the outflow of capital is significant.
Young people are tired of war and its ideology.
They lived in the modern world during the exile in Iran or Pakistan, they appreciated its advantages.
About 65 per cent of the population is under the age of 25; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, one fifth of the total population.
Public schools in the cities are filled with both boys and girls.
It is necessary to provide jobs for these young people, who will not want to return either to the obscurantism of the old parties or to the corruption of some leaders.
Everyone, including armed militants, loves mobile phones, television and Turkish soap operas, which represent the modern world, and which are watched everywhere.
At the moment, the army is there.
Will the authorities who command it be considered legitimate?
The old commanders who waged the anti-Soviet struggle are already taking measures to restore provincial militias that would not be subordinate to the central authority.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with strong local differences, should be decentralized to a certain extent, modeled on Western countries, but the United States wanted to turn it into a centralized state with strong presidential power, eliminating the post of prime minister that had existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, especially ahead of the April 2014 elections.
But his country, since the 50s, and even earlier, has been dependent on foreign aid.
Industry has not been put on its feet, no dam is functioning, no irrigation system has been repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except vegetables and fruits.
Priority is given to private initiative.
In a country devastated by thirty years of war, state control over infrastructure would be necessary.
There were rumors that Afghanistan had huge mineral wealth.
This only reinforced the sense that Western countries were there only to possess them.
With no energy to process iron ore or copper on site, no means of transportation to export through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have almost left the Mes Aynak copper deposit, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to excavate the huge Buddhist complex and remain the province's largest employers.
It is also imperative that one day, equally, Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which imports and exports depend heavily, restore normal relations.
The withdrawal of French combat units was completed on November 20.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the preservation of traditional assistance: a lyceum for girls, for boys, the Faculty of French at the University, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in an effort to "win hearts and minds" and accomplish the impossible task of combining aid with offensive operations, the "civil-military activity" service under the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), abolished in 2012, together with a small French public organization, has contributed to numerous public works and activities aimed at restoring agriculture in dozens of mountain villages.
These works, with the intensive involvement of local labor, were able to help contain the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, forest restoration, fruit trees, soil protection and an increase in the area of arable land.
What will we leave behind when we spend two billion euros on military spending?
A much more modest budget would help to improve the living conditions of the local population, which are very harsh in these valleys, often located at an altitude of more than 2,000 meters above sea level.
The Embassy has received dozens of written requests for small-scale agricultural activities emanating from local communities in the province of Kapisa.
To get rid of the uprisings led by foreign groups, which the farmers want, as they told me, you need to give them a little non-military support that is well controlled and goes directly to them.
The Hard Births of the Egyptian Constitution
This is a new risky move by President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt is divided more than ever, on the issue of a constitutional declaration that temporarily gives it emergency powers, it has decided to play all-in.
Taking everyone by surprise, he announced Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote on the final text the next day.
Exactly one week ago, the head of state gave the Assembly two additional months to finish its work.
It will soon be two years since Egypt has relied on the preliminary text, which has been amended several times, which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal contradictions.
This new initiative has only deepened the division of the country.
According to his opponents, the President persists in his "autocratic delusions", continuing to "violate this word" and "trample on the law".
His followers believe that this is a way to end the institutional and political crisis by accelerating the transition process.
The referendum must be held within fifteen days.
A very short period of time that causes the Brothers to abandon the intention to explain to the Egyptians the text, article by article.
For the president, it is also a way to restore public and democratic legitimacy while discontent rages across the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that Egyptians will vote positively, as he stated in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Moreover, the call for an accelerated vote is like an ultimatum to the Egyptian people: "Either you vote for my text, or I retain emergency powers", which are supposed to end after the adoption of the Constitution.
In this strange atmosphere, 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, mostly Islamists, voted in favor of the text yesterday.
Most liberals did not respond to the challenge.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they slammed the door, feeling unable to get their say.
Representatives of human rights defenders, religious minorities or civil society have done the same.
In order for the necessary quorum to be reached, 11 reserve participants were hastily added yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
Not surprisingly, in most cases, the articles were voted unanimously.
Commentators, by the way, were amused by the fact that one of the few disagreements of the day arose around ... time for prayer, as some members of the committee felt that the clock of the Constituent Assembly was misconfigured.
The text, which was still being voted on yesterday, consists of 234 articles.
The object of widespread attention, Article 2 ultimately remained identical to the article from the 1971 Constitution stating that "the principles of sharia are the principal source of law".
Salafist parties, for which the introduction of Islamic law is one of the main demands, hoped to replace "principles" with "rules", which would allow for their stricter application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is a testament to their goodwill and respect for other members of Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy," answer liberals, who see it only as PR.
Because, in their opinion, the Islamization of the Constitution takes place through other articles.
They point in particular to article 220, which gives Al-Azhar University an advisory role, in particular with regard to verifying compliance with Sharia law.
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, this is alarming because "the people called upon to make decisions are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy."
We can watch the birth of a theocracy."
Many liberals, moreover, are excited by the fact that the next rector of this university seems to be much less moderate than the current one.
"At the moment, there is no specific religious interference.
With this constitution, we remain within the framework of civil law.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not ulema, but people with university education, some trained in the French system," reassures Alexis Bloche, who is preparing a dissertation on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges that "there may be ambiguity around article 220, as the terms used in it are borrowed from religious vocabulary.
This applies in particular to "fiqh" [Islamic jurisprudence].
And in the future, the question may arise as to whether civilian judges are competent to rule on this."
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday has been criticized because it gives broad powers to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood claims that they are significantly reduced compared to what they were under the old regime.
Another controversial point: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the consideration of the defense budget will take place not in the Parliament, but in the National Defense Council.
Nor will the trial of civilians in military courts be prohibited, despite requests from human rights associations.
The latter also expressed concern about the text, which they considered disastrous for freedom.
Responsibility for blasphemy is retained, and insult is now prohibited, which can have serious consequences for freedom of speech, and especially for freedom of the press.
In addition, none of the articles are more about protecting women, said Heba Moraef of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture in article 36.
A word that did not appear in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president was supposed to speak on television last night, demonstrations are scheduled for this afternoon.
Supporters of the head of state, in turn, will take to the streets on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are waiting for holy places, the Navel of the Earth and the sea of brine
The Promised Land combines the greatness of biblical truths, modern comfort and pristine nature.
"AiF" identified the five most important reasons why you need to visit Israel.
Let's Worship the Holy Places
It is worth visiting the Jordan River, in which Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that God's grace descends on all who enter this "font".
And Galilee is the place of Jesus' miracles: turning water into wine at a wedding, walking on water, calming a storm and filling nets.
Here Jesus appeared before the disciples and after the resurrection.
But most of all there are shrines in Jerusalem.
Believers here pass the Way of Sorrow or the Way of the Cross of Jesus (in Latin - Via Dolorosa).
It begins at the fortress of Anthony - the Praetorium - where there was a judgment, and through the streets of the Old Town leads to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on Mount Calvary - to the place of the Crucifixion, the Stone of Anointing and the burial place of Jesus.
Here is the symbolic Christian Navel of the Earth, symbolizing the salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem was erected on the site where, according to Christian legend, a tree grew, from which a cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus.
Jerusalem is home to the holiest site for Jews, the Wailing Wall, left over from a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
By tradition, people of different confessions leave notes here with wishes, which are then fulfilled.
Take a trip vertically
The ruins of the fortress of Massada are left from a secret refuge from enemies, which Herod the Great built in 25 BC for his family.
They are located on sheer cliffs in the mountains at an altitude of 450 m above sea level.
And only those who are fond of mountaineering can get to them on their own.
The rest are taken to this historic peak by cable car lift.
And in the north of the country at an altitude of 1600-2040 m is the famous ski resort of Hermon, where in the winter months there is a huge influx of tourists.
A shuttle bus delivers to it from the foot of the mountain.
The total length of the ski slopes is 45 km.
According to an ancient legend, pagan gods allegedly lived on the top of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
You can't visit all of them in one trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting, are worth a visit.
Among them is the Israel Museum, located near the Knesset (Parliament).
It contains the oldest Qumran manuscripts, or Dead Sea scrolls, found in the caves of the Judean Desert, and about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
It is worth visiting the Museum of Art in Tel Aviv.
His exposition widely presents paintings of impressionists and expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cezanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall, Picasso.
In Acre, you can visit the Al Basha Bath Museum, which consists of several halls of ancient Turkish baths with dummies of visitors and bathhouse attendants of that time.
In Caesarea, you should go to the unique private Rally Museum, where you can admire the sculptures of Dali and Rodin.
There are no guides and souvenir shops.
Admission is free, and donations are strictly not accepted.
The fifth, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, tells about one of the most dramatic pages of history.
The most tragic section - a children's memorial - was built in memory of 1.5 million children killed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You go into it and you find yourself in absolute darkness.
The stars twinkle.
And the names of Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they died are heard.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Healthier
The three main resort areas of Israel are located on the coasts of the Mediterranean, Red and Dead Seas.
Each of them has swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and oceanariums.
Interestingly, the Red Sea is bathed even in the winter months, since the water temperature there does not fall below 21 degrees Celsius, and the air warms up to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer, and they swim there all year round.
By the way, this most unusual sea in the world is located on the lowest point of the planet - at 417 m below sea level.
The azure water in it is a brine that easily keeps afloat even those who do not know how to swim at all.
The scenery around is unrealistically beautiful.
They come here to undergo a course of treatment with the use of salt water - brine, and healing mud, and to treat health with dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes mellitus, to put in order the shaky nerves.
Touch the mysteries of antiquity
They are kept by the old part of Tel Aviv - the town of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
The famous Sea Route passed through it, connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to legends, it was here that Noah built his ark, and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom they lived a long and happy life here.
Tourists love to wander through the narrow streets, named after the signs of the Zodiac.
They say that if you touch the walls on the street of "your" sign, Fortune will become favorable.
In Jaffa, you can meet newlyweds coming from all over Israel and even other countries for a photo shoot.
And in Caesarea - the city of King Herod - you can wander around the Roman theater, "take" the fortress of the Crusaders.
In the Roman period, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman procurators, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theater is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
Note for tourists
Going to Israel, do not worry about your imperfect English: in the country about 30% of the population knows Russian.
It is better to take money on a trip not in euros, but in dollars, which are easy to exchange for shekels (now 1 dollar - 3.8 shekels).
Urban transportation is mostly buses, but Jerusalem has a light rail, and Haifa has the country's only metro line consisting of six stations and linking the Lower City with the Upper City.
In fact, it is an underground funicular.
Travel in all types of public transport costs 6 shekels, for which you can travel with transfers for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, Shabbat is celebrated on saturday.
From Friday evening until sunset on Saturday, markets, shops, and public transport stop working.
And on Sunday morning, the working week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels - only kosher food, excluding pork, seafood, fish without scales and dishes in which milk and meat are combined.
They offer a large selection of lamb and beef dishes, soups and desserts cooked with coconut milk, traditional Jewish hummus pasta, a variety of sauces, balls of ground chickpeas - falalel, fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
But there are a lot of fattened cats that impressively "walk by themselves."
In the evening, they can be seen sleeping even on the roofs of parked cars.
Purrs love crowded places and do not refuse treats.
Renting a car, depending on the brand, will cost from $ 37. per day (Hyundai Getz) to 188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Plus insurance - $15. per day.
A bike rental will cost 15 NIS. per day.
Tickets to museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
The language of numbers
In 2012, Israel was visited by over three million tourists from all over the world.
Most of all, citizens of the USA, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine came to travel and rest.
From January to October 2012, 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists visited the Promised Land, which is 51% more than in 2010, before the abolition of visas on February 9, 2011.
"Great and mighty" will bring to Moscow: migrants save money for the language
While deputies and human rights activists are arguing what the law on mandatory language testing will give, scammers selling "fake" certificates have already appeared in the country
Every year, 13 million guest workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities of Russia.
For the most part, these are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to support the families left in their homeland.
On December 1, a law came into force, according to which every labor migrant will be obliged to pass an exam on knowledge of the Russian language.
So far, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service sector, housing and communal services, everyday life and retail.
However, over time, the FMS promises, the tests will become mandatory for all visitors.
Moreover, you will have to pass not only the language, but also Russian history and the basics of legislation.
Knowledge of the language will have to be confirmed both to obtain and to extend a work permit.
The exception is valid only for citizens of those countries where Russian is the state language.
People who managed to obtain certificates and diplomas of education before the collapse of the USSR in 1991 are also not subject to the law.
Usefulness, doom and protection of rights
The network of examination points will operate under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute of the Russian Language, the Peoples' Friendship University, Moscow State University, St Petersburg University and other Russian universities.
Migrants will be able to take tests in all cities; more than 160 such centers have already opened in Russia.
The initiative to introduce testing was supported by both State Duma deputies and the Federal Migration Service.
But human rights activists, before the law came into force, many times managed to ask the press a question: what, in fact, will it give?
What will change the obligation to know the language for both Russians and visitors themselves?
First of all, - representatives of the migration service answer, - this will reduce the number of people suffering from "labor slavery".
A lot of people are now talking about protecting the rights of labor migrants, explains Viktor Sebelev, head of the representative office of the Federal Migration Service of Russia in Tajikistan.
The protection of their rights must begin before their departure.
Only a system of organized recruitment will solve the problems of foreign workers by 90%.
Problems appear in migrants without a profession, education, who do not know the language, do not have a medical examination.
Without understanding the language, - Sebelev is sure, - the future migrant is doomed to face unscrupulous people who, under the guise of help, will shove him a "ticket" into a terrible cramped barracks, where he and dozens of others like him will languish for months without food and documents, working hard for 12-14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
"At home, they are promised one thing, but upon arrival they are deceived, their passports are taken away, they do not pay the promised salary," confirms Tolib Sharipov, head of the Main Department of Labor Migration of the Ministry of Agriculture of Tajikistan.
Don't swear, nasyal!
Nevertheless, while many citizens of the Central Asian republics, going to work in Russia, admit that they not only do not know the language of the country to which they aspire, but also write in their own with difficulty.
Of course, this is not so much their fault as trouble: few Turkmens, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to get even a sensible primary education.
After all, their families have nothing to even feed their children, let alone dress them decently, shoe them and equip them for school.
Growing up to adolescence, such guys at the first opportunity go to work.
It is difficult if the knowledge of the language is bad, they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
However, with regard to the law on language, human rights activists note one important point.
Testing will be carried out only for those migrants who have legal status.
If there is no status, there will be no exam or subsequent official work.
Meanwhile, most of the guest workers still live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome, or Outsiders are not allowed to enter"
Many of the visitors argue that obtaining official status in our country is not so easy.
The reason is bureaucratic obstacles and all the same language difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
But a fake registration can be done quickly and in just fifteen hundred.
Russian police officers know that we mostly have false documents, no registration, hence the cases of extortion.
"They are asking for a hundred, two for cigarettes, tea," Tajik citizen Umed Khushkadamov told reporters.
"Fly, don't skimp, buy paintings"
On the first day of the entry into force of the language law, it turned out that not only migrant registration documents are fake.
Several "fake" certificates of passing language tests have already been seized by FMS employees.
Counterfeit papers are printed on a regular color printer.
Of course, they went to the new owners not for nothing: each of the migrants, hoping in this way to facilitate the task of passing the tests, paid seven thousand rubles for the document.
This is more than twice as expensive as the official testing procedure: it will cost a migrant worker three thousand.
The fact that the main task for the near future is to protect the system from corruption, so that the "crusts" cannot simply be bought, both representatives of the authorities and human rights activists converge.
In the meantime, the authorities can promise guest workers who failed to successfully pass the test the first time, time to study a basic language course.
In addition, visitors who do not know Russian will be offered work in areas that do not involve active communication with people.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs does not take into circulation the illegal arms market
The proportion of crimes with the use of legal weapons is extremely small
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia proposes to tighten the law against owners of civilian weapons.
This is the authorities' reaction to recent incidents: Firing shots at weddings when there were no casualties, and the massacre by Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, which killed seven people.
Police want to ban the carrying of traumatics in public places and raise the age at which you can get a gun license - from 18 years to 21 years.
The idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption Irina Yarovaya and promised that amendments to the law on weapons will be submitted to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is happy with the fact that the Russian authorities are trying to deal with the problem by "tightening the screws".
An open letter appeared on the network, the authors of which - representatives of various public shooting organizations - demand to abandon the "senseless tightening".
The percentage of hooliganism with registered weapons is minimal, forensic lawyer Vasily Lesnikov told the BBC Russian Service.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, in the first six months of 2012, 142 crimes were committed with the use of firearms registered with the internal affairs bodies, while a total of 1168 thousand crimes were recorded during the same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that the tightening of legislation in the field of civilian weapons does not prevent the criminal from going to the "black" market.
Now, according to them, in Moscow you can find any weapon at a low price.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Internal Affairs claims to be in control of the situation with the proliferation of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The "black" arms market is replenished through several channels.
There are five main such channels, says retired Colonel Viktor Baranets, who worked for ten years in the structure of the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of a site that accepts orders for weapons
The first is the "army or military trail," that is, weapons that were stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were carried by both Russian officers and Caucasians themselves," Baranets said.
The next type of "black weapon" is stolen by criminals from representatives of law enforcement agencies.
Baranets explains that this includes those taken away from police warehouses, and stolen directly from law enforcement officers.
Illegal "trunks" go on sale from military warehouses.
Explosions often occurred in many military warehouses.
"There are proven versions that some of the arson was done specifically - to cover up the shortage," says the former military.
Their contribution, according to Barants, is made by weapons manufacturers.
"Now there are private arms factories that cannot withstand competition on the international market and throw weapons from under the floor to the black market, including in Moscow," the expert says.
Another source of the black market is smuggling.
Especially a lot of pistols and machine guns come from poor countries, for example, Kyrgyzstan.
"It has its own production, sometimes handicrafts, and a mafia has formed that has organized a flow," the former military man explains.
Where do the weapons come from?
Experts calculated what is the approximate share of each of the sources of supply of illegal weapons to the "black" market.
A report on this in 2011 was prepared by the Center for Problem Analysis and Public Management Design.
Experts analyzed the reports of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Rosstat, criminological literature and open data of portals on weapons topics.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, the researchers write, come from the army and law enforcement agencies.
Half of all weapons on the black market ended up there "through the fault of officials whose work involves guns," the report said.
According to researchers, 17% of cases of weapons come from places of armed conflicts, in 14% of cases there are thefts at the stage of weapons production, 5% are accounted for by "black archeology".
A sales consultant at one of the gun stores, who asked not to be named, assures that the weapons found by black diggers have not been bought for a long time - too old.
Most often, as he says, for a new batch, sellers go to a military warehouse.
Through an ensign, a person buys a unit, such as a TT pistol.
They write it out to him, pass it over the fence.
"He takes it to the city and here sells it for 900 euros apiece with two shops," he says.
"True, the police are aware of all the cases, so periodically when the plan for solving crimes is on fire, they conduct a test purchase of illegal weapons from dealers," the consultant adds.
"Like in a luxury store"
The seller and the buyer most often find each other through acquaintances.
I looked at websites, blogs, until a friend responded, who offered to come to the platform "Begovaya", where there would be a person who would take me to the "corner" where we would bargain.
I found out the price of the barrel only there
military observer Viktor Baranets
To get the barrel, I need a friend who has a way out, - says the sales consultant. - I have such a friend, but I'm not sure about it.
There are sellers in the markets, but you also need to come there, conditionally, "from Ivan Ivanovich, who asked to convey that his daughter's tooth fell out."
I'm even getting a couple of brass knuckles now through the person I'm sure of.
He also supplies them only to me, because he knows that I will not pass it.
Beginners look for weapons in different ways.
Former military man Viktor Baranets tried himself as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when he was preparing an article about it for publication.
The schemes, he said, have not changed.
He was given an album of photographs with "anything."
"I felt like I was in a luxury store," the soldier recalled.
The buyer, according to Baranets, is not offered a pig in a poke - everything can be tried.
I, a potential customer, do not just buy - we go with the seller to the forest, there we put a target.
"I am given the opportunity to shoot, and when I am convinced that the weapon is hitting well, we begin to bargain," the expert describes the procedure.
Shop on the couch
Search engines on the Internet lead to sites and groups in "Vkontakte", where they offer to buy weapons "for different purposes".
To do this, you do not need any documents and personal meetings.
"It is enough to have a certain amount of money," they write in the advertising header on the website "Buy a combat pistol or assault rifle."
On it, users leave their applications and ask questions.
Will they sell to minors?
"Without a license of course," asks user "Ivan" (spelling preserved).
"I will buy TT.Moscow" - succinctly formulates the request "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service has now scattered a huge network of fake sites and those who want to buy military weapons row with a shovel.
People go like hungry fish to bait, and then extract coal in Siberia
military observer and former military man Viktor Baranets
I have heard of such schemes: usually the site is registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People take orders.
The buyer makes the payment through the ATM.
"In response, they send a photo and instructions on where the weapons are hidden," said Dmitry Kislov, a spokesman for the Right to Arms NGO.
Victor Baranets claims that by leaving an application on the site, you can be left without weapons and go to jail.

Makarov for 100 dollars
When buying illegal small arms, according to experts, you can keep within the amount of 100 to 900 dollars.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the Right to Arms organization, Makarov's pistol can be purchased for $100-300.
We will have to wait a month and a half.
It is shipped from long-term storage warehouses by the management of these mid-level warehouses.
According to the official statistics of the department, in comparison with January-October 2011, the number of such crimes in Russia as a whole decreased by 7% and amounted to 22.9 thousand, and the number of revealed facts of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
In the US, fast food and supermarket workers are on strike
Up to a quarter of all American teenagers go through work at the McDonald's checkout.
In recent days, a wave of protests against low wages has swept across America in walmart department stores and restaurants of popular fast food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky's Fried Chicken.
So far, no one has undertaken to predict whether this wave will turn into a ninth wave or whether it is destined to run out of steam in the early stages.
The actions are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing public organizations.
In addition to raising the modest salaries that ordinary walmart workers and the fast food system receive, the goal of the organizers of the protests is to create trade union organizations in them.
So far, this sector of the economy is almost not covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The action began last week, after Thanksgiving, on the so-called "Black Friday", when an of cheap sales hit America, capturing millions of ordinary people and sometimes accompanied by brawls.
On that day, some workers at Walmart Corporation, which employs 2.2 million people around the world, left their jobs and picketed with trade unions and left-wing activists the stores of the corporation, whose goods are designed for people of modest and average income.
Walmart sells everything from diapers, hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products in its stores are on average from 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
Therefore, many low-paid Walmart workers buy goods only at their jobs.
The availability and range of products have made Walmart one of America's largest corporations.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell goods cheaper in part because it pays its workers little.
The latter also complain of harsh working conditions, such as a lack of forklifts or hand-held scanners.
Participants in the actions on "Black Friday" demanded a salary increase and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation jumped from 30 to 100 dollars a month.
The typical Walmart worker earning $9.5 an hour can't afford that expense, they said.
Scientists from the University of California at Berkeley prove that if Walmart raises the average salary to $ 12 per hour, it will cost the corporation $ 3.2 billion.
That's about 1.1% more than she spends on a paycheck now.
If Walmart completely shifts the growth of wages on the shoulders of customers, then each visit to the store will cost them only 46 cents more.
For a year, they will spend some 12.39 dollars more than now.
Walmart supporters note that the protests occurred in just nine states and did not cause any minor damage to the corporation.
"Black Friday" continued in its stores from 8 p.m. on Thursday until midnight the next day, and during that time Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, its cash registers made almost 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
Corporation spokesman Dan Fogelman claimed in an interview with the left-wing Huffington Post website that a total of "less than five" Walmart employees had left their jobs, and that the protest was just "another PR stunt" by the union that organized it.
"Free cashier!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where their target was not Walmart department stores (they are not welcome in this progressive city, and therefore they are not here yet), but McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says it sells billions of servings, and after that, it doesn't even give you sick leave or pay you for honest work!
Jumaine Williams, Member of the New York City Council
At the moment, the minimum wage, according to federal and New York law, is $ 7.25 per hour.
Fast food restaurants increase it over time, but not by much, and on average their ordinary workers receive $ 8.90 per hour in New York.
No one earns less than them in this expensive city.
How it is possible to exist in New York on such money is incomprehensible to me.
Once upon a time, almost a quarter of American teenagers passed through McDonald's, who worked behind their shelves after school, while living with their parents.
Few people saw this as the main source of food or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now I constantly come across interviews with McDonald's employees who complain that they have to live on this salary and sometimes even feed their children on it.
On the other hand, there's a comment on the Wall Street Journal forum whose author remarks that it's irresponsible to have children if you don't know what you're going to feed them.
Participants in the protests, which began at 6:30 a.m. Thursday at McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and fast-food cooks begin paying at least $15 an hour, more than doubling their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that trade unions be established in the field of fast food.
American law prohibits the administration from preventing this and punishing trade union activists with quibbles and dismissals.
On the other hand, the administration rarely makes their lives easier.
But it is difficult to cover fast food by a trade union for objective reasons.
One of the main ones is the extraordinary turnover of personnel.
Dissenters
Noisy protests took place on this day and at a number of other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The action culminated in a mid-afternoon rally at McDonald's near Times Square, where several local Democratic politicians spoke, notably City Councilman Jumaine Williams, who said, "McDonald's says it sells billions of servings, and after that it doesn't even give you sick leave or pay you for honest work!"
The demonstrators were supported by other prominent New York Democrats, such as mayoral candidate Bill De Blasio, who said that "we must join the support of fast food workers so that they achieve the fair pay and economic well-being that every New Yorker deserves!"
As the New York Times described the incident, it was the largest action of its kind in the history of the American fast food industry.
But only a few hundred people participated in it, and not all of them were fast food service workers, which employ tens of thousands of people in New York.
It is not yet clear whether this spark will give rise to the flames of mass movement.
"While deceiving the brain turns out to be average"
Popular among fans of modern technologies, the topic of augmented reality has recently been perceived mainly through the prism of special glasses.
First, in the summer at its annual conference, Google showed the current model, and then in November it became known that Microsoft also filed an application for the corresponding patent.
However, from a conversation with the head of the interactive 3D technologies group at the Cambridge Microsoft Laboratory, Sharam Izadi, it follows that for scientists of this company, glasses are a passed stage.
They are attracted by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with their bare hands, creating virtual open spaces.
- Please tell us in general terms, what does your research group do?
- We are engaged in the interaction of man with machines, but at the same time we are trying to push the boundaries of this interaction.
While humanity is stuck in the mass at the stage of working with pixels on a flat screen, sometimes poking at them with a finger.
We want to look 5-10 years ahead and predict dramatic changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox is sold today without Kinect, because everyone is interested in gesture control.
- What else lies ahead?
- Even though Kinect has taken interaction to the physical level, a lot still happens on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information has improved (the system receives more data), and the output is not yet very good.
We are trying to change this, we are working on truly three-dimensional display systems based on various technologies, including projective ones.
We need to release the computer world into ours, the physical one, to make it more tangible.
To do this, however, you need to recognize not only the user, but also the space around him.
Then we will be able to supplement the real world with virtual objects in a much more convenient form.
And first of all - to hell with those stupid virtual reality helmets!
What do you think about voice control?
A popular thing, but isn't it overrated?
- It definitely can not be called a panacea - the question of privacy arises, because you do not always want to notify others about your actions and intentions.
In fact, all kinds of interaction with computers are good, but each in its own niche.
For example, to control devices in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not over sweeping ones, but over such stingy, short ones.
At the same time, gestures were filmed not by the camera of the device, but by a wristband, which recorded the movements of bones and muscles.
While it is large, but theoretically it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But in general, the future belongs to a mixed type of control, for example, gesture + voice.
- How's that?
- For example, how do you ask me to give you this can of soda?
You will say and at the same time show.
- I usually just say.
- Oh, it's going to be very hard to recognize.
- So you want to force users to adapt to what a machine can or can't do at the moment?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual rapprochement.
I think that in the near future we will mainly have to work on the development of new types of sensors that will allow us to more accurately determine human reactions.
It can be, for example, laser sensors, they give a good resolution in depth, this is very important.
- If we talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your complaints about modern cameras?
Lacking resolution, depth, or something else?
- In principle, the current generation is something that can be based on in our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at a speed of 1000 fps.
But it's not about the megapixels themselves, but about the quality of the matrix and depth.
From the latter point of view, all the current technologies are not good enough for us - this adds work to the designers of algorithms.
That is, we must remember not only about the resolution along the X and Y axes, but also about Z.
Speed, the number of frames per second is also very important.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and the current 30 k/s is frankly not enough, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betisches of our Redmond Lab has made a touch sensor with an adjustable processing delay of 1 to 100 ms, with modern serial sensors closer to the second (60-100) indicator.
Not everyone understands how much this affects the interaction of man and machines.
The equivalent of such a device would be very useful to me in my work, only it does not require touches, so that there are more frames per second.
- Don't you need to increase the number of cameras?
- Kinect now has three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared emitter, and the second is a receiver of the reflected signal.
But the third camera is, in fact, an ordinary sensor of the visible range.
It is not used to determine the depth of an object.
Potentially more cameras could solve the problem...
Or exacerbate it by increasing the required volume of calculations.
It would be nice to create a flexible analogue of Kinect, play with the curvature of the location of the cameras and see how it will help in three-dimensional position determination.
- As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present its glasses to the public.
Don't you think that from the point of view of everyday use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, walking around all the time, holding a smartphone in your hands raised, is not very convenient, but here's what I think: the coolest option would be "transitional" augmented reality, when on the basis of a cloud platform you could switch from glasses to a smartphone, a head-up display and then everywhere.
Glasses are a very personal device, this is their strength (only you see private things), and at the same time a weakness - augmented reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
- Let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark from Iron Man, but also to a mere mortal.
There is one problem that critics of this idea often point out: there is no tactile feedback!
Hands don't feel anything!
What answers does your team have in store for this challenge?
- In my lectures, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction of man and machine.
I think the eighth may well be the addition of tactile sensations.
In the meantime, one of the interesting tricks is to use the second hand as a kind of substrate for the image.
It registers clicks perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are really aimed at giving these "pictures in the air" tangibility - for example, the interference of several directional ultrasonic rays at a certain point where the finger is located gives a feeling, but so far it is very weak - as if you have blown on the pads.
There are also wrist bracelets that affect the nerve endings in the fingers - also a promising direction.
- Have you tried to trick the brain?
To make him think that he feels what he should feel the moment he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried it yet.
Here lies another task that has to be fought over for a long time - how to make a person physically in a very confined space believe that he is walking on an open, almost infinite - we are working on the concepts of treadmills (not at all like in clubs), moving platforms, as well as huge balls.
While deceiving the brain turns out to be average, the work is still very much for many years.
That's what makes working on virtual reality so appealing to the researcher – many things are in their absolute infancy.
Taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "Petersburg Avant-garde", dedicated to the citizens who are ahead, in the forefront of culture and art.
This top list has already included bright figures of the art scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements go beyond the city, often finding recognition in Europe, bypassing all-Russian fame.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the flamboyant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller - a bearded man dressed in all red, who is found at the Russian Museum, then at the Summer Garden, then at fashionable parties and vernissages.
Kirill Miller's paintings always gather crowds of spectators, wherever they are exhibited.
Kirill Miller is one of the purely St. Petersburg socio-philosophical storytellers, the creators of new mythologies.
Kirill Miller is a bright man of the St. Petersburg avant-garde of the late 80s - early 90s.
In addition, he is a man of the city, with his appearance on the streets causing a smile among the townspeople, raising everyone's spirits.
Recently, he picked up a sharmanka and became a St. Petersburg charmer, as he was ripe for this complex role with all his bohemian existence, philosophy and image.
- Kirill, why do you still walk around the city in all red, and not in yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I chose the color red as a fashion designer dealing with the appearance and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between the artist, the image-maker, and society.
Although in society, everything that is slightly gray causes aggression and excitement of an unkind nature.
But my provocations are aimed at starting a conversation.
The whole history of my provocative actions is an invitation to discussion.
When did you realize you had to be an artist?
- At the exhibition in the Nevsky Palace of Culture, where my works were exhibited.
I realized that this was my way.
Then the wave of old free unofficial artists passed, and the new, free ones were incomprehensible to me.
I became friends with the artists of the new wave, with the post-gas phenomenon that led to Pushkinskaya-10, and there was no more wave.
I'm thrown into theater, clothes, music, all genres except the word.
- And all this came together in your Art Clinic... - It was important for me to find myself in the center of culture in St. Petersburg, where all the best creative forces should gather.
In 1995, I occupied the territory on Pushkinskaya-10, and there, until there was a repair, there was a music and artistic club, a bohemian club, a house of St. Petersburg bohemia.
Many were born there: NOMs, Tequila Jazz, I remember how Schnur was brought with the project "Van Gogh's Ear".
Shnur and his friends sang light songs under the plywood, they were in tight tights, among them was the now fashionable composer Igor Vdovin.
When the band played live, it became "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg was the host of many programs until Hali-Galiv times.
We gave them Trachtenberg, and his great career went on, and he received a basic education and upbringing from us.
Gallery "D 137", club "Griboyedov - these are echoes from the Art Clinic.
Our employees and regulars went there.
I am a hero of yesterday's century, when culture meant something.
In 2000, the poll was in the press, the award was "People of our city".
In the nomination "Artist of the Year" I was named, my climax ended.
In modern times, according to the old rules, it is uncomfortable to work, I am a person of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
Nowadays it is easy to become popular, but the culture and popularity are separated, you can be popular, but not very cultured.
- Your work has a recognizable manner.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they have a pronounced relevance and sharpness.
I will have a program exhibition, the Russian Museum in Clowns.
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be social, now to be like that is painful and scary.
But in clowns, everything is smeared, tragedy is removed.
I love the grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, saving the world by totalitarian disguise in an orderly manner.
Now the clothes are met, focusing on the external mechanics, and not on the inner person.
Or maybe you can't give him a hand and spit in the face.
And the deception will be removed by changing clothes.
- And recently we saw you in the role of an urban charmer. - A cultural city should have such a hero.
Who better than me to be.
- Well, maybe commercial art can be beautiful?
- Now commercial art should be neat, tactful, sweet.
There is a disintegration of cultures.
Previously, people huddled in packs, bohemians loved one thing, simpletons another.
Now everyone is divided into microcommunities, now it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar piece of paper to please everyone.
Now you need to think about who will like you.
Now each cult hero has 100 fans.
- And several thousand people come to Stas Mikhailov!
- Throws come at him, there the sex-social sphere works.
And on cultural grounds, 300 people will come, and 10,000 will not come, and as a result, less management, money, everything will wither.
I have fans, the main thing is not to deceive them, not to spoil the acquired.
In my youth, I painted such paintings that one collector had them hanging on the wall next to Falk and Larionov.
I started with the paintings that are usually finished.
Now the concepts are often confused.
They say: spiritual culture, culture of consumption.
There is no culture in consumption, it is from another opera.
I am a person of culture of yesterday, I grew up on the examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, gave up money for the sake of drawing pictures.
I'm all for this kind of culture.
- Kirill, what is St. Petersburg missing?
- Good cultural experts.
There is such a thing as a cultural official.
But not every one of them can engage in culture.
With the right kings, it wasn't like that, the kings may not have really understood the culture, but they understood that you need to keep the right experts.
There are good consultants in Moscow now.
We have people in St Petersburg who could be experts, but they are pushed back, because we need higher experts who will correctly assess these experts and give them a way.
Now the taste is thriving.
The same Erarta, but they are distinguished by the fact that they honestly say that not all contemporary art we accept, there are such artists who should look for other museums.
- What is St. Petersburg for you?
- St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital, there is much more culture in Moscow, there is soil there.
And on our stones, art is difficult to grow.
We need cultural ground, and we now have more writers than readers, this is wrong.
There are a lot of curious people in Europe. who go to exhibitions, concerts.
We have this layer thin.
We need to make art fashionable, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project was implemented with the help of a grant from St. Petersburg
Give birth in space
The earth is in danger.
Global warming or a collision with a killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with earthlings on board go in search of a spare planet.
To preserve humanity, the main question arises, how to continue your kind in conditions of weightlessness or on the same spare planet?
I think there's not much choice.
In fact, there are only two real planets that can be mastered at least hypothetically.
"These are Venus and Mars," said Vladimir Surdin, a senior researcher at the P.K. Sternberg State Astronomical Institute (SAIS).
But if on Mars the conditions are more suitable for life, then on the surface of Venus - temperatures of 500 degrees.
You can live only at high altitude or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
Approaching the issues of reproduction in space began with flora.
Half a century ago, experiments were conducted on plants.
The four generations of peas grown in orbit were no different from their terrestrial varieties.
Then - the introduction into orbit of insects, tiny fruit flies-Drosophila.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to test how the embryo develops in zero gravity.
We get an absolutely normal chick at the output.
And then the problem begins.
"The problem is that this chick must find support, it must stand on its feet and begin to move," explains Vladimir Sychev, head of the laboratory of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IBMP) of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
Unable to find support, the chicks tumbled erratically.
And after 10 hours, the newborns had a complete atrophy of instincts.
The chicks did not respond to light and sound.
And there the trouble was that after four days they just died.
"And twice we hatched chicks, after that we refused, because it is simply impossible to work with them there," vladimir Sychev states the failure of the experiment with chicks in space.
With animals, the last time a biological "mini-ark" flew into orbit was 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013, the experiments will continue.
However, on the biosatellite "Bion" there will be only same-sex individuals.
There was an experiment with rats that were sent into space already with a fetus.
In principle, they did not find anything supernatural there.
"This was just on biosatellites, but again- this is an isolated experiment, and such studies should be carried out," says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the space rats had offspring.
But it is not yet possible to approach the problem of reproduction directly in space.
It's not an easy task.
Animals, losing their habitual habitat, simply cannot realize their sexual instinct.
A person, unlike animals, in principle, can.
Homo sapiens has abstract thinking, and is able to create a proper emotional background.
For ethical reasons, no such experiments are conducted.
But women have been flying into space for 50 years.
Tereshkova had the biggest risk.
And the most precious thing that humanity has is the female body.
Our Seagull flew away, and no one on Earth could say: whether it will survive after a flight into space.
Will she be able to give birth to a child after this flight.
"After all, no one answered this question," said Vakhtang Vachnadze, a veteran of the rocket and space industry.
In June 1964, just a year after the flight into space, the first female cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to a daughter.
The child's father, Andrian Nikolaev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second female cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, who twice visited orbit and even worked in outer space, had a son.
However, the risk remains.
We have few, there are only a few cosmonauts who, after long flights, everything turned out well, and a healthy generation is growing.
"And if more, then it is dangerous even during orbital flights," sums up the pilot-cosmonaut, Hero of the Soviet Union, Hero of Russia Valery Polyakov.
And yet, humanity needs to look for some new ways in biotechnology, protection from radiation, the creation of artificial gravity.
The CPC hydro laboratory is a mandatory stage of preparation for the flight.
Here, in conditions of zero buoyancy, astronauts work out the skills of working in outer space.
Water imitates weightlessness.
If for adults water, albeit comfortable, but still an alien environment, then for infants it is a native element.
Small ichthyanders seem to confirm that life on land came out of the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is about 9 months old with the mother in the fetal fluid, it is easier for him to get used to the water later.
In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth, from the moment of that first bath, only 2 weeks pass.
"It's very little to forget something," says infant swimming instructor Marina Aksenova.
In short, if for a born child weightlessness is a more natural state, then for a woman gravity is necessary, gravity.
Very quickly, in weightlessness, the muscles of the abdomen, pelvis become decrepit, the ability to push the fetus falls.
Okay, let's omit that too, relying on labor stimulants.
You can, of course, go to the birth in a special cell, she will push him out.
"And then what?" - Valery Polyakov asks non-trivial questions.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling the earth's gravity, the body will not form a skeleton and a muscular system.
A newborn in orbit cannot, like an adult, be dressed in a special loading suit for training.
He will simply be deprived of what he will need.
"And this experiment, which we will go to, allowing the birth of a child in an alien environment, will lead to the fact that we will bring to Earth a disabled person, a completely maladapted person," predicts Igor Pestov, head of the BIOETHICS Committee of IBMP RAS.
So far, the birth of children in space is a matter of theory.
However, after a while, this will be a reality when earthlings on their ships will go to a distant planet, which will become home to their descendants born in space.
Head of the Main Control and Audit Office: The inspection of the schwartz system failed due to the fault of politicians.
In the public procurement industry, the Czech Republic has good control bodies and, despite the availability of high-quality legislation, lags behind in its application.
This statement by Miroslav Kala, Vice-President of the Supreme Audit Office, is from an interview for the Aktuálně.cz website.
"The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which, in my opinion, we lack," Kala commented on the current situation.
Such conclusions are provided by the joint inspection of the Czech and German control authorities.
As an example of wrong practice, Peter Nechas's approach to the so-called Schwartz system is cited.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the GDP (Civic Democratic Party) will not bother entrepreneurs with inspections - is it forbidden or allowed?
"The law should be established in some way, and if it prohibits something, then the prime minister cannot oppose the work of the institutions that are charged with checking and enforcing the fulfillment of obligations," Kala states.
At the meeting of the Audit Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you talked about a joint project between the Czech and German sides, within the framework of which the legislation on public procurement of both countries was compared.
What exactly was it about?
I am referring to the parallel test that we started probably two years ago.
Simply put, the point is that European legislation states how public procurement should take place, followed by national legislation and then also application in practice.
All the information was collected and, even with an unfinished check, interesting differences were revealed - simply put, our legislation can be "accurate and error-free", but in the practice of application we are inferior to Germany in some respects.
It follows that it is not enough to create more and more refined rules, it is necessary to focus on the application of the law itself.
And actually, how can this project help you, what does it mean to you?
It is this kind of joint control that can contribute to efforts to stop the clarification of laws, the reduction and improvement of restrictions, because it does not lead to a positive result.
Economics means getting the right thing for a reasonable (but not always low) price to avoid enrichment and possibly criminal behavior.
But it is not a fact that we will achieve this by reducing the restriction of orders.
Perhaps this system will be overflowing with "papers" so that those who wish to find loopholes in this system will find them much easier than if the restriction were not reduced.
You are talking about the internal problems of practical application of the legislation on public procurement.
And how does the control system work in Germany?
Is there such an organization as our KRU (Control and Audit Office) or does it work differently?
As for the institutions, the Bundesrechnungshof, organized according to our principle, acts as our KRU, there is also a collegium that works a little differently, but basically both institutions function similarly.
In addition, the powers are to a certain extent similar, but since Germany has a federal structure, there are audit units at the level of the federal states - in this their system is somewhat different from ours.
BRH can only manage federal money, we have public funds.
Public funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled at the level of federal accounts chambers.
As for local legislation, is it easier there than here?
In general, I would not like to compare without specific data, but in some respects Germany can be taken as a model, but it cannot be said with certainty that it is better in everything.
Is that because they're better at control?
Definitely not, but again, I don't like comparisons like that.
But it must be said that even exemplary countries face many problems.
Otherwise, they wouldn't get any benefit from working with our office, right?
If we talk about domestic legislation, how have the amendments to the Law on Public Procurement affected your institution, do the consequences manifest themselves in any way?
Given that the legal force of these amendments is quite short, it has not yet manifested itself in our control work.
Since we conduct control after the fact, it is necessary to take into account some delay.
We take this into account only in the process of preparing future inspections - we began to use our new tool "detection of the risk of uneconomy", through which we drove almost 14,000 government contracts. We analyzed them. Of course, these changes will manifest themselves there, because the restrictions are changing, the conditions for certain types of tenders are changing, and so on.
Do you think the approval of this law will bring benefits or an additional burden on the bureaucracy system?
I think this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope this will be confirmed.
The problem that may arise is that the rules will be "tightened" and they will not be possible to comply with.
Under the previous rules, controlled enterprises are linked to the supplier (e.g. regional operational programmes to the regional council) in that any failure to comply with the public procurement law constitutes a violation of budgetary discipline.
In this case, is it worth tightening the law in this way?
I don't think so.
The system should exclude those who want to capture and abuse, but not punish those who make a formal mistake that does not affect the decision.
Such a system will only put more pressure on the bureaucracy.
And then how to get out of this situation?
Let's realize that this path will not lead anywhere.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the GDP will not bother entrepreneurs with inspections of the so-called schwartz system. What does that mean?
Is the "Schwartz system" forbidden or allowed?
The law should be established in some way, and if it prohibits something, the Prime Minister cannot oppose the work of the bodies that are charged with checking and enforcing the fulfillment of obligations.
You can say, "We're going to change this law and let it go," but you can't say we're going to pretend that nothing is happening.
The Public Procurement Law contains fairly strict rules on how and what should be formally conducted, and rightly so. This will protect public procurement.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic when the candidate with the best offer is disqualified only because of formal shortcomings.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which, in my opinion, we lack.
The roads are slippery in places, but mostly passable.
In some places in the Czech Republic, the roads are frozen and snowy.
They are mostly passable, but in some places with greater caution.
Karlovy Vary Region
This morning in the Karlovy Vary region, the roads were passable, but in some places frozen and snowy.
The temperature has dropped from five to ten degrees below zero, but during the day it should gradually warm up.
Snowfall in the region has stopped, only in the lowlands lies a small layer.
However, on the ridges of the Ore Mountains lies about 30 centimeters of snow.
From the information received from the regional road workers, it became known that in some places there was lower visibility due to fog.
The R6 expressway and first-class roads in the region are currently passable without restrictions.
However, care is needed, for example, on bridges, where the surface may be frozen and slippery.
Also, all roads belonging to the second and third class, including mountain trails, are passable.
But in some of their sections there are still remnants of frozen and sometimes worn snow.
Especially careful you need to be on roads located on higher ground.
Pardubice and Králové Gradec Region
The Department of Roads and Highways of the Czech Republic on its pages on the Internet informs that some roads of the eastern Czech Republic are threatened with ice, and on mountain roads and roads located on hills, there may be a hackneyed layer of snow.
Regional road workers warn drivers about ice, which can form especially on the hills of the Pardubice region.
Ice can be near Lanskrown, Ústí nad Orlici, Polička, Svitavi or Visoke Mito, especially on second and third class roads.
Roads I/43 and I/34, located near Svitavi, are treated with chemicals.
Especially snow lies on the roads of the Krkonoše and the Eagle Mountains.
A hackneyed layer of snow is located on roads located on higher ground in the areas of Richnová nad Kněžnou and Trutnová.
In East Bohemia today it is partly cloudy with no precipitation.
Temperatures usually range from minus three to plus one degree Celsius, light wind.
Plzeň Region
Roads in the Plzeň region are passable this morning, but in some places you need to be careful and adapt to the weather.
In the morning it is frosty, the temperature ranges from three to nine degrees below zero.
After snowfall and subsequent cooling, it can be slippery in some places.
In places, drivers may encounter fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
The information was provided by regional road workers.
The D5 highway is now passable almost without restrictions, however, the road managers recommend caution between 80 and 131 kilometers.
Most first-class roads have a dry and frozen surface.
In southern Plzní and Tachowa, frozen areas may be found.
Second- and third-class roads are wet, and there is also a warning in connection with the possibility of slippery sections.
Drivers should be careful, especially on little-used roads in the Šumava area.
Olomouc Region
Drivers heading to the high ground of the Olomouc Region must now take into account the snow on the road.
It remained after the use of chemicals in the Chervenogorsk saddle and on the road in the direction of Videl Kršiž.
At night, snowfall forced road workers to take to the street, according to information from the road administration, about three centimeters of snow fell in Shumperk.
In other areas of the region, roads are usually passable without restrictions.
"On the hills of Sumperk lie the remains of snow.
Drivers heading towards Jeseník should bear in mind the presence of snow porridge in the Chervenogorsk saddle," the dispatcher of the Šumperk Road Administration told CHAN (Czech News Agency) today.
At night, their colleagues from Jeseník also went to clear the roads, they assured that the roads on the hills after treatment with chemicals remained bare and wet.
In Olomouc, the roads are passable without restrictions, but in Sternberk, drivers should be careful in forest areas where humidity is still maintained.
Ustec Region, Liberec Region
This morning, road workers from northern Bohemia report that there are still some hard-to-pass places.
According to information from the police database, in addition to several places with ice or snow, a mountain road is closed on the section from Telnice to Klinica in the Ústík Region.
Also, the temperature remains negative in the lowlands, so snow and ice remain on the roads. In the lowlands, especially southeast of the Czech Middle Mountains, on the contrary, there are no problems, the roads are mostly dry.
Complications on the roads have not yet been reported.
Road workers report the appearance of ice in the vicinity of Steti.
According to meteorologists, ideal conditions were created for its formation at night - it rained all day and snow melted, at night the sky cleared and frosts began.
Unfavorable conditions are reported on the main highways and on the I/13 highway on the border of the Ustec and Liberec regions.
Due to the branches of trees curved under a layer of snow, touching the road itself, they were forced to close the road in Telnica on Kninitsa.
Shimon Ornest: At concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
What do you think about the fact that in less than a month the end of the world should come?
This is just one of the many troubling news that we humans so easily fall for.
Together with The Tap Tap, we constantly joke about this topic and say that we are the only group in the world that will be able to collect enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
Moreover, in December you are going to give an absolutely unique three concerts against the end of the world.
Could you tell your readers more about that?
This is a nationwide fundraising event that we have been planning for two years now.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential of the Mayan calendar, the end of which was announced on December 21 at 11:10.
The day before this event, on December 20 at 21:00, three concerts will start in parallel in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end, roughly speaking, at the moment when the May calendar ends on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific Ocean, whose time zone is 12 hours earlier than ours.
Who came up with this idea?
Initially, this was my idea, then we came up with everything together with our artist Gonza Augusta.
In addition to the fact that we want to accumulate enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want to think together with the public about the state in which this world we will one day pass on to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the May calendar, we have created a unique collection of items from shoes, T-shirts, bags and original keys against the end of the world. These things can be bought on the website of the www.e-tap.cz and thereby at the same time provide us with support.
The band The Tap Tap, along with other musicians, also performed an anthem against the end of the world, which is called "The end of the world is canceled."
Will the anthem already loved by YouTube listeners sound at these benefit concerts?
Of course, at the very end, if in the end everything works out and the end of the world does not come.
It will be sung by all the performers at all concerts at the same time.
The anthems will also be played live on Czech television at the same time.
The lyrics to this song were written and played the role of Jesus in the video Tomasz Hanak, participates in the performance of Xindl X...
How did you get involved with them?
We also cooperate with other people of Czech cultural life, as we hold many charity events and concerts.
We try to actively connect them to these projects.
It turned out that many people like to work with us, they are interested.
What will the proceeds from the concert against the end of the world go to?
For the purchase of equipment for the barrier-free educational center STUDEO, for the sixth year we have been working like this with the civic association Tap at the Jedlička Institute.
Teachers regularly visit students of schools of the Jedlička Institute and hold fun and interesting events with them.
The students themselves do not have the means to go to the teachers, and we try to provide them with this opportunity in this way.
As part of the project of additional construction of the Jedlicka Institute, in the future there will be a separate building, to which we will move with this project.
Several musical groups and performers will perform at each concert.
What were the selection criteria?
We tried to create a program that would interest all generations, including children.
For example, In Prague, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Barta, The Tap Tap, Marjan Bango and Jiří Suhi will perform.
All the details can be found on the www.kpks.cz website.
Do you plan any similar "grand events" in the future?
In May, we will perform for the first time at the prague Spring festival and here, of course, we will prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year we would love to hold a performance at the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, if we are in the United States, would very much like to perform in Washington and Chicago.
As for abroad, you have serious plans, you have already performed in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you cope with the road in terms of organization and logistics??
This is not as scary as it seems at first glance.
We have five participants in electric wheelchairs, their strollers have to travel in the luggage compartment, plus a large amount of cargo and tool boxes.
Nevertheless, so far we have coped with it without problems. Czech airlines ČSA and British Airways have always been excellently prepared for us, which surprised me so many times.
Even in Moscow, from where we recently returned, everything went without problems.
Thanks to traveling abroad, you can compare different countries in terms of accessibility, public attitudes towards people with disabilities and so on.
What have you come across so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other countries where everything functions better than ours, in Russia we have witnessed that in the east it is still at a basic level.
Compared to Prague, there are a lot of barriers in Moscow, and it is still a wonder that a person can move independently in an electric wheelchair in the city center.
Also, such banal things as giving way to a disabled person in an elevator are not in use there.
Fortunately, there are already public organizations that are trying to draw people's attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what, on the contrary, should we constantly catch up with the advanced countries?
There are so many things whose level of execution is far behind.
But it is important to clarify that the improvement and improvement of the situation always depends on the efforts of those people concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is quite normal that people with severe disabilities move independently on the streets, can go to the toilet, to the museum, and anywhere ...
It is not very common that a large number of people with disabilities take an active part in public life, in this we are a little ahead of them with The Tap Tap!
Respect for the public or barrier-free is one thing, but the moment famous athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers appear among us, then everything will really begin to change.
So far, these are isolated cases - people with a strong will.
The Tap Tap is currently very popular, but let's go back two years, what made you organize it in 1998?
I entered the Jedlicki Institute as an educator, there were many young people around me who wanted to do something.
And since I myself am a musician and I play, including the saxophone, I organized an interesting musical circle together with a colleague.
Well, over time, as our host Ladya Angelovich says, it got a little out of control (laughs).
Has popularity come only in recent years, or am I confusing something?
It's true, it helped us that we began to join the famous singers and actively work on the propaganda of the group.
We've come to the conclusion that work that no one can appreciate essentially doesn't exist.
Thanks to the funds of the European Union, we can afford qualified teachers, equipment and so on.
Did your goal be to promote The Tap Tap so well?
From the beginning, I felt their potential in their ability to do something extraordinary.
Showbiz is full of things that mimic one another.
This is logical, everything new is taken with caution, and it lasts a long time.
There are very few rare things out there, but I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us, of course, is pity, this is natural...
But this pity is completely unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not some suffering and all abandoned personalities that we should feel sorry for.
They are people who can live a full life and develop, of course, only if they have the necessary resources.
What I'm saying is that if people with disabilities succeed, it's a shift not only for them, but for society as a whole.
Has success been ensured by the fact that you are the strict leader that many people consider you to be?
If we want to do quality work, we must be uncompromising in many things and keep a certain discipline.
But I think that's okay.
Some people come to us with a romantic performance and fly in the clouds, and when they find out that twice a week they have to go to rehearsals, attend preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the road, they very quickly lose enthusiasm.
But this happens in any group that wants to work and achieve something.
The Tap Tap currently has twenty members.
How many were there at the beginning in 1998?
Only one Ladya Angelovich.
We are an open group, people come and go, this cannot be prevented.
For those who have the desire and willpower, our doors are always open.
It will take place a day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21.00.
The concert will take place in Prague at the Incheba Stadium, in Brno - at the Fléda Club and Ostrava - in the Plynojem Center with the participation of 12 bands and other musicians of the Czech Republic.
At the end of the concert, all three cities are connected by a teleconference at the time of the performance of the song of the group The Tap Tap "The end of the world is canceled".
The aim of this project is to raise funds in the amount of 25 million kroons for the purchase of multifunctional barrier-free equipment for the STUDEO educational center at the Jedlicki Institute in Prague.
A ticket to the concert costs 400 CZK, for children under 12 years old the entrance is free. Tickets can be bought in advance at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and space.
Last week, at a ministerial meeting of the European Space Agency, Poland was accepted as the twentieth member of the European Space Agency as the second country from the former Eastern Bloc countries (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of ESA on September 12, 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and over the following years took an active part in a number of the agency's projects.
But Poland began the path to space much earlier.
Even before the Second World War, Polish enthusiasts were engaged in flights into space, but this was not always met with understanding.
Let me remind you, for example, of the lecture of A. Sternfeld, who on December 6, 1933 presented ideas from his innovative work "Introduction to Cosmonautics" at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory.
The ideas of the young engineer (born in 1905) left the audience indifferent, after several years Sternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomsky was interested in his work.
In 1934, in France, Sternfeld won the Robert Esnault-Peltrie and André Louis Hirsch Prize for Introduction to Astronautics.
Dr. Jan Gadomsky (1899 - 1966), mentioned above, later became a great promoter of astronomy and astronautics.
He has published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and written a number of books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomsky became a well-known world propagandist of astronautics, and his contribution was appreciated, among other things, by the fact that one of the craters on the far side of the Moon was named in his honor.
Already in 1925, a railway draisine equipped with a rocket engine was built in Poland.
Unfortunately, the author of this idea remained unknown, as well as the details of the project.
It is not even clear whether a rocket was to be used to accelerate or to brake the trolley.
Information about this draisine is known only from the press of that era.
Since 1933, polish artillery began to think about rocket arrows.
The study was carried out by the Section of Armament Engineering in cooperation with professors Mieczysław Wolfke and Gustaw Mokrzycki.
From the surviving materials, it can be seen that the research has reached the stage of practical tests.
But with the arrival of German troops, the work was interrupted.
In 1937, the idea of a photovoltaic fighter rocket appeared in the specialized press, which was proposed by the engineer Rogozinsky, and the following year the work "Air Rocket-Torpedo and Aviation Missile-Bomb" by the author Leliv-Kzhivoblotsky was published.
Both projects were developed for the military use of rocket engines.
Before the war, all projects for the military use of rocket technology were carried out by the Provisional Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy), which coordinated all the work.
The committee was established in 1937, but after two years of its activity, the work ended due to the outbreak of war.
The next scientific work on astronautics appeared in the Polish press after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Astronautical Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
The society was first mentioned in the November 1954 issue of the journal Problems, which published four voluminous articles on astronautics.
In one of them, Professor M. Subotovich proposed to organize a society that would deal with astronautics.
At that time, artificial satellite projects were already gaining momentum, and it was clear that space research was a promising industry.
From the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautical Society (OSA) tried to join the International Astronautical Federation (founded in 1951), and in the autumn the POA became its full member.
And the following year, the first chairman of the POA Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959) became deputy chairman of the International Astronautical Federation.
He remained in this position until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the POA has made a significant contribution to the development of the highly successful meteorological rocket RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket to perform scientific research.
The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957, and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
The rocket, capable of covering a distance of 1800 m, was about 80 cm long, and its weight was less than 5 kg.
Subsequently, an improved version of the RM-1A was built, and in the summer of 1959, tests of the two-stage RM-2 rocket were conducted on the Bledovsky wasteland.
This rocket was about 1.4 m long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
The next version of the rocket was already able to engage in real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket could overcome 14.5 km, and its task was to monitor the high-altitude wind.
But in 1962, further development was suspended.
The successor to the first RM rockets was the Meteor-1 rocket, developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was conceived as a two-stage, its total length was 510 cm, and the initial weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types (designated Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed, which differed in the size of the chamber for scientific equipment.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a space of 0.4 liters, the Meteor-1B - 0.34 liters, and the Meteor-1C - 0.62 liters.
The maximum flight range of all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Aeronautical Institute was developing the Meteor-2 rocket, and its first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket with a launch weight of 380 kg was capable of bringing a payload weighing 10 kg to an altitude of about 60 km.
Then the Meteor-2N and Meteor-3 versions were built.
It is also worth mentioning Poland's accession to COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the establishment of the COSPAR National Committee two years later.
In addition, within the framework of the Intercosmos program, Poland participated in space exploration on Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Mirosław Germaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remek.
Repealing the public works law is not the solution.
Last week, the constitutional court repealed the law on community service.
The ruling sparked a lively debate in society.
Undoubtedly, it will be interesting to look at this problem from a broader point of view.
Liberal-oriented economic systems in the EU, as well as in a globalized world, are based on the principle of multiple, unregulated economic competition.
In essence, this means that individual economic units, national economic systems, are in constant conflict with each other.
This is due to the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital, together with unbridled financial speculation.
As a result of a significant difference in the cost of labor (wages), price tension arises.
This concept should be understood as a state when the manufacturer, through the delivery of a cheap product, tries to withstand economic competition by "knocking down" the cost of a competitor in order to take a large part of the market and, thus, increase his own income.
On a mass scale, this means for most entrepreneurs either the transfer of production abroad, or cheap purchases abroad, or the disappearance. As a result, unemployment rises in those countries where the cost of labor, compared to others, is high.
Since private capital bears no social responsibility, including for the unemployment it has produced, the inevitable expenditures of the state for social needs are growing.
In general, the situation increases the reluctance of business gentlemen to pay taxes and thereby compensate for the social economic and social damage caused by them in the pursuit of profit.
The situation is so well known that it is not necessary to cite specific statistics.
Unceremonious methods of private capital create situations at the level of the economies of individual states when the governments of countries are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially reduce the social level of their population in order to attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments are leaving their own populations to the mercy of private capital, despite social decline.
This is reflected primarily in the changes in the current legislation.
The aim is to economically force their people to submit to the dictates of private capital, especially in the area of wages.
This acts as a system of economic coercion in the event of long-term unemployment and at the same time serves as a tool to curtail the rights of workers in the field of labor legislation.
As a result, the poverty rate increases, and with it the difference between the poor and the rich.
In Germany, for several years there has been a public distribution of food to the poor, who are not able to feed themselves with their own labor.
The number of these people is already approaching a million.
As part of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, there are constantly cases when employed people receive such a salary that the state must pay them extra so that they receive a living wage.
A similar scandal became known to the public in the case of additional employees of the Bundestag.
Economic measures in virtually all of the EU's southern states undoubtedly lead to the same state in which people under the pressure of a catastrophic drop in social status are forced to either emigrate, as was the case in the 19th century, or exist on poverty wages on the margins of society in the hope that someday private investment capital will come to the country.
However, the question is, where will it come from?
If capital comes from other EU countries, then poverty will move from one country to another, or it will not come at all, since Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Turk, Moroccan, Egyptian, African still work for a share of European wages.
This applies to all of Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media argue ad nauseam that the state cannot participate in the capital of its own economy, that a managed economy leads to economic disaster.
Private capital stubbornly insists that the state should not interfere in the economy by controlling actions.
Next, it is necessary to answer the question whether private capital, which is now practically managing politics and the entire state, does not act for its own selfish purposes?
The unequivocal answer is yes.
Proof is the existence of virtually omnipotent and ubiquitous lobbies in all states.
As a result, we have a desperate situation, manifested in corruption, ensuring mutual benefits, in legislation where almost everything deserves punishment, but is not a crime.
In Germany, the situation is such that state ministries, due to lack of financial resources, entrust the development of bills to private law firms that are closely connected with industry.
Then these bills are approved by the Bundestag.
All power comes not from the people, as the Western-style constitution says, but from financially powerful groups that prefer their own interests.
It is obvious that liberal-oriented democracy is now quickly finding itself in a situation such as described by Appian in the work "The Crisis of the Roman Empire in the Days of Caesar and Pompey": "The state has long been disintegrating, and the departments are engaged in violence.
Bribes, illegal receipt of favors with the help of stones and swords.
Bribery and corruption flourished without any prohibitions, and people went to the polls with a vote sold in advance."... decent people did not run for the post of ruler at all, in the end, one day the state was left without a consul for eight months. .. "Seriously, they began to talk about the fact that the only salvation in this terrible situation is autocracy and the need to choose an energetic person." Appian thought it would be Pompey, but it was Caesar, who finally changed democracy to autocracy.
As in antiquity, modern society is dominated by its own reckless interests without taking into account the public interest.
Private capital is no longer inherently intended to be used for public purposes.
The current result is no different from the past: an unprecedented decline of the elite without any effort to implement deeper reforms.
Hence, we must look for the reason for the emergence of fascist and communist regimes in the reckless liberalization of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
To date, the absence of these regimes and the existence of liberal-type democracy can be perceived as a certain pause, after which the next round is expected.
First of all, it is tragic that the current elite completely ignores the consequences of hundreds of thousands of victims in the future, the humanitarian and social catastrophes that we are already witnessing, along with crimes against humanity, as we know from old and modern history.
Repealing the Public Works Act is not a solution, or at least not forever.
Under the pressure of competition both at the international and national and European levels, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
Thus, this trend is systemic.
The solution is targeted political and social reforms that will strengthen the share of the state in the economy, strengthen the role of citizens in the management of the state and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society in favor of the state.
Israel: Chaos Lab.
"Nothing will come out of violence, and it can never come out" - Sting, the song "Fragile", where the main verse of the refrain is the words: "Do not forget how fragile we are."
"If my sons didn't want wars, they wouldn't have happened"— the dying Gutel Schnaper, wife of Meyer Amschel Rothschild.
The latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip has, as always, generated many responses.
Some support Israel, arguing that it has the right to self-defense, and the Palestinians act as terrorists, others support the Palestinians, arguing this by the racism of the Israeli state, the genocide committed against the Palestinian Arabs, and the state of Israel is attributed the role of a terrorist state.
I don't want to speculate on who, in these recurring waves of murder, is the perpetrator and who is the victim, after all, today's citizens of Israel, including the self-governing territories, were born at the moment of the current political situation, and did not witness the beginning of the violence.
My goal is to invite readers to look behind the curtain, to look at who is primarily served by the tension that has lasted for 95 years (counting from the signing of the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small piece of land in the Middle East.
Some of my reasoning is supported by historical facts, some of them derived from my own understanding of who or what group of people is the main engine of events in modern history.
The history of mankind is first and foremost the history of the struggle for power.
In every era we can find the same Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so clear is whether these people always took their steps completely independently, or whether behind their throne there was someone who directed their actions to predetermined goals.
It must be assumed that we live in a period when the world's wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals, and that this concentration of money and the power that flows from it could not have occurred in a single generation.
Among the astronomically rich families, there is one that could be considered as an octopus head (I don't know if anyone stands over them, but this is not excluded) - the Rothschilds.
They don't write much about them.
Certainly.
They bought the first news agency (Reuters) already in the 90s of the 19th century to stop the rumors linking their name with criminal acts in the higher spheres, in the shadow of which they were, and which always led to the strengthening of their power, the increase in wealth or both.
They have large stakes in almost all the central banks of the world, and against countries in whose central banks they do not have their share, they are waging or preparing a war (before the invasion of Afghanistan there were only 7 countries, after the invasion of Iraq there were 5 countries, after the overthrow of Gaddafi there were only four, but at the same time the Russian government took the central bank of its country into its own hands).
Anyone who tried to resist this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to retain the status of the central bank for the Rothschild Bank of America, during the Civil War he began to issue his own (understand - government) money and was killed in 1865 in the theater.
John F. Kennedy began issuing his own money and wanted to abolish the FED (Federal Reserve), was assassinated in 1963. Deputy Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after wanting to sue the FED for unleashing the Great Economic Crisis in 1929.
Their thirst for world power between 1859 and 1871 led to the development of a plan for three world wars created by the great 33rd level Freemason Albert Pike.
The task of the first war was the destruction of monarchical states in Europe, the second was to destroy colonial domination, especially Great Britain, and the third should lead to a reduction in the world population to about 0.5-1 billion people (such a number of slaves will be enough to ensure their comfort and luxury, and they will not consume much resources), the creation of a single universal religion (ecumenism can not be anything else,  except as a prerequisite for such a project) and the final seizure of absolute power.
The method by which a group of the wealthiest families, led by the Rothschilds, works, is to challenge the crisis and then propose solutions (order ab chao).
But these decisions are false and always lead to a deterioration of the situation (see the fed's foundation, which was supposed to prevent a repeat of the crisis caused by them in 1907).
Thus, after they managed to unleash World War I by assassinating the Habsburg heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, Ferdinand, in Sarajevo, they destroyed Tsarist Russia by launching the Bolshevik Revolution.
The First World War ended with the sudden, militarily and economically unjustified surrender of Germany (there was no longer a need for war to destroy Tsarist Russia) and, as a result, there was a fragmentation of the Central European power, Austria-Hungary.
To facilitate the outbreak of world war II, bankers and politicians created a hidden conflict situation, imposing huge war reparations on Germany, which created the prerequisite for the radicalization of the impoverished masses, then it remained only to throw the Germans a strong enough Leader who denounced the guilty and offered simple solutions, then to create a multinational Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which was to play, and really played the function of a fifth column,  when igniting the fire of war.
In the late 19th century, the Rothschilds provoked the founding of the Zionist movement, one branch of which sought to create a Jewish state, preferably in the area of historic Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The aforementioned Balfour Declaration created the precondition for mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, and the first clashes with the local Arab population began to occur.
Terrorist attacks have happened on both sides.
World War II broke out, it is difficult to assess whether Hitler broke free from the chains in which he was originally held by bankers, or everything he did was planned, in any case, the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps created the prerequisites for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, just as Germany was provoked by military reparations for World War 2, the State of Israel was proclaimed to create a hotbed for War III.
If international bankers succeed in unleashing it, the Jewish people, as in the Second World War, will become victims of fighting on the front lines, now together with the Arab or, more simply, Muslim populations of the Middle East.
Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of discord and chaos not only at home, but also internationally (take only the sharp division of people into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is to blame and who is the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where resentment breeds resentment in an endless chain of violence if it all began with the greed of individuals and their quest for world power?
Here it is necessary to distinguish ordinary people of Israel from their leaders, because, like us, international bankers slip people only their own candidates to vote in elections.
Israel's current prime minister, the hawk Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascist, loyal to international bankers politician doing anything to start a war with Iran that, thanks to Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), would threaten to escalate into a world conflict, and given Iran's control over the Strait of Hormuz, which contains 20% of the world's total oil reserves (the shipping corridor is only 2 miles wide),  - Will also lead to the destruction of the world economy.
In what light are the words of David Rockefeller in 1994 now manifesting themselves: "All we need is a general crisis, and the people will accept the new world order."
The new world order in their view is a world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves a handful of financial aristocracy enjoying comfort.
A world where every organism born is implanted at birth with a chip with which it becomes a creature under total control.
"And he compels all the small and the great, the rich and the poor, the free and the slaves, to have a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, so that a man who is not marked with the name of that beast, or by the number of his name, can neither buy nor sell.
Here's the wisdom: Anyone with a mind can calculate the number of the beast.
For it corresponds to the name of man, and this number is six hundred and sixty-six.
Operation Argo: When It's Worse, Call Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob of Islamist student demonstrators seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the deposed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled after the revolution in the U.S., which had been the patron of his regime for decades.
For the US administration, a positive outcome of the situation was not expected - it could not afford to throw the Shah overboard, because this could fundamentally undermine the trust of the allies in other countries.
However, it was unable to achieve the release of hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later reinforced by an unsuccessful attempt to free the hostages by force.
The imprisoned diplomats were finally released after 444 days, after talks brokered by the Algerian government.
Their fate caused a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment at home.
The defeat in Iran contributed significantly to Jimmy Carter's defeat in the 1980 presidential election that ended with the election of Ronald Reagan.
The film, directed by actor Ben Affleck" "Operation Argo" describes one of the episodes of the story that brought America small victories.
Shortly before the occupation of the embassy, six workers managed to escape.
After difficult twists and turns, they finished their journey at the residence of the Canadian Embassy.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, managed to take them out of Iran, while helping an extravagant cover story, according to which they left on Canadian passports as members of a film crew looking for a place in the country to shoot a science fiction epic.
Mix of genres
The plan, which was invented by "evacuation" expert Tony Mendes, required the cooperation of Hollywood.
In order for the legend to be reliable, specialized magazines wrote about the project of the film, press conferences were arranged, a fictional production company had a real office.
Details of the operation have long been kept secret, the film is based on the memoirs of Tony Mendes.
Affleck's film is a special combination of several genres.
On the one hand, a real political thriller, the so-called "film opus", the story of a successful venture, a scam - an example can be a number of films about Ocean's friends.
The mood in the film is constantly changing - on the one hand, the documented scenes from Tehran (the credits show iconic historical photographs of the events and how the same situations were demonstrated in the film - there are no big differences in this).
On the other hand, lightened Hollywood passages that intersect with irony and moderate exaggeration.
And then there are scenes from the headquarters of the CIA and other agencies - men in suits discuss the situation at the negotiating tables, on the stairs of institutions, on the phone ...
Ben Affleck was remarkably able to make a career restart.
From a ridiculed actor, he became a respected director, and his performance ceased to be the object of ridicule.
"Operation Argo" is his third full-length film, after the dark detective "Farewell, Baby, Goodbye" (2007) and the thriller "City" (2010).
At the same time, this is the first Affleck film that is not shot in the director's hometown - Boston.
The sense of atmosphere of the place refers to qualities that elevated the director's earlier films above the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck shows it in Argo, where Tehran "plays" Canada.
The best scenes in the film take place on the streets, while reconstructing real events – the opening scenes of the embassy's fall are impressive in their clarity, which also conveys the emotions of confusion and unforeseenness that arise when a story suddenly changes somewhere.
Affleck and his colleagues achieve a similar effect in fictional scenes (a fake headquarters in the Tehran bazaar).
Too many processes in too many places.
The director had to deal with the fact that the narrative does not involve a lot of exciting scenes of cinematic significance.
He's pretty successful with that few, sometimes figuring something out — it doesn't come out so elegantly there (the scene in which a phone call in America prevents the impending crisis at Tehran's airport, and the runway chase look pretty far-fetched).
The downside of Argo is the absent-mindedness associated with having to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman in the role of Hollywood colleagues are really very charming, but their characters would deserve more space, and they are far from the only ones in the film.
Affleck's film lacks a bit of drama, it's a film that can be watched with moderate interest, appreciating the production and retro style, recreating the thrillers of the seventies.
But it's hard to capture.
However, this is enough to remind you of one, still in a certain sense living history, as well as to testify to how exaggerated the ideas about the all-powerful and all-knowing special services are.
Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and circus
The portal www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which annually conducts a survey on the most absurd bank fees, has now decided to announce a competition for "the most absurd regulation or project from the EU workshop."
"We were prompted to do this by the latest development, in which the EU plans to adopt a 40 percent quota for women in the administration of large European companies," the organizer of the questionnaire, Patrick Nager, told Pravo.
Among the absurdities already put forward for the nomination is the recent decision of the European Court of Justice to combine the rates of insurance premiums for men and women.
Until now, women have had life insurance benefits because for insurance companies they are objectively less at risk.
"Further incredible ideas from the EU workshop people can put forward for the competition before the end of this year.
The voting itself will take place until the end of February 2013," Nager said.
Controversial EU regulations include, for example, the mandatory addition of biocomponents to fuel, which as a result harms nature, as well as a ban on the use of reliable mercury thermometers just because they contain relatively small amounts of hazardous substances, or a directive on the size of the cage for chickens, as a result of which eggs have risen in price significantly this year.
Also criticized was the actual ban on the use of the term "sandwich butter" or the withdrawal from sale of classic light bulbs.
High-quality bananas should be 14 centimeters long.
The pan-European apparatus often makes a decision under the pressure of one or another trade or industrial lobby, whose positions in Brussels are usually defended by some state or group of states (so the Czech Republic now, even under the threat of veto, defends the claims of its banks).
The interests of the lobby are as follows: for example, bananas of the highest quality in the European Union were supposed to reach a length of 14 cm and did not dare to show "abnormal curvature".
At the same time, the European Commission justified itself by the fact that it only harmonizes the existing disparate national rules that complicated trade.
The EU, despite the resistance of some states, still softened the standards for fruits and vegetables, citing the fact that existing directives will lead to wasted products.
A candidate for winning the survey may also be last year's EU regulation, according to which balloons sold must be provided with a warning that children under eight years old cannot inflate them without adult supervision.
The EU turned to Us research according to which balloons when playing are a potential cause of death in children through suffocation.
Such a restriction now applies to children under 14 years of age, who are forbidden to blow into fairground pipes.
Funny ideas are born at home
The rule concerning the European officials themselves is also quite absurd: anyone who has any official position in the EU cannot, given the delicacy of the topic for Greece, use the name of Macedonia, but must instead say "FYROM" (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The portal Bankovnípoplatky.com in cooperation with the association of liberal economists "Laissez Faire" (Laissez Faire), proposed for voting, in addition to several of the above absurd rules, for example, the EU rule on the volume of food stocks in the territory of a member state.
The EU has set a maximum amount of food reserves that can be in the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of its accession to the European Union.
Subsequently, the Czech Republic exceeded, for example, the established volumes of canned mushrooms, for which it faced a large fine.
The organizers of the questionnaire were also interested in the idea of paying some countries for the fact that they do not have the sea, and the idea of providing subsidies for the application for subsidies.
But these ideas originated in Prague, not in Brussels.
"We are at a disadvantage because we don't have a sea.
We will ask the European Union for compensation," then Agriculture Minister Jaroslav Palace (CSDP) said in autumn 2004.
As an argument, he pointed out that the country had a high grain harvest, and as a result of the so-called interventional purchases, the state had full warehouses of stocks that needed to be removed.
For the fact that the Czech Republic is far from the ports, the EU, according to Palas, had to pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
As a result, the European Commission met the Czech Republic halfway by organizing a tender for the purchase of grain from landlocked countries.
Subsidies for subsidies were offered to villages by the Ministry for Regional Development, headed by Minister Pavel Nemec (US-DEU), in particular, such subsidies were to be used to draw up an application for subsidies from Brussels.
EU: Bizarre orders are an exception
Although regulations in member states are easily criticized, the EU's efforts to regulate, as well as to improve the functioning and development of the European Union, in the opinion of many experts, deserve rather recognition.
A serious problem, according to experts, is the drawing of EU subsidies for projects that do not have even a hint of something in common with the deepening of European integration, but which the member states achieved when discussing the budget.
It also evokes emotions among Czechs that, like in other EU countries, the Czech Republic must fight in Brussels for the right to specific identification of its traditional products, and it does not always win this competition.
Although the Czechs after six years of fighting with the Germans and Austrians retained the name "Olomouc cheese", but "Native rum", the traditions of which in our country date back to the 19th century, our manufacturers had to rename to "Tuzemak".
Only products from cane distillate, and not from sugar beets, can be called rum.
In the official list of registered products of the EU, along with the world-famous cheeses "feta" and "gorgonzola", marzipan from German Lübeck or Parma ham, there were already, for example, Karlovy Vary crackers, Pogorzelic and Třeboň carp and Žatec hops.
Also, the TRADEMARK of the EU can be proud of the Pardubica gingerbread and Gorzycki straws.
People want me to protect the republic, but I'm an amateur," Okamura said.
Mr. Senator, how does it occur to a person to run for president?
I don't think about becoming a senator or president myself.
If everything in our country functioned without problems, then I would not run anywhere.
But I can no longer watch how over the past 20 years the country has been stolen, how thieves are fussing here, people are raising taxes and the retirement age.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something I don't like, I try to find a solution to change it.
And since I'm in my forties and I'm an independent, non-partisan, I have no other way to influence things than to run for senator or president.
You got into the Senate, but soon went to the presidential castle.
Aren't you turning your back on the people who have chosen you in this way?
I kept saying that I would get involved in the fight for the presidential castle depending on the result of the Senate elections.
Later, I clarified that if I was elected senator, I would run for president.
My goal is not a position, a position is a tool with which I can implement my views.
So I need the most influence and the broadest powers.
But the difficulty is not only that we as a nation grumble in our bar or in front of the TV, but at the same time we are ready to trample anyone who tries to change something.
To this is added the media, which denigrate a person, and which confuse freedom of speech with freedom of lies.
For example, I was told that I gave bribes to journalists, or that I was an adviser to Jiří Paroubek.
Let's move on to your views.
You began the struggle for the presidential castle with theses about the material and criminal liability of politicians and about reverse property declarations in the amount of more than twenty million.
To do this, it is necessary to change the law.
As president, you have no such powers, and only an entire Senate can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When I, as a citizen, lobbied for excursions to become a free enterprise, it was promoted.
The problem lies in politicking - when someone comes with a good offer on the left or right, he is deliberately obstructed, and this restrains citizens.
As an independent non-partisan, I have a much greater potential to gain support from all parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that without party laying out on the shelves, without regard to dogmas, I can take from each party what is best for our country, and apply it.
Do you consider yourself to be more of a right-wing or a left-wing person?
From the Czech point of view, it seems to me that people consider me more of a leftist.
For me, it doesn't matter at all - a little to the left or a little to the right.
It's important to me that we move forward.
It's not about someone being on the right and someone on the left, I want to unite people.
I will always support any good decision for society, whether it is proposed by the KSČM or the GDP, and I will similarly oppose a bad idea.
You get angry when someone says you're a populist.
But don't you prove it by what you said?
When you create a business plan for a firm, you also have some ideal goals and views.
And that's what you're trying to get closer to.
You can call it populism, but all the proposals I'm talking about are already functioning in the world, or prominent experts are talking about them.
But without the support of parliament, you will be left with only slogans.
And with that in politics, you won't last long.
Or do you think that when you go out to people and talk to them, you will be able to realize criminal and material responsibility?
I have no other option.
Only to persuade politicians, journalists and the public and try to lure them to our side so that we get our way.
If I had been elected President, it would not have been a problem to organize a live television broadcast in which I would appeal to the presidents of the parliamentary parties to legalize material and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
And they, in case of refusal, will have to report why they do not want it.
If there is a strong personality who voices abuses, it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
Take the direct election of the president - it was the merit of pressure from the public.
I say directly that I am an amateur, not a genius or an intellectual.
I try to look for allies to defend my beliefs and views.
I'm just a beginner in politics, and for my program I will try to get the support of the majority.
I try to promote things on my own; if that fails, I will finish in six years and return to the private sector.
It partly sounds like Okamura has to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior at all.
I know I'm not going to do anything alone, so I've gone around a number of famous people with an offer to run for the Senate.
I went to Radim Yanchura, he refused due to the large amount of work.
I also at least supported the investigative journalist Yana Lorentsova, who uncovered the scam with light fuel oil products.
I put forward my candidacy because people are really dissatisfied, but now I feel like I'm on the scales.
Sixty percent of the people did not go to the polls, and most of those who went to elected representatives of the establishment.
There are only two of us independents in the Senate.
People have elected the Senate in such a way that change will be difficult to implement.
Despite this, I will fight for my views, for example, for the direct election of mayors and governors.
Are you thinking about founding your own party?
I haven't thought about it yet because I don't have the time to check the purity of each potential supporter's past, and I don't have the money to do it.
There is no money for the presidential campaign, there are only twenty thousand kroons in my transparent account.
Don't have any money?
You're talking about property declarations, but what about your own dealings with that?
Personal property is estimated at approximately 60 million.
I have a plot in Prague worth about 25 million, an apartment worth 10 million, another apartment worth 8 million, an art collection of about 10 million, Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Skoda Superb for a million, and a few more million on my account.
By the way, I got Aston-Martin because it was my boy's dream - I always liked James Bond, who drove a car, was gallant with women and at the same time fought against meanness and lawlessness.
Do you drive an Aston Martin, own $60 million worth of property, and don't have the money to campaign?
You say that you want to change the republic, but you do not want to invest your own money in it.
It's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Do I have to go into debt?
I have already invested 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have sponsors shows that my program isn't as interesting.
And I don't have to pay for the campaign out of pocket.
The cost of the campaign will essentially be covered by a senatorial salary.
But I would not live with this money, for example, I could not pay my son for an English school, which costs 30 thousand a month.
If I only wanted to make money, I wouldn't run anywhere.
So, then you will be engaged in entrepreneurship so that you can live?
Didn't you say you'd cut back on that activity?
But this does not depend on the size of the salary.
As I promised, I partially reduced my activities.
For example, the managing director of a travel agency in the spring will be my deputy.
People would like me to be an unscrupulous person who would keep the republic.
But I also need to live on something.
How much, as an entrepreneur, are you used to getting paid monthly?
From two hundred to four hundred thousand, which I get and further.
And if I had become president, I would have finished my entrepreneurship.

The architects of MVRDV prove that real adventures are not only in the imagination - on the example of Speikenisse and its newly built Book Mountain - 2 photos
"I find this building fun, it looks futuristic, finally we can see something interesting again," says Lisette Verheig, passing by on the edge of the road.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT specialist at a nearby large enterprise, thinks: "No, this building is really beautiful."
But I ask myself: why do we need another library today?
All have the Internet, iPads, and e-books.
Now no one voluntarily goes to such old-fashioned libraries, right?
Speikenisse, an unremarkable sleeping town near Rotterdam, holds an unusual record.
Its population of 80,000 has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
To combat this unfortunate circumstance, a few years ago it was decided to contribute to general education and build seven fictional bridges, which are depicted on euro banknotes, in the form of picturesquely painted miniatures of reinforced concrete.
The success of this educational initiative has been modest.
And then the fathers of the city realized that they had only one opportunity to overcome the statistics: to build a library here!
Winnie Maas of rotterdam-based architecture firm MVRDV, a master of bold bar charts and author of witty, sometimes even cynical, structures, treated the task with his usual equanimity and appeared at a competitive audition in 2003 with five books under his arm and a smirk on his face.
And while the jury members looked around puzzled and shrugged their shoulders, the daring Maas folded a pyramid of size from his original gift and concluded the speech in defense of his project with the following words: "Dear citizens!"
Here it is, my proposal: "Book Mountain" in Speikeniss, the so-called Bukenberg!
Nine years later, this €30 million mountain has grown.
It is part of a revitalization project that also includes an underground garage, a supermarket, a post office and several adjacent residential buildings and townhouses for a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, "Book Mountain" was awarded the second prize of the competition "The Best Library of the Netherlands 2012".
The project also participates in the national Dutch competition of wooden structures in 2012.
Thus, the faceless suburb, which previously could offer nothing but a postmodern pedestrian zone and a surprisingly ugly town hall, the white facades of which suggest a dairy plant, has become richer by one modern piece of architecture.
But the most important thing is that the first public building of cultural purpose in the history of this town appeared in Speikeniss.
The Long Road to the Book
First impression: bookish El Dorado under a cheese cap.
There is only one elevator passing in the center of the mountain range, because real fans of architecture and reading will prefer to explore this area on foot.
Glazed on all sides, the room is bright and easily visible, the floors of baked brick and elegant street lamps unmistakably create the feeling of a public city square.
The urban environment is recreated perfectly.
The eye involuntarily searches for benches, dogs and boys and girls playing football.
And everywhere - books, books, books.
"Usually there are bookshelves along the facades, and in the middle there is a large dark hall, usually uncomfortable and faceless," says Winnie Maas.
We turned the classic space configuration on its head and pulled the reading area from the inside out.
The interior space of the book mountain is used skillfully: in the center there are offices, an Internet library, a chess club, an environmental center and technical rooms.
Especially pleased are the black bookshelves, which serve as wall decoration, then parapets, then stair railings.
Their appearance, texture and smell are unusual.
Even sophisticated architects and civil engineers are lost in guesses what kind of unknown material it is.
"We were keen to work with secondary materials," explains Joop Trauborst, project manager representing the Speikenisse community, in accordance with the requirements of the standard.
And once, at an agricultural enterprise in Friesland, we came across a suitable by-product of agriculture.
For many years, in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands, an artificial fibrous material of millimeter thickness has been used as a lining for roots.
It's cheap and saves time.
Thin textiles last one or two seasons, after which they can be thrown away.
For the library, this canvas - for the first time in such volumes - was compressed into a panel four centimeters thick.
Under the influence of heat and pressure, the so-called landbauplasty (KLP) turns into a dark, homogeneous, durable material, smelling a bit like a new car and a little sneaker.
105 steps lead to the top.
Anyone who crosses the path of almost 500 meters will be rewarded in the literary café not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and wood ficuses in pots.
They care about the atmosphere, and first of all about the correct humidity of the air on the literary mountain.
Spending on a New Soul
"It's hard to believe, but this building, despite the many glass surfaces, is an exemplary project in terms of ecology," says Trouborst.
For its heating and cooling, the heat of the earth is used.
Although Book Mountain stands under a glass cap, even on clear days the sun gets inside only for a short time.
Wide trusses of glued wood, located perpendicular to the glass facade, give shade and take on most of the sun's rays.
The climate in the room is very pleasant.
The rest of the protection is provided by fully automatic roller blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the IT skeptic mentioned above, has already visited the new library.
Lisette Verheig was also here.
As well as traditional Chinese medicine teacher Cynthia Bogarde, who called Bukenberg "the soul of Speikenisse, which has long been lacking."
The reason: A few weeks before the opening, each resident received an invitation to donate one book from their own collection.
These books were supposed to take up empty space on the shelves of the still incomplete library - at that time it had 70,000 books.
The idea worked.
The shelves are filled to the brim.
"There is nothing worse than a half-empty library," says architect Winnie Maas.
"I think that thanks to our invitation, now every resident is connected to this new house in some way.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it serves only for decoration.
Thus, MVRDV managed to solve the royal problem, which in professional jargon is called the creation of identity.
Speikenisse wrote his literary history.
And even though they are very young and uneducated.
After all, this is only the starting point for building an identity.
Szabo: "Germans have a more important role to play"
Germany abstained in the vote on the recognition of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on U.S.-European relations, by doing so, Berlin is teetering on a narrow diplomatic path.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany first signaled that it would vote against the Palestinians' application for observer status at the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained from voting.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support the actions of the Israelis in Gaza.
Germany now needs to be careful about its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I believe that she also does not support the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence – without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained in the vote on the introduction of a no-fly zone.
As a result, NATO carried out this proposal.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on complex international issues?
Yes, it is.
The fact is that it is in the process of transforming its foreign policy, namely, it is moving from the policy that, so to speak, was managed by the United States, to the German foreign policy itself.
In addition, the situation is complicated by the fact that Europeans do not have a coherent unified policy.
Thus, the Germans again find themselves between two fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I believe that while they are only groping for their role, they are on the way to a "more normal" foreign policy.
Such a foreign policy as France or Great Britain pursues.
What exactly does "normal" foreign policy mean from the German point of view?
This is a willingness to take a position in their national interests that does not depend on the position of the United States or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy depends on economic policy, that is, on exports and ties with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are largely different from those of other major states, and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the position in the Middle East conflict and the UN vote?
First, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, in particular in the Gulf states.
Therefore, it needs to be careful not to offend the public and the elites in the Arab countries.
Either way, it plays a role.
But I wouldn't attach too much importance to it, it's not entirely one-way communication.
But in any case, this plays an important role in the calculations of the Germans.
Has Germany harmed its relations with the US by refraining from making important decisions, such as voting on Palestine?
I am sure that in Europe and even in the United States the understanding of the German position prevails.
Therefore, I do not think that it was as dramatic a breakdown as in the Libyan issue.
Perhaps Germany will even gain some respect in this way.
After all, this signals that it should be taken seriously as a player in the international arena and that its interests must be reckoned with.
In Europe, there are different opinions about the Palestinian initiative.
The U.S., by contrast, has been clear in favor of the veto.
Is there a difference of opinion between the U.S. and many European countries?
By virtue of American domestic politics, such differences have always existed.
I believe that the Obama administration has, deep down, a sufficient understanding of the European position.
But due to the local political situation, the government, of course, cannot openly take such a position.
I believe that the significant differences of opinion are not as significant as they always seem.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is not at all enthusiastic about Netanyahu's policies.
Is it easy for Germany to combine its close ties with Israel and the US on the one hand and its position as a crucial partner in the EU on the other?
I think that's what makes the situation so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be somewhat easier for the Germans if there were a single, consistent European policy, but this is not the case now.
Therefore, they cannot take a broader approach and are instead forced to act on their own vision.
That's what they do with the euro.
I think that in the future Germany will take a leading role in developing a common European position.
It is clear that this is not easy for Germany, if only because of its ties with Israel.
This topic has always been sensitive.
But I think it's clear to the Germans that they have to play a more independent role.
If Germany sees itself as an important international player, won't it really take on a major role?
Or is the leading role still hard for Germany?
Germany is not yet accustomed to this, it is still always unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is still always difficult to play a significant role.
Consider, for example, the euro crisis – every time Germany assumes an important role, a wide variety of anti-German sentiments emerge.
The Germans don't just have to deal with it.
Actually, this is an old problem: you do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult situation than the United States.
It must take into account a wide variety of neighbors and opinions, and this is not easy.
So, the influence of the United States in European politics is constantly weakening, but at the moment the EU does not fill this vacuum, who then remains?
The Germans will simply have to play a more significant role.

'Trademark Protection' in China: When Puma and Armani Suddenly Become Chinese
Armani is a world-famous trademark, Polo Ralph Lauren is too.
But what is armani Polo?
This is a completely officially registered name in China, which has nothing to do with the companies from whose names it is formed.
However, it will be protected until the owners of the original names file a lawsuit.
But even then, it is unclear whether they will be able to defend their rights.
"It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their trademarks in China," says Thomas Pattloh, an attorney at Taylor Wessing, who specializes in trademark infringement in the Far East.
On my desk every week there is a new case of this kind.
Imitators only need to add a couple of letters to get the right to register their trademarks.
So from Gucci you get Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada you can register Prada-Kny.
In the same way, German enterprises, for example, the manufacturer of sporting goods Puma, are legally copied.
Pattloh opens a folder with the records of the trademark office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company registered the trademark Zegna DF Puma there, an artificial name that also used the name of the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
The fact that the Chinese are world champions in copying and violating intellectual property rights is known.
In big cities, there are multi-story department stores selling almost exclusively fakes.
However, Pattloch's case is not like that. On behalf of his clients, he opposes chinese enterprises officially receiving from the trademark office the right to use a name that is already protected somewhere else.
The Chinese call this "ban mingpai", a passenger brand.
This word is associated with "ban dakuan".
This is the name of women who hunt for rich men.
Chinese authorities do not admit guilt
"This is detrimental to business, it must be fought," Pattloh said.
"The trademark is blurred, the unique position is lost, the image suffers greatly."
Financial losses and procedural costs in the affected industries are in the millions, especially in the case of expensive copied products.
According to market research firm CLSA, China, with sales of 15 billion euros a year, is the third largest and fastest growing market for luxury goods.
However, it is difficult and expensive to obtain the removal of dubious entries in the trademark registry.
The process can last up to nine years, with an unclear outcome.
Pattloh talks about cases in which the court rejected the claims, since after a long time the protested name became "the reality of the market."
If the plaintiff is unlucky, he will even have to pay the plagiarist, as he caused damage to his trademark in China, says Pattloh.
Sometimes the law of the jungle rules here.
There are also famous cases about graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with construction machine manufacturer Sany, a company that had recently acquired concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
Therefore, the Chinese still have the right to use an emblem similar to the Mercedes star.
Geely, which bought Volvo, originally used a blue-and-white logo that resembled BMW; the process was successful, Geely had to change it.
Fashion maker Lacoste lost in China to imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, whose famous crocodile looked the other way.
The Chinese authorities do not consider themselves guilty.
The CTMO Trademark Office in Beijing confirms that in 2010 there were difficulties due to a lack of staff and equipment in the premises.
But last year there was a "return from an emergency in the work process to normal."
Thus, the number of pending cases of objections decreased by 22 per cent.
Nearly 57,000 such cases were closed, a 75 percent increase from last year.
However, 81,500 claims are still pending at the department.
It's expensive to fight it.
As is very common in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million trademark applications, nearly a third more than in 2010.
This is a record and means that China for the tenth time in a row topped the list of new registrations around the world, the agency said.
The same applies to the total number of valid trademarks, a total of 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan in fees were paid.
To simplify, this means that each registration costs an average of 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
It costs many times more to protest it, as the case of the German family company Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the concern has been fighting against the Chinese plagiarist.
The Germans managed to ensure that their illegal production of fake car parts was eliminated.
However, the imitator secured the Chinese rights to the Freudenberg trademark.
It was an omission of its own, as surnames in Germany are not subject to protection, says Hanno Wentzler, chairman of the board of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
And the trademark office CTMO rejected the claim of the Munich residents.
True, Freudenberg won in both subsequent instances, but the opposite side continues to fight to this day.
You need to be on the alert
The matter is now pending before the Supreme Court.
Wenzler hopes to bring the case to a good conclusion and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, "The process is extremely expensive and takes us a lot of time, money and nerves."
Internal costs are hardly accountable, the company's archive had to look through even the acts of a century ago to bring evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg fruitlessly offered the opposing side a "large six-figure sum in euros" for a settlement.
"It's clear from here how costly it is for us," says Wentzler.
The dangers of the Far East threaten to spread even to Europe.
Namely, in the event that imitators register unprotected trademarks there.
So, one Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather goods.
The concern has long ceased production in these areas, but despite this it was able to prevent registration.
"You have to be on the alert," Goentzler says.
Both he and Attorney Pattloch recommend that German businesses be very careful with China.
It is not enough to rely on international provisions for the protection of trademarks, rather foreigners should "register everything that is worth protecting in any way in China," says Wentzler.
Otherwise, it can cost much more than registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg loses in the last act of its trademark drama, it will have to pay the other side licensing fees for its own name, Wentzler explains.
Otherwise, we will be ousted from the market in the controversial segment.
World AIDS Day: trampling, singing, helping
In Heidelberg, the Imbonga Choir is rehearsing - and in Swaziland, AIDS orphans rejoice.
The history of relations that covered a distance of more than 8733 kilometers.
First, there is a stomp: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, ladies' boats and men's slippers pick up the beat on the parquet floor and quickly find it.
One-two-three-four.
Only then do the voices of the singers – alto, bass, tenor and soprano – slowly grow and they step on, fascinate and follow each other.
And Fite Hopf, a 29-year-old conductor, almost pops out of his cloth shoes as he leads them with flexible and expressive gestures.
On Monday evening, in the music hall of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the Imbonga Choir rehearses a new song.
Fifty choir members from 23 to 69 years old came to the rehearsal, from a specialist in human genetics to a janitor.
"Om Obani" is not an easy thing, each voice of the choir has its own text, moreover, in a completely alien language: Zulu, which is spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
Unaids, the United Nations AIDS programme, estimates that there are about 34 million people living with HIV worldwide.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
Swaziland is home to 245,000 AIDS orphans.
At the same time, more than 40 percent of the population is HIV-positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitgeni, Voices for Africa has found chefs in Germany.
70 of them attend a school preparing for further education.
For 15 or 20 euros per month, you can take on patronage.
It guarantees the child money for school, school uniforms and a daily hot lunch at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi in Zulu means narrator or praiser.
In this room, they do not speak Bantu fluently, but they can sing.
For almost a decade, the choir has been learning songs in this foreign soft language and from time to time even brings them back to where they first appeared: to southern Africa.
After all, at a distance of 8733 kilometers of summer from Heidelberg, in the north-west of the Kingdom of Swaziland, is the village of Esitgeni, which depends on the voices of the German choir.
Forty percent are infected
About 2,000 people live there, some still in simple huts made of clay and straw, among the inhabitants there are many children.
More than 300 of them were left without parents who died from the IC virus.
In Esitgeni, the disease of the whole of Swaziland is reflected in miniature: the highest rate of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF.
Circumcision of the foreskin in men, which is proven to reduce the risk of infection by half, is almost not accepted among the population.
More than forty percent of Swaziland's population carries the immunodeficiency virus, and death in the middle of the fourth decade is not uncommon.
The choir opened this village on a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, but before the participants of Imbognee saw many children on the streets who lacked not only parental care, but also just everything: food, clothing, education.
Without a school education, a person in a poor country has no chance at all.
At first, it was a private obligation of individual participants - for a few euros a year to send a child to school and give him the opportunity to receive a hot meal once a day.
But a year later, the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa", which since then has been almost professionally caring for AIDS orphans in Esitgeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia and tripper (gonorrhea).
Frequent viral STIs are HIV, human papillomavirus, genital herpes and hepatitis.
Pubic lice and scabies are parasitic STIs.
What are the main groups affected?
Syphilis and gonorrhea occur mainly in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute believes that in at least four out of every five cases of syphilis reported in Germany, transmission occurs as a result of sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults, common sexually transmitted diseases are chlamydial infections, trichomoniasis, candidiasis (fungus), gonorrhea, and human papillomavirus.
The prevalence of HIV among heterosexual adults in our country is relatively low - but about 20 percent of new HIV infections fall on this group.
Chlamydial infections are much more common among young people than among other population groups.
According to European data, three-quarters of all infections affect young people from 15 to 25 years old.
We also often have a human papilloma virus among young people.
How does the number of infections change?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to mandatory registration.
The incidence of syphilis, according to the Robert Koch Institute, more than doubled from 1697 cases in 2001 to 3698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been declining since 2007.
In 2011, there were about 2700 cases.
This is about one tenth less than in the previous year.
What symptoms indicate a sexually transmitted disease?
In infectious diseases, ulcers in the genital area, complaints during urination, discharge, pain in the lower abdomen, as well as vesicles or seals may occur.
However, often they are not accompanied by pain and other symptoms and go unnoticed.
How can I protect myself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but do not give one hundred percent protection.
After all, partially the causative agents of sexually transmitted diseases can also be spread by contact infection and through close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular examination, especially with frequent changes in sexual partners.
With early diagnosis, most STIs can be cured and long-term consequences avoided.
Patronage, donations and last but not least the fees for the choir's performances throughout Germany allow us to collect something.
"In total, we have already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitegeni," says Annette Lennartz, chairman of the association.
In the village itself, money from Germany is managed by Tsodva Dlamini, a conscious and active woman.
She also makes sure that the orphans are well arranged, for example with one of the grandmothers.
Gogos, as old women are called in Zulu, is the backbone of the village.
Some of them have taken in up to 14 orphans, give them a roof over their heads and make sure that children in uniform appear on time for lessons every day.
Those who have no relatives go to the shelter to Haniysila, a lonely woman who receives a salary from the association, as well as two cooks who prepare every day for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, Voices for Africa organized a sewing school, built two chicken coops and, together with the American health organization PSI, organized HIV testing for many villagers.
It is difficult to imagine, but about the disease, which is so obvious throughout the country, they prefer to remain deeply silent.
The King with 14 Wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
Quite unusual for a country in which the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his love of excess.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
In particular, such a state-sanctioned lifestyle is also to blame for the fact that the IC virus spread so rapidly in past years.
But it also lies with the wandering workers who are spreading the virus across the country.
Free condoms are literally on every corner, says Annette Lennartz, "but they are almost not used.
The other culture is flesh to flesh."
To support the cultural exchange a bit, the Ibmogni Choir travels to southern Africa every two to three years and sings songs full of sadness, fighting spirit, confidence and black identity that many on the southern edge of the black continent have known since apartheid.
A bus full of whites singing songs in black - such a confession not only brings a good mood and joy, but even, it happened, caused tears in the eyes of stern border guards.
The trip always leads also to Esitgeni, where the singers visit the children under the patronage.
Despite the fact that the small village can hardly be found on the map, in the valley of the Etsulveni River it is more than famous.
"Go to Esitgeni, there is light," people here say.
And after an 8733-kilometer flight back to Heidelberg, when the stomping singers return to the rehearsal room on Bergheimer Street, you can see that this light is also on here.
Messenger: NASA opens ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice sheet can be up to 20 meters thick.
The US space agency NASA has proved the presence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is located closest to the Sun, there is also frozen water, according to three studies published Thursday in the special journal Science.
The messenger probe found evidence that the region of the planet that is constantly in the shadows is covered with ice.
Its thickness should be at least 30 centimeters, and possibly even up to 20 meters.
Presumably, the water comes from a comet or possibly an asteroid that collided with Mercury.
No one links the discovery of ice to the existence of life on the planet, said the probe's scientific director, Sean Solomon.
Temperatures on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
However, these discoveries could help explain how water and other building blocks of life made their way elsewhere in the solar system.
Unbeknownst to the inhabitants of the Earth, probes, telescopes and small robots, for example, "Phoenix", explore the depths of the Universe.
From time to time, they send images to Earth: small windows in endless distances.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
Eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the Sun after Neptune, Ceres, according to the new definition of the International Astronomical Union of 2006, is not a "planet".
This fragment of the Spitzer infrared image provides a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars are in the form of blue dots, it is more difficult to identify pink "newborn" stars in the stellar circle.
This region of star formation - scientists unromantically call it W5 - was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6500 light years.
This iridescent heat of the dying star was photographed by NASA's Spitzer telescope.
The doughnut-like ring is made up of material that the star ejected in the process of dying.
In the giant Nebula Trifid, 5400 light-years from Earth, new stars arise from gas and dust.
NASA's Spitzer telescope took this photo of the galactic delivery room.
The Pleiades Star Cluster, also called the Seven Sisters, can be seen at night with the naked eye.
Of course, with a telescope, colors are better.
As a red eye winks at an observer, the Snail Nebula in this infrared image.
It is located at a distance of 700 light years in the constellation Aquarius.
The resemblance to the Earth's continent earned this nebula the nickname "North America".
The combination of normal and infrared photography provides expressive color reproduction.
This new star in all its beauty was photographed only with the help of infrared sensors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and its rings: How they came to be is one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
Perhaps these are fragments of the moon of Saturn, which disappeared without a trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of hubble's greatest and clearest images: The Whirlpool Galaxy
Depending on the color reproduction, images of spiral galaxies turn into real works of art.
Published by the European Southern Observatory, the image shows the trifid nebula in the constellation Sagittarius several thousand light years away.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (three-lobed, three-parted), as dark streaks of dust divide into three parts the red-hot heart of the cradle of stars.
In the constellation Ophiuchus, astronomers photographed the harbinger of a cosmic collision: at a distance of 400 million light years from Earth, the cores of two merging galaxies rush towards each other and inevitably collide.
This birth of a star was filmed by the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Anyone who doesn't like technical abbreviations might call it the "South Wheel of The South Wheel."
A photograph of the Hubble Space Telescope shows a fragment of the Iris Nebula in the constellation Cepheus.
The nebula, 1400 light-years away, consists of dust particles ten to one hundred times smaller than that of ordinary house dust.
This image was composed of optical and X-ray images from various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes 430 million light-years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, was photographed for NASA by the Hubble Space Telescope.
Scientists call the large spiral galaxy UGC 1810.
In this stellar nebula is the brightest group of new stars of our Milky Way.
The stellar cradle is constantly creating new stars.
This star cloud, connected to the Rosette Nebula, is also constantly creating new stars – at a distance of 5,000 light-years from Earth.
In this brightly glowing galaxy with a small black hole, there is no dust yet, only gas.
Researchers suggest that it arose shortly before the Big Bang, when the universe mainly had hydrogen.
Our Views on the Universe: Essential Telescopes
The telescope was probably invented in 1608 by Hans Lippershey – even before Galileo Galilei began observing the stars a year later.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have become larger - and the spaces available to their eyes are deeper.
For 30 years, namely from 1947 to 1975, the Hale Telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror depicted here had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, the "Large Binocular Telescope" was installed.
It allows you to look into space with the help of two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
"Gran Telescopio Canarias" has a giant internal device - the diameter of the mirror alone is 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the South African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - for the sake of reducing cost.
Nevertheless, in diameter it reaches about eleven meters.
The disadvantage of inexpensive design: the telescope is rigidly fastened at a vertical angle - this limits its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly Telescope in Texas also has a fixed vertical angle.
Its peculiarity: high light-collecting ability.
It reaches - despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror - the parameters of the world's largest telescopes.
Using a radio telescope in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, researchers are listening to extraterrestrial signals in space.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
By participating in the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) project, any computer owner can help by providing their computing power.
View of the European Astronomical Service (ESO) Observatory in the Chilean Andes.
Here stands the "Very Large Telescope" - fully consistent with its name.
Its four mirrors allow you to illuminate even the mid-infrared spectrum in the telescope.
ESO's Chilean Observatory is also planning to install a European Very Large Telescope.
Its main mirror should spread over as much as 42 meters - and will be composed of almost 1,000 mirror elements.
However, photos should not be expected until 2018 at the earliest.
Until 2007, both Keck telescopes on hawaii's Mauna Kea volcano were considered the largest in the world.
They have two mirrors with a diameter of ten meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which also looks into the sky with the help of the Subaru and IRTTF telescopes.
In addition, a new giant telescope should appear on Mauna Kea - with a mirror with a diameter of thirty meters.
Here you can admire the illustrations.
However, the most important views from space are supplied by the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has been delivering paintings of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been searching for planets outside the solar system – primarily those on which life is possible.
On February 2, 2011, NASA reported that 1235 candidate planets had been discovered since the mission began.
The photograph shows the latest preparations of the Kepler space telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be sent into space no earlier than 2018 aboard an Ariane 5 rocket.
The main mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope: it must search for the Big Bang by the light of the first stars and galaxies.
Scientists suggest that there is ice at Mercury's south pole.
However, there is no reliable data on this, since the "Messenger" rotates closer to the north pole of the planet.
Radar measurements for decades have indicated that there is ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger probe launched in 2004 – the first to orbit Mercury – scientists are now confident in this.
Drink oil every day - and live up to 168 years
In southern Azerbaijan, many residents reach a biblically venerable age.
There is even a museum of longevity.
Looking for a clue in a country where 97-year-old elders still seem relatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many residents reach a biblically venerable age.
There is even a museum of longevity.
Looking for a clue in a country where 97-year-old elders still seem relatively young.
A trip through the Talysh Mountains can be called wild and romantic.
A minibus rolls with rumbling along a winding road past hills overgrown with dense forests, turbulent rivers and simple peasant houses.
Everything around you is so green and bright that you might think you're in the Black Forest.
But this is the southernmost edge of Azerbaijan, the Iranian border is only a few kilometers from here.
Here live the Talysh - one of the peoples of the Caucasus, about whom little is known, except that they speak Farsi and Azerbaijani perfectly and are distinguished by longevity.
The final destination is Lerik.
The small town boasts too heavy soviet-era architecture, which is not at all in harmony with the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe almost do not come here, the road from the Azerbaijani capital Baku is too tiring.
It takes eight hours to reach 323 kilometers, as the road has only one lane.
The legendary wealth to which the country owes the oil of the Caspian Sea has not yet reached here, in the province.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that there is something to interest tourists in Lerik.
"In May, Baku became famous for the Eurovision Song Festival - and next year we will have a festival of the oldest people in the world," Fatulayeva said.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, probably the only one in the world.
It documents the biography of about eight dozen Talysh from these places, who are more than 100 years old. Fatulaeva points to a black-and-white photograph.
This is my grandfather, he is 120 years old here.
At the age of 136, he had another child.
But the controversial star of the museum is shepherd Shirali Myslyumov, who allegedly turned 168 years old.
There is no birth certificate, however.
And given the fact that the oldest person, whose age is confirmed by documents, turned 122 years old, the age of Muslyumov seems extremely doubtful.
"He was born in the area in 1805 and died in 1973," Fatulayeva explains.
The man was married three times and had 23 children, at the age of 136 he allegedly had a daughter.
So did the shepherd Myslyumov add a couple of decades to his age?
After all, even Rembrandt Scholz, an age researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has heard of centenarians in Central Asia.
"An astonishing number of elderly people can also be found in some parts of China, in Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz.
However, due to the lack of documents, scientific proof of age is not possible, since there were no civil registries.
Every day a glass of ghee
However, there is a fact that people in the Lerik area are strikingly often of biblical age.
Now 20 people over 100 years old live here.
Why are there so many centenarians here in the south?
Azerbaijani guide Farid Muhimzade explains this by the special genes of the Talysh.
The director of the fatulaeva museum, on the contrary, believes that the matter is in nutrition.
Talysh love meat, bread and most of all dairy products, many of them drink a glass of ghee every day. However, it is unlikely that such a high-calorie diet can be healthy from a nutritional point of view.
Or is it a primitive way of life that preserves people's youth? In Chengemiran, a tiny village near the town of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzoeva.
At 97 years old, she is still relatively young for these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor with a barrel of butter that she tirelessly rolls back and forth.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of mirzayeva's sons and daughter, who have long had their grandchildren.
Two kids are also galloping nearby.
Tea is served in the kitchen and served in typical armudou pot-bellied glasses.
Mirzayeva has perfectly straight and strong white teeth, under her headscarf she hides long dark blond braids, which her son proudly reveals to us.
I always wash my hair with milk, so it never fell out and retained its color.
"And I've never used shampoo," Mirzayeva said.
Monthly pension is enough for life
She always ate only what grew in her own yard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
In my entire life, I have never bought a grocery in a store.
She then talks about her husband, who served in the military.
The hardest thing was after the Second World War.
But it got better when the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev took the helm.
Propaganda is not often heard in the speech of an old woman.
However, the cult created around the figure of the father of the nation, who ruled the country as a dictator, knows almost no borders in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, when his son Ilham took the reins.
Nevertheless, there is no poverty among the Azerbaijani elderly.
Mirzayeva receives 230 manats (approximately equal to the same amount of euros) monthly as a pension, for local conditions this is an amount on which you can live well.
And, perhaps, Mirzayeva's long-grown son is also right: "Old people in our culture are deeply respected."
They live in a large family, are loved, surrounded by care and happy.
What is not a reason to stay alive as long as possible
The word "human right" does not appear in the constitution
The revolution returned to Cairo.
The rival demonstrations in Cairo are indicative of the country's deep division.
The future constitution, based on Sharia, was fiercely opposed.
The Egyptian president did not stint on pathos.
We have to create a transition.
"And his success lies with my responsibility to the people and to God," he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to the entire people, but above all to Christian Copts, liberals, enlightened Muslims and non-religious Egyptians.
After all, all of them, still hopelessly divided in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a religious state on the Nile is at the mercy of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohammed Morsi, almost apologizing, said he had temporarily curtailed the competence of the constitutional court and expanded his competence "to save the revolution."
However, what the 61-year-old engineer, who has a doctoral degree from the American University of Southern California, really wants to save is not entirely clear to the Egyptians and the whole world.
Will the judiciary be stripped of its power?
In fact, 234 articles managed to sneak through in a 15-hour overnight horse race with obstacles at an Islamist-minded constitutional assembly of 100 participants, and this is partly a cause for concern.
As in previous constitutions, the draft states that judicial proceedings are based on "the principles of Islamic law."
But what do "principles" mean?
This has been and remains a matter of interpretation, and it is feared that Islamists will use the vague wording and the resulting legal backlash to interpret Sharia more strictly.
At least, this is hinted at by one newly introduced article: in all matters relating to sharia, al-Ashar University, the country's most important Islamist institution, which enjoys great authority in all of Sunni Islam, should be involved in the council.
This should not, but it could mean that the clergy oversee legislation, which would de facto result in a limitation of the judiciary.
In the draft constitution, much is the subject of interpretation.
Another problem: the jurisdiction of civilians to the military court must be preserved.
These courts during mubarak's rule served to suppress the opposition.
Since the overthrow of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians have been held in military detention.
Also, as the draft says, the state should protect "the true essence of the Egyptian family" and "uphold its morality and values."
Legally, this is formulated so vaguely that state institutions with the help of this article will be able to control even the content of cinema and literature.
In plain text, this means nothing more than censorship.
In general, no article explicitly establishes the equality of men and women.
But the other prohibits insulting and defaming the Prophet Muhammad and his messengers.
But what an insult is and how it should be punished remains unclear.
The wording that "insulting people" is prohibited is also questionable.
Will a caricature of the president or a joke about a lawyer be enough?
The question of interpretation, like much of this draft, which Morsi is proposing for signature and which he said will be submitted to Egyptians in a referendum "very soon."
"The revolution is back"
For several weeks now, opposition to the superiority of the Islamists has been formed.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in unusual unanimity on Friday evening in Cairo's Tahrir Square and vowed to destroy the document before it could even enter into force.
"The revolution is back and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, who came third in the presidential election.
Nobel Peace Prize winner and former head of the international atomic energy authority, Mohamed ElBaradei, said the draft constitution had a place "in the dustbin of history."
Through twitter's short news service, he accused Morsi's supporters of wanting to lead a "putsch against democracy."
"If he calls a referendum, we will go to his palace and throw it away," said opposition leader Yasser Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers has not yet been avenged," Egyptian media quoted opposition politician Khaled Ali as saying.
Many judges also said they did not want to observe the referendum, which would make it invalid.
"The Quran is our constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, in turn, called for the opposite demonstration, but, out of precaution, not in Tahrir Square, but after mass prayer on the other side of the Nile in front of Cairo University.
It was attended by a large number of women under veils and adherents of the Salafis, who shouted: "The people demand the application of God's law."
They demanded from Morsi: "Cleanse the country!" and assured: "The Koran is our constitution."
The power struggle over the symbolic square where it all began provoked a state of almost civil war.
Morsi's followers obviously did not want to take that risk.
The Muslim Brotherhood said both opponents and supporters of the draft constitution had spoken loud and clear.
Now it's time to let the people decide at the ballot box which direction the country should go.
The majority is for the islamists' project, it is considered a done deal.
"The concept of 'human rights' is never mentioned"
Hafiz Abu Sayeda is furious with this accelerated constitutional process, which, in fact, was supposed to last until February with the participation of all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EDR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood while they were in prison or on trial under Mubarak.
Not because he shared their worldview, but because human rights are indivisible to him.
For this, he was beaten, sentenced, arrested.
And now the words "human rights" are never found in the new constitution, he regrets in an interview with Welt am Sonntag.
Morsi's expanding influence over all three branches of government in the state has disappointed the lawyer.
These measures represent clear blows to the democratic rules of the game and will lead Egyptians to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening the civil state, the president de facto annulled it," Sayeda laments.
After all, without civil society organizations, democracy cannot function.
Sayeda feels that everyone has abandoned him, even the international community, which looks at the ideological struggle of the directions on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
There could be a price to pay for that.
A demonstrator in Tahrir Square warns: "You are creating a monster that you cannot control."
Norwegian Rakfisk: The Most Foul-Smelling Fish in the World?
Norway's population of five million has one of the highest standards of living, not only in Europe but throughout the world.
Perhaps the secret of this country's success has something to do with the local addiction to one extremely fetid fish dish?
Take a few overripe pieces of cheese.
Put them in a pile of dirty and sweaty sportswear.
Leave them there for a week.
You'll get the smell-numbing smell of rakfisk, one of Norway's most famous delicacies.
I'm in a small town called Fagernes, a three-hour drive from Oslo.
Snow-covered views are all around. It is very beautiful, but an indestructible characteristic smell is spilled in the air.
Rakfisk is a trout sprinkled with salt and fermented in water for up to a year, depending on what kind of soul you need to achieve.
As dusk falls and it gets colder, crowds of Norwegians gather for a festival in Fagernes dedicated to this, shall we say, exciting dish.
"It is eaten raw and washed down with a glass of aquavit, a local cumin vodka," explains Havard Halvarsen, a local firefighter by profession and part-time "rakfisk general" who runs the festival.
Everywhere around us, people eat diced fish and wash it down with considerable portions of alcohol.
"Someone likes aquavit more than rakfisk," says Havard.
This drink is able to kill the smell.
I try a couple of pieces.
If you manage to carry a piece under your nose, then everything is not so bad - not much different from a portion of sushi that you have been carrying with you on the bus for a long time.
Rakfisk is a Norwegian product from completely different times, the times of poverty, when, even before the advent of refrigerators, fish in the autumn were soaked in hermetically sealed barrels of salt water.
Then, in the deep winter, when the fish had already fermented well and thoroughly, it was extracted and, muting the perception of alcohol, was eaten.
It is still in the memory of the last generation that thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and emigrate, mainly to the United States.
Now the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, who are attracted here by jobs, high salaries and a developed social security system.
Residents of Sweden (a long-standing rival, and not so long ago and much more prosperous neighbor) come here en masse to work.
Rakfisk is perceived as an important symbol, an indispensable, albeit somewhat fetid element of Norway's past.
This is one of the most expensive local dishes.
On the other hand, everything is expensive here – a small glass of beer or a sandwich will set you back £9 ($14).
Norway rarely appears in the world news, and most of the country's residents seem to be satisfied with this.
People here are still reluctant to mention the name of Anders Breivik, the racist and right-wing extremist who shot and killed 77 men, women and children last year.
Without mentioning his name, the terrorist attack is called "what happened on July 22."
It is very difficult for Norwegians to believe that in their peace-loving country one of their fellow citizens was capable of such atrocities and murders.
At the heart of Norway's current prosperity is the growth (since the early seventies) of one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world.
"However, oil is not the only reason we thrive," says Anna, our waitress carrying trays of aged rakfisk, a woman with long blonde hair and strikingly blue eyes, the epitome of Nordic well-being.
We are such a people - as you call it - reasonable.
Like most Norwegians, she speaks perfect English.
We don't like to be on display, we're not bragging.
Norway handles its oil very carefully – most of the oil and gas industry's revenues are invested in a special fund created for the benefit of future generations.
In the years leading up to the global financial crisis, when everyone was littered with money they didn't have, Norway was thrifty counting all costs.
"As long as you can ski in the winter and hike in the summer, that's enough for happiness," says Anna.
"And there's a rakfisk," she adds with a light-hearted laugh.
I'm standing in the snow in line for some food - I've had enough.
Here's a hamburger with moose meat - it's certainly exotic, delicious juicy meat.
But in the evening we are waiting for an even greater number of the same fish with an unforgettable smell.
My hotel hosts a special dinner dedicated to rakfisk, during which visitors vote to determine the best or perhaps the most fragrant fish.
There is a live television broadcast, which shows the presenter in a bow tie, surrounded by plates with a rakfisk.
It's like the Eurovision Song Contest.
"So, Thor-Jürgen, what grade did you give for the best fish out there in your mountains?"
"Yes, Havard, here's our assessment."
Everyone laughs and applauds.
Someone falls out of a chair, perhaps after sorting through the aquavit.
Or maybe just inhaling the smell of this fish.
Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto will have a difficult start to his career.
As Mexico's newly elected president, Enrique Peña Nieto, prepares to take office, BBC correspondent Will Grant invites us to take a look at the difficulties he will face and the mixed expectations of his country's population.
Traffic in Mexico City is now in a particularly deplorable state.
The city is congested with traffic at the best of times, and since Monday steel barriers have been erected, cutting off several key highways to the capital and causing chaos on the roads.
However, this was done not to prevent people from getting to work from the suburbs, but to prevent protesters from getting to the parliament building.
On Sunday, the new head of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, will put on a presidential sling and take the reins of power of the country.
He faces a daunting task.
Mexico has achieved good economic performance under the administration of Felipe Calderón, who is now stepping down, but the country is mired in a war on drugs that has already claimed about 60,000 lives in six years.
"My government declares to the people of Mexico its readiness to fight violence," Mr. Peña Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama earlier this week in the White House Oval Office.
I am going to propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve this goal.
Prior to such statements, Mr. Peña Nieto's political career was developing alongside the U.S. president as governor of his home state of Mexico.
In his homeland, in the densely populated and vast state surrounding the country's capital, opinions about the new leader were divided.
Straightforward Man
In the idyllic town of Valle de Bravo, for example, he is remembered fondly.
Residents credit him with the revival of tourism, the development of the resort sector and the creation of infrastructure.
The city can be reached via one of the new highways built by Mr. Peña Nieto, which are strikingly different from the pothole and pit roads that were previously on this site.
Plaques with his name hang on the modern building of the sports center and on the impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
"We pin our hopes on him for real and serious change," said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a state congressman for the Peña Nieto-led Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).
We look forward to the real and decisive changes that our country so desperately needs, particularly in the areas of security and economic development.
After 81 years in power, the PRI party was ousted in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera admits that after his 12-year absence from the presidential palace of Los Pinos, the party has high hopes for Enrique Peña Nieto.
In addition, he refutes the accusations of vacuousness made by the opposition to the new president.
He is very straightforward and very dedicated to realizing his vision for the future of the country.
He is an excellent statesman, and above all, a man who knows how to listen.
But in another part of the state, many people have a different view of the former governor.
The municipality of Nezahualcóyotl, also known as Ciudad Nesa, is the most striking contrast to the cobbled streets of Valle de Bravo.
Hidden under highway overpasses, it is in many ways a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the municipality are also of a severe nature of this metropolis.
Earlier this year, troops were brought in to pacify drug gangs in those areas; and violence against women is particularly acute here.
Several dozen bodies of murdered women have been found in a vacant lot near a vast landfill in the past two years alone.
More than a thousand women have been killed in the state of Mexico during Mr. Peña Nieto's governorship, far exceeding that in the notoriously violent city of Ciudad Juárez, whose name has become a household name when it comes to the murder of innocent women.
According to Mr. Peña Nieto's opponents, it can be said of him at best that during his tenure as Governor he has failed to cope with the problem of femicide.
In the worst case, his administration is accused of completely ignoring this problem.
A resident of a concrete house like most houses in this dilapidated neighborhood, Irenaeya Buendia can barely hold back tears as she shows me pictures of her late daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes that she was killed by her partner.
"When I got to her house, it looked like her body had been washed before," Ms Buendia recalls.
There were signs that she had been beaten and her body had already stiffened.
Mariana's mother retells the story, and the portrait of her daughter looks at us from the wall, where it hangs next to a crucifix on which only one word is inscribed: justice.
That, they said, was denied to this family.
"State officials treated me like an old gossip cop, a disgruntled troublemaker.
They want people to just take everything they say on faith and keep quiet.
But this is wrong, it is impossible, especially when there are so many violations and shortcomings around," she says.
Wearing the presidential sling on Saturday, President Peña Nieto will shoulder the heavy responsibility with it.
Over the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have been affected by violent crime, and the new president has promised to make addressing the problem a priority during his rule.
"I hope he will be exactly the same president as he was governor," says Olvera, a congressman from Valle de Bravo from the PRI party.
However, this is what the families of the victims in Ciudad Nesa fear the most.
Bradley Manning has not complained of mistreatment, the prosecution said.
Prosecutors are trying to refute Bradley Manning's allegations of poor conditions of detention.
The hearing focused on Manning's stay at a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense is seeking to close the case on the grounds that Manning's conditions of detention were harsh.
A U.S. Army private is accused of stealing several thousand classified documents.
On Friday, the prosecution sought to prove that Private Bradley Manning, accused of the largest leak of classified material in U.S. history, did not take advantage of the many opportunities to file a complaint about the ill-treatment he said he endured while in a military prison.
During cross-examination at a pretrial hearing in Fort Meade, Maryland, military prosecutor Major Ashden Fein said records of weekly visits to Manning by prison officials during his nine months in Quantico, Virginia, contained no complaints of ill-treatment.
Cross-examination of the defence motion to dismiss Manning's case on the grounds that the conditions of his imprisonment were cruel and in themselves sufficient punishment was conducted the day after Manning claimed that he intended to commit suicide while in custody.
A military intelligence analyst arrested in June 2010 is accused of stealing several thousand classified documents while serving in Iraq.
These materials were subsequently published on the Internet on the WikiLeaks website.
WikiLeaks did not confirm that Manning was the source of the information.
During Friday's hearing, Prosecutor Fein, along with Manning, reviewed reports that were completed after visits to Manning by administration officials during his stay at Quantico Prison, where he was held under a high-security prison regime from July 2010 to April 2011.
During the visits, prison officials asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When Prosecutor Fein asked Friday about the reports, Manning admitted he rated the treatment by prison authorities as "excellent" and the general conditions of detention as "very professionally organized."
The reports reviewed do not contain any complaints of ill-treatment, despite the fact that Manning was directly asked about the conditions of his detention, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had expressed verbal concern about these issues and that administration officials who visited him had discussed the issues with him and stated that they would be addressed, but had not recorded them in writing.
"They wrote down 'there are no problems' (after discussing my complaints), but that doesn't mean I didn't bring it up in the conversation," Manning says.
A military judge, Colonel Denise Lindh, also asked Manning why he had not complained about his mistreatment in January 2011 during a meeting of a commission that considered suicidal intentions that he had expressed in writing a few months earlier.
Manning replied that during that meeting he wanted to get the "injury prevention" removed and the conditions of detention relaxed.
Representatives of the military leadership explained that the limited regime of imprisonment - a level lower than the regime of supervision to prevent suicide - was introduced to protect the prisoner, as well as for the safety of others.
"I wanted to let the administration know that I was fine so that they would lift the injury prevention regime ... to improve the standard of my life, from my point of view," Manning explained.
On Thursday, Manning testified about his arrest in Iraq and transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months, before being transferred to a prison at a naval base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He reported that he had suicidal thoughts in Kuwait and that he had once lost consciousness due to extreme heat.
He explained that psychologically it is very difficult when you are not allowed to know how your fate is being decided, and what is happening in the outside world.
"My world has shrunk to camp Arifjan, to the size of my prison," Manning said Thursday.
"I thought I was going to die in that cage."
While in Quantico, Manning, he said, spent most of his time in a small cell — at least 21 hours, and often even more than 23 hours a day — all alone.
Manning reports that he was allowed to leave only a mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, several items of clothing and glasses.
He says he tried to move, as sleeping or even just lying down during the daytime was forbidden by the rules.
According to Manning, while sleeping, he was constantly hit in the eyes by light penetrating from outside the camera.
If the guards did not see his face when he rolled over in bed at night, he said he was awakened and forced to roll over on his back.
Manning's attorney filed a formal objection to Manning's mistreatment in January 2011.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
Also on Friday, a judge questioned Manning about a statement he made while testifying Thursday that after being forced to sleep naked in his cell in Quantico one night, he was forced to stand naked in front of guards and other inmates at a morning check."
Manning said he was unable to cover himself with a blanket during the inspection.
Responding to questions from a judge on Friday, Manning said he understood from a security guard's order that he had to throw a blanket he could cover for, but admitted that no one had directly ordered him to throw it.
On Thursday, Manning said he had been forced to sleep naked the previous night because of his attempt to show the officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning said he told the officer he could have used a rubber band of panties or flip-flops to injure himself, but did not.
That night, Manning testified, his underwear, flip-flops and glasses were taken from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account what he had to endure during his imprisonment and significantly reduce his sentence if Manning is found guilty by a military court, which is due to begin hearing his case early next year.
The defense said it plans to ask Manning to plead guilty to less serious crimes and challenge other charges as excessive.
A resumption of hearings is scheduled for this weekend, with the prosecution expected to insist that conditions of detention have been justified.
The Pentagon claims that Manning was held in Quantico under the rules governing the detention of those arrested with the strictest possible regime.
Among the charges brought against Manning are aiding the enemy, illegally facilitating the publication of data on the Internet, transmitting information related to national defense, and stealing state property or documents.
If convicted on all counts of the indictment, he could face life in prison.
My crisis of national identity is the story of a Mexican-American.
According to the author, many Mexicans were forced to leave Mexico due to the lack of opportunities to realize themselves.
Mexicans tend to blame those who left because they remind the country's residents of difficult times.
Ruben Navarette believes that Mexicans of American descent are torn between the two cultures.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I walked through the arrivals corridor, approached the border control zone and froze in place.
The signs indicated two queues: one for Mexicanos (Mexicans), the second for Extranjeros (foreigners).
I stood in front of them for a few seconds, not knowing where to go.
I grew up in central California, and I've been called a Mexican all my life.
It's just a conventional name, just like my friends in Boston call themselves Irish, and my friends in New York call themselves Italians.
Later, I settled on the complex "Mexican American" design.
But here I was in Mexico.
Here, in my grandfather's homeland, there was no need for conventional names or complex designs.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to ask questions or answer them.
But my vocabulary is poorer than that of native speakers, and I can't get rid of the American accent.
So I pulled out my American passport and got in line for Extranjeros.
I remembered this story a few days ago, when Mexico's newly elected President, Enrique Peña Nieto, visited the White House and met with President Obama.
On the agenda were the usual issues for the meetings of the presidents of these countries: immigration, drugs and trade.
President Peña Nieto was eager to talk about the boom of the Mexican economy, thanks to which Mexicans would now, with the same success, be able to stay in Mexico, instead of moving to the United States.
He wants to conclude a partnership agreement with the United States and Canada and create a kind of North American trade bloc like the European Union.
In addition, President Peña Nieto promised to continue the war against drug cartels in Mexico, but no specific proposals were made.
For Mexico, relations with the United States are a difficult and old-age issue.
Most Americans never thought about the fact that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and, at gunpoint, forced its leaders to give up half of their territory.
But Mexicans think for centuries, not minutes, and see reminders of those events in everything.
Therefore, as soon as any US statesman mentions at least a word of criticism in the direction of Mexico, complaints are immediately heard in the press and among the elite of Mexican society that Americans encroach on the sovereignty of neighbors.
And montezuma's descendants are filled with militancy.
Mexico's relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the U.S. is the most complicated.
Want to talk about grievances?
There are enough of them.
In Mexico, there are winners and losers, people who find opportunities for themselves in this country, and those for whom there are no such opportunities.
In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, there are so many people of Mexican descent for one reason only: at some point in their family history, someone – father or grandfather – did not have the opportunity to realize themselves in Mexico and was forced to go north.
Most often they were Mexicans of a certain type - dark-skinned, poorly educated, from poor peasant families.
We are their descendants, and we remember that.
In Mexico, they see it differently.
Today, our lives are the embodiment of the American dream, we studied in good schools and got good jobs, but we will not forget that even this dream is American, not Mexican.
Our national identity is confusing and unclear, but we know which country to consider our own.
United States of America.
In addition, we know that most members of the Mexican elite and the ruling class do not like us.
We respond to them in kind.
They see us as a reminder of humiliating defeats and treat us as second-class citizens, as fake Mexicans.
We don't speak Spanish well enough and our ties with Mexico aren't strong enough.
Our very existence for them is explained by failures.
If our ancestors had succeeded in Mexico, they wouldn't have left.
We wouldn't be behind a silk curtain right now, finding a well-fed life in the U.S. but losing our spiritual connections.
My wife was born in Guadalajara and legally moved to the U.S. as a child, and it reminds me that there are certain tensions between real Mexicans and Mexican Americans — Mexicans have a clearer understanding of their national identity, and Mexican Americans are offended.
She is a U.S. citizen and believes she belongs to both of these countries.
At the same time, many Mexican Americans I know don't feel like they belong to any of them.
We listen to the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but we also love Bruce Springsteen.
By getting the best of both worlds, you inevitably lose your roots.
In Mexico, we are Americans.
And in the U.S., they call us Mexicans.
Now, as I found out during my trip, as if our relations are already not complicated enough, some Mexican leaders and intellectuals want to restore relations with the diaspora.
They want Mexican-Americans to serve as sorts of Ambassadors for Mexico and represent its interests in the U.S.
We could tell our American friends what a beautiful country it is and how great it is to visit it, and we could persuade political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yeah, absolutely.
It won't work.
Too many grievances in the past.
And given the gap between rich and poor, rampant corruption and drug trafficking, many of us do not consider this country to be so beautiful.
Sorry, but deal with it yourself, Amigos.
And rightly so.
If some Mexicans still can't forgive the United States for what it did to Mexico a century and a half ago, they will have to accept the fact that some Mexican Americans are still offended by the way their relatives were treated in Mexico as recently as possible.
Yes.
Perhaps we have more in common than I thought.
Old Battles in the New Middle East
Ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas could be a fragile foundation for further peace
Is long-term peace between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East possible?
Another round of bloodshed leads to the conclusion that such hopes are futile.
There are familiar, pointless arguments about who started first; many buildings have been reduced to rubble; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis were killed; For the first time in the conflict, rockets fired from the Gaza Strip landed in the vicinity of Israel's capital, Tel Aviv, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
However, despite the fact that Israelis and Palestinians are hopelessly bogged down in their eternal conflict, change has come to the Middle East.
This can be treated in different ways, but the events of the "Arab Spring" swirled many established realities in the rebellious storm, and the Palestinians and the Israelis failed to stay away from the whirlwind that shook the region.
Perhaps as a result, their struggles will become even bloodier than before.
However, there are reasons that give hope for a way out of this deadly impasse.
War without winners
At first glance, the current situation does not give reason for optimism.
Even if the ceasefire, which was signed on November 21, is implemented, this week's clashes have only strengthened the position of security forces on both sides.
Leaders of the Islamist Hamas movement, which came to power in the Gaza Strip in 2007, will claim that they forced Israel to retreat despite the losses they suffered.
Despite the fact that some of the group's leaders have been killed and 1.7 million people trapped in one of the most populous and troubled corners of our planet, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is increasing its popularity in the West Bank, another Palestinian territory now controlled by the more moderate Fatah movement.
Moreover, Hamas leaders may well conclude that time is working for them.
As the influence of Islamist movements grows in the Arab world, Hamas has new influential and wealthy friends.
Resurgent regional leader Turkey, which was once Israel's closest ally among Muslim countries, has come out in support of Hamas; its example was followed by Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamically developing states in the Persian Gulf.
Triumphant Hamas supporters claim to have created an Islamist crescent around Israel, from Lebanon in the north, ruled by the militant group Hezbollah, to Syria, where increasingly pro-Islamist rebels are about to overthrow the rule of Bashar al-Assad, and further to Jordan, where the king's authority is threatened by Hamas allies.
The most significant shift in the balance of power in the region occurred on Israel's southern borders, in the most populous and important Arab country, Egypt, where the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood movement has strengthened under President Mohammed Morsi.
Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years and was overthrown in 2011, was a secular dictator who paid little attention to supporting Hamas.
The Muslim Brotherhood, by contrast, is an organization much like Hamas, and its leaders are more prone to populism.
In future diplomatic alignments, Hamas may become a significant player whose voice cannot be silenced even by Israel and America.
At the same time, hardliners in Israel will come to the opposite conclusions.
Militarily, Hamas has been defeated.
Israel's Iron Dome anti-missile system justified the cost of its creation and successfully destroyed many of the rockets launched by Hamas.
Israeli citizens can sleep soundly, at least for a while.
On diplomacy, the U.S. has remained true to its unchanged position; many European countries have also blamed Hamas for starting the latest round of violence.
Another important factor is Israel's economic prosperity, especially under the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, who largely ignored the peace process.
Although approximately 30 Israelis have been killed by rockets fired from the Gaza Strip since 2004, Israel has managed to minimize the problem of suicide bombers, in part by a wall that enters the West Bank – a large part of the unrecognized Palestinian state – and protects Jewish settlements that continue to expand despite the illegality of such actions under international law.
The position of Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party – in preparation for the January 22 elections – has teamed up with even more aggressive conservatives under the leadership of Avigdor Lieberman, is very convenient.
What's the point of pandering to the Palestinians and giving them their own state?
If they put all the power in the West Bank in their hands, won't they launch rockets from there toward Israel, as their brethren in the Gaza Strip do?
It is better to keep them behind the wall and firmly suppress any attempts to raise their heads.
Hardliners may win; however, their calculations can be refuted by the Arab Spring.
Despite the fact that the Islamists who come to power in Egypt and other countries do not have the warmest feelings towards Israel, their priority will be internal problems.
The defense portion of Israel's budget is larger than that of all of its Arab neighbors combined.
Unleashing a war with a regional superpower is unlikely to help Arab governments strengthen their own economies.
The pragmatism of Egyptian President Morsi, who worked with Barack Obama on the cease-fire, is a good sign and could mark the beginning of change.
Israel, no less, must consider the long-term consequences of its policies.
As democratic change emerges in Arab countries, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination is a ticking time bomb that will sooner or later explode in Israeli-occupied territories, like the bus blown up in Tel Aviv this week.
Repression is already undermining the foundations of the democratic order in the Jewish state, and the demographic dimension – the growth of the Arab population – only exacerbates these problems.
The bloody operations that take place every few years in the Gaza Strip to suppress Hamas come at a cost with growing discontent among the international community.
Both sides need external momentum.
What remains is the only solution that sensible representatives on both sides, as well as much of the rest of the world and our newspaper, tirelessly call for: the formation of two states and Israel's ceding of territory in exchange for security.
There remains hope, not too impressive in the short term, that a ceasefire will allow other countries to influence the parties to the conflict more effectively.
Egypt, which is long overdue to cut off arms shipments to the Gaza Strip, as well as Turkey and Qatar, are in a better position than ever to persuade Hamas to recognize the borders of the Jewish state, adopted since 1967 in view of the exchange of territories and the sharing of Jerusalem.
Other Arab countries should also work to reconcile Hamas and Fatah.
This would do more to create a Palestinian state than the upcoming UN vote, which could result in recognition of Palestine's virtual statehood.
President Obama also has a role to play in bringing Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term, he never presented his own peace plan.
Since returning to the White House, he has remained reluctant to engage in the issue.
This is a catastrophically short-sighted position.
The United States has a vital interest in stability in the Middle East.
This is only possible in the case of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
In Australia, the law on uniform packaging for cigarettes came into force.
Warnings about the dangers of smoking and images of disease-affected parts of the body stand out in contrast on dull green boxes, the same for all brands of cigarettes.
The first in the world practice, the Australian law on the same type of packaging of cigarettes and tobacco products came into force, replacing the logos and color design of different brands with the same box of dull olive color with terrible pictures of body parts affected by the disease and images of children whose health was undermined by the smoking of their parents.
In addition to various pictures and inscriptions warning about the dangers of smoking, the only difference between the packs, introduced mandatorily from this Saturday, is the names of stamps that are printed in the same small print.
These are the harshest conditions in the world for the design of packages of tobacco products.
Australia's federal government says the purpose of the measure is to deter young people from smoking by depriving this bad habit of fashion status.
The basis of this decision was the results of studies that showed that people who did not start smoking before the age of 26, in 99 cases out of 100, never become smokers.
"It is obvious that even at a very young age, children understand the meaning that tobacco companies are trying to convey with the help of packaging design," explains Health Minister Tanja Plibersek, referring to studies that have shown that, for example, the crown in the logo is associated in children with the idea of a princess.
Australia is one of the countries with the lowest proportion of smokers in the world, so these changes will not particularly affect the profits of transnational corporations, but other countries are already considering the possibility of taking similar measures.
Representatives of the tobacco industry strongly opposed the adoption of this law.
Tobacco companies argue that this will only increase the share of the black market on which cheap and affordable cigarettes will be sold.
"This law will lead to serious consequences, different from those conceived by its initiators," said Scott McIntyre, a representative of British American Tobacco in Australia.
Manufacturers of counterfeit products from China and Indonesia will supply many more such goods for sale on the streets of Australia.
For some, on the contrary, the new laws contribute to the growth of business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family-owned company, argues that demand for cigarette cases and silicone cases that hide unpleasant pictures on the packaging has grown rapidly (almost from scratch) since two months ago companies such as British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a case in an Australian high court where they tried to appeal the law.
According to Sandra Ha, Zico has already sold about six thousand products to wholesalers and expects a new batch.
It's good business for us.
A potential obstacle to the effectiveness of such measures is, according to experts, the popularity of social networks among the very part of the population to which these measures are directed.
Following the passage of a number of laws in Australia that made cigarette television advertising and support illegal and their support for sporting events, as well as prohibiting sellers from displaying cigarettes in a prominent place, tobacco advertising has moved to the Internet.
The Australian government has banned local companies and websites from advertising online, but it cannot restrict foreign sites from doing so.
"If you're selling tobacco products and you're left with just this small loophole, the idea of promoting your product online will seem extremely tempting," explains Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman notes an increase in the number of reviews of trademarks written on behalf of supposedly ordinary users on social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
The question arises - is this really the work of an ordinary citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes so much that he spared no effort and made a video, or is there an advertising company behind it?
The Australian branch of British American Tobacco claims that the industry is now more busy adapting to the new rules than advertising.
The tobacco industry has even taken measures such as sponsoring Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules: these states are making claims under the World Trade Organization, claiming that trade has been unfairly restricted, despite the fact that the trade relations of all these countries with Australia are very insignificant.
The WTO decision is expected by mid-2013.
According to Tanya Plibersek, the government has discussed with other countries the possibility of adopting similar packaging laws.
In 2001, Canada was the first to introduce mandatory placement of photos warning about the dangers of smoking.
Now this rule is adopted in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The possibility of tightening laws is being considered in the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia defiantly disobey innovation.
These pictures don't bother me.
I just don't pay attention.
"You just grab a cigarette and hide the pack in your pocket," explains Victor El Hague, who buys cigarettes with a photo of a tumor of the oral cavity on a pack.
Honestly, the only thing that can make me quit is my little girl.
James Yu, head of the King of the Pack tobacco shop in central Sydney, argues that the same packaging has made it more difficult to arrange goods on the shelves.
"It used to take me an hour to unload a new batch, but now it's four hours," he complains.
"The government should have banned cigarettes altogether, we would have said, 'What to do, okay, it's over, close the store,'" he says, throwing his hands up.
Being bored in the world of electronic networks and constant connections is not such a bad thing.
On this Thanksgiving, I suddenly had to spend five hours at the airport because our plane had a mechanical problem and was replaced by another plane that we were waiting for.
So I had plenty of time to think about the nature of boredom.
I won't lie to you.
Half a day at the airport waiting for a flight is really boring, and neither books, nor magazines, nor iPhones, nor even duty-free shops will help here.
Recently, however, more and more scientists and specialists in child development speak in favor of boredom.
They say that in certain situations, it's not so bad for us and our children to be bored.
This forces the brain to be distracted by interesting related topics, which perhaps contributes to creativity.
And since in today's world we are all constantly in front of some kind of screen, the benefits of boredom pass us by.
Maybe we should strive for boredom?
Yes.
And at the same time, no.
We'll come back to that.
I used to believe, like many, that boredom was an invention of relatively recent times, when people had more free time.
This is not the case, argues Peter Toohey, a professor of Greek and Roman history at Canada's University of Calgary and author of Boredom: A Lively History (Yale University Press, 2011).
"Boredom actually boasts a very ancient history," he says.
On the walls in Pompeii, Latin inscriptions about boredom dating back to the first century have been found.
That being said, it remains an open question about how we understand boredom.
The problem, says John D. Eastwood, an associate professor at York University in Ontario, Canada, is that understanding and seeing boredom has often changed.
After studying the research materials on this topic and asking a question to a target group of 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the following definition: boredom is when people "want, but cannot do something that would bring them satisfaction."
The difference between boredom and apathy, he says, is that a bored person doesn't do something they'd like to do.
With apathy, you don't want to do anything.
Central to the boredom experienced, he says, is "the disruption of attention and the associated deterioration in mood and the feeling that time drags on slowly."
By description, boredom may seem very similar to depression.
However, Professor Eastwood argues that despite the possible connection between these conditions, bored people see the causes of problems in the world and circumstances around them, and people experiencing depression see problems in themselves.
Sometimes we feel bored when in fact it's just hard for us to focus on something.
In their study, "The Unoccupied Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention," published in the September issue of the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Prof. Eastwood and colleagues refer to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a recording of a voice reading a journal.
Some participants also heard the loud sounds of an irrelevant television program turned on in the next room, others heard the same sounds at a low volume so that they could barely be made out, and a third group listened only to a voice recording without an extraneous audio track.
Those participants who heard a low-volume TV noted that they were bored, more often than others - they had difficulty concentrating, but they did not know the reason for this and attributed it to boredom.
When we're trying to focus on a difficult or exciting task, interrupting attention can cause boredom, says Mark J. Smith. Fenske is an associate professor of neurology at the University of Guelph, Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when we do something uninteresting, "like peering into the flow of products on an assembly line looking for marriage, distracting music can help avoid boredom."
It is believed, he continues, that when people start swaying in a chair or drawing doodles on a piece of paper, they do it out of boredom, but now we know that in fact such actions simply help not to relax physically.
"The study showed that children who are not forbidden to fidget and twirl learn better and remember more information than children who are required to sit still," says Professor Fenske.
At some points, we all experience boredom: when the flight is delayed (as in my case), listening to a monotonous speech, watching an uninteresting film.
However, different people show varying degrees of propensity for boredom.
In the 1980s, to measure such individual characteristics, researchers developed a special "boredom bias scale."
To determine the score on such a scale, questions and statements are used, for example, "Much of what I have to do is monotonous and monotonous" or "I am too much interesting, so there is not enough time for anything."
Using such questionnaires, the researchers determined that boys were bored more often than girls, says Stephen Vodanovic, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially in the presence of a variety of external stimuli.
However, in general, teenagers in general are often bored.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of personality and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he used a pager to contact nearly 400 teens and their parents 7 to 8 times a day.
He got the following results: 32% of teenagers said that they were bored at school and while doing homework, and 23% said that they were bored outside of school.
At the same time, only 3% of parents noted that they are bored.
Professor Larson notes that he has no data on what such data on boredom would be now, 21 years later.
However, he knows that "adolescence is the peak of the tendency to boredom," mainly because children and adolescents are not allowed to fully decide what to do.
Back to my original question: Is boredom helpful?
Sometimes not, because in extreme manifestations, it can, as research shows, push people to absurd and dangerous physical actions, risky gambling or abuse of certain substances in an attempt to get rid of boredom.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers have thought about the connection between boredom and creativity, says Professor Vodanovic, who has devoted more than two decades to studying this problem.
"So our brain tells us that we should do something else; that's boredom," says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at New York University.
However, this same brain does not always know what exactly is better to do.
If you get bored and direct that energy to guitar playing or culinary experiments, you'll make yourself a better person.
However, if you start watching TV, you will only get better for a while, and that will soon pass.
So if your child gets bored and you give him an iPad, he will stop getting bored, but he will not learn to fight boredom on his own or in any other way to manage his time and employment, says Professor Fenske.
"And such self-regulatory skills are used in a variety of situations," he argues.
Your child learns not only to engage himself in something on his own, he also learns self-control in general.
I don't think boredom should be celebrated in any way.
However, it should not be considered something bad either.
Rather, one should learn to feel comfortable even outside of the continuous flow of action and technology.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"What we see is that we need to experience boredom more often, even though boredom is an extremely unpleasant, unquenchable desire to do something meaningful," he says.
In fact, people tend to somehow disconnect from constant worries and just relax.
"In today's world, we're used to constant overstimulation of the senses," he says, "and when there's silence, we get lost and don't know what to do."
It is not yet clear how the new law on the legalization of marijuana in colorado will be applied.
Anthony Orozco, a nineteen-year-old soccer player and community college student in southeastern Colorado, is charged with a felony that will soon be perfectly legal throughout the state: possession of a small portion of marijuana and the pipe in which he smoked it.
Mr. Orozco said that one september he and his friends were in Lamara and were driving in a car on the prairie near the border with Kansas when they were stopped by police.
After a police officer found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco received a subpoena for drug possession and possession of a drug use device — minor offenses, each of which is owed a $100 fine — and a court date has been set.
"We are treated like criminals," Mr. Orozco said.
But is he a criminal?
As a result of the uncertainty that has been going on for weeks since colorado voted to legalize the use of marijuana in small quantities for entertainment, the resolution of hundreds of small court cases depends not so much on the law as on the place of consideration.
Marijuana-related felony charges have already been dropped in hundreds of cases here and in Washington state, which has taken a similar measure.
Police stations have already stopped bringing charges against people aged 21 and older for possession of small doses, which will be considered legal once the law comes into force in a couple of weeks.
However, in more conservative Colorado counties, prosecutors have decided to try existing marijuana-related cases and are still being prosecuted for possession of the drug.
At the same time, some cities from the suburbs of Denver to the mountainous regions of the West are voting to prevent the emergence of new, state-licensed marijuana stores in their places.
"It's all developing so rapidly that I don't even know what to expect next," says Daniel J. Smith. Oates, police chief in Aurora Township east of Denver.
Regulators in Washington state are also scratching their heads puzzled.
They will have to form rules to determine the procedure for licensing the cultivation, processing, distribution and sale of marijuana, and all this must be done before December 1, 2013.
They say Colorado, for better or worse, is ahead of most other states in regulating marijuana use, first for medical purposes and now for entertainment.
"Colorado has a more streamlined market, so they'll serve as a good example," said Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the Washington State Alcohol Regulatory and Marketing Board.
But now no one can do more, Mr. Smith admits, than put forward some proposals and hope that it will work.
"We don't have a real precedent that we can target," he says.
The Washington state bill, called I-502, will go into effect on Dec. 6 and will plunge the state into a state of uncertainty for a whole year, when there is no state licensing system yet, and the right to own marijuana is already legalized.
And there are still difficult technical aspects that need to be solved during this period, for example, how to find a balance between the state's order for "adequate access" to licensed marijuana with a ban on its sale at a distance of 1,000 feet from schools, parks, playgrounds and kindergartens.
"It will be particularly difficult to locate licensed marijuana businesses within cities, particularly in Seattle and its suburbs," explains Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the newly created marijuana legalization research group.
On Nov. 21, Chief Constable Oates of Aurora sent an email to his subordinates stating that the city attorney's office would no longer prosecute 21-year-olds for possession of small amounts of marijuana, and that police were ceasing to convict people of these violations "from now on."
Chief Of Police Oates said police would monitor the city's compliance with the rules governing the activities of persons growing marijuana for medical purposes and would prosecute illegal drug dealers and distributors.
The attorney for Weld County in northern Colorado, Ken Buck, presents a stricter approach to the matter.
After the vote on the bill, he said prosecutors would continue to prosecute marijuana possession, mainly to encourage those who use it to undergo treatment.
At the moment, 119 individuals are charged with possession of two or fewer ounces of marijuana, although many of them are accused of other violations.
"It is the responsibility of our institution to prosecute acts that are considered criminal at the time they are committed," Mr. Buck said in a statement.
The reaction has been mixed even in places like Mesa Rural County, where voters rejected a proposal to legalize marijuana.
Police at Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, are no longer prosecuting adults for possession of a small amount of the drug.
District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supported the decision, but also decided not to drop charges in already open cases related to marijuana possession.
"I believe that it is our direct responsibility to enforce the law until it changes," he says.
Despite the fact that 55% of Colorado residents who took part in the vote supported this decision, the inclusion of marijuana for entertainment in the state and legal system will not be easy.
And the contradictory reaction of residents in different parts of the state has exposed the ambiguity of the attitude of local authorities to the state's experiment with marijuana.
"District attorneys have a cultural barrier to this," said Sean McAllister, a Denver attorney representing marijuana convictions and a local spokesman for the National Organization for Marijuana Law Reform.
"They've been chasing people for this for so long that they can't really accept that it's no longer a crime," he says.
Colorado and Washington — the first states in which small amounts of marijuana are treated in the same way as alcohol — are destined to become an experimental field on a national scale to test the very idea of legalizing drugs.
Supporters of legalization and state officials plan to expand the territory of legalized trade, but at the same time they are waiting with caution from the federal authorities, who still plan to consider the sale and cultivation of marijuana as a federal crime.
Proponents of marijuana legalization hope the Justice Department will concede on the issue.
Despite several high-profile arrests of medical marijuana traffickers and patients, the federal government has in most cases given the go-ahead for the sale of marijuana for medical purposes in Colorado, Washington, and 16 other states.
Drug Enforcement Bureau agents are unlikely to break into homes to confiscate a small bag of marijuana, but they are unlikely to turn a blind eye to state-regulated recreational marijuana stores that are allowed under the new law, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former drug adviser in the Obama administration.
Some cities in Colorado did not wait for federal action.
Even before the presidential election, some local administrations approved a moratorium on the opening of new marijuana stores, which would not have been able to open earlier than a year later.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the western part of the state, put forward a six-month ban on the marijuana trade, which is likely to be approved next week.
"We don't want to be in a position where we're going to give someone a license and then it's going to cause serious problems at the federal level," says Bob Nicholson, a city council member.
Our city voted against this amendment.
And now we have a contradiction between the results of the local vote and what the state voted for.
There are still many outstanding issues.
Petronella Wyatt: I was expelled from Oxford for being a conservative.
The persecution of university students for their views did not begin today.
For as long as I can remember, I've always dreamed of going to Oxford University.
My father and older brother studied at Oxford and described it as the best educational institution in the world, the modern analogue of the ancient symposium, laying the two foundations of civilization - free thinking and tolerance.
And yet, after two weeks of studying history at Worcester College, Oxford University in the late eighties, I packed my bags and left, which resulted in the first real scandal in my life.
My father couldn't stand it and started crying.
Friends were confused.
The Evening Standard claimed that I dropped out of college because I didn't like my classmates having sex in the next room.
Writer E. Norman Wilson joked that I left because I had to drink from chipped cups.
It wasn't really that funny.
I ran away.
Yes, I ran away because I was systematically bullied and intimidated.
Not because of my rather unusual name or the fact that I went to a private school.
I was bullied for only one reason, and in this glorious cradle of enlightenment it looked like real barbarism and blind fanaticism: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a famous adviser to Margaret Thatcher, and I myself was a supporter of conservatives.
You may ask, why remember this now?
According to the latest data, a new generation of students who hold center-right views are subjected to the same harassment.
This institutionalised and ever-growing hatred of Conservative students at Oxford is so strong that last week a group of such students demanded the same protection of their rights as that granted to disabled people, sexual and ethnic minorities.
Conservatives at corpus Christi College's student club in Cambridge say they are "often actively isolated, personally attacked and made to feel unwanted" because of their political views.
They want to bring an additional representative to the college's equal rights committee to ensure freedom of expression.
Their situation was only exacerbated by the recent BBC 2 documentary about student politics, Wonderland: The Young, the Smart and the Right, which portrayed conservatives as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
The film featured Joe Cook, a former president of the Oxford University Conservatives Association, who rides in a Rolls-Royce, wears a silver suit and a cane with a silver knob.
At other universities, conservative students complain that they are being made "scapegoats because of higher tuition fees."
Luke Black, 20, vice-president of the Conservative Association at the University of Nottingham, said in an interview with a Sunday newspaper that "there is a growing bias towards the left in the university environment.
People who don't even know us think of us in advance as brazen and violent children of wealthy parents with impunity."
Samuel Roberts, 21, a history student at Corpus Christie College, where the petition for increased protections was filed, calls the atmosphere "uncomfortable", and Stephanie Cherill, 19, the new president of the Conservatives Association at the University of Oxford, says that the attitude of student club members towards carriers of center-right views has deteriorated significantly.
"This is a threat both to the atmosphere of intellectual discussion and simply to the normal life of club members," she says.
For the first few weeks at Oxford, I wasn't just in the minority, I was alone.
I went there in September 1986, a timid and shy eighteen-year-old girl.
Oxford was feverish with hatred of the Conservative Party.
A year earlier, the university had stripped former student Margaret Thatcher of her honorary degree by a vote due to budget cuts to higher education.
In such an atmosphere, even the Stalinists would be uncomfortable.
In the early days of freshman week, when students get to know each other and the teachers, I felt for the first time what lay ahead of me.
I didn't know yet that teachers not only turned a blind eye to the harassment of conservative students, but they were also happy to take part in it.
Political issues – a miners' strike, privatisation and the government's refusal to sanction the apartheid government in South Africa – permeated the wood-panelled walls of the classrooms.
In my first seminar, I needed to translate an eighteenth-century French text into English, and I wasn't prepared for what followed.
"Miss Wyatt," said the teacher, the late Harry Pitt, "please translate the first paragraph."
The text was hard for me, I stammered.
Harry Pitt was a very gallant man with a face that looked like a cake.
"Thatcherists fundamentally don't learn French or do they just lack brains?" he asked.
Other students giggled.
I had tears in my eyes.
"I advise you to take a few initial French lessons in your spare time, unless, of course, you are very busy spinning in society," Pitt said.
I went back to my room completely miserable.
That night in college, I was sitting alone at lunch; then someone patted me on the shoulder.
It was James, a second-year English student who introduced himself as a member of the University's Conservative Association.
"I know who you are," he said friendly.
- Unfortunately, this is as follows:
Anyone suspected of sympathizing with conservatives will be bullied.
It's not easy for me, and in your case, they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it will be more difficult for you.
Most Conservative freshmen pretend to be Labour."
Later, at a local pub, I cowardly tried to be hypocritical.
I insisted that I didn't agree with everything Margaret Thatcher said.
The ruse failed.
A freshman in philosophy, politics and economics, who himself studied at Eton, said: "You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You're contagious."
Other students picked up on his words.
I was spoiled, dirty.
"How do conservatives have sex? One of them asked.
"They're stabbing each other, right?"
I felt the way homosexuals must have felt before the decriminalization in the sixties.
Will I ever be able to live a normal life in Oxford?
Or will I have to meet like-minded people only under the cover of night?
Will I be forced to become Labour and hide my true beliefs?
The next three years began to seem like hell to me, full of persecution and loneliness.
The only professor in my college who did not hide his conservative views was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history.
He was hated not only for being conservative, but also for being Thatcher's foreign policy adviser and one of her speechwriters.
He hardly appeared in college.
He despised him for his provincialism, pettiness, and adherence to the Marxist-Deterministic view of history.
In 1997, he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You're not going to be happy here," he told me.
I began to travel to Oxford from my parents' house in London, trying to find refuge among relatives and unbiased metropolitan friends.
I told my father I hated Oxford and explained the reason.
He didn't believe me.
During his studies in the forties, any political views were accepted there.
"But it's the best university in the world," he said plaintively.
- They can't do that there, just not in a city of slumbering spires...
Even my communist friends have always behaved flawlessly."
His moist eyes became cloudy.
"Don't make hasty decisions.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
You're going to break my heart if you drop out of university."
I was exhausted from the constant travel to London and my emotional defense was waning.
My friend, also a conservative, could not stand the pressure and abandoned his beliefs.
The following week, during a seminar, when another history teacher called me an "enemy of the people" quite seriously, I decided to do the same.
Burning with shame, I confessed that "my parents brainwashed me" and called them "old fools."
The respite was short-lived.
The final nail in the coffin of my oxford career was destined to be hammered by my father.
At that time, he wrote two columns every week for publications owned by Rupert Murdoch.
My door was locked.
I didn't come out, and five minutes later my pursuers surrendered.
When they left, I packed my suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me a crybaby and a rag.
But at eighteen, no one should be the object of such anger and intimidation in an educational institution.
It is all the more sad because it was Oxford, which not only produced fourteen Tory prime ministers, but to this day hides behind the undeserved reputation of a university that values equality and free thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to fame"
About the exhibition "Valentino: The Master of Sewing", which opened this week in London, ABC talks with Nati Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemitz and other famous clients of the Italian designer
Somerset House, the former residence of Queen Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
The designer acknowledged this during the opening of Valentino: The Master of Sewing, a triumphant retrospective exhibition that brings together more than 130 haute couture dresses created by his "home" over the past 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his unique Italian accent.
This exhibition is the final part of the story, the only character of which is garavani's "il signoret", but it could not have been written without his eminent clients.
Valentino always felt fascinated by the rare and distant world of the nobility.
The first hall of this exhibition, open until March 3, is replete with personal letters and photographs signed by the most noble aristocrats, from Princess Salima Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, including Marie-Chantal, Princess of Greece, and Margaret, Princess of great Britain.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social uplift, from a humble tailor from the town of Voghera in northern Italy to the idol of the international "elite."
Being in love with the royal court is nothing wrong with that.
"They at least don't extinguish the cigarette butts of their cigarettes on your gorgeous carpet, as some fine pop stars do," says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemitz.
In the '60s and '70s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is an incomparable host and receives guests with generosity and elegance.
"We all really enjoyed visiting his chalet in Gstaad," explains Heini's ex-wife Thyssen, a close friend of forgotten beauties like Marella Agnelli or Eugenia Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to fame.
And despite this, he is a star.
Valeria Mazza, representing Valentino
Argentine model Valeria Mazza recalls the charismatic fashion designer.
One day we went to dinner at his house, it was after a fashion show in Piazza di Spagna in Rome, many years ago.
Among the twenty invitees were Sharon Stone and John F. Kennedy Jr.
Valentino's style manifested itself in everything - in every detail of his apartment, in its decoration, in food, in music.
"Valentino made each of the guests feel important and loved," recalls the "top model", whose work with the fashion designer began in 1995 during the Haute Couture Fashion Week in Paris.
"He never goes out of fashion because his sketches are real works of art," she concludes.
Pedigree Parade
Garavani's life is not a story of obsession, but of falling in love with full reciprocity.
He loves people with good upbringing and high titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a glamorous podium sixty meters in length, which offers a change of roles: the visitor takes the place of models and has to parade on the podium, contemplating the "spectators" of dreams that sparkle with masterpieces from Valentino, such as the dress that Jacqueline Kennedy chose for her wedding to Aristotle Onassis, the costume that Monica Vitti used in "Night", or a coat of wool and leather,  which belonged to Empress Farah Diba.
In this audience, such names as Sibylla of Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit from Norway, Rosario from Bulgaria or Sofia Habsburg shine from the models.
Nati Abascal and fashion designer, in 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentino is like a first love, "impossible to forget."
I remember it perfectly.
These were pants, a shirt, a "vest" and a jacket from the fall-winter collection of 1971-1972.
"It was a gift he gave me," says Nati Abascal, one of the designer's muses.
"I prefer him to others for his femininity, for his great love for women, because he emphasizes our beauty," adds the former Duchess de Feria.
I really like the colors he uses: they have a lot of light and they "fit" his face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess and trendsetter Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg also can't forget the first time she dressed in Valentino.
When I was a teenager living in Italy, I dreamed that I would have the age and reason to put on one of his evening toilets...
Finally that hour came in the late '90s.
I bought my first Valentino dress to wear to a feast in the castle of my cousin, Prince Edward de Ligne.
It was a red dress, with a skirt with ruffles, a pleated corsage and a strapless neckline.
"It was a dream that came true," says Rodrigo d'Arenberg's widow.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his passion is timeless," explains this Italian aristocrat, who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg keeps her festive dresses from the fashion designer with "the utmost care... because a dress is not just a dress, it is also a collection of memories that accompany it."
The "king" of fashion
The great finale of the exhibition at Somerset House is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress for her wedding to Pavlos from Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "girls" (as the fashion designer calls his seamstresses) to make this outfit of ivory silk with pearl inlay, twelve types of different laces and a train of four and a half meters.
According to journalist Susie Menkes, the greatest authority of the specialized press, the dress represents the milestone of high fashion of the late XX century, "the return of clients from the high society."
Drugged for many years by the "lifestyle" of the elite, now Valentino himself is its best representative.
Knight Grand Cross (insignia of the highest rank in Italy), Chevalier of Labor, Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters, awarded the Order of the Legion of Honor, Garavani collected as many honors as any of the spouses of his clients.
"My attention has always been drawn to his sophistication, his calmness, his neat and impeccable appearance," recalls d'Arenberg.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Musée d'Orsay.
He was sitting at a table with Countess Jacqueline de Ribe, a great friend of mine.
"He was immaculate, time doesn't exist for him."
If that's what the princess says...
The hardest profession in the world: miners from Kawah Ijen
For four euros, Indonesian miners risk their lives and health by dragging 70 kilograms of sulfur to the top of the volcano along steep rocky paths
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others literally work in hell.
Among them is Anto Vijaya, one of 400 miners who make their living extracting sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano, located in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
Every day, Anto descends to the very bottom of the crater, where sulfur dioxide rising from the depths of the Earth freezes on contact with air.
Breaking off huge pieces of sulfur, the total weight of which can reach 70 kg, he puts them in two bamboo baskets, puts baskets on his shoulders and carries them up along a steep rocky road.
The summit of the volcano, which is 2,386 meters high, is only 250 meters away, but it takes more than 40 minutes for exhausted movers to climb at a snail's pace, barely keeping their balance and carefully groping for the road so as not to stumble and fall off a cliff.
They know that one wrong step can cost them their lives, as happened to one tourist from France who fell off the cliffs of Kawah Ijen a few years ago.
Miners from Kawah Ijen earn 5 euro cents for every kilogram of sulfur they extract
Once at the top, they make their way between tourists who photograph them as if they were monkeys from a circus and, tiredly carrying heavy baskets, walk three kilometers to the scales, which the mining company placed a little higher, at an altitude of 1,850 meters.
We are talking about PT Kandy Ngrimbi, a company that has been operating this volcano since 1960 and, to say it better, its employees, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 euro cents) for each kilogram of sulfur.
It then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 euro cents) to petrochemical industries, because this mineral is common in everyday life and is used to make matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to bleach sugar.
"Since the norm is to carry 70 kilograms, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each walk," explains Anto, who usually performs three daily carriers.
He spends three hours on each of them and at the end feels overwhelmed, however, they allow him to accumulate 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) by the end of the day.
While this seems minuscule for such an inhuman effort, it is three times more than what he would earn in the field.
"Daily wages for miners are very high by local standards, where coffee is paid 15,000 rupees (€1.2) a day and an average monthly wage of two million rupees (€167)," explains a longshoreman who used to work as a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (€6.2) a day and the plot was not as heavy, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a town near the volcano, for a good reason that in Indonesia is as crushing as sera: "I married a girl from Bali, where there are some Hindus, and brought her to Java to convert to Islam."
Anto has asthma, he breathes with difficulty, constantly coughs, and his eyes are watery due to toxic gases.
At the age of 27, Anto spent three years risking himself in Kawah Ijen, whose sulfur had already begun to affect him despite the presence of a mask and special glasses.
He has asthma, he breathes hard, he coughs constantly, and his eyes water because of the toxic gases that the volcano emits.
This is the price he has to pay for achieving his dreams.
"I'll work for another two years because I want to open a shop or learn Spanish or French," he promises in more than acceptable English.
Punished by life, this pleasant and intelligent young man could be a tourist guide, a waiter or a hotel receptionist, but instead he does the work of a mule.
Sharing a dirty wooden hut with other porters, he gets up every day at two o'clock in the morning, because sulfur does not cease to flow out at night when its characteristic yellow color turns blue and shines among the darkness.
Defying the shadows, Anto descends into the crater, lighting his way with a small lantern connected to his helmet, which he himself bought with his own money.
About 400 porters pull baskets of sulfur on their shoulders from the bottom of a volcano.
Despite the high profits, the mining company has not mechanized sulphur mining to save costs and does not provide any equipment to porters who work at their own expense and with such deprivations.
In fact, they don't even get a fraction of the 30,000 rupees (€2.5) fee for photography, which, along with the entrance ticket for 15,000 rupees (€1.2), the guards of this reserve charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its mule people.
"This job is for livestock, not for people," said Badrusin, a stocky porter of 42 years who has spent three decades on Kawah Ijen since he left college.
Able to lift up to 110 kilograms, he says he will tolerate the job "as much as he can" because he needs money to educate his three children between the ages of 18 and 10.
I won't retire, I'll die here because the volcano is my whole life.
Although sulfur burns the throat and burns the eyes when the wind suddenly changes and catches the miners in the dense columns of smoke coming out of the volcano, they are so hardy that no one complains about their serious diseases ... more serious, obviously, than their usual breathing problems, arthrosis, knee pain and shoulder ulcers that deformed under the weight of baskets.
Balancing the basket on his back, Unainick can now only lift 50 pounds in his 53 years.
Every day, he and his comrades carry 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which three trucks transport to a warehouse in Tamansari, covering a distance of 18 kilometers along a narrow path among the thickets.
"I'm not retiring, I'm going to die here, because the volcano is my whole life," Unainik declares, opening his mouth wide, which is missing a few teeth.
Of his five children, the eldest, 30, also works as a sulfur carrier.
Time passes, but poverty perpetuates from generation to generation one of the most difficult occupations in the world: what human mules from Kawah Ijen do.
Singapore is looking for children to save the economy
Singaporeans blame careers, stress and housing and education prices for the absence of children.
"Singapore's population needs to grow."
I am a patriot husband, you are my wife a patriot, we will fulfill our civic duty and create life!
It may seem unbelievable that these lines are part of an advertisement for mint cakes, however, despite this – or perhaps because of it – this video became a hit on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
These phrases are part of a rap that uses local sayings like "Let's put a bao (loaf) in the oven" to make fun of Singapore's birth rate.
The advertising agency that made this video, BBH, cherishes the hope that with the help of advertising they will be able to draw attention to this problem in an entertaining form.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to harness the power of music to get people to fulfill "their national duty."
This thing is exclusively for the web, so we needed to make it fun and funny.
This is the main problem in the country.
We are the worst in the world in the reproduction of our own kind, so we felt that this is the topic that we should touch upon.
We knew that the government was trying to do a lot, such as launching perfumes with pheromones or organizing quick dating parties.
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but didn't necessarily work.
So we thought, why don't we do the most creative thing possible to solve this problem, which is rap?
1,2 children
Who doesn't take it so lightly is the singapore government.
It spends $1,300 a year on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
The state package for couples and parents provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and provides tax breaks.
But all this has low efficiency.
Singapore is a wealthy and high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leadership and its strict public scrutiny.
Singapore's birth rate, according to its National Population Authority, is currently at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was below 2 – what is known as the replacement percentage – was in 1976.
So why don't Singaporeans have more children?
Tang Wei Min, director of the Couples and Families Policy Division of the National Population Authority, said the reason for this was "improved education" and "a wider range of career opportunities."
"This has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities beyond getting married and starting a family," she explains.
These changes in social norms are contributing to the growth of the number of bachelors and the postponement of marriages and childbearing, as a result of which the birth rate in Singapore has decreased.
Meanwhile, immigration policies that aim to dramatically increase immigration to counter population decline are causing outrage among the local population.
There are websites in Singapore where barely concealed xenophobia is rampant against many new immigrants, especially Chinese, who have been criticized for keeping wages low and not wanting to integrate.
Rising immigration is also seen as one of the reasons Singapore's ruling party won its worst election result since independence last year.
After the elections, there was an attempt to solve the problem, with the help of quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While falling birth rates have a known impact on a nation's economic growth, tax revenues, medical spending, and immigration policy, singapore's example is also starting to have some unexpected consequences.
The government is making efforts not to build so many small housing.
For example, it has begun to affect the real estate sector.
The Urban Development Guide has moved to controlling the number of small apartments, known as "shoeboxes," that can be built in certain areas of the city.
This apartment of 46 square meters sells very well.
However, it is believed that they can promote a single lifestyle and discourage developers who want to build large family housing.
But Lim Yu Sun, CEO of housebuilding firm EL Developers, says their "shoeboxes" sell much faster than larger examples.
They are more popular, in the sense that such apartments are sold out for several days, even weeks, faster than larger apartments.
As a result, our cash inflows are increasing.
However, he acknowledges that the new rules provide clearer guidance to developers who used to be put in the way if they wanted to offer too many small apartments in the project.
Too overstretched
Singapore is a city-state.
While these new rules may be a step toward increasing the national birth rate, after talking to Singaporeans who work in the center's financial district, it seems like they won't have much of an effect.
"People are very overexertioned, housing is expensive, as well as education, and because of this, many people postpone it," says the young manager.
Other people may have children.
"But it's important for me to have my own money and time," says another young man in his 20s.
Men and women cite their careers, stress, and housing and education prices as reasons that prevent them from having children.
So, no matter how hard the government tries to encourage its citizens to have children, when it comes to childbearing, Singaporeans have the final say.
Personal offline - in person online
Confidentiality.
According to the dictionary of the Royal Academy of the Spanish Language, it is a property of the private or "sphere of private life that has the right to protect against any interference."
What is personal for a minor under the age of 16?
How does he apply this definition in his daily life and on social media?
Does he understand the dangers he faces when discussing situations on the Internet that he probably would not share outside the Internet?
elPeriódico interviewed five children between the ages of ten and 15, frequent netizens.
In four cases, they associated the term with "something very personal," and "password and username" when they applied it to social media.
"My biggest secrets I wouldn't upload to a post," says ten-year-old Jorge as he tries to explain the significance of personal on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he's had accounts for two years.
"These are very secret secrets, my mother may know them, but not the whole world," he says.
On FB, I upload beautiful pictures or pictures from games.
I also have fun with my friends.
"I wouldn't share a photo that isn't mine or someone who behaves stupidly," he says.
The boy realizes that it is bad to publish indecent photos of naked people, crimes or write offensive or violent comments.
Jorge says he knows 35 friends he has at FB and nine of his followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
The mother knows, she has a password to one of the accounts.
I started Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I just download them," he adds.
"Social media is entertainment, I can talk to distant relatives or to my friends quickly," he points out.
Without hesitation, he replies that he would never accept a request from an unfamiliar person.
I wouldn't reckon with anyone who would recommend it to a stranger.
The case of 14-year-old Jose is different.
This teenager has open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and in the latter admits that he does not know 20 people added to his friends list.
"It doesn't scare me because we have something in common, music, for example," he points out.
According to the boy, no one rubbed into his trust and did not ask for his home address or phone number.
"If they put pressure on me or demand them, I'll just remove them from my account," he admits.
Jose became a follower of Ask after reading the recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is no stranger to the experience of what is known today as cybermobbing.
An acquaintance of my friend was blackmailed on a social network.
He was threatened and extorted money.
"He never found out who it was," he said.
The victim, according to Jose, did not delete the account.
"Only enabled privacy".
It then explains the sequence of steps to configure the account in a secure manner.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would do it if I don't like the person or if I want to.
"Although I know it's cybermobbing," he confirms.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, an English teacher and education and training specialist, believes that in order to guide children and adolescents, you need to understand that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet has emerged as a means to find information, but with the advent of these sites, the rules of the game have changed," she notes.
Porras points out that Academic Mark Prensky, a master of pedagogy at Yale University and author of Digital Natives and Immigrants, invented these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital Natives are them, children and youth who were born in the age of technology.
"We're digital immigrants who have to teach them while we're still learning," she says.
He explains that this topic is complicated, "because we ask them to have a certain criterion for what can or cannot be distributed, published or said, at an age when maturity is not enough for this."
"Also for them to be selective, when the most important thing for them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," she adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to show what privacy is to children and adolescents is to ask questions that make them think.
"Telling them not to do it is useless," she adds.
Porras then lists some options: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, so why are you doing it online?
Or, would you like it if they published a photo of you like the one you posted about your friend?
Do you know what others post about you?
When you sign photos from parties, are you asking for permission from other people to tag them?
And one more thing, does everyone need to know what you're doing in every moment?
Another point is to let them know that they should behave online just like they do offline.
The rules are the same.
"Outside of the Internet, a person behaves with respect, responsibility and other principles, so it should be in social networks," she says.
Vigilance
Estuardo Guardia, a university lecturer, primary education professor and education consultant, explains the need for heads of households to read social media policies in good faith.
By understanding each of the points, they have good reason to talk to children about the background to opening an account online.
"For example, age and what is allowed to be distributed or published," he says.
According to Gaurdia, the key issue is to remind children of the lesson "don't talk to strangers."
UNASUR summit ends without promulgating the Lima Declaration
The VI Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) ended today in Peru without the promulgation of the Lima Declaration, announced earlier and theoretically signed by seven mandatory participants.
Efe repeatedly tried to gain access to the document signed at the SIXTH Ordinary Assembly of Heads of State and Government of UNASUR, but sources from the Office and The Presidential Administration indicated on the main page that it would be handed over after the closure, but then confirmed that at some point it would be published on the website of the Peruvian Government.
When asked about the text, they indicated that the contents had been presented by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, during brief press statements.
Journalists' access to information about the Summit was limited at all times.
During the day, only a video of the presidential assembly was broadcast in the press room without sound with the message "closed meeting, sound is prohibited."
A small amount of information circulating among reporters was passed on by spokespersons for some UNASUR governments present at the meeting, but not in Peru.
The only document distributed during the day was a list of participating presidents, angering hundreds of journalists from various national and international media outlets who asked for more information.
Subsequently, the Peruvian presidential administration sent an email to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but this is Umala's statement, not the official document that ended the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the Third Summit of South American and Arab Countries (ASPA), and that time, despite the fact that the press insisted on it, the so-called Lima Declaration, which was previously announced, was also not distributed.
On the official website of ASPA, you can check that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities tried to ensure that transmission systems were provided for all journalists, but limited the receipt of information as much as possible.
The summit also concluded with a joint decision by Chile and Peru to accept the verdict of the Hague Court, which will settle the territorial dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, gathered at a regional meeting and ratified that they would abide by the ruling of the International Court of Justice, which begins on Monday in The Hague to hear statements from both sides, as part of an indictment that Lima has brought against Santiago.
"We will abide by and enforce a decision that will clarify the differences that we are currently submitting to this international court," said Humala, alongside his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile has been, is and will be a country that respects international law, the peaceful resolution of differences, pacts and international tribunals," Piñera added, and greeted Humala with a handshake against the backdrop of the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation by both presidents that they would submit to the International Court of Justice came just after Colombia challenged this week the Pact of Bogotá, under which it recognized submission to the verdicts of that international court following a decision on maritime boundaries with Nicaragua that it considered erroneous.
The summit took place in the absence of Brazil's presidents, Dilma Rousseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chávez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, whose membership in UNASUR has been suspended since 2011 following the impeachment of its former president Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was responsible for opening the discussions in the morning and closing the summit, just after noon Lima time.
The head of state read the final document, in which he said that 16 agreements were adopted and the directions of action for 31 projects were approved among South American countries, the amount of proposed investments amounted to $ 17 billion.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the UNASUR countries will take "important steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, for which we are expanding residence agreements."
He said actions are being taken to improve "cooperation in the fight against citizens' insecurity and against organized transnational crime, actions to increase access to medicines, affordable Internet access in all corners of South America and taking into account the risks of natural disasters in an aggregate and effective manner."
As Europe is in crisis, "the economic unification (of Latin America) should not have a triumphant basis, but should serve to expand our productive base and foresee a better future for our cities," Humala added.
"We have decided to give privileges to a group of 31 landmark projects that will improve the connectivity of South American spaces, especially in village and border areas ... uniting our countries and forming new economic schemes," the Peruvian president said in a statement.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five belong to Peru, and are limited to transverse axes on its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two are aimed at greater communication with Ecuador, but he did not provide more details.
The final document also touched upon the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve to re-join the Union of South American Nations," from which she is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, to be united, and to have good relations between its neighbours was another theme highlighted at the summit.
In that sense, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said before attending a regional meeting that he hoped to meet with his Nicaraguan counterpart, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico City to hold talks in a respectful manner about the maritime dispute resulting from the verdict of an international court challenged by Bogota.
"The day after tomorrow (Saturday) I may meet with President Daniel Ortega," Santos said.
"We will revise all these ways, they are not mutually exclusive, including the pact with Nicaragua will require discussion with Nicaragua," he stressed.
"With President Ortega, I hope I can tell him that we will handle this in the most civilized and respectful manner possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico City, where they are scheduled to attend the inauguration of the country's new president, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Also within the framework of the summit, the ministers of defense of the bloc met in advance to approve the Action Plan for 2013, which is aimed at strengthening dialogue and unanimity on the protection of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay form UNASUR, although the participation of the latter is suspended.
Peru has an interim presidency in the regional bloc.
"South America should learn from Europe on the integration of citizenship": Rafael Correa
Ecuador's president, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which "South America, in this case, yes, must learn from Europe."
Correa, who attended the Sixth Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) held in Lima, told Peruvian state television that Europeans "killed each other during World War II" and in other clashes, "but now they are practically one fatherland."
He defended, in this context, the project to establish South American citizenship, which is endorsed by the UNASUR participating countries.
"It is necessary to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country, as is already happening with members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors that want to return us to the past," he warned.
The Ecuadorian president has also shown himself to be a supporter of the revival of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the premise of reducing the influence of Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account those who have signed the San José Pact on Human Rights.
Those who give lectures never make any commitments, and we South Americans, on the contrary, sign everything.
"It is inexplicable that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is located in Washington and funded by the United States," he said, alluding to the political asylum given by Ecuador to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa assured that he did not regret this decision, because with it he did not betray his principles, but observed his "deep values of democracy and human rights."
He added that at the time "there were certain suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and the process would not be followed."
He also criticized Swedish justice for requesting to come to its territory for questioning regarding an alleged sexual offence, while "Swedish law itself considers it possible to implement it through a video conference that could be made from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London."
Correa confirmed that there is a risk of assange's physical and mental health deteriorating.
"I haven't spoken to him since he arrived at our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small pulmonary problem, nothing serious," the Ecuadorian head of state said.
What really exists is the danger of deterioration of his physical and mental health due to confinement in a small space without the ability to do exercises in the air.
"It affects the health of any person," he added.
Correa pointed out that the solution to the asylum issue granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, by providing a guarantee of immunity that will allow him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and European judicial authorities and stressed that there were negotiations in London to find a solution to the problem of the imprisonment of the Founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate about human rights, we do not use this word in this case, but there have been constant discussions.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the European judiciary, because Assange's lawyer, Baltasar Garson, is leading a number of trials in various European instances," he said.
And he expressed the opinion that "if the UK tomorrow provides a guarantee of immunity, it will end."
And if Sweden, as its legislation perfectly allows and as it has done in other cases, interrogates Señor Assange at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London or interrogates him via Skype, tomorrow this problem will be exhausted.
Correa took the opportunity to prove himself as a defender of press freedom and stressed that he does not tolerate "mediocrity, bad faith and lies that distort freedom of expression."
"The main enemies of press freedom are not spoiled villainous politicians, but bad journalists who support profiteering, blackmail and extortion," he said.
In this aspect, he was pleased that neither these journalists, nor the bankers, nor the bourgeois hegemonic countries dominate Ecuador", and added that, being re-elected, "he will deepen the revolution to continue development in the right direction."
Correa also supported paraguay's decision to keep Paraguay's veto in UNASUR at least until the next election, arguing that the organization "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and support for coups under the guise of legality" because in reality "it has destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy."
The Ecuadorian President also considered "perfectly justified" the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to now negotiate with Nicaragua on maritime boundaries between the two countries following the decision of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which turned out to be in favor of Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty.
At the moment, this decision is not respected.
This is a problem between South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the desire to go together.
You need to process them together to overcome them and continue to move forward.
He also expressed hope for a good conclusion to the dispute over maritime boundaries, which is being conducted in the same court of Peru and Chile, and said that "it is right for Latin America to appeal to international bodies if the two countries undertake to make a decision, no matter how difficult it may be."
Regarding the possibility of running as a candidate in Ecuador's upcoming presidential election to run for a third consecutive term, he said he was considering the possibility "with great optimism and joy, although sometimes it is quite difficult."
Correa assured that if he loses the elections in February 2013, he will leave public life.
On a personal level, I have never been interested in power, but in such unfair situations as in Ecuador, socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
"My political movement felt that it was I who guaranteed this likely victory, so we have to recognize this responsibility," he said.
If I win, this would be my last term as president, and then we leave public life.
If we lose, same thing.
"It's a decision," he confirmed.
Correa also mentioned venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's new treatment course in Cuba.
I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro, who told me that he went for treatment that had already been planned, routine, and that he was expected to miss the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean that President Chávez's health is worsening," he explained.
The Ecuadorian Head of State participated today in Lima in the Sixth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to maintain progress, equality and security.
Mortality from AIDS today - the result of late diagnosis
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was told he had tested positive for AIDS.
"It was as if I was stunned," he recalls that difficult moment, despite all the tact of the doctor.
The young man hid it from his family.
Deciding to cope with the disease on his own, he wanted to learn as much as possible about it. And his efforts were justified - he has already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
Fabrizio is one of the "oldest" patients in the HIV department of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), where he entered in 1994 after overcoming many obstacles.
He has been living with a diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years. In the early 90s, it would have been hard to believe – there were too few treatment options then, too little was known about the disease, too biased towards the sick.
So, even the director of the clinic of the Mexican Institute of Social Protection did not want to say goodbye to him, "because he had a cut."
In other words, in those days, having AIDS was a sentence.
It is now possible to survive this syndrome and do so without impairing the quality of life.
However, without knowing about their illness, many people still come when the virus has already caused damage, "depleted" their immune system and they suffer from opportunistic infections.
31 years after the emergence of AIDS in the world, at least after the first reported cases, "a great achievement at the moment is that the survival of a patient who begins treatment in a timely manner and the survival of the general population are exactly the same," said the head of the HIV department of HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, citing the fact that this information was confirmed in April this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectious disease specialist and HIV/AIDS expert Andrade Villanueva explained that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS is not a sentence, but the duration and quality of life depend on the degree of damage to the immune system that patients have at the beginning of the diagnosis, with the best life expectancy for those who do not use drugs: up to 30 years with a number of 200 CD4,  and until the age of 50, when 500 CD4 is reported.
Simply put, the above means that someone who receives an HIV-positive diagnosis at the age of 25, according to these terms, "maintaining control, will be able to live without problems until the age of 75," he explained.
To appreciate this progress, it should be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans today averages 76 years.
Although mortality has declined significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying of AIDS has fallen from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that since the advent of AIDS, 60 percent of patients in the national database have died.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and 187 deaths have already been recorded by May of this year; however, it is claimed that there has been widespread access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
- Why are there still deaths?
- Personally, I don't think the problem is access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's the way things are in our hospital.
At least for the last 12 years, we have not had a shortage of medicines, the problem is that patients come very late, because they do not know about their infected condition, that is, in the later stages of the disease.
He cited devastating data: "Nine out of ten patients come when they already have some opportunistic infection; what needs to be done to have a greater impact on overall mortality is to carry out diagnostics at an earlier stage, and therefore it is necessary to provide samples for detection on a mass scale, for all people who ask for it."
In their proposal, experts and officials of the State Council for the Prevention of AIDS in Jalisco (COESIDA) agree, as well as patients themselves, like Fabrizio, who turned to a private laboratory for testing, prompted only by the fact that his friend did it and, despite his young age, he was already at the stage of AIDS and even suffered from Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancerous tumor.  which is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they're going to die and they don't want to know anything.
"Since I'm going to die anyway, I'd rather three times a week," they say. But not in my case.
There are positive changes, I eat well, do exercises, take medications.
To date, his parents only know that he has had cancer.
I live a normal life like any other.
"I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active sex life, but with mutual responsibility, I take care of myself and the other person," said Fabrizio, who agreed to share his personal life with MILENIO JALISCO to encourage with his statement those who are now, in the context of World AIDS Day, afraid.
Let them check if there was a risk of infection, let them find out as soon as possible whether they are HIV-positive, so better, and if they already have a diagnosis, let them know that they can live like any other person, being responsible.
This message of his summarizes the theme of the fight against AIDS in this 2012 year.
Condoms behind the counter
There are great gaps between health programmes and the common citizen, said Ricardo Salazar, a Guadalajara-based journalist who tackled hiv-related issues.
And the biggest is prevention.
In places dedicated to this task, "there is actually an increase in the distribution of condoms, we used to be given one or two, now we are given packages of a hundred, and this is very good, but it turns out that there are those who now still do not have access to a condom," he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
"Why do you need them?" is a popular question, with snideness and condemnation, from social workers, school counselors, pharmacy staff and health workers that teenagers don't want to hear, the propagandist assured.
I propose to change this inefficient distribution; that condoms are not only behind the counters and that a hundred of them are in vending machines in public toilets in places that are often visited by young people.
This is not an encouragement of promiscuity.
It's not about paying for beer and a motel, Governor Emilio Gonzalez replied when asked if it was possible to distribute condoms under his leadership.
"It's not sexuality, it's best to make condoms available to those who already practice sexual activity," he said.
Key data in Jalisco
There were 13,435 total cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state ranks 4th in the national ranking for new and total AIDS cases and 13th for HIV.
92% of infections relate to the genital tract, 6% through the blood and 2% to the perinatal route.
An estimated 50,000 people can live with HIV, as there are 4 to 5 people who are not aware of it per reported case.
Given the ratification by the United States Court of Appeals of a decision that annulls the Vitro Group's debt restructuring achieved through bankruptcy proceedings in Mexico, the scenario sets a fateful precedent for any national company with branches in a neighbouring country that has solvency problems.
It seems that procedures to support the survival of firms that are permitted by Mexican laws are not valid in the country of stripes and stars, contrary to international agreements.
In practical terms, the approval of Judge Harlene Hale's June 15 ruling in the Northern District Bankruptcy Court of Texas leaves Mexican firms defenseless in the face of the possibility of seizing their property on the other side of the Rio Grande.
However, the ruling opens the door to a leading glass manufacturer in Mexico to appeal to the United States Supreme Court, citing three inconsistencies as evidence.
As an introduction, while the judge of the case notes that creditors should be governed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, located in New Orleans, says the main proceeding concerns bankruptcy proceedings pending in Mexico.
The first paragraph implies the annulment of international judicial cooperation in cases of insolvency of enterprises of a transnational profile.
In fact, for this purpose, the UN Model Law on the Unification of the Law of International Trade was created, defining the American Law Institute as an arbitrator.
Second, the verdict establishes that without an inter-firm vote, the critically recognized bankruptcy debts owed to the parent company by Vitro affiliates would not have achieved the majority necessary to approve the restructuring.
However, this possibility is recognized by Mexican law.
In fact, Vitro was not the first time this scheme was adopted.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose intercompany debts were guaranteed by the Federal Institute of Competitive Industries.
It is also true that by subtracting the votes of the branches, one way or another the Vitro creditors who fought against it in the courts of the United States, namely vulture funds like Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have reached a majority.
The vote would have been 45 percent to 37 percent.
The Court of Appeal omits these data.
On the other hand, he blames Vitro for the difficult situation it has faced since 2008, affected by a serious economic crisis that has overtaken the United States, striking at the country.
So far, the gonzález Sada family firm will appeal the decision to the Court of Appeal itself so that the vote reaches its plenum, that is, five judges, since only three voted.
In the event of failure, a motion for certification will be filed that will require a review of the process by a higher court, in this case the United States Supreme Court.
Worst of all, the court rejected a document sent by the Mexican government as amicus curiae ("friend of the court"), which describes the process that Vitro follows under the Bankruptcy Law, signaling that it exempts itself from compliance with agreements signed by both countries to link it to Article 15 of the US Bankruptcy Law.
In addition, it is noted that the country has obeyed the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, that is, the rules established for cases of interstate insolvency, which guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
Carom from two sides: they hit the Vitro and hit the country.
Overall Balance
Given the months-long-delayed complaints posted on the table by the Mexicana de Aviación unions against the company's former owner, Gaston Ascarraga Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent management, the Aviators' Pilots' Union has already discovered a bottleneck.
The court, headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morino, has just filed a criminal case against the National Banking and Securities Commission, which is accused of obstruction of justice.
According to this, the supervisory authority systematically refused to submit reports to the Prosecutor General's Office of the Republic regarding the operation performed by the entrepreneur to extract 198 million pesos from the F/589 trust fund of IXE Bank, on behalf of Mexicana Airlines.
Resources would be directed to the purchase of shares of the Professional Hotel Management Company.
As you know, Ascarragha Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
Surround Dragon Mart
Gathered over the weekend at a forum at the Caribbean University, a group of local and foreign environmentalists, academics, businessmen and members of the general civil society have endorsed the creation of a broad front to oppose the opening of China's Dragon Mart in Cancun.
We are talking, as you know, about a giant sales and distribution center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean products of an isolated country, with a residential area nearby for employees of 150 companies.
Earlier, Canacintra managed to unite the governors of the southeastern zone to confront the monumental forces that have razed to the ground part of the protected areas and put forward serious threats against the industry.
Death of ACTA
With regard to the Senate's rejection of the Government's request to explain under what conditions and circumstances the Mexican ambassador to Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known as acta, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property, the case has already been archived.
As you know, the action was carried out despite the fact that the Senate itself disqualified the possibility of viewing it as violating freedom of expression on social media.

Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
Avid basketball traveler Hector "Hetin" Reyes was associated with this sport for more than 60 years and, thanks to it, traveled around the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have as many basketball histories as Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
And before a cerebral hemorrhage confined him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, as a minor player, a Major League Basketball player, commissioner and BSN executive with Bayamon Cowboys, and president of the Basketball Federation.
"I've played many roles in basketball throughout my life, including several at the same time, like when I was president of BSN, CEO of the National Team, and president of the federation in the '90s," Reyes recalls during Primera Hora's visit to his home in Bayamon, where he has lived with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes is not exaggerating by making this statement.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photographs and memorabilia collected over his long journey, bear witness to this.
Bayamon in the Heart
With the greatest emotions, he keeps those that remember his journey through the Cowboys, from the mid-50s as a player until 1982, when it was the 15th anniversary of his performance as a co-agent or contract agent.
"Those were my best years, which I enjoyed the most because I had the opportunity to be part of eight Cowboy Championships since 1967, as an agent, co-agent or executive.
There were many years of joy, including five championships held from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, the year Jerome Mincey made his BSN debut.
From that moment on, Ortiz, who was a great administrator, became the head of Cuco, who was a great administrator," Reyes said.
I remember gene Bartov, who was on his way here and was at the University of Alabama(Birmingham), saying to me, "I have a very strong player for you, 6'7 feet tall."
"Do you want to?"
And that was the beginning of Mincey, one of the best players Puerto Rico had.
Bartov then recommended sniper Raymond Gauss, who was granted citizenship and became one of our top scorers.
I remember saying that if Mincey had brought the championship to Bayamon, Gauss would have helped win another one.
I enjoyed the cowboy championship with Gauss, but already at a distance, because by 1988 I was already listed as the head of the federation.
By then, I preferred to enjoy his achievements and Minsi's achievements in the national team.
I remember winning for the first time against the United States during the Olympic qualification tournament in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Championships, where we got fourth place and it should have been bronze, if not for that Canadian referee who forced us to replay the final game, Reyes said.
Is that team from the 1990 World Cup the best team you've ever seen?
It is among the best, as is the one that won against the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the one from the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and defeated team USA, which was pretty similar to the one that won us bronze at the World Championships.
That team not only included Mincey, Gauss, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and Piculin (Ortiz), but also young (Javier) 'Tognito' Colon and James Carter, brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario 'Quixote' Morales, who was unable to compete in '90 due to a knee injury.
A team that may not have been the best in terms of personnel, but brought us a gold medal and great joy, was the team of the 1995 Olympic Qualification Tournament in Neuquén, Argentina.
With role players like Nieves' Canito, Pablo Alicea and a young Rolando Hurruitner replacing players suspended for a mess in the Mar del Plata Pan American Championship, we won gold against all predictions.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
Without a doubt, it was Piculin Ortiz.
His performance in international tournaments is impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico dominated this level the way Piculin did.
And that's without regard to his career in the various leagues he's played in.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
This is a very difficult question.
We had very good youngsters including Julio Toro, Flora Melendez, Carlos Morales, Raimond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Of the young, I really like the work of Leo Arilla.
What do you consider your main achievement in the federation?
Participation in the most glorious era of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and that in the early 90s the BSN had up to 17 teams per season.
What do you have left to do?
There were things I wanted to implement, like regionalizing smaller categories.
For example, that boys from Ponce play only in their area and only against teams from other parts of the island in the national playoffs.
Now the guys are traveling and playing too much, and that's unnecessary.
At the very least, I see the fruits of mandatory certification and a course for managers, officials and judges.
It gives me pleasure.
What are you doing now?
Most of all, I listen to music, watch music videos of my era on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren, and occasionally go to basketball games.
And, of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been with me.
Actor Larry Hagman has died
Born on September 21, 1931 in Fort Worth, Texas, Larry Hagman became world-famous for his starring role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R.," in the television series Dallas, in which he embodied a businessman without principles, evil and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as oil predator mogul J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
He was 81.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in the new season of Dallas, died Friday night due to complications caused by cancer, according to a family statement provided to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., dallas' production studio.
"Larry is back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, once again playing the iconic role he liked the most," his family said.
Larry's family and closest friends were with him in Dallas for a Thanksgiving fair.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original series and in the sequel, was by Hagman's side when he died in a Dallas hospital, her spokesman Jeffrey Lane said.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, affectionate and talented, and I will miss him very much.
"He was an original person and lived life to the fullest," Gray confirmed in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver in 1992 and admitted to drinking for years.
In 1995, he was diagnosed with a malignant tumor in the liver and underwent a transplant.
Long before Dallas, Hagman gained notoriety on television for his decent-type role in the light comedy "I Dream of Jeannie," broadcast by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it, he played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life changes when he meets an attractive genie girl played by Barbara Eden and begins to live with her under the same roof.
He was also the main character in two comedies that rarely appeared on the air, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His film work included critically acclaimed roles in The Group, Harry and Tonto, and Primary Colors.
But it was his masterful interpretation of the delightfully disgusting J.R. that propelled Hagman to the pinnacle of fame.
A CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and other characters in his entourage aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional slogan "Who Shot J.R.?", designed to create hype around an episode full of emotion in which Hagman's character is nearly killed, generated international discussions and millions of dollars risked at bookmakers.
It also helped to attract a record audience to the series at that time.
When the november 1980 episode was answered, an average of 41 million television viewers watched it and turned Dallas into the second-most-watched entertainment program in history, after the 1983 MASH finale, which attracted 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s sister-in-law, Christine (played by Mary Crosby), who shot him.
J.R. prevented her and then threatened her that he would accuse her of prostitution if she did not leave the city, but others also had reasons to attack him.
Hagman played Ewing as an insatiable corrupt official with a charismatic smile: a dishonest entrepreneur and an unfaithful husband who wanted his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), to be placed for treatment.
"I know what should be on J.R.'s gravestone," Hagman said in 1988.
It should be said, "Here rests the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
That's the only deal he lost.
Victoria Principal, also the heroine of the original series, recalled Hagman on Friday as someone "huge, both on and off screen."
He is unforgettable and indispensable for millions of admirers around the world, and in the hearts of each of us who are lucky enough to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new dallas issue aired a few months ago with great success on TNT.
The recording of five episodes of the second season has already been completed and the sixth was in production, the channel reported.
Warner or TNT have not yet made a statement on what will happen to the series after Hagman's departure.
A native of Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who shone in such classics as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan."
Martin was still a teenager when she gave birth to him in 1931 during her marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on the theater stages of New York in the early 1950s, and then served in the Royal Air Force from 1952 to 1956.
While there, he met and married the young Swedish artist Mai Axelsson.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for a long time in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities live.
In 2001, he titled his memoir Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life.
"I didn't include anything that I thought could hurt anyone or affect them in any way," he told Prensa Asociada at the time.
After a liver transplant, he went on to promote organ donation and worked as a volunteer in the hospital to help patients experiencing fear.
"I give them advice, give them courage, meet them when they go for surgeries and after," he said in 1996.
I'm trying to offer some consolation, like "don't be afraid, it's going to be a little uncomfortable for a short time, but you'll be fine."
He also actively opposed smoking and participated in several campaigns.
A course that explores "The End of the World" begins
Each week, students explore apocalyptic phenomena such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
This semester, when religion professor Stuart Charme decided to teach a course on the end of the world, he knew he had a compelling lure: the end of the "long countdown" of the Mayan calendar, December 21, which many people seized on as proof that the end of the world was coming.
But Charmey had no idea what awaited him in the next couple of months: the catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, the financial crisis that some call the "long-termageddon," and the growing conflict where Israel would be dragged in, a place where end-of-time Christian theorists believe the Apocalypse will begin.
"I didn't realize it was going to be the most apocalyptic semester of all," Sharme told students at Rutgers-Camden University in New Jersey this week.
If you analyze what's happening in the world now, as if we only have 30 days left, it was a really good period.
And remember that the bad is good for those who have an apocalyptic way of thinking.
And he's not the only professor offering courses on the "end of the world" this semester, theoretically the latest in history.
At Temple University, Associate Professor Barry Wacker teaches a course on "Media, Culture and the End of the World."
Each week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
"We analyze why these ideas spread over time," he said, and the way in which hypothetical scenarios are proposed to trigger certain human actions.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, war could break out.
This month, students analyzed films on apocalyptic themes and studied how they relate to real-life examples.
"I tried to tell students about what is possible, probably plausible and impossible," Wacker said.
At Pennsylvania State University's main campus, Latin American history professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an associate professor of art history and anthropology, teamed up to teach a course called simply "The End of the World."
"We don't add '2012' to always be able to read the course again in case the world doesn't end," Restall said.
Despite the "imminent destruction," students must learn, prepare projects, and take final exams.
In Penn State, the final exam will be taken on the eve of the Apocalypse, leaving students with no choice but to work "until the very night that is supposed to be the end of the world," Restall said.
The courses proved to be quite popular.
"The seats ended in two hours," Restall said of his course for high-GPA students, which enrolled 35 students.
We received emails for many weeks before the start of the semester from people who asked if there were any more places.
Students, in turn, assure that this course is one of the most interesting.
"I love watching what people are doing to comfort themselves," said Brigid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, in Rutgers-Camden.
And the apocalyptic way of thinking, secular or religious, is only a matter of consolation or lack thereof.
Will Vequesa, a 25-year-old psychology and nursing student, said he had watched all the apocalyptic films.
"I've never heard of a course that teaches this," he said.
I like him.
But none of the students surveyed — let alone the professor — said they believed the end of the world date of Dec. 21.
"Our first draft touched on a Mayan prophecy, and in some ways we discredited it," said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old final-year student at Temple University in West Chester.
The Maya never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key moment on the calendar, Restall said.
But he noted that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture that dates back several centuries, where people respond to changes around them by predicting the end of the world.
The internet has caused an increase in this speculation.
"Elsewhere, people don't think about it," he said.
Mostly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly answered a question about whether he knew of any course about the "end of the world" there.
"The Philippines is not taking part in the end of the world," he wrote, alluding to the order of a higher authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall noticed that many days of the last trial had been talked about for a long time, and said that if nothing happened on December 21, "people will immediately begin to think about the next date" or philosophize that December 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period, after which the world will end.
Students and teachers are careless about this date.
Some said they were going to go to "doomsday" parties.
"Maybe I'll call a friend to have a laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
