Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law on the introduction of administrative liability for violation of the term and procedure for payment for goods (works, services) when making purchases for state and municipal needs.
This law is designed to solve a very acute problem of non-fulfillment of their obligations by customers in the implementation of state and municipal procurement.
Two years ago, the situation when entrepreneurs could not receive payment under already executed state and municipal contracts was ubiquitous.
At the same time, the President of Russia instructed the Prosecutor General's Office of the Russian Federation to take the problem under special control.
Because the businessmen themselves could not cope with unscrupulous customers who concluded contracts that were not supported by financing, tried in every possible way to evade their payment obligations and included illegal conditions in the contracts.
The problem was systemic in the country as a whole.
Since 2015, in the interests of protecting the rights of entrepreneurs to receive payment on public orders, the prosecutor's office has made 9.7 thousand submissions, as a result of their consideration, 4.5 thousand officials were brought to disciplinary responsibility, 533 to administrative liability, 75 materials were submitted to the investigative bodies for the organization of procedural checks, criminal cases were initiated on 46 of them.
As a result, the debt to entrepreneurs in the amount of more than 66 billion rubles was repaid.
Moreover, these huge sums were not accumulated as a result of non-payment of multibillion-dollar contracts.
Numerous, systematic delays in paying services to entrepreneurs for much more modest amounts led to fabulous debts.
Here's a typical case.
The head of a small company won a tender for the provision of social transportation services for several million rubles.
The person invested all his working capital, fully fulfilled his obligations, but did not receive the money on time.
The result is a growing financial lump of debts on salaries, taxes, loans, which would have led to bankruptcy if the entrepreneur had not turned to the prosecutor's office for help.
Now in a number of regions the problem has been leveled as much as possible.
Nevertheless, as of the first half of 2017, the total amount of debt under state and municipal contracts identified by prosecutors of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation amounted to about 27.4 billion rubles.
In regions where debt indicators continue to reach critical values, the prosecutor's office works in the mode of manual crisis management.
The Prosecutor General personally holds field meetings with representatives of local authorities, at which all violations discovered by prosecutors and measures for their immediate elimination are thoroughly examined.
Such operational meetings have already been held this year in Yaroslavl and Yekaterinburg.
The implementation of Federal Law No. 189-FZ "On Amendments to the Code of the Russian Federation on Administrative Offenses regarding the Establishment of Administrative Responsibility of Customer Officials for Violation of the Deadline and Procedure for Payment for Goods (Works, Services) when Making Purchases to Meet State and Municipal Needs", which was signed by the President of Russia last week, will be able to qualitatively improve the payment discipline of public customers.
The draft law was developed by the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia at the initiative of the Prosecutor General's Office.
The new law will supplement the Code of the Russian Federation on Administrative Offenses with an article that provides for a fine of 30 thousand to 50 thousand rubles for violation by an official of the customer of the term and procedure for payment for goods, works and services in state and municipal procurement.
And if an official has already been subjected to administrative punishment for a similar offense, then he will be disqualified for a period of one to two years.
All prosecutors of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation have already been instructed to ensure the application of these legislative innovations in practice.
Civil Rights Group Announces Missouri Travel Warning
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People issued a warning to people of color traveling to Missouri because of the state's discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
The group's statement reads: "The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People Traveler Warning, valid through August 28, 2017, urges African-American travelers, visitors, and Missouri citizens to be especially careful and extra cautious when traveling within the state due to a number of questionable racist incidents that have recently occurred throughout the state and are brought here."
According to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the group's travel warning was prompted by a recent Missouri law that made it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, as well as the fact that state law enforcement agencies disproportionately target minorities.
"You have people who are subject to human rights violations.
They are stopped on the roads because of their skin color, beaten and killed," Rod Chapel, president of the Missouri National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, told the Kansas City Star.
"We hear complaints more often than ever before."
This is the first warning of its kind issued by the organization to a U.S. state.
The group cited incidents such as the racial humiliation of black students at the University of Missouri and the death of twenty-eight-year-old Tory Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under suspicious circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of gas while touring the state and Missouri state police arrested him without charging him with a crime.
The warning also mentions a recent missouri attorney general's office report that black drivers are 75 percent more likely to be stopped on the road than white drivers.
"The purpose of the warning is for people to be aware of the situation and to alert their family and friends and colleagues about what might happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People need to be prepared in one way or another, whether they will take money with them for bail or tell relatives that they are traveling around the state."
According to the latest data from the FBI's Hate Crimes Reporting Program, Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, making the state the sixteenth most such offenses in the state.
Also, the travel warning is a response to a new Missouri law, after which it will be more difficult to bring a case against a legal entity for housing or labor discrimination.
Earlier, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued warnings for travelers to Texas and Arizona after these states passed new immigration control laws that required local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for violating immigration laws, which, according to the ACLU, should have increased the number of checks on racial grounds.
Travel alerts are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but recently community organizations have resorted to this measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Two people killed in shooting at police patrol in Egypt
Unknown persons fired at a police patrol in the Egyptian city of Isna, Reuters reports, citing the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Egypt.
During the shootout, two people, including one policeman, were killed and three people were injured.
All the injured were taken to the hospital.
According to the agency, the police stopped the car, after which two armed men in the car opened fire on law enforcement officers.
One of the attackers was detained, the second managed to escape.
Rosturizm supports the law on the abolition of free baggage for non-refundable air tickets
The head of the Federal Agency for Tourism Oleg Safonov said in an interview with the RBC TV channel that he was "positive" about the adoption of the law on the abolition of free baggage transportation for non-refundable air tickets.
"It is necessary to create conditions under which a person who does not have luggage can buy a ticket cheaper than the one who has luggage," he stressed (quoted by TASS).
At the same time, Mr. Safonov noted that, despite the fears of citizens, it will not be necessary to pay for the transportation of outerwear and a mobile phone in hand luggage.
"It would be right to reassure all our citizens and tourists and declare this, to say that this will have nothing to do with outerwear, an umbrella, a mobile phone, an iPad or even some kind of computer," the head of the Federal Agency for Tourism said.
Earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law providing for the right of airlines to exclude the norm on free baggage transportation in case of non-refundable air ticket.
The point is that airlines can determine the number of pieces and weight of baggage included in the non-refundable fare.
Vladimir Putin instructed to eliminate pollution of Lake Baikal
Russian President Vladimir Putin at a meeting on the protection of Lake Baikal said that in recent years, significant areas of the lake have been subjected to extreme pollution.
He instructed to determine the sources of funding, plans and implementers for the elimination of pollution.
Mr. Putin also instructed to carry out a full-fledged reclamation of contaminated areas.
"It is necessary to deal with the facilities that continue to work here, the treatment facilities of most of them are worn out," RIA Novosti quoted the president as saying.
He also added that the Prosecutor General's Office of Russia should conduct an inspection to identify environmentally harmful activities.
According to him, in the lake area there are problems associated with the appearance of spontaneous landfills and a number of violations in the field of ecology by the organizers of recreation.
"I want to emphasize this: not to check everything in a row, here you also need to know the measure, but it is precisely - illegal and environmentally harmful activities and take appropriate measures," he stressed.
Earlier, the Prosecutor General's Office reported on the reduction of fish stocks in Lake Baikal and proposed to increase the number of objects subject to environmental supervision.
Recall, on June 15, Vladimir Putin during a direct line stated the need to change legislation to ensure the rights of citizens living in natural areas of a special protection regime.
He was informed about the problems with conducting economic activities by residents of Olkhon Island, which is part of the Baikal natural territory.
The head of the Ministry of Natural Resources Sergey Donskoy immediately proposed to solve the problem by clarifying the boundaries of the water protection zone of Lake Baikal, but the government of Buryatia recalled that such a change is not enough, since the restrictions are associated with a number of regulatory acts.
Earlier, the Ministry of Economy proposed to solve the problem by changing the Land Code and the law on environmental protection.
A new temple will appear in Ugra
In the village of Sosva, members of the community from representatives of the indigenous minorities of the North "Rakhtynya", together with residents of the Berezovsky district, are taking part in the construction of an Orthodox church in honor of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker.
Its location is a river bank, the temple will be clearly visible from afar, so it will serve as a travel beacon for fishermen.
According to representatives of the community, the construction work will be completed this year, now domes have been installed, church bells are available.
The Igrim EW of the fleet provided transport support.
The temple is named after St. Nicholas the Wonderworker, as it is revered by the Orthodox Church as the patron saint of travelers, including fishermen.
In Sosva, fishing gives settlers work, feeds them.
Locals are waiting for the temple to open its doors, and children even write in school essays about it as a local landmark.
Disneyland with the death penalty.
Why do Singapore comply with the law?
I'm talking to a local businessman, Chang, while sitting in an outdoor diner.
Commenting on the situation in Singapore, Chang smokes one cigarette after another, while he carefully stores cigarette butts in an iron box taken with him from the office.
After the end of the conversation, the businessman goes to the nearest urn - a hundred meters to it - and throws the gobies there.
The fine for garbage in a public place is $500, Chang said.
You know, since childhood, I just developed a reflex: you can not throw a candy wrapper on the pavement, they will instantly fine.
And now there are video cameras everywhere.
And indeed - the sidewalks of Singapore in the city center are clean, like in a museum.
Chang says three months ago, his neighbor's 18-year-old son painted graffiti on the wall of an old colonial building.
The court found the guy guilty of vandalism and sentenced him to flogging.
What?!
Imagine.
He received ten blows to the buttocks with a wooden stick and spent a week in jail.
Corporal punishment is not uncommon in our country.
How Singapore combines the highest standard of living and incredibly harsh laws, the AiF columnist understood on the spot.
No one here thinks about abolishing the death penalty," explains lawyer Victor Lee Hong.
And the government has long cared about the opinion of both the European Union and the United States on this matter.
If a person carries a large consignment of drugs or sells them, he is entitled to the gallows.
In 2002, a 22-year-old Australian citizen was detained at Changi airport carrying 400 grams of cocaine.
The Australian Prime Minister spoke in his defense, threatening sanctions, international human rights activists and even the Pope.
However, the guy was eventually hanged anyway.
After that, drug couriers diligently bypass our country.
The fact is this: in Singapore, it is supposed that the laws are obliged to comply with EVERYTHING in a row, and not just modest and poor people.
It does not matter who you are - a millionaire, a deputy prime minister, a famous artist or a resident of the European Union.
There is only one option in this case: if they find half a kilo of cocaine in your possession, you will be hanged.
When you walk around Singapore and everywhere you meet signs with a bunch of warnings, you simply wonder - how many bans there are in this city-state!
For example, chewing gum is sold only in pharmacies, and you can buy it strictly by prescription (!) of a doctor.
Upon arrival, chewing gum will not be taken away from a tourist, but it is worth gluing a "rubber band" in the subway, a fine of 1 thousand local dollars will be imposed.
Over four days, I met two people with white signs around their necks: "I littered."
For throwing a cigarette butt past the urn, in addition to a fine, they are often sentenced to "exile to the janitors": a week to clean parks and beaches.
6 thousand rubles. pays a "criminal" who forgot to wash off the water in a public toilet, and when trying to cope with a small need in the elevator of an apartment building, a special detector is triggered - the doors are blocked and a signal is sent to the police.
Among the most exotic laws are prohibitions on feeding pigeons on the street, public performance of songs and even excessive watering of indoor plants (!): it is believed that the abundance of water attracts mosquitoes.
To avoid fires, smokers should not bring lighters into the subway, otherwise they will be fined 5 thousand Singapore bucks.
In general, there is a thought: no matter how hard you try, you will definitely break something.
This is not the case at all," Mohammed Kabir-Qajariya, the owner of a local travel agency, tries to dissuade me.
Particularly fantastic laws exist only on paper, and in the last twenty years I have not seen anyone prosecuted for violating them.
Why are they preserved?
So that citizens do not relax.
Compliance with the basic rules is strictly monitored.
For example, if a minor is sold cigarettes in a kiosk, then everything will be punished along the chain: the owner of the store will pay a huge amount, the offender himself will receive blows with sticks on the "back", and the seller will also be whipped and put in prison.
It is thanks to such harsh laws that offenses in Singapore are very rare.
Is this justified?
Back in the seventies, we had chaos on the roads - motorists ignored traffic lights, drove as they wanted, got drunk behind the wheel.
After the introduction of fines for the year, everything calmed down.
Now the driver, having drunk a portion of whiskey, knows: if they stop, the policeman will not let him go for a bribe, they will impose a fine in the amount of the cost of the apartment and will be sent to jail for years.
To many foreigners, the city-state in Southeast Asia seems like a kind of concentration camp.
In 1993, the American writer William Gibson called Singapore "Disneyland with the death penalty" - the guest from the United States was horrified by the general wealth of the inhabitants, the "frighteningly clean airport" and the "cultivated nature".
They say that such things are unnatural, they look artificial, and this should not be the case in principle.
The first days in Singapore and rightly afraid to throw a piece of paper on the sidewalk, you wake up if you go to the subway with ice cream.
But then you arrive in the "Little India" area, and suddenly - "breaking the pattern": plastic cups are lying around at the bus stop.
"How's that?" you wonder.
And like this," Singaporeans chuckle.
Things do happen.
Not every such "crime" will be captured on the spot, but you should know that if you are calculated, you will not be punished - because you broke the law.
Most often, this is enough for a person to behave normally.
Of course, the government in Singapore is quite authoritarian.
But you know what?
In Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, I moved very carefully - motorcyclists often snatch smartphones and cameras from the hands of tourists.
The center of Paris is full of dirty bums and beggars.
On our streets, too, not everyone tries to throw garbage in the bins.
Singapore, thanks to a set of draconian fines and ruthless (up to the death penalty) laws, has become the calmest, cleanest and safest city on Earth.
Come to think of it.
This is human nature: remember, and in Russia no one buckled up behind the wheel until they began to fine.
Although the main thing in Singapore is not fines, but voluntary compliance with the laws.
And we must think that here in Russia people would also be happy with clean streets, the absence of garbage in the subway and would welcome the arrest of those who confuse the elevator with a public toilet.
Here's corporal punishment - thank you, don't.
Otherwise, the laws of Singapore are at least worth taking a closer look at.
Nothing sacred?
Now the Trump White House is targeting the Statue of Liberty.
The surest sign of regime change is when it starts fighting statues.
Americans understand this as well as anyone else – hence the deliberate theatrical demolition of the statue of Saddam Hussein in Baghdad's Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the Key Ideologues of the Trump administration, no doubt knew what he was doing when he brought the symbolic axe over the Statue of Liberty during a bitter dispute with CNN journalist Jim Acosta about the president's proposals to drastically reduce legal migration.
Let's be honest, Miller didn't attempt on the statue itself.
Hordes of pleasure boat owners and artists depicting the Statue of Liberty would have lynched him if he had tried.
But he encroached on its meaning, and especially on the meaning that was attributed to it in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, when the poems of Emma Lazarus were added to the pedestal.
As Miller grumbled at Acosta, "I don't want to go deep into history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem you are talking about was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
Miller got the facts right, but as he said, it's not really about history.
It's about the current sound of the astounding words of Lazarus, the only ones in which the state invites not all immigrants, but the poorest: "Your tired, your poor, / Your crowds dreaming of breathing freely, / The wretched dregs of your bountiful shores."
Never before have the "unfortunate scum" been so visible on our screens.
Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that in America Trump these people are not expected.
This debate over the statue's meaning is part of a broader political and cultural war: it's really a dispute about the meaning of America.
Lazarus – and her friends, who fought to put her words on the plinth of the statue after her death – understood very well that they were committing a completely political act.
The sculpture was intended to mark the connection between the French and American republics with the help of a banal classical figure - the female image of Freedom.
Lazarus changed her meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract, she has a voice.
And she got a very different name: Mother of the Exiled.
The combination of poem and image was a brilliant feminist move and a crushing attack against American nativism.
And as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right though changed it back.
The vociferous Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist who heralded the coming of Trump, reasoned in 2010 that Freedom does not invite anyone, rather it is an early neoconservative, bringing the flame of America to the world lying in darkness: "Freedom is moving forward.
It carries the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not needed to light the way to the United States."
Against usual, Limbaugh really hit the nail on the head here.
The meaning of the statue depends solely on the angle of view.
Lazarus's great creative achievement was to see her as she would have been seen by exhausted, miserable, but hopeful people on the decks of ships after a long and often arduous voyage.
It means literally looking at the world through the eyes of people who are seeking asylum and a chance at a better life.
Her statue responds to them with the words of hope and hospitality they dream of hearing.
And, of course, this is not a prospect that Miller and Trump will ever want to recognize.
Their torch is needed not to light the way, but to incite hatred, which is the only source of their strength.
2017 World Cup: Neil Blake praises the Scottish members of the Great Britain team.
Eylid Doyle recalls a time when there were only two Scotsmen in the Great Britain national team.
Neil Blake, director of play at the British Athletics Federation, said the 16-person Scottish side of the World Cup team would make a "significant contribution to the team's play".
A record number of Scottish track and field athletes have been selected for the 2017 London Championships starting on Friday.
Blake believes that in Scotland "something special is born" and the UK Athletics Federation should take this into account.
"We know that and we're trying to understand and we're going to support it as long as they have the potential," Blake said.
"I've talked to people at the Scottish Sport Institute and they think it has to do with what they've done.
The Scottish Athletics Federation thinks what they have done needs to be worked on.
British Athletics Federation: what they have done has to be worked on.
And people on the street think the same way.
I don't know why the circumstances are like that, but it's absolutely brilliant."
Some of the Scottish track and field athletes are vying for medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Bachert – who will compete with Sir Mo Farah in the 5,000m; and Ayleed Doyle was chosen by the team as their captain.
"Eylid is modest.
Her captain's speech was great," Blake said.
"Many track and field athletes, whether they are Scottish or not, and regardless of where they live or train, came out of this room feeling proud and determined to win.
The passion and genuine feelings that Eylid put into her were wonderful."
The Commonwealth Championships silver medal winner, who will run the 400m steeplechase at her fifth World Championships, says the 16 Scots in the British team is "incredible".
The previous record for the number of Scots at the World Cup was seven, in 1983 and 2005.
Ahead is Laura Muir, who specializes in middle-distance running and broke five British and two European records last year.
She will run 1500 and 5000 meters.
Chris O'Hare, who will compete in the 1500m race, is another Scotsman to look out for: he has a successful season with wins in the British qualifiers and the Annual Competition.
Doyle recalls her first World Cup, when besides her, the only Scotsman in the team was Lee McConnell.
The captain of the team says that she is "incredibly proud" that so many of her compatriots not only entered the national team, but in some cases will claim medals and fight for a place in the final.
"The captain of the national team is chosen by other team members, so it was a huge honor in any case, but to know that your teammates voted for you and you were chosen is a very special thing for me," she added.
"Of course, I am very proud of all the Scots who have been included in the national team.
This shows how much we have achieved.
And they are all accomplished track and field athletes who will strive to get on the podium.
As for my captain's speech?
Yeah, I think it was pretty good.
I just noticed that we were very lucky to host the World Cup at home.
So it's just about how important it is to get support from the fans and take advantage of the fact that we're going to be at the Olympic Stadium again.
I got another chance to go into his arena and compete and the atmosphere there will be just wonderful."
Blocking critics on Facebook: Don't run for public office if you're not willing to listen to criticism from voters
The founder of our country understood what a critical press was.
Americans loved George Washington, but that didn't stop them from criticizing him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
The criticism of him, of course, irritated him.
But he didn't silence his critics.
Because back in 1783, Washington said, "You can take away freedom of speech and we, deaf and dumb, will be led like sheep to the slaughterhouse."
Now I'll move on to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who should have tried to be more like Washington.
Hogan's subordinates blocked and erased the posts of at least 450 people who expressed their opinions on his official Facebook page.
And this week, the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for it.
The governor's subordinates called this lawsuit null and void, and the comment on the Internet was written in the spirit of "so what."
"It's just Facebook," many will say.
But it's also important.
And that's especially important when it comes to a guy like Hogan.
He is a remarkably popular Republican governor in a predominantly Democratic state.
He is in second place in the approval rating among the 50 governors of the country.
Hogan is not a stubborn reactionary.
He has demonstrated a firm hand in managing the state and a commitment to his principles.
He also deftly uses Facebook as the primary way to communicate with his constituents and jokingly displays his bald head after chemotherapy on his page.
Therefore, blocking people who come to the governor's page - which is declared as an official public forum and is conducted by administration officials with taxpayers' money - is unnecessary and ultimately harmful.
In an interview with the Washington Post, spokeswoman Amelia Ches defended the governor's actions, arguing that blocking comments is simply moderating them.
But it's all too easy to use the image of trolls, spammers and haters spitting on the internet.
The Post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are real people, not trolls, a teacher, a businessman, a pastor who appeal to their elected leaders.
They all say their comments were respectful, meaningful and not rude.
The pastor quoted the Bible, appealing that Hogan was Catholic.
Lakshmi's lawyer, Sarma Ramana of Bowie, Maryland, did not express hatred but asked about hate crimes.
"I wrote a polite comment saying that I am disappointed by his lack of response to hate crimes and other recent news," she wrote in the comments section of the post article.
"I also don't like the idea that when a lot of people leave comments on the same topic, some immediately say it's so-called cheating, instead of admitting that they are dealing with a large group of disgruntled citizens."
What the governor's subordinates call a "concentrated spam attack," others would probably call an "active life position."
In the Facebook era, it's easy to edit your image by simply blocking critics or erasing negative comments.
It's a much less dusty job than before, when it required sending people, collecting and burning newspapers with critical editorials, or arresting and silencing protesters.
But this is exactly what is happening now, only in digital.
Hogen is not the first official to be criticized for not wanting to listen to Facebook and other social networks.
President Trump was sued by Twitter users who were banned from his Twitter account.
One of the first, pivotal decisions on this topic was made this week in Virginia.
According to U.S. District Judge James C. Casheris of alexandria, the chairman of the County Supervisory Board of Loudon violated the First Amendment by banning a voter from her Facecbook account.
And in Kentucky, Republican Governor Matt Bavin was sued by the American Civil Liberties Union for his behavior on Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
In Washington's time, the era of affordable postage made about the same upheaval as the Internet is today.
From 1776 to 1800, the number of newspapers quadrupled, and the authors of anonymous letters greatly undermined his authority.
And even then, Washington was dealing with anonymous trolls.
People under the pseudonyms "Yurikola", "Valerius", "Belizearius" and "Porcius" wrote letters to newspapers ridiculing Washington's decision.
According to historical documents collected by the online project "George Washington Papers", his cabinet was littered with petitions criticizing his position on the Treaty of Amity, Commerce and Navigation.
But he didn't try to silence them.
Freedom of speech, dissent and speech lies at the very foundation of our state.
And true leadership means agreeing to that.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for household amenities at the Renaissance club
Former European champion Ronan Rafferty is hoping for amenities for the next three days, when the Renaissance club in East Lothian will host the twenty-fifth open Scottish golf tournament for senior athletes.
The Northern Ireland native, who led next door at Archerfield Links, and was heading towards the final round last year until he lost to Paul Eales, has been assigned to the new venue and is acting as a tournament spokesperson on behalf of the club's founder and director, Jerry Sarwady.
"I've seen how the Renaissance club was built and we're seeing it come to success with this event," Rafferty said.
"Players will see this field at its best moment, it is in great condition.
Jerry did a great job arranging this place.
He is an ardent supporter of this game and is proud of his achievements here.
It's a great demonstration for this field."
Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending the title for the first time, despite the fact that in his 32-year career he won both the European tournament and the European Challenge Tour.
"It's a really special feeling," the Southport player said.
"I couldn't try to win the Extremadura Open again because it was removed from the schedule a year after I won it.
Returning to this corner of the world is magical.
It's a great place to play golf.
Last year's memories are coming back, and for me and my wife, Sharon, it was a very special experience to win last year.
It was a really special time and we will always remember it."
Gary Orr, who joined the European Tournament for Senior Athletes after turning 50 earlier this year, is returning to the fray on home soil.
The event will be his first public appearance in Scotland since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"When you play at home, it's always a little more important," said Helensboro resident Orr.
"You want to perform well, but you feel that extra burden."
It was with great pleasure that I played again and I showed good golf.
I'm happy with how things are going so far."
on the field, the trio will be joined by former Masters tournament winner Ian Wusnem and senior major champion Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are two of the six Scotsmen on the pitch; the others are Andrew Oldkorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Participation in the tournament is free, and parking costs 5 pounds per hour if there is one person in the car, and 10 pounds if there are two or more people.
All proceeds go to the British Prostate Cancer Foundation.
British roads will learn to absorb harmful emissions
Tunnels over highways capable of absorbing carbon monoxide emitted by cars are already being tested on UK roads.
The country's transport agency, according to the publication Autocar, reported positive test results of a 100-meter tunnel installed on one of the highways in the north of the country.
The tunnel with a height of 6 meters is built of some of the latest polymeric materials that are able to absorb harmful substances contained in automobile exhausts.
However, the creation of a whole network of such tunnels is only part of the large-scale measures that the UK authorities are going to take to improve the atmosphere.
In addition to the network of tunnels, the British are going to expand the network of charging stations for electric vehicles, implement a number of measures to reduce the traffic flow on the roads, expand the use of commercial vehicles on electric traction and modernize the fleet of heavy trucks.
According to official statistics, a quarter of all air pollution falls on transport, and poor air quality causes up to 40,000 premature deaths per year.
Moscow City Court changed the punishment of disabled Mamaev to a fine
The Moscow City Court changed the punishment of disabled Anton Mamaev, sentenced to four and a half years in prison, to a fine of 200 thousand rubles.
It is reported by TASS.
Earlier, the prosecutor's office asked the court to replace the term with a conditional one, explaining its request by the fact that Mamaev's illness "prevents him from being in prison conditions."
Anton Mamaev, 28, was sentenced to four and a half years in prison to be served in a general-regime colony for robbery, the victim of which was a former special forces soldier.
On July 19, the court released the man from custody at a field session in the pre-trial detention center.
Poverty and death in Indonesia's "golden land"
When cooking dinner, Bardina Degeia does not use the stove.
She rarely uses the potty.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of Paniai County in the rebellious Indonesian province of Papua, a housewife usually simply places sweet potatoes, which here are called "note", directly into the hearth.
After half an hour, the charred tuber is taken out and eaten with impatient, unwashed hands.
Degeia sits on an earthen floor – she has no furniture – and this is where she does her chores around the house, such as washing clothes with muddy water from a nearby swamp.
The restroom serves as a bucket in a room without a roof.
She is the youngest of her husband's four wives, and so she was not assigned to work in the fields.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: many men from this village are unemployed, many drink, and there are soldiers.
"No one dares to walk around the village after five in the evening," she says.
It's a rare opportunity to look at daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was annexed to Indonesia in 1969 after a dubious referendum when only 1,026 elders were forced to vote by publicly raising their hands in front of occupying troops.
The existing pro-independence movement from the Netherlands quickly turned its ire against the Jakarta government, which retains tight control over the region by keeping foreign journalists and human rights defenders out.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, and the independent state of Papua New Guinea occupies the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is a city as remote as it is abandoned; the road here includes an hour and a half flight from Jayapura, the provincial capital, to Nabir, and then a five-hour shake in a hired car.
There is no public transport here.
The city of about 19,000 people consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences; corrugated steel roofs are painted with rust in a variety of reddish shades.
Few Indonesians, let alone journalists, and almost none of the foreigners got here.
Prior to the arrival of Christian missionaries, the Papuans worshipped a god named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes.
"It was unusual for us to wear these clothes," Degei says, pointing to his bright, hand-woven turban, dark skirt and bright shirt.
"We used to wear only leaves on our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, with 28% of its population living below the poverty line, and child mortality and literacy rates among the worst in Asia.
But it's also indonesian golden land.
The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by phoenix-based Freeport McMoran, is just sixty miles from Paniai, a highland province roughly the size of New Jersey, home to 153,000 people.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined about $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper here.
In addition, Papua boasts forest reserves valued at $78 billion.
These riches, however, entail one misfortune for the Papuans, ensuring that Indonesia's powerful armed forces maintain their suffocating presence here.
According to a 2005 New York Times investigation, between 1998 and 2004, Freeport paid local military personnel and units nearly $20 million, including up to $150,000 to one officer.
Demands for greater autonomy on the part of the Papuans threaten the existence of this gold mine and are ruthlessly suppressed.
Since 1969, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed by Indonesian military forces, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned, human rights activists say.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, massacres in the indigenous highlands of Papua in the seventies can be considered genocide.
Last year alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3900 peaceful protesters in the region.
"We will lose everything," a report published in 2016 by the Diocese of Brisbane, contains evidence of atrocities committed in the previous year, such as summary executions, torture – particularly frequent, as another report claims, rape and electrocution – and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
"It's hard to count the number of victims because the incidents take place every week," Andreas Harrisono, who does research in Indonesia for Human Rights Watch.
The hype tightened as Papua's resources attracted an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The province's 3.5-million population is 83% Christian, but demographics are changing as Muslim economic migrants arrive from the densely populated Indonesian islands of Java, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese shops, "varungi", sell fried chicken and a mixture of vegetables "gado-gado" served with peanut sauce.
Local residents are trying to withstand competition.
"Migrants started selling chicken and vegetables cheaper in the traditional market than the indigenous people of Papua," explains Abet Yow, a twenty-four-year-old native of Paniai who moved to Jayapura, the provincial capital, because of her work.
"Because of this, the indigenous people of Papua – Papua's mama-mama (women) – have lost their market."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, vowed to address inequality and rights abuses in Papua during his 2014 presidential campaign.
On his way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta, the former carpenter enlisted the support of 27 of Papua's 29 districts, including Paniai.
But in Papua, almost nothing has changed, and the locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokowi, expecting him to fulfill our hopes for justice," says Yow.
In fact, just two months after Jokowi's inauguration in October, Paniai survived the tragedy.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were on the street singing Christmas carols around a campfire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers on a motorcycle emerged from the darkness.
The frightened children told them they should turn on their headlights.
According to local pastor Javedt Tebay, one of the soldiers was offended by their tone and returned with four soldiers after a while.
According to victims and eyewitnesses, soldiers who were drunk chased after children and beat them with rifle butts.
Then one of the soldiers shot at a group of children.
One child, sixteen-year-old Julianus Eimo, was so badly beaten that he fell into a coma.
A couple of hours later, someone set fire to the nearby government election commission building, and the next day the situation escalated.
About a thousand Papuan men, women and children gathered on a football field in front of the local police station and military command center to demand justice.
They brought ritual hunting bows with them and performed vaita, a dance of the Papuan mee pago tribe: they ran in circles and depicted bird singing.
Some protesters began throwing stones at the police station and military base.
As the situation escalated, the soldiers were given an internal radio order: "If the crowd resists more than three times, shoot them," according to an official document seen by TIME magazine but not published in local media.
Fifty-six-year-old Eremias Kayame, the head of the Kego Koto district in Enarotali, sensed the approach of danger and called for calm, asking the crowd to go home.
No one wanted to listen to him.
"When I turned, I was suddenly hit in the left wrist by a bullet," he told TIME magazine, standing on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kayama still does not know who fired the shots, but says the bullet came from a line of assembled soldiers.
"There was a crowd, there were a lot of shots," he adds.
Local resident Alfius Jove was hit three times, according to his cousin, who witnessed the shooting.
"I ran up to him and examined his body to make sure it was him," Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, uses only one name, told TIME magazine grimly.
"I saw that he was dead ... I kissed him."
Gen. Yotje Mende, a senior police inspector in Papua, told reporters that his officers were only "defending" their base because it was under attack.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," Papua police spokesman Commissioner Pujo Sulistillo said in 2015.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more were injured.
News of the killings didn't reach Jakarta until the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi delivered a passionate speech in Jayapura in which he expressed condolences to the families of the victims and vowed to address the issue of historical abuses of power in Papua.
"I want this situation to be resolved immediately so that it never happens again in the future," he said.
In October 2016, Security Minister Wiranto said he would establish a non-judicial organization to end historical human rights abuses.
But almost immediately there were excuses.
"Most of the violations occurred a long time ago.
Some of them took place in the nineties or early noughties.
The fact is that we certainly want to address these violations, but there are procedures that need to be gone through," he said.
Wiranto then retracted his remarks, speaking to TIME magazine on June 5 in Jakarta, and said he had no plans to establish an organization to deal with complaints in Papua.
Instead, he said, "Everything will be decided through the courts."
Wiranto, who was accused by the United Nations of "crimes against humanity" over the deaths of more than 1,000 people during the bloody east Timorese independence vote in 1999, said 11 cases of human rights abuses in Papua had already been settled, including the Paniai incident.
The families of the victims from Paniai met such statements with grim disbelief.
"I've been questioned four times in the last three years, but there has been absolutely no change," Says Johannes.
"I'm tired."
He says that years later he still lives in fear.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I'm afraid I'm going to be arrested by the military, I'm afraid I'm going to get shot."
His brother Jacobus also expressed the opinion that the residents of Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four victims.
"After we buried the bodies, the military came for me," he says.
The shooting did not stop.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot at villagers in the neighboring Deiyai district of Paniai.
In a clash between villagers and a construction company manager who refused to help take an unconscious man to the hospital, one person was killed and 17 others were injured, including children.
A man, twenty-four-year-old Ravianus Dove, who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on the way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested in front of the office of a construction site owned by the company.
According to police, the villagers threw stones at the officers, who fired warning shots in response.
But locals claim that a mobile brigade (Indonesian special forces) fired on the crowd and killed one person.
"We've been in such a panic, we're afraid of retaliation," twenty-nine-year-old Domingu Badii, who lives near the hospital and hastily seen the wounded rushed in, told TIME magazine.
"I hid at home for two days."
Parliament Deiyai demanded that the officers involved in the incident be held accountable and the mobile police brigade withdrawn from the region.
Paniyai has always been a sore spot for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development angers the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes scattered throughout the green-covered central highlands of Papua.
Many have joined the Movement for a Free Papua (OPM), a rebel army that claims to protect the rights of Papuans by staging sporadic attacks and kidnapping raids on Indonesian soldiers.
Some of opm's top executives come from Paniai, including Thadius Yogi and Daniel Judas Kogoya.
In response, thousands of people have been arrested in Paniai in recent years and unjustifiably detained by the military under the pretext of "defending national independence."
Some never returned.
Among the population of Papua, Paniai is considered a "sad, forgotten place".
Poverty increases discontent.
A small portion of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for the locals.
Bread is just as certainly unavailable.
People here grow everything they eat: mainly a note, but also some fruits and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the work of women, each of whom can care for four to five fields of sweet potatoes.
They usually save most of the harvest for the family, and the rest is sold at the local market.
Ten tubers of a note cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupiah (75 cents).
Over time, economic disparities have increased between native Papuans and new migrants, who have arrived in large numbers following the introduction of new flights to Nabiré Airport.
The few existing vacancies usually go to more educated and wealthy migrants.
Papuans rarely have enough money or the necessary skills to run their own competitive business.
"Young people don't want to stay in the village ... because there is no work or money here," says John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai Tribal Council.
Isolation keeps Papua away from the views of the rest of the world.
In addition, restrictions on the work of international media remain severe.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudy and Basile Longchamp were deported from Papua for "lack of coordination with relevant organisations" despite being given rare video permits.
According to Felim Keene, deputy director for Asia at Human Rights Watch, promises made during Jokowi's election campaign to lift restrictions on media work in order to promote transparency and development have not been fulfilled.
"Now foreign journalists trying to report from the rebellious eastern Indonesian provinces, Papua and West Papua, face new dangers: visa denials and blacklisting," he said in a statement.
The lack of press attention means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely limited to Papua's immediate neighbors.
In March, six Pacific states – Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands – asked the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "diverse and widespread violations" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
Those same countries have supported OPM in the past.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arramanatha Nasir brushed off the group's statement, telling reporters in Jakarta that "Indonesia still has a democratic system and a free press, so it would be difficult to hide evidence of human rights abuses."
Locals want more foreign governments to pay attention to the situation.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by dutch human rights ambassador Kiys Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, local residents broke their silence, saying, "We want freedom," according to a source who was also present at the meeting but wished to remain anonymous.
Indonesia will hold new presidential elections in 2019, but Papuans say they are unlikely to vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a man who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by people involved in the Paniai shooting," said Gobai, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the people of Paniai, in addition to living in the shadow of the threat from the greedy army, are mired in poverty, and their education and health care are in a miserable state.
Gobai says the people of Paniai, like other Papuans, consider their vote for Jokowi to be a debt he must pay.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Paniai shooting carried out the last symbolic act of defiance: they buried the body of one of the victims on a plot of land directly opposite the police and military station.
Knowing that justice will probably never be served, they at least won't let the guilty forget their crimes.
"They killed a member of our family," Jacobus says without raising his head.
"What else were we supposed to do?"
The fire for the second time covers the Dubai skyscraper "Fakel"
A fire engulfed one of the world's tallest residential skyscrapers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to rush out of a seventy-nine-story structure with a 337-meter high ground.
This is the second fire to sweep through the high-rise building – which coincidentally is called the "Torch" – in two years.
The building was evacuated, no casualties were reported, and there was no operational news about the cause of the fire.
"We slept and woke up to a fire alarm and people screaming.
We ran down the stairs and it took us about ten minutes to get down from the fiftieth floor," a skyscraper resident who identified himself as George told Reuters.
According to the Dubai Civil Defence Authority, fire brigades extinguished the fire at around 4:00 local time (00:00 GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said it was working to provide shelter for the victims.
The incident could put the safety of materials used in the exteriors of high-rise buildings around the world back on the agenda.
During the investigation by the administration of "Fakel" after the fire there in 2015, it turned out that the most affected were the plating - external panels used for decoration and insulation.
In the United Kingdom, police said they believed the insulation system and plating panels of the Grenfell Tower in London could have accelerated the spread of a fire there in June that killed about 80 people.
The growth of tourist flow in Ida-Viru County in June was minimal
As follows from the data that the correspondent of the portal rus.err.ee received in the Department of Statistics, in June 2017, a total of 20,519 local and foreign tourists used the services of hotel enterprises in the North-East, which is 125 people or 0.6% more than in the same period a year earlier.
At the same time, the number of local tourists decreased, and foreign tourists increased.
Thus, the foreign tourist flow increased in June by 7.3% (544 people) to 7994 tourists.
And the number of local tourists decreased by 3.2% from 12,944 to 12,525 people.
The most noticeable increase in the number of Russian tourists in the region - by 8.9% or by 318 people compared to June 2016.
In total, in June 2017, 3885 guests from the Russian Federation stayed overnight in Ida-Viru County hotels.
Andrei Malakhov made it clear to fans who is to blame for his departure
Andrei Malakhov hinted to his fans on Instagram who is to blame for his departure from the "First" channel.
So far, he has not commented on the rumors, but today he posted a fragment of the article of the newspaper "Vedomosti" for August 1.
Malakhov signed the photo with the tag "boss breast pump".
The article is about how to prevent the "burnout" of the employee and pay attention to his condition.
If we recall the numerous reports that the presenter could not find a common language with the newly arrived producer, who undertook to reformat "Let them talk", it becomes clear what he so transparently hinted at, writes "KP".
As reported, TV presenter Andrei Malakhov is currently on vacation and did not sign a letter of resignation from the First Channel.
The situation with the dismissal may become clearer in the coming days.
In Afghanistan, a car bomb killed five soldiers
At least five servicemen were killed in an explosion in the Afghan province of Helmand, RIA Novosti reports.
According to the police, the night before, a car bomb exploded near the military checkpoint in the Girishk district.
It is known about 20 dead.
On Friday morning, a new emergency occurred in Girishka.
Armed criminals attacked a currency exchange office.
The exchange of fire between the attackers and security forces continues.
The diver filmed a shark biting his camera
Diver and researcher Greg Skomal (Greg Skomal) captured on video a shark that bit his action camera GoPro.
The video was posted on Facebook by a division of the US Marine Fisheries Agency in Massachusetts, of which Skomal is an employee.
The incident occurred on August 2 off the coast of the Cape Cod Peninsula in the northeastern United States, the Necn portal specifies.
A man during scuba diving tried to shoot a shark on a camera, which he held on a special stick.
Noticing a person, an animal over three meters long swam up to him.
The shark began to bite the camera, while not trying to attack the scientist.
Skomal explained that the predator did the same to determine whether the gadget was edible.
The researcher added that the shark could easily destroy the device.
He also noted that this behavior of a marine animal turned out to be a novelty for scientists.
The reason for the mass brawl in the Ural military center became known
A working group of senior officers of the Central Military District arrived at the Yelan Training Center, where a mass brawl took place to investigate the circumstances of the incident.
Some details of this massacre have already become known.
According to the public Mash, which appeared on the page "VKontakte", the contractors of the Ural military unit number 31612 violently fought because of an unmade bed.
It all started with the fact that a private named Sayan pointedly ignored the officer's order to fill up the protruding sheet.
Soldiers from the sixth company sided with the officer.
Sayan was supported by the first company.
For half an hour, 140 young guys smashed beds and sinks in the barracks, broke the windows.
More than ten people were injured in the mass brawl.
The CVO denied the information about the stabbing.
The study found that at least one-fifth of passengers in the U.S. carry prohibited items onto the plane.
The study found that more than 20 percent of air passengers knowingly or accidentally carried prohibited items in their luggage on board the aircraft through the inspection points of the US Transportation Security Administration, including at least 6 percent boarding the plane, inadvertently carrying prohibited knives or other sharp objects.
Nearly 1 percent reported that they later discovered they had accidentally carried firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The study, conducted by charter company Stratos Jet Charters, Inc., which covered more than 1,000 people, also found that younger passengers were more likely to break the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted to knowingly trying to fly with something forbidden by atB, 19.7 percent were millennials compared to less than 15 percent of Generation X members.
Consciously, food and water are most often brought past ATB employees.
More than 3 percent admitted to deliberately carrying sharp objects through the search, and 2.2 percent of female respondents and 3.7 percent of male respondents admitted to knowingly bringing prohibited drugs into the plane.
The company said it studied passengers across the country to see how many of them accidentally smuggled through airport screening and how many did so knowingly.
It is quite expected that most often - consciously or unconsciously - smuggle through the inspection of those who fly the most.
As the company points out, the ATB rules are quite complex and confusing.
People often don't know exactly what liquids they can carry and in what quantities.
So it's no surprise that most of what ATB takes away are banned liquids.
Some time ago, people thought that ATB might consider books prohibited.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
EPA President Pruitt refuses to postpone the implementation of the rules adopted under Obama to reduce emissions
The day after the 15-state lawsuit, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency reversed his decision to postpone the implementation of Obama-era rules designed to reduce emissions of substances that pollute the air and lead to the formation of smog.
Pruitt explained his decision by the fact that now his agency listens more than under previous administrations to the needs of environmental regulators of individual states.
He made no mention of the lawsuit against his previous position filed in federal appeals court.
The dispute revolved around the Oct. 1 deadline by which states must meet 2015 standards for ground-level ozone.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would delay compliance for one year to give his agency more time to study the plan and avoid "inconsistencies with local decisions or obstacles to economic growth."
Pruitt, who was Oklahoma's attorney general before he was appointed by President Trump to his current position, has long been known as a consistent opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since moving to Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly blocked or delayed the imposition of regulations opposed by the chemical or gas-oil industries.
Wednesday's unexpected change of course is another legal defeat of Puitt's course of returning to previous norms.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the head of the EPA had exceeded his authority in trying to delay the Obama administration's rule requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement Wednesday night, Pruitt suggested that by abruptly changing course on ozone standards, he was simply fulfilling the EPA's responsibility to work with states in a comprehensive process to implement the new standards in a timely manner.
"Under previous administrations, the EPA has often been unable to meet deadlines, after that it waited for lawsuits from activist groups and others and discussed timelines during the settlement of the case," said Pruitt, who filed more than a dozen lawsuits against the EPA in his previous position.
"We don't believe in regulation through litigation, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take our charter and the power it gives us seriously."
However, the EPA said in a statement that Pruitt could at some point again use his "deferral authority and other statutory powers" to make sure the norms are "on a clear course and on all available information."
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broader overhaul of ozone rules.
The bill, approved by the House of Representatives last month, aims to delay implementation of the 2015 rules for at least eight years.
The Senate has not yet voted on the issue.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led a coalition of states that filed a lawsuit against the EPA this week, said the group intends to continue legal pressure.
"The EPA's change of course — following our lawsuits — is an important victory in the fight for the health and safety of the 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smog that covers their cities," Schneiderman said.
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, as well as the District of Columbia, joined the New York lawsuit.
Ground-level ozone occurs when common pollutants from machinery, power plants, refineries and chemical plants, and other sources react in the atmosphere with sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive people, leading to thousands of premature deaths per year.
Health and environmentalists welcomed Pruitt's unexpected change of course.
"It's sad to think about how much pressure it took to get this perfectly logical step from the person tasked with protecting the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Bird of the Center for Biodiversity.
"We must continue to resist the Trump administration's ideological campaign and protect those who pollute the air and their special interests."
IAAF Congress extends suspension of All-Russian Athletics Federation
The Congress of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) voted to extend the suspension of the All-Russian Athletics Federation (VFLA).
Thus, Congress supported the IAAF Council for the Restoration of the WFLA, which issued a report on Monday in which it recommended that the suspension be upheld.
166 people voted for the extension of the suspension, 21 - against, reports TASS.
The IAAF Council's report stated that the WFLA had made significant progress towards meeting the conditions set by the council to reinstate membership, but those conditions had not yet been fully met.
Due to the disqualification of the VFLA at the World Championships in London, Russian athletes were forced to compete under a neutral flag.
The team included 19 people admitted to the IAAF championship.
The WFLA was subjected to an indefinite disqualification by the IAAF in 2015.
Then the report of the independent expert of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) Dick Pound was published, which spoke about numerous violations of the WADA regulations committed by Russian officials and athletes.
Read more about the latest report of the IAAF Council in the material "Kommersant" "IAAF extended sanctions against the VFLA".
Disappointing defeat
As part of the 3rd round of the Fonbet Championship of Russia among PFL teams, Khimik Novomoskovsk held an away match against FC Kaluga.
A little more than 10 days ago, the rivals played each other in the Russian Cup, but this time the picture of the game was completely different.
Khimik was in no way inferior to their opponents, but a second of relaxation at the end of the match led to an offensive goal and a fiasco.
After the recent defeat against Kaluga with a score of 0:3, many predicted in advance an easy victory for the hosts.
However, from the beginning of the meeting, the Novomoskovsk team forced to reckon with themselves and acted from the defense, but from a position of strength.
In the 1st half, Kaluga created more and had an advantage in possession of the ball.
Another very high-quality match was held by Alexey Sirotin, who several times repelled dangerous blows and gave confidence to his partners with his actions.
Unfortunately, in attack, Khimik lacked the effort and luck to stump the Kaluga defense and score the first goal on the road.
After the break, the game began to take place on the counter courses.
Novomoskovsk played more actively in attack.
Alarm bells for our team were mistakes in defense, which allowed Kaluga to create a number of sharp chances.
With 10 minutes left in the game, Khimik seized the territorial advantage and launched several dangerous attacks.
But the experience of the Kaluga residents played a role - they more competently and coolly spent the ending, waiting for their moment to take the goal.
After a dangerous attack, Khimik moved the ball to a corner, the feed of which the home team sent into the net without resistance.
The author of the goal was Yuri Dubrovin.
In the reporting meeting, Khimik demonstrated a good game, but suffered a disappointing defeat.
Ahead of our team is waiting for another trip - on August 11 at 19 o'clock in Moscow at the stadium "Torpedo" named after Eduard Streltsov Novomoskovsk will fight with the favorite of the group "Center" FC "Ararat", which includes Roman Pavlyuchenko, Marat Izmailov, Igor Lebedenko, Alexei Rebko.
Come and support "Khimik!"
Place and time of meeting novomoskovsk residents - 18 h. 30 min. near the store "Magnolia" (Vostochnaya, 2, korp.
Khimik squad: Sirotin, Manokhin (c), Romashchenko, Shayunov, Khomutov, Gogia (Oreshkin), Dudaiti, Ryzhov, Svyatov, Belyanin (Adoevtsev), Andreichenko (Lygin)
Press-service of the club "Khimik"
According to published transcripts of telephone conversations, Trump pressed Mexico about paying for a wall at the border.
The Washington Post published transcripts of telephone conversations between US President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On January 27, during a telephone conversation with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieta, Trump insisted that he stop publicly declaring that he would not pay for the planned wall on the border.
The U.S. president scolded him for speaking out publicly against the wall and, according to leaked information, told him, "You can't say this to the press."
Trump began his campaign with a promise to build a wall along the U.S. southern border and vowed that he would make Mexico pay for the project.
A published transcript of his first telephone conversation with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull also revealed a heated altercation.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement requiring the U.S. to accept refugees heading to Australia was "ridiculous," "disgusting" and "obtuse," and insisted that because of the agreement struck by the Obama administration, he would look like an idiot because he intended to stop resettling refugees in the U.S.
Trump concluded the conversation by telling Turnbull that "it was the most unpleasant conversation of the day."
The bodies of the tourists killed in Abkhazia were sent by plane from Sochi to St. Petersburg
The plane belonging to the airline "Russia", on board of which are the bodies of the Russians killed in Abkhazia, took off at 20:15 Moscow time from Sochi to St. Petersburg, reports TASS.
At the place of the final destination, the board will be met by employees of the funeral agency, as well as representatives of the city mayor's office, Deputy Minister for Resorts and Tourism of Abkhazia Astamyr Akhba told reporters.
Earlier, representatives of the Ministry of Emergency Situations of the Republic said that all the costs associated with the delivery of bodies back to Russia were assumed by the government of Abkhazia.
In addition, the official Sukhum intends to pay compensation to the families of the victims in the amount of 500 thousand rubles.
According to Akhba, the leadership of Abkhazia expressed its readiness to pay the relatives of the tourists killed in the explosions for the flight and accommodation in the republic, but the relatives sent only powers of attorney to the republic for the right of local authorities to act in accordance with the established procedure.
On August 2, at about 16:20 Moscow time, in the village of Primorsky, Gudauta District, two explosions thundered at the warehouse of rocket and artillery weapons of the Ministry of Defense of the Republic, after which large-caliber shells and other ammunition stored there began to detonate.
As a result, there was a fire in the warehouse, which provoked uncontrolled explosions of shells of various modifications.
As a result of the emergency, two Russian citizens died - Elena Polyakova born in 1970 and Elena Timofeeva born in 1962, who were on vacation near a hydrogen sulfide source.
64 people, including 35 citizens of the Russian Federation and 29 citizens of Abkhazia, with injuries of varying severity were taken to medical institutions of the republic.
Currently, seven people remain in the hospital, the rest have been discharged.
A grand jury will study the Russian influence on the American elections
Special Prosecutor for Russia Robert Mueller convened a grand jury in Washington, which will study the influence of Russia on the US presidential election in 2016, according to The Wall Street Journal and Reuters.
A grand jury is a group of ordinary citizens who collect evidence of potential criminal offenses and have the right to question witnesses under oath.
The collected materials will be studied by the special prosecutor and will decide whether they are enough to bring charges.
Convening a grand jury gives Mueller additional powers to gather evidence.
One of the topics of the investigation of the jury, which began work a few weeks ago, will be the details of the meeting of the son of then presidential candidate Donald Trump with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.
Mueller himself had previously promised to check the details of this meeting, which took place in June 2016.
They have already been studied by the FBI.
At the end of July, it was reported that Donald Trump Jr. expanded the staff of his lawyers.
Trump Jr. previously said that from the meeting with Veselnitskaya, he was waiting for kompromat on the headquarters of the Democratic Party candidate Hillary Clinton, but no revealing documents were presented, and it was ultimately about adoption.
In early August, a number of media outlets reported that Trump Jr.'s statement about the meeting with Veselnitskaya was literally dictated by Trump Sr.
The White House clarified that the president did not dictate anything, but simply used his authority, which any father would have done.
Vice Mayor of Penza detained at the workplace
Deputy head of the Penza administration Irina Shirshina was detained for 48 hours on behalf of the Investigative Committee at her workplace, RIA Novosti reported.
Official reports from law enforcement agencies on this issue have not yet been received, but the press service of the Investigative Directorate of the Investigative Committee assured that they will soon follow.
The mayor's office of Penza has not yet commented on the incident.
Irina Shirshina is one of the five deputy heads of the Penza administration.
She has been in charge of urban planning and land relations, a position she has held since April 2015.
Prior to that, she worked for a long time as the head of the department of the State Housing and Construction Inspectorate for the Penza region.
Irina Shirshina brings up three minor children, it is noteworthy that once again becoming a mother a year ago, she refused maternity leave and returned to work.
Of course, there is no spaceport or launch vehicles in Mexico.
But there is a space agency established in 2010 and a desire to develop its own space program.
And the installation of the bust of Yuri Gagarin is a tribute to the first person who visited space.
Unlike the monuments of the Soviet period, which are demolished in some countries, the monuments to Gagarin, on the contrary, "walk around the planet."
In 2012, the monument was installed in the US Houston near the former headquarters of NASA.
In London, a monument on the territory of the Royal Observatory was erected in honor of the 50th anniversary of the first flight into space.
There is a monument to Gagarin in Germany in the city of Erfoot, where our cosmonaut visited in 1963.
The monument in Karlovy Vary (Czech Republic) escaped demolition in 1992 thanks to public protests and was moved from the city center to the square in front of the local airport.
In the year of Gagarin's 70th birthday, a monument to Yurius Gagarins appeared in Riga.
This is how the name and surname of the first cosmonaut sound in Latvian, and it looks as if he turned 70 years old.
Morse Ford Murder: Activists Will Lose Lynch Trials on Stage to Call for Justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury drove past spectators in the village of Monroe, Georgia, and roared toward the small Morse Ford Bridge.
As a car carrying four black passengers and a white driver pulled up to the bridge, a group of white men with guns blocked its path.
The main one, a middle-aged man in a thin-striped suit, tightened his cigar and looked through the windshield.
Those sitting inside trembled with fear.
"We need that nigger, Roger!" the man roared.
"Get him out of the car!"
Shrill screams broke the silence as a young black man was pulled out of the front seat.
Fortunately, this horrific scene, which played out on July 22, is just a dramatization.
But when a noose was thrown around Roger's neck, almost all the spectators really held their breath.
Since 2005, activists have been returning to Morse Ford Bridge to replay the night when two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and May Murray Dorsey, were lynched by Kukla klan in 1946.
No one has been convicted of these murders.
"It is striking that in all these years not a single person has been arrested - although we see them next to us; although we know who they are," says Tyrone Brooks, who helped organize the production.
"It's a stain on our history and it's a rock on our souls."
Brooks, 71, is a former member of The Georgia Congress who has been fighting for human rights all his life.
For him, the play is a dramatic call to action and an annual reminder to monroe residents that the injustice has never been corrected.
"We want an investigation, we want completion, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we have to get justice," he says.
"We cannot move to healing and reconciliation until we achieve justice."
The coroner covers the body of one of the victims of the Morse Ford lynching on July 27, 1946 with a sheet.
According to FBI records obtained by NBC News, more than 50 people in Monroe and neighboring counties were suspected of participating in the lynching.
But no one was ever charged.
Although the suspects have remained at large for decades, human rights activists say that the city has always been well aware of two related motives of vigilantes: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court ruling for the first time allowed black citizens to vote in the primaries, which were to be held that summer.
Around the same election, the FBI reportedly stabbed Barnett Hester, a white landowner, apparently because of a woman, in a fight.
Brooks says that according to rumors circulating in the city, Hester slept with Malcolm's wife Dorothy, and that the child she was supposed to give birth to was not from her husband.
According to the FBI, on July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a large white landowner, paid $600 in bail to free Malcolm from prison.
He went to prison with Dorothy and their cousins May Murray and George Dorsey.
But as they drove out of jail and drove up to the Morse Ford Bridge, a mob of vigilantes surrounded the car.
"It turns out that Harrison organized and commanded the murders," one FBI report concludes.
"It is also clear that there was collusion between state and city law enforcement agencies, which not only took part in the killings, but also destroyed evidence and concealed the identities of witnesses."
Brooks calls it shorter.
"It was an attack on voting rights," he says.
"They were all killed to send a message to blacks in town: If you register and vote, it will be the same with you."
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Green has directed an annual play reproducing that lynching at Morse Ford Bridge.
Her performance is visual, it captures the viewer and tells about the deep racism, which, as many would like to believe, no longer exists in America.
It's hard to watch and even harder to turn away, but Green thinks that's the main thing.
"We don't want to talk about the Lynch Courts because they show us our own ugliness," she says.
"But I can't build a relationship with you unless you hear me or hear what I've been through."
Rehearsals for this year's play began in June, and on the first day nearly 30 actors — a dozen whites, the rest black — gathered indoors and listened to a review of the play polished over the years.
Wade Marbo directed along with Green.
He played the role of the main member of the clan for several years, but says that the role never got easier.
"I feel like I got dirty because it's not the kind of person I am," Marbo says.
"But I think it's very important to remember that story because we don't want to go back to that time."
Indoors, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester, reprise their roles.
The spectacle begins with Malcolm, furious that Hester is sleeping with his wife Dorothy, screaming and pushing him.
"I said,, get out of my house!"
Rascon shouts back.
A blow is heard.
And at the same moment, everyone (at least all the black actors) burst into laughter.
Green laughs the loudest.
"What's that," Askona asks.
He is concerned and confused.
Am I overplaying?
"No," Green says through laughter.
"I just don't think whites said '' then."
"Yes, yes," laughs one of the black performers.
"You have to pronounce a solid 'r'."
And so does the energy in the room change: discomfort is replaced by a sense of camaraderie.
Everyone has to do everything right, not only for the sake of the play, but also for the memory of the four people killed.
The scene starts over.
This time, when Rascona says a word for the letter "n", it turns out to be clear and sharp.
Not a single person laughs.
The play ends violently and quickly.
Screams, gunshots, and then silence.
A woman in mourning black clothes stands over the bodies of the actors and performs Billie Holiday's sad song "Strange Fruit".
Her voice is interrupted by a word.
A hundred yards away, fifty spectators wipe tears and sweat from their eyes.
There are almost equal numbers of blacks and whites among the audience.
One couple came from Ithaca, New York to watch the performance; many live very close.
They all endured Georgia's heavy stuffiness for nearly eight hours as Brooks led them on a pilgrimage to the graves of malcolm and Dorsey.
Up to this point, the murders remained only history, but now, when they stand in the same place where people were lynched, it seems that their ghosts are in the air.
When the last note of the song subsides, Green invites people to come closer and examine the bodies.
Children bend over to their heads, touch blood paint and motionless bodies, and whisper something to each other.
"They're not really dead," mutters one little boy, as if to remind himself.
A few minutes later, Green thanks the audience, and suddenly it's over.
The actors shed ropes from their necks and wipe away tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbo, a man in a suit who played the main Ku Klux Klan.
Nick Rascona hugs the other two actors and suddenly, crying, falls into their arms: the emotional load of the performance finally fell on him.
"It's okay," one woman whispers.
"We know you have a good heart.
You had reasons for that."
Later, the audience sits down to dinner with the actors.
At the same table, a white couple from Atlanta animatedly discusses a play with a black couple they have just met.
Denise Daplinsky struggles to find the words to describe how she feels after the performance.
"It's hard to listen to these horrible, creepy words, and actions... people who look like you and who do it because they look like you," she says.
"After that, I think the lynchings are still happening," she adds, "only now it's called what the police are shooting."
In another corner of the room, Tyrone Brooks, who recalls his work as a human rights activist over food.
He says he has already started planning next year's performance.
"The production inspires us because it not only describes the horror of what we have experienced, but also teaches us," he says.
"Because if you don't learn from that, it could happen again.
Those who do not study their history, who do not know their history, are doomed to repeat it."
The court fined Navalny for violations at the "agitation subbotnik"
The Simonovsky court of Moscow fined Alexei Navalny 300 thousand rubles for violating the procedure for organizing a rally.
The oppositionist was found guilty of committing an administrative offense under Part 8 of Article 20.2 of the Administrative Code of the Russian Federation "Repeated violation of the procedure for organizing a rally".
Earlier, the judge of the Simonovsky court of Moscow, Khizir Mussakayev, finished considering the administrative case against Leonid Volkov, the head of the headquarters of the oppositionist Alexei Navalny, who was brought to justice under the same article as Navalny.
Volkov was found guilty and sentenced to a fine of 300 thousand rubles.
Judge Mussakayev estimated the distribution of leaflets at a "propaganda subbotnik" that supporters of the Navalny held in Moscow on July 8-9.
Having seen the propaganda materials that monitored the participants of the subbotnik, the police believed that the organizers of the event deliberately hid its true essence - a public action (for which it is necessary to first request permission from the city authorities).
Leonid Volkov and his lawyers Ivan Zhdanov and Alexander Pomazuev requested the termination of administrative proceedings due to the absence of elements of an offense and pointed out that the police had made certain mistakes in drawing up the protocol.
Volkov was not detained at the "propaganda subbotnik" itself, but he received a summons obliging him to appear at the police station to tell about the event held with his active participation.
The same summonses were received by the Navalny himself and another associate of the oppositionist - Nikolai Lyaskin.
In Mordovia, arrested who shot the bride and three wedding guests
A court in Mordovia arrested a local resident who shot four people, including a bride, at a wedding.
This was reported in the republican department of the Investigative Committee.
The incident occurred on the evening of July 29.
During the quarrel, a 42-year-old resident of Saransk shot several times at the guests of the event, who came to the village pond to swim.
Three women and one man were injured.
Criminal proceedings have been instituted under article 213, paragraph 1 (a), of the Criminal Code (hooliganism), article 30, paragraph 3, and article 105, paragraph 2 (a), (e) and (i), of the Criminal Code (attempted murder of two or more persons, committed in a generally dangerous manner, out of hooligan motives).
According to Interfax, local media reported that the man opened fire due to the fact that the wedding guests, deciding to swim, walked through the territory of his site to the reservoir.
The Ministry of Energy will tighten the requirements for suppliers of turbines for power plants
The Ministry of Energy of the Russian Federation will update the rules for the provision of information by suppliers of critical equipment, in particular, turbines for power plants.
When starting gas turbines, hydropower turbines, oil pumping and oil production facilities, equipment suppliers will be obliged to share data on access to it with the Ministry of Energy and the Federal Service for Technical and Export Control.
The draft government resolution has already been ready and submitted for public discussion.
The new requirements will affect only "critical energy equipment" supplied to Russia.
Potential threats in the document are such phenomena as obtaining information and access to the management of the object by foreign special services, criminal elements and structures, unscrupulous partners and hackers.
The European Union has expanded anti-Russian sanctions because of Siemens
The press service of the European Union on August 4 said that anti-Russian sanctions were expanded due to a scandal around the supply of turbines produced by Siemens to the Crimea.
This was previously reported by "Arguments of the Week".
The press service of the EU Council said that sanctions against the Russian Federation were expanded due to the scandal with turbines produced by Siemens, which were allegedly delivered to the Crimea in circumvention of sanctions.
Today, the Council of Europe is considering all possible complaints and proposals of member states to expand anti-Russian sanctions.
Earlier it was reported that the final decision will be made before the end of this day, and now the decision has been made, sanctions against Russia have been expanded.
Pearson cuts another 3,000 jobs and cuts dividends to bring business back to life
On Friday, British education group Pearson announced it would cut another 3,000 jobs and reduce its preliminary dividend by 72 percent as it launched another restructuring program aimed at tackling the challenges facing their business.
These job cuts, which chief executive John Fallon says will mostly occur in late 2018 and early 2019, come in addition to the 4,000 jobs cut in the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced it plans to cut costs by a further £300 million ($394 million) in May as part of a third cost-cutting programme to try to revive businesses hit by the rapid shift to digital learning methods.
The company, which last month agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to its partner, Bertelsmann, said its outlook for the year remained unchanged after it announced a 1 percent increase in sales of its core product in the first half of the year to 2.05 billion pounds.
Attack on convoy in Kabul: NATO soldier killed in suicide bombing
According to official sources, a suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital, Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were wounded, according to a NATO report.
According to unverified data from local sources, three civilians were also killed as a result of the incident in the karabakh urban district.
The blast is the latest bloodshed to hit Afghanistan this month, killing more than 30 people in an explosion at a mosque in Herat on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people outside iraq's embassy in Kabul.
According to NATO, the explosion, which occurred on Thursday evening, happened when a joint convoy with the afghan army was attacked with a "man-carried improvised explosive device."
According to the report, all the wounded are in stable condition and are receiving treatment at the US military hospital at the Bagrama airfield.
Correspondents report that the growing power of the Taliban and a group known as the Islamic State (IS) in Karabakh is a major source of concern for NATO forces stationed nearby in Bagram.
According to the UN, in the first half of 2017, there were at least 1662 civilian casualties in Afghanistan, and about 20% of them in the capital.
In late July, a suicide car bombing killed at least 30 people in the Shia area of Kabul.
The Taliban said they carried out the attack.
On May 31, a massive downtown explosion killed more than 150 people, the country's worst-killed suicide bombing since U.S.-led forces removed the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence highlights the precarious situation in Afghanistan, while US President Donald Trump assesses whether it is necessary to increase the number of US military forces providing assistance to troops and police in the country.
According to correspondents, the terrorist attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also created a crisis of public confidence in the government, its course of action, and especially in the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
The Environmental Protection Agency after lawsuits cancels the decision to postpone the adoption of the law on air pollution
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reversed a decision to delay passage of an Obama-era law that would require states to limit emissions that pollute the air, a day after 15 states sued the agency over the move.
On Wednesday evening, the Environmental Protection Agency announced its decision to implement the so-called "ozone measurements - 2015", stressing that this step shows the agency's willingness to cooperate with the states.
"We believe in dialogue with and responsiveness to our partners in the states," Environmental Protection Agency Chief Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the Environment Agency's intention to defer ozone measurements, in which existing air pollution is measured in different parts of the country, to determine where it needs to be reduced so that it meets stricter air purity standards, for one year, until October 2018.
On Tuesday, a group of 15 states, mostly Democratic, along with the Federal District of Columbia, filed a lawsuit alleging that the intention was illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration is trying to roll back a wide range of environmental protection regulations introduced by the previous president, Barack Obama, as part of a broader program aimed, according to Trump, at brilliant economic growth.
But action in this direction has drawn resistance from Democrats and environmental organizations concerned about the possible impact of large emissions on public health.
The Environmental Protection Agency's website says that using ozone-containing air for breathing "may impair lung function and increase respiratory symptoms," such as asthma.
The Association of European Businesses opposed the new anti-Russian sanctions
The Association of European Businesses expressed disagreement with the US economic sanctions against the Russian Federation.
According to the AEB, such measures can lead to a serious reduction in production and the number of jobs.
In a statement, the AEB said that business is one of the important links between countries and people, so the principles of free trade should not be limited.
European business unites more than 500 companies from the countries of the European Union and the European Free Trade Association.
The Association calls on the heads of state and government of the EU, the United States and Russia to develop a new line of action that would allow to separate business from politics and find a common, mutually acceptable solution in the spirit of peace and harmony.
Deputies ask the police to limit traffic on the embankment in Pskov
Pskov people's deputies sent an appeal to the head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs for the city Sergey Surin about the problem of movement along the embankment of the Velikaya River.
Deputies of the City Duma Konstantin Bolotin, Grigory Storonenkov and Valery Lesnikov believe that motorists prevent people from walking and relaxing in this place.
In their opinion, the control of drivers will help make this territory more calm and safe.
The problem is that violators ignore the signs "Pedestrian path" and freely ride along the embankment.
It turns out that major repairs and landscaping were carried out in vain.
Sports and children's playgrounds become uncomfortable because of the cars.
As noted by the Pskov Information Agency, in the evenings the central embankment is patrolled by employees of the motor patrol of the PPS and vigilantes.
Thanks to them, the number of passing cars becomes less, but the traffic does not stop completely.
Putin demanded from the investigating authorities not to seize hard drives
Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed to prohibit the investigative bodies not to seize servers and hard drives from working computers at enterprises.
The head of state said this at a meeting on investment programs for the development of the Far East.
According to the president, it is necessary to "exclude the use in the interests of the investigation of measures leading to the suspension of the activities of enterprises, including the removal of hard drives from working computers and servers."
Putin noted that if the investigators have such a need, "it is enough to make copies, certify them and use them during the investigation."
The head of state added that it is impossible to "create conditions that prevent the continuation of the company's activities up to the impossibility of paying taxes."
Olga Buzova told how much she wanted to call her ex-husband
TV presenter Olga Buzova admitted that she really wanted to call her ex-husband - football player Dmitry Tarasov.
At the moment, the celebrity is in the United States, where he is engaged in work issues.
Just the day before, Olga visited Las Vegas, after which she decided to publish a post on the social network Instagram.
She reported that she did not marry, did not make new tattoos, and also did not call her ex-husband with the words that he ruined her life, although she really wanted to do it.
Buzova said she would remember the trip forever because she had a great time.
British actor Robert Hardy has died
British actor Robert Hardy, who played the Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge in the film adaptation of the series of novels about Harry Potter, died at the 92nd year of life.
This was reported on Thursday by the newspaper "Independent".
About the death of the actor told his relatives.
According to them, he lived "a huge life, having achieved success in film, theater and television in 70 years of his career."
Hardy was born in 1925 in the English resort town of Cheltenham.
In 1959, on the stage of the Royal Shakespeare Theater, he played with Laurence Olivier in The Tragedy of Coriolanus.
Hardy is also remembered for repeatedly playing the roles of Prime Minister Winston Churchill, including in one of the film adaptations of Agatha Christie's works about Miss Marple.
For his performance of the role of Churchill in the BBC television drama Winston Churchill: The Wilderness Years (1981), he was awarded the British Academy of Motion Picture and Television Arts (BAFTA) Award.
Robert Hardy also had the role of US President Franklin Delano Roosevelt more than once.
Something is rotten in the Danish state: Prince Henrik, but in fact Henri Marie Jean André, Count of Laborde, refused to be buried with his crowned wife, Queen Margrethe.
This year, the couple has a "golden" wedding, but the couple's agenda is not preparations for the celebrations, but a grave dispute.
His Highness renounced the title of Prince Consort, and he quipped the Queen that she had never granted him the title of King Consort.
Henrik lives in France, although he remains officially the Queen's husband.
The Russian Foreign Ministry urged Washington to stop slandering Moscow
The Russian Foreign Ministry reacted to the statements of Mike Pence, who accused Moscow of trying to destabilize the Balkans.
The corresponding statement was distributed by the Foreign Ministry some time ago.
In its commentary, the Foreign Ministry pointed out that the United States is increasingly using cold war clichés that are inadequate to modern reality.
In addition, Russian diplomats called on the US authorities to stop slandering the Russian Federation.
As "Arguments of the Week" wrote the day before, US Vice President Mike Pence accused Moscow of trying to destabilize the western Balkans and organize a failed coup in Montenegro.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, there is talk about the possibility of a decisive fight
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who appear to be steadily moving towards having the most exciting boxing match in the under-147weight division in the near future, met for the first time on Thursday.
They occupied separate rooms in ESPN's Los Angeles offices until Garcia, the undefeated lightweight champion of the World Boxing Council, walked down the hallway to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization's second featherweight champion.
Following Garcia's unanimous victory over former four-weight world champion Erian Broner on Saturday on Showtime, both boxers are among the top five boxers regardless of weight classes.
Garcia held out his right hand and said, "How are you, champion?
Good luck."
Lomachenko defends his belt in a fight with Miguel Marriaga on Saturday at seven o'clock in the evening on ESPN.
When the boxers posed for a photo, Lomachenko's manager Egis Klimas remarked that a potential decisive fight between them would be just right.
"I used to be at featherweight," Garcia said.
"I climbed the category for Broner '140 pounds], but I'm not that big.
I'm not enough for 140.
I want to go down to the feather.
And he needs to go up to the featherweight [up to 135 pounds] and then we'll have a fight.
That's what the fans want.
Let's give it to them."
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boxing needs this fight."
Klimas asked if the fight should be streamed through the PPV service as part of the strategy he has to have Lomachenko have his debut fight at weight 135 later this year to schedule a meeting next summer with Garcia (37-0, 30 KOs), who is also interested in battling the winner of the fight between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell after their fight for the world lightweight title at the Forum Arena on September 23.
"A fight could be at a PPV because all the fans have asked for it," Garcia said, later expressing a willingness to fight on the channel that would offer better financial terms.
"We are the main names.
No other names will generate as much interest.
As soon as they're ready..."
Garcia said he thought Lomachenko was a "terrific boxer" and might attend his Saturday fight.
But Lomachenko didn't immediately shower Garcia with praise and said he thought the three-weight champion from Riverside looked "very slow, sorry, Mikey ... you were begging for a knockout."
Garcia said he focused on showing the strength of the punch and then boxing.
They both said they could feel the tension build up before their own fight.
"This fight has to take place.
No other fight generates so much interest and conversation.
I'm more than happy to work on it," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: "I was waiting for one of the top boxers, and here he is, Mikey.
It's going to be a great fight."
On several central streets of Moscow will block traffic for the weekend
This weekend, on August 5 and 6, traffic will be limited in the capital on the section of Tverskaya Street from Nastasyinsky Lane to Triumphal Square, as well as traffic on 1st Tverskaya-Yamskaya Street.
In addition, the passage will be closed on Leningradsky Prospekt, from the Third Transport Ring to the 1st Tverskaya-Yamskaya Street.
In all areas, the overlap will operate on both lanes, according to the information center of the Moscow Department of Transport.
The streets will be closed from midnight on August 5 to 5 a.m. on August 7 due to their improvement.
Also at the weekend, traffic will be closed on the section of the Moskvoretskaya embankment.
The construction of the Zaryadye Park continues there.
Putin instructed the Prosecutor General's Office to check Baikal
Russian President Vladimir Putin instructed the Prosecutor General's Office of the Russian Federation to check the territory of Lake Baikal for facts of illegal and environmentally harmful activities.
"I ask the Prosecutor General's Office to check the Baikal territory for facts of illegal and environmentally harmful activities," Vladimir Putin said at a meeting on the environmental development of the region.
In addition, the Russian leader asked to take measures if the facts of violations are revealed.
New test results published to assess the age of asylum seekers in Sweden
The latest test results of asylum seekers in Sweden who were subjected to a new method of medical age assessment show that more than 80 percent of those tested were assessed as over 18 years of age, but not everyone trusts the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish National Forensic Medicine Agency (Rättsmedicinalverket) began conducting tests earlier this year.
They were designed to make age estimates in the asylum process more accurate, after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticized for failing to determine the true age of some refugees who claimed to be minors.
So far, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases for testing, and the forensic agency has now released the results of 2,481 tests between mid-March and July 31, 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) of those tested were rated as 18 years of age or older, and in another 25 cases, the forensic science agency rated that the test taker was "probably a person 18 years of age or older."
In the case of 432 cases, the opinion stated that the person was "probably under 18".
Tests are carried out only in cases where the person's age is in doubt.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are in line with those of past months.
"We don't see much difference with the statistics for the past months, the numbers are quite appropriate," he told The Local.
The high proportion of cases in which people were assessed as having reached the age of 18 does not necessarily indicate that asylum-seekers lied about their age.
In May, the agency released the results of 581 tests and reported that in 442 cases, "most likely, the age of the test taker is 18 years or more."
However, after reviewing 581 published results, the newspaper "Svenska Dagbladet" found that in 243 cases a person openly stated that he turned 18 this year.
The method of conducting a medical age assessment, consisting of making x-rays of wisdom teeth and tomography of the knee joints and giving them for analysis to dentists and radiologists, also caused criticism in some instances.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at the Karolinska Institutet, whose work is to assess the biological maturity of people in order to determine whether they have gone through puberty earlier or later than usual.
"I had reasons to think about it, and I don't think you need to use the methods of measurement that are used now.
Biological age is thus determined very inaccurately.
If we can't define it with certainty, we shouldn't pretend we can," he told the Metro newspaper.
However, Göranssen of the Forensic Medicine Agency spoke in favor of the accuracy of the tests: "In general, it can be said that the risk of mistaken a child for an adult is small.
The biggest risk we face is when a person is about 18, in which case he is about 10 percent. "
I'll think about whether to run for president.
During a working trip to Buryatia, Vladimir Putin said that he was ready to think about whether he would run for president of Russia in the elections in 2018, Interfax reports.
This statement was a reaction to the request of residents of the village of Cheremushki, Buryat region.
During a video conference dedicated to the liquidation of the fire in Buryatia and the Irkutsk region, the interlocutor addressed Putin with the words: "Vladimir Vladimirovich, we have a request for you: when the next presidential elections are held, we all ask you to run again for this post."
"Okay, I'll think about it, thank you," the president said in response.
On July 28, the press secretary of the President of Russia Dmitry Peskov commented on the statements of some media that the election headquarters of Vladimir Putin will be headed by the head of the presidential administration of the Russian Federation Anton Vaino.
Peskov called these assumptions "unfounded, hypothetical reasoning."
"So far there are no headquarters, the creation of headquarters is far away, the election campaign is far away," Peskov said.
"So far, this is not on the agenda," Peskov said.
West Virginia Governor Says He's Moving to Another Party
West Virginia Democratic Gov. Jim Justice announced Thursday during a rally attended by President Trump that he was moving to another party.
"Like it or not, Democrats have distanced themselves from me," Gov. Justice said.
"Today I speak to you with many prayers and many reflections... today I say to you, the people of West Virginia, 'I can no longer be of service to you by remaining a Democratic governor.'"
The rally erupted in applause.
"So tomorrow I will change my registration to a Republican," Justice added.
"As a coach, I would tell you it's time to play differently."
Earlier, Trump promised that an important statement would be made at the rally in West Virginia.
Trump won West Virginia by a margin of 42 percent, and Justice did not support the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who, according to Forbes, is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, as he inherited the coal business from his father.
His fortune is estimated at $ 1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee issued a statement Thursday night that "Gov. Justice's transition to another party is another blow to the Democratic Party, which is hindering rather than working to make our country great again."
"With just 15 governors and control of the smallest number of state legislatures in history, Governor Justice's announcement is just another rejection of a party that lacks leaders from top to bottom and is unable to find a positive, unifying message," Republican National Committee spokeswoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
A heavyweight cat named Mr. Handsome found a home thanks to social networks
The cattery of the city of Pittsboro (North Carolina, USA) attached a cat named Mr. Handsome weighing more than 14 kilograms after he became famous thanks to the Internet.
It is reported by Mashable.
At the end of June, a photo of the cat was published on the cattery's Facebook account with a request to find its owner, because "it was clearly fed by someone before."
In the comments, users noted that the expression of the animal's muzzle could become a new meme.
The post gained more than 3.2 thousand likes and 15 thousand comments.
In the comments, dozens of people expressed a desire to shelter Mr. Handsome.
As a result, it was given to the hands of Angela Frazee, who promised to deal with his excess weight.
In an interview on WNCN radio, the American said that she had already had a similar experience: she took home a cat weighing about 10 kilograms, and now it weighs a little more than five.
In July, Reddit users drew attention to a cat from Australia with unusually long legs.
The post with a photo of the animal collected more than 68 thousand views.
Commentators noted that she could well make a career in the modeling business.
Coe praised Russia's "sincere" apology over doping scandal
International athletics expert Sebastian Coe on Thursday praised what he called a sincere apology from Russia over the doping scandal, but reiterated that now is not the right time to allow the country to participate in sports competitions again.
The Russian representative of the Athletics Federation, Dmitry Shlyakhtin, said at the congress of the International Association of Athletics Federations, which was held on the eve of the World Athletics Championships, that the suspension of his country from sports competitions was fair and that he was determined to fight doping.
He apologized to "all athletes from whom gold and silver medals were stolen at the competitions."
Despite his comments, the Congress of the International Association of Athletics Federations voted to maintain the suspension imposed in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) published a report on evidence of state-sponsored doping.
"It seemed to me that today's response, today's report, was very sincere," Coe, president of the International Association of Athletics Federations, told reporters.
"The whole council and the whole congress liked ... that the Russian Federation itself admits that it has experienced extremely hot times and is now doing everything possible to take care of the restructuring of the federation."
Coe said he also "liked" that Russia agreed to the criteria for its reinstatement.
"I think it was a very constructive day and that we're moving forward, but Congress supports the special commission's recommendations that now is not the time to reinstate Russia," Coe said.
"Over the next few months, we must do everything to settle this situation.
Our guiding principle was our desire to separate clean athletes from the tarnished system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes who meet the strict criteria of the International Association of Athletics Federations will participate under a neutral flag in the World Championships in Athletics, which begins on Friday in London.
The head of a special commission of the International Association of Athletics Federations, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that a number of requirements have yet to be met for Russia to recover.
As he told reporters in London after a report made at the council of the International Association of Athletics Federations, drug testing is still not carried out in sufficient volume, and suspended coaches are still quietly doing their job.
Court arrests Ukrainian journalist suspected of treason
Detained by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), journalist Vasyl Muravitsky was sent under arrest for two months, the SBU reports.
An employee of the online publication "Zhurnal Zhytomyra" is suspected of treason by posting his publications on Russian websites and encroaching on the territorial integrity of Ukraine.
At the same time, Russia does not support the measures of the Ukrainian authorities against the journalist, considering it a "barbaric policy" against the media.
Two years after the peak of the migration crisis in Europe, Italy decided on a limited military operation in the Mediterranean.
The patrol ship "Comandante Borsini" entered the territorial waters of Libya, then together with the Navy of this country to stop the influx of illegal migrants.
The decision to launch the operation was taken by the Italian parliament on Wednesday.
Rome agreed it with the internationally recognized government of Libya, which, however, does not control most of the country's territory.
The tobruk-based Libyan parliament, which opposes the cabinet, has accused Italy of violating Libya's sovereignty.
And the commander of the Libyan National Army, Field Marshal Haftar, gave his subordinates the order to counteract the Italian ships.
In Rome, however, they said that they do not believe these threats and intend to send another warship to Libyan territorial waters.
The situation was discussed last week at talks between Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni and the head of the European-recognized Libyan cabinet, Fayez Sarraj.
The Italian authorities decided to establish a maritime mission to combat illegal migration after statistics on the number of illegal immigrants who sailed to the country from Libya were published in July: 95 thousand people since the beginning of the year.
The government said that resources for the reception of migrants have been exhausted.
A large-scale failure occurred in Skype
A global failure in the work of the Skype service was recorded today in several countries of the world.
Users on Thursday, August 3, began to massively send complaints to the developers of the program.
Microsoft stressed that experts are already actively working to eliminate the problems faced by residents of Europe and North America, RIA Novosti reports.
Recall that in June of this year, Skype also had a failure.
Users have been unable to send or receive messages for some time.
Two leaders of the Ukrainian national athletics team were suspended from participation in the World Cup
Olga Zemlyak and Olesya Povkh, who specialize in short-distance running, were excluded from the Ukrainian national team for the 2017 World Championships in London.
This was reported on the website of the Athletics Federation of the country (FLAU).
This decision was made by the executive committee of the organization in connection with the initiation by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) of disciplinary proceedings against track and field athletes.
Coach Serhiy Basenko was also excluded from the Ukrainian delegation.
According to Sportarena, the IAAF suspects athletes of doping.
Povh is the bronze medalist of the 2012 Olympics and the 2011 World Championships, the 2010 European champion in the 4 x 100 meters relay, the Countryman is the winner of the 2012 European Championship in the 4 x 400 meters relay.
The World Athletics Championships in London will be held from 4 to 13 August.
How football's financial rules will affect Neymar's move to Paris
Rules aimed at preventing unlimited spending by European football clubs will not prevent the world-record-setting transfer of Neymar from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris Saint-Germain.
Any consequences could come further down the chain for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, the governing body that oversees European football, whose power to ban teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League tournament.
From the rules of financial "fair play", introduced by UEFA in 2011, it follows that PSG will eventually have to show that the transfer of Neymar was financed without major losses.
Barcelona were paid 222 million euros ($262 million) just to release the Brazilian from his contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
PSG could definitely fork out to hire Neymar and add him to the galaxy of other stars, given the team's funding from Qatar's energy-rich ruling family.
Clubs have the right to spend large sums to acquire players, but they have to balance them with legitimate sources of income in order to reach the threshold of profitability in their football business.
FFP was introduced by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA president in 2007.
The former French footballer believed that clubs that went into huge debt in their quest for success were essentially cheating and risking ruin if banks or owners stopped financing.
In 2011, FFP stopped focusing on the clubs' debts and instead switched to tracking their losses.
As a consequence of this change, the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used at Chelsea in 2003 – to buy a club with good potential and then spend heavily to improve the team and create a global brand – has become a difficult plan.
During the current three-year evaluation period, which is exciting in 2018, clubs could suffer losses of €30 million.
And, despite the fact that Platini was disgracefully removed from the presidency in 2015, his successor in UEFA, Alexander Ceferin, is still determined to restrain excessive spending.
"Of course, the FFP is alive and we will tighten the rules as we move forward," Andrea Traverso, who controls the FFP at UEFA, told the Associated Press last week.
Although PSG will pay for the purchase of Neymar's contract in a lump sum, he can distribute this amount for reporting throughout the term of his contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so the transfer value can be shown in the annual accounts as an expense of 44.4 million euros over the next five years.
During the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, PSG, as well as Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City, were subjected to severe sanctions.
PSG were fined €60 million (at that rate of $82 million), which was later reduced to €20 million, and were ordered to limit their team's champions league roster during the 2014-1015 season to 21 players instead of the usual 25.
UEFA tracks clubs that may try to outsmart its financial supervisors by inflating their revenue at the expense of companies linked to the club's owners.
Although the Qatari company could sponsor PSG, but if the amount of financing was considered to exceed the standard market rates, UEFA would not allow it to be considered legitimate income.
This is exactly what happened in 2014, when UEFA ruled that the amount of funding for PSG from the Qatar Tourism Authority had been inflated.
It was reported that part of Neymar's earnings at PSG could come in the form of payments from the organizing committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 deny that Neymar will become an ambassador for the World Cup, and such a maneuver could easily be detected by UEFA inspectors.
Past sanctions imposed on PSG mean that UEFA will monitor even more closely any attempts to circumvent the rules.
As reported on Thursday by persons familiar with the situation, UEFA did not conduct preliminary discussions with PSG about the transfer of Neymar.
They spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity as they are not authorized to discuss PSG's position.
According to the latest published reports, in 2015-1016, PSG received more than 10 million euros of profit with a turnover of 542.4 million euros.
The financial statements for the last financial year have not yet been published.
PSG expects that the arrival of Neymar will be a fertile ground for sponsorship deals, the sale of paraphernalia and shirts with the team's logo.
The club expects turnover to grow by at least 30 percent as a result of hiring a new player.
Undoubtedly angry that one of the best players was leaving, the Spanish league tried to prevent the transfer of Neymar, saying that PSG would violate the financial "fair play".
"This is an obvious case of 'financial doping', with the club and the state," La Liga president Javier Tebas told the Spanish newspaper AS, referring to Qatar as the ultimate owner.
Arsenal coach Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares La Liga's doubts about the club's funding by the state.
"These are all the consequences of equity participation, and it has completely changed the landscape of football over the past fifteen years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"When a club belongs to a country, anything is possible.
It becomes very difficult to comply with financial fair play because a country can have many paths and many reasons to be represented by such a serious player.
The order and places of taking the oath will be determined by the President
Where and how new Russian citizens will swear allegiance to the Russian Federation will be determined by the president - such amendments to the second reading to the relevant law were developed by the State Duma Committee on Legislation and State Construction.
A week ago, deputies planned to directly determine the procedure for taking the oath in the law.
Children under 18 years of age, as well as those who are incapacitated, will be exempt from taking a solemn oath, follows from the revised text of the amendments to the bill "On Citizenship of the Russian Federation" (available to Izvestia), which the committee will consider before the second reading at its meeting on July 11.
The idea of introducing an oath when entering into Russian citizenship instead of formally signing documents was supported by President Vladimir Putin on June 6 during a meeting with State Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin.
The deputies formalized this idea in the form of an amendment to the second reading to the bill providing for the abolition of the decision to issue citizenship to those who were subsequently convicted of a number of crimes of a terrorist or extremist nature: for example, for public calls to terrorism or its public justification in the media or on the Internet (Part 2 of Article 205.2 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation), as well as for hijacking an airplane,  trains or water transport, but only if this act is related to terrorism (Part 4 of Article 211 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation).
According to the bill, its logic was as follows: when applying for citizenship, a person signs a promise to comply with Russian legislation - by embarking on the path of extremism, he violates this promise.
The bill was submitted to the State Duma in April by the leaders of the Duma factions Vladimir Vasilyev ("United Russia"), Gennady Zyuganov (CPRF), Vladimir Zhirinovsky (LDPR), Sergei Mironov ("Fair Russia") and the Speaker of the State Duma Vyacheslav Volodin.
On May 19, deputies adopted it in the first reading.
Last week, the State Duma Committee on State Construction and Legislation approved the text of the bill for the second reading, but now it has been revised once again.
Now it says that the order of taking the oath will be established by the President of the Russian Federation.
Earlier, parliamentarians were going to describe the procedure directly in the law "On Citizenship of the Russian Federation", indicating that the ceremony should take place in a solemn atmosphere in front of the state emblem and flag of Russia in the presence of a representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
However, it was not clear from the text of the bill where such an event should take place - the list of places where it is possible to place the coat of arms of the Russian Federation is regulated by the relevant federal constitutional law.
These include the courts, the offices of the heads of state authorities of the regions, municipalities, judges, prosecutors, heads of federal executive bodies, etc.
Most likely, it could be registry offices.
Those wishing to obtain Russian citizenship will pronounce a solemn oath after officials check their documents.
But a person will receive a Russian passport only after he takes the oath, follows from the revised text.
A week ago, the draft stated that the oath should precede the signing of the decree.
The updated text says that Russia will be sworn in from the age of 18, and not from 14.
The rule has been preserved according to which the incapacitated or limited legal capacity, as well as those who cannot pronounce, read or personally sign the text of the oath, will be exempted from taking the oath.
In addition, the President of the Russian Federation has the right to exempt from this procedure and "other persons",
Also, the updated bill prescribes a special procedure for the admission of Russian citizens to residents of Ukraine who are considered native speakers of the Russian language.
They will have to officially renounce Ukrainian citizenship by submitting a corresponding application to the authorized body of Ukraine.
A notarized copy of the application will need to be handed over to Russian officials.
The renunciation of "foreign" nationality, as it is now, will not be required if it is provided for in an international treaty or if this is not possible "for reasons beyond the control of the person".
The corresponding amendment to the law was proposed by a group of deputies, including First Deputy Speaker of the State Duma Ivan Melnikov (CpRF), Natalia Poklonskaya, Pavel Krasheninnikov and Airat Farrakhov (all from United Russia).
I think many of you know that getting a certificate from Ukraine is unrealistic, simply impossible.
Accordingly, a lot of people are waiting for the decision of their fate regarding the citizenship of the Russian Federation, - explained on the eve of the head of the Duma Committee on State Construction and Legislation Pavel Krasheninnikov (UR).
In addition, the text clarified that restrictions on holding certain positions for foreigners will not apply to those who have writtenly renounced "other" citizenship and handed over the previous passport to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia, but "for reasons beyond his control" he has not ceased to be considered a citizen of another country.
Now foreigners are forbidden to hold positions in the municipal service, to be hired at facilities and organizations whose activities are related to ensuring the security of Russia.
Also, a person with dual citizenship or a residence permit of another country cannot become a deputy of the State Duma or a member of the Federation Council.
It is planned that the law should come into force on September 1, 2017, by which time the necessary by-laws should be ready.
Nostalgia becomes a niche in "Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"
The current iteration of the story is nostalgically reminiscent of the characters' glorious days in the '80s; about the era of grunge in the 90s (around the time when the outstanding masters David Wayne and Michael Schowalter made the comedy sketches "The State" for MTV); and about herself - that is, about 2001, before her stars, as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd moved on to more serious things.
As a fact of culture, it is both the rise and embodiment of our era with its constant reminders from Facebook.
But as a franchise, it seems anachronistic.
"The First Day of Camp" was surprisingly good, and not just because of the absurdist humor (including the original story of a talking can of vegetables, which was voiced by H. John Benjamin).
The result doubles the main joke: middle-aged actors play sexually anxious children who have just reached adulthood; thanks to this, the inability to return to the joke becomes part of the joke.
Ten Years Later, where adults played adults, has less deep emotional roots, and its parody is more haphazard and includes riffs from '90s stalker films like The Hand Rocking the Cradle.
In one episode, the character pulls out an Apple Powerbook, four-wheeled roller skates, and "a bunch of other things from 1991."
Many of the plot moves are the same.
Good-natured Koop (Showalter), now a writer, still hasn't gotten any reciprocity from Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn't given up his virginity.
And then there's the crazy and dastardly conspiracy involving Ronald Reagan (also Showalter), who is now instigated by George H.W. Bush (a tried and tested parody played by Michael Ian Blake).
As always, the best part of the franchise is deviating from it.
It's especially funny to see the eternally young Rudd humming Matt Dillon's song from Loners, whose character, the former big man Andy, now looks like an old man.
The franchise could be successful with occasional follies like the recursive series Seven Up, until it gets to what I think would be its logical conclusion: "A Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," where in the last scene the whole company would go to the cinema for the premiere of the film "Hot American Summer."
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon appeals to another type of nostalgia: memories of the Cold War from "The Americans," "Explosive Blonde," or even "Glitter," with its images of East-West struggles.
This comedy, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaca with director Reese Thomas, depicts a TV movie: a Romanian police drama of the 80s about two policemen in Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the Marxist-Leninist way.
The main roles - gregor who has seen the life and the idealist Josef - are performed by Florin Piersik Jr. and Corneliu Ulić, and their dialogues in English are voiced by Channing Tatum (he is also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitte.
It's a brilliant idea.
But just an idea.
There are a few visual jokes (police officers spend time watching a chess match, just as Americans might watch football).
A team of famous voice-over voices - among them Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny - allows you to play "guess the voice" in an interesting way.
But "Comrade Detective" clings so much to the plausibility of a clumsy propaganda drama — there's even a killer in a Ronald Reagan mask — that it often looks like it.
Six long episodes are drawn out, and it's not very funny, not often.
Had it been made shorter, Comrade Detective might have done a better job of its agitprop-esque satire; for example, every time Gregor and Josef arrive at the American embassy, two fat men sit in the lobby devouring a bunch of hamburgers.
To the imaginary communist viewer, this image tells us that Western culture can make a gluttony out of anything.
The fictional Romanian filmmakers are not so wrong: We do this even with our own recent history, and with theirs too.
The prize fund of the match for the Russian Super Cup in football between Spartak and Lokomotiv will be about 30 million rubles.
This was announced by the President of the Russian Football Premier League (RFPL) Sergey Pryadkin at a press conference.
According to the head of the RFPL, the winner will receive 70% of this amount, reports RT.
He also added that to date, there are almost no tickets left for the match.
The match "Spartak" - "Lokomotiv" will be held on Friday, July 14, at 21:30.
As noted by TASS, "Spartak" is the current champion of the Russian Federation, and "Lokomotiv" is the owner of the Cup of the country.
Two young Ufa residents cleaned the furniture shop for 200 thousand rubles
The other day, a 37-year-old Ufa resident who has a furniture company turned to the police.
The man reported the theft of expensive tools from the workshop, which caused serious damage to its production.
The thieves' prey were tools with a total value of almost 200 thousand rubles: two welding machines, a perforator, hydraulics, a winch.
The guards of order began to search for criminals and soon came to the residents of the Blagoveshchensky district of Bashkortostan, friends of 23 and 24 years old.
According to the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic, the accomplices entered the territory of the enterprise, broke the front door and took out the tools.
Immediately after that, the guys sold the stolen equipment to the first car service they came across.
A theft case has already been initiated against them, and law enforcement officers managed to return only a part of the stolen tools to the rightful owner.
The State Department commented on Medvedev's words about relations between the Russian Federation and the United States
The U.S. and Russia must be able to work with each other.
This statement was made by the official representative of the State Department Heather Nauert in response to the words of Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev about relations between the two states.
Earlier, the head of the Russian government said that by adopting new anti-Russian sanctions, the United States put an end to the hope for improving bilateral relations and declared a full-fledged trade war on the Russian Federation.
Commenting on these words, Nauert admitted that Russian-American relations are at a "low level", but noted that it is necessary to look for "areas for interaction".
"Look at the truce in southwest Syria, which has been observed for almost a month."
"And this is an example of good cooperation between the United States and Russia," RIA Novosti quoted the diplomat as saying.
At the same time, the representative of the Foreign Ministry refused to comment on the statement of the Russian Prime Minister that sanctions are tantamount to a trade war.
The bill on new sanctions against Russia, Iran and the DPRK was signed by US President Donald Trump last Wednesday.
At the same time, he admitted that the document is unsuccessful and contradicts the American Constitution.
Dior "grew" roses from amethyst and quartz
The jewelry division of the French fashion house Dior - Dior Joaillerie - has replenished the collections of Rose Dior Bagatelle and Bois de Rose.
They have five new rings and three choker necklaces on velvet ribbons.
The Rose Dior Pré Catelan line features two new rings and a pendant made of amethyst, rose quartz and diamonds made in the technique of glyptics (hand carving on stone) and pavage and dedicated to the 70th anniversary of the house.
The head of the Dior Joaillerie, Victoire de Castellane, was inspired by the roses that the fashion designer Christian Dior grew on his estate in Granville, and the Parisian gardens of Bagatelle and Pré-Catelan.
Trump found the culprits of the deterioration of relations with Russia
US President Donald Trump has sharply criticized members of Congress.
According to the American leader, their actions led to a deterioration in relations with Russia.
Our relations with Russia are at an all-time low and dangerous level.
"You can thank Congress, these same people can't even give us medicine," the president wrote on Twitter.
On the eve of Donald Trump signed a law on new sanctions against Russia, Iran and the DPRK.
They, in particular, will affect Russian banks and energy companies.
Subsequently, the White House issued a statement by the president, in which he indicated that the law would not allow the United States to conclude profitable deals and would bring Russia, China and North Korea even closer together.
Belarusian businessman refused to buy Ukrainian daughter of Sberbank
Entrepreneur from Belarus Viktor Prokopenya withdrew from the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) an application for the purchase of a subsidiary of Sberbank.
The businessman explained his decision to RBC by the intention to "concentrate on our other planned investments and projects that we are working on."
According to Mr. Prokopeni, such a step will be "the best investment of time", despite the investment attractiveness of buying a daughter of Sberbank.
Mr. Prokopenya became the main contender for the purchase of the Russian bank's unit in Ukraine after the NBU in July rejected the application of grigory Guselnikov's NorvikBank consortium and the Belarusian company Said Gutseriev.
Russian banks began to leave the Ukrainian market after the country's President Petro Poroshenko imposed sanctions on their subsidiaries in March.
One of these financial organizations - in addition to VTB and Vnesheconombank - was Sberbank.
Novak called the reason for the blackout in the Crimea
The Ministry of Energy of the Russian Federation called the reason for the blackout in the Crimea.
Explanations about the incident were made by the head of the department Alexander Novak.
According to him, the peninsula was left without electricity due to a traffic accident in the territory of the Krasnodar Territory.
The truck involved in the accident touched the power lines, as a result of which the Kuban and related Crimean networks were disconnected.
Failures in the power supply of large Crimean cities were recorded last week.
Specialists fixed the problems within a few hours.
Initially, it was reported that the cause of the blackout could be an abnormal heat.
The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to later announce that interest rates will not change after weak economic growth and weakening inflation made rumors of a possible hike subside.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth would remain leisurely, and left interest rates unchanged amid growing pressure on household incomes.
The bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 6-to-2 to keep rates at 0.25%, with fewer members of the committee calling for a rate hike this month because weak economic growth weakened support for the hike.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank limited its upward forecasts to 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 and warned that pressure on household incomes would continue, while inflation is still expected to rise to around 3% in the fall.
However, the bank warned that rate hikes in the next few years would be needed to control Brexit-induced inflation and said borrowing costs would likely have to be raised more than expected in financial markets.
Also, members of the committee voted to abandon part of the huge set of measures for the development of the economy, launched a year ago as a result of Brexit.
Starting next February, the bank will close a term financing plan under which it provides banks with cheap loans, although it said it now has to provide another 15 billion pounds under this plan - up to 115 billion pounds.
In its rate decision minutes, the bank said: "According to the MPC's core forecasts, gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the near term remains slow, while pressures on real household incomes continue to weigh on consumption."
On the issue of rates, he reiterated that in order to stop inflation, "some tightening of financial policy" would be required, at a "slightly larger" rate than the markets expected.
At the moment, markets are predicting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
But the bank stressed that all increases will be "gradual" and "limited."
The bank's forecasts for an increase this year and next year are lower than forecasts made in May, which were equal to 1.9% and 1.7%.
The bank left unchanged its forecast of 1.8% in 2018.
After this news, sterling fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell 0.5% to $1.31 and 0.4% to €1.11.
The decision not to change the rate was made after recent disappointing growth indicators weakened the increased expectation of an increase; GDP then grew by 0.3% in the second quarter against 0.2% in the previous three months.
According to the representative of the bank, growth, apparently, will remain at the level of 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will begin to increase slightly at the end of the year.
The bank's latest inflation report gave little reason to rejoice for households hit by high inflation and very minor wage increases: the bank said the pressure would increase before declining.
The bank added that fiscal policy "cannot prevent" the udao on earnings in the next few years, but expects wages to recover "significantly" by the end of its three-year forecast.
The economy is also set to grow as a result of growing demand for British goods, due to the low exchange rate of the pound, which compensates for some of the reduced consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after rates were cut to 0.25% last August after the shocking results of the referendum on leaving the European Union, which led to the fall of the pound.
The bank estimates that it will likely take four years to fully impact prices and the economy.
Before the bank issued its last rate ruling, there was growing buzz around the proposed rate hike as inflation weighed more and more on already under pressure on households, with three members of the committee asking for rates to be raised to 0.5% in July.
Last month, inflation fell to 2.6% from 2.9% in July, although, according to the bank, this drop was expected and will be compensated again in the coming months.
According to the bank, the higher figure compared to the planned 2% is entirely a consequence of the low exchange rate of the pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of Mortgage Brokers Coreco, said: "Given the recent drop in swap rates, it looks like the mortgage market will once again become even more competitive as lenders demand business opportunities and expect a good end to the year.
The market looks particularly favorable for those approaching the end of their existing contracts, as refinancing loans, often with the possibility of no commission, as well as with a low rate, is becoming more popular than ever."
NHS to prescribe controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people
Starting in September, patients will have access to a "revolutionary" HIV prevention drug after a High Court battle over funding for the drug from the NHS.
The National Health Service of England has announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV (PrEP), a pre-sex pill that has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in people at risk by an average of 86 per cent, will now be provided by health services over an initial three-year probationary period of approximately 10,000 people.
She agreed to fund the trial after an appeals court upheld a High Court ruling last year arguing that the NHS had the ability to pay for the PrEP despite its claims it should be funded by local authorities.
The move, which was announced on Thursday, was described as a "major innovation" by National Health Service England President Simon Stevens, and the National AIDS Control Authority (NAT) called it a "turning point".
Ahead of the full launch of the programme across England by April 2018, venereal dispensaries in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to start registering people, with even more dispensaries joining the programme in October.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a course of HIV medications taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces the risk of HIV infection among people at risk.
When taking PrEP before sex in the human body, there are enough certain drugs to prevent infection with HIV infection.
Such drugs can be taken daily or no later than two hours before sex.
Eligible patients include gay and bisexual men, transgender people and people whose partners are HIV-positive and do not receive successful treatment.
Dispensaries will select eligible participants who agreed to participate in the study, including men, women, transgender people and individuals whose partners are not known whether their HIV status is contained by antiretroviral therapy.
People living and assigned to a GP in England will also be able to apply for potential participation in the nearest venereal disease dispensary taking part in the programme.
The programme will cost £10 million, and England's National Health Service this week signed a contract to provide the drug after an international procurement tender.
The study is structured in such a way as to assess the full possibilities of PrEP by collecting clinical data on who is the target audience of the drug, its digestibility and use on a large scale.
"This critical innovation should complement and strengthen large-scale and increasingly successful hiv prevention efforts.
This is another milestone in more than three decades of success in the fight against one of the biggest health threats facing humanity.
Deborah Gold, President of NAT (National AIDS Control Authority), said: "This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if properly targeted at people in need of help and at risk, provides an opportunity to change the state of affairs with the HIV epidemic in England.
Starting in September, people at risk for HIV will have access to a new, empowering tool that a person can control without discussing it with a partner through this study in England, which will improve many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this news."
Ian Green, president of the Terrence Higgins Foundation, said: "The first priority now is to ensure that the trial unfolds quickly across the country and that no one at risk for HIV is left behind.
Now that we are provided with the experimental drug PrEP, we are on our way to protecting the more than 10,000 people at risk for HIV."
Shadow Minister of Public Health Sharon Hodgson said: "We very much welcome the start of the PrEP trial, it is very late due to months of delays and delays by the government."
The data demonstrate how revolutionary this drug can become as part of our approach to preventing HIV and stopping the transmission of this fatal infection.
This test will bring us one step closer to a full understanding of the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that the trial be deployed across the country as soon as possible to protect people at risk for HIV and to take us one step further towards stopping the spread of HIV in society.
The World Congress of Tatars adopted a resolution on supporting the treaty of Tatarstan and Russia
The Sixth Congress of the World Congress of Tatars (CGT) adopted a resolution in which it noted the importance of maintaining the post of president in Tatarstan.
According to the document, the post is "a positively proven form of organization of the highest state power in the republic and expressing the national interests of the entire Tatar people."
In addition, the congress stressed in the resolution the importance of the agreement on the division of powers between Russia and Tatarstan.
According to the document, he "played a positive role in the ethno-cultural, socio-economic and socio-political development of Tatarstan and the Russian Federation as a whole."
Recall that the agreement between Moscow and Kazan, which has been in force since July 24, 2007, was concluded for 10 years.
On July 11, deputies of the State Council of Tatarstan appealed to the President of Russia with a request to extend the agreement and keep the name of the post of the head of the region.
Now Tatarstan is the only subject of the federation that has an agreement with Russia.
The head of the region is the only one whose position is called "president".
In Russia, there were difficulties in obtaining an international driver's license
Traffic police units are experiencing a shortage of international driver's licenses (IDPs).
To get such a license, you have to wait in line for several weeks, which has become a real problem for vacationers who want to go on vacation abroad in their car or rent it there.
It is worth noting that the situation with international driving permits remains contradictory.
The IDP was introduced to make it easier for the foreign police to understand what is written in the national identity card, since the information in it is explained in five languages.
Requirements for international rights are written in the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic of 1968, but in countries that have ratified the Vienna Convention, Russian rights are recognized as such.
However, in reality, it all depends on the specific police or rental office: some require an IDP, and someone has enough national rights.
To hedge their bets, drivers still receive international rights, but it should be borne in mind that in countries that have not ratified the convention (for example, the USA, Spain, Mexico, Indonesia), the authorities have the right not to recognize either national rights or IDPs.
Now there is a problem with forms in almost all traffic police units, Kommersant reports, having conducted a study in a number of regions.
So, in Moscow, in the units of the traffic police, coupons are simply not issued, the forms have not been enough for four months.
You can make an appointment on the website of public services, but there the queue has already stretched until mid-August.
In Krasnoyarsk, it is impossible to get an IDP "for technical reasons" without going into details, in the Samara region they honestly say that there are no forms, a similar situation is developing in other cities.
Many Muscovites have already faced the problem, such messages are increasingly appearing in social networks:
Irina Burmistrova: "Guess why you can't get international rights in Moscow?"
That's right, because all traffic police departments ran out of forms.
Elena Podkolzina: "A question for knowledgeable people!"
We need to get international rights very urgently.
In Moscow, all the time is packed far ahead, on the spot coupons are not issued at all (there is a button, but they cannot give a coupon).
It seems that the portal of public services shows that in St. Petersburg there is no free time before the fig.
Has anyone tried to get in another city?
Work?
As explained in the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation, the requirements for the forms of international driver's licenses have changed, therefore, new forms are supplied to the units of the State Traffic Safety Inspectorate.
This may be related to the deficit, however, it is unclear what changes are in question, this has not been reported before.
The forms are purchased by the Special Purpose Center for Road Safety (TsSN BDD) of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation and then supply them to the traffic police units.
In recent years, all contracts have been concluded with Goznak JSC: in 2014-2015, almost 200 thousand IDP forms were manufactured, in 2016 15 thousand forms were purchased, in 2017 - 90 thousand, but the last contract was concluded on July 18 with LLC "First Printing Yard" for the production of 70 thousand forms.
There is a version that the CSN simply did not have time to hold the tender on time, which is why there was a shortage.
However, there are other versions of the shortage of forms: because of the crisis, many people began to independently travel not to Europe, but to cheaper Asian countries - China, Thailand and so on.
What rights are accepted there is not completely clear, that's why people are reinsured, which is why there was a rush demand for international "crusts".
Recently it became known that professional drivers will have to pass an exam to confirm their qualifications.
This proposal was made by the Ministry of Transport.
The international driving permit (IDP) of the new sample is valid from May 31, 2011.
The Minister of Justice of Ukraine refused to believe in the construction of the Crimean bridge
Ukrainian Justice Minister Pavlo Petrenko said he did not believe in Russia's ability to build a bridge to Crimea.
On Friday, August 4, he said in an interview with the portal "Obozrevatel".
No self-respecting international company will put a bolt or a nut in there, because it risks losing its business in the EU, the United States, Japan - in countries that have joined the sanctions against Russia regarding Crimea.
"That is, in my deep conviction, there are practically no prospects for this project," Petrenko said.
He added that he considers Russia unable to implement a major infrastructure project on its own.
Russia cannot normally build smaller facilities.
I know that after the Sochi Olympics, entire stadiums have already begun to collapse.
"Therefore, I believe the best tool in this situation is sanctions against companies that turned out to be so short-sighted as to join this project," the official said.
On July 31, the builders completed the construction of the arch of the automobile arch of the Crimean Bridge.
On the Kerch bank, the enlarged assembly of the road arch of the Crimean Bridge has been completed: its vault is closed at a height of 45 meters from the base of the structure.
"At the same time, bridge builders have prepared a railway arch for installation on fairway supports," the project information center reported.
In April, the head of the Ministry of Transport, Maxim Sokolov, informed Russian President Vladimir Putin that the construction of the facility was ahead of schedule.
The Crimean Bridge will connect the Crimean Peninsula and the Krasnodar Territory.
In Spain, fired an official who did not go to work for 10 years
What angelic patience (or absolute indifference to public service) should the chief of the Spanish official, Carles Recio, have possessed?
Permanent truancy stretched for 10 long years.
However, Mr. Recio was still fired.
But not his immediate superior.
That only in the world of bureaucrats does not happen.
Ordinary people, it seems, have long been accustomed to all the pranks of the "servants of the people".
And, nevertheless, officials all the time manage to surprise those on whose taxes they live well.
This time, the "sensation" came from Spain.
There, an employee of the Valencian archive, Carles Recio, managed not to go to work for ten years.
At the same time, he regularly received a salary.
And all solid - 50 thousand euros per year.
And now Mr. Recio's "wonderful times" are over.
He was dismissed by the decision of the Legislative Assembly of Valencia.
During the investigation, it turned out that the malicious truant came to the office every working morning at 07:00 to check in with the electronic system.
And then he went home.
Once again, he showed up at the workplace at 4 p.m. to again note in the system that he had left.
And so for 10 years.
It also became known that the truant devoted all his free time to drawing comics at home.
Now the deputies of the Legislative Assembly of Valencia are thinking about how to punish mr. Recio's immediate superior, who could not help but know how to "actively work" at his workplace his subordinate.
Judges are proposed to be protected from presidents
The Presidential Council for Human Rights (HRC), on behalf of Vladimir Putin, has developed proposals to strengthen the independence of the judiciary.
The HRC proposes to limit the powers of court presidents and introduce their electability.
For the courts of appeal and cassation instances, the HRC wants to introduce special districts that will not be tied to the administrative-territorial division in the Russian Federation.
The Supreme Court must also submit its proposals within the framework of the presidential instruction.
The HRC has completed the development of proposals that will strengthen the independence of the Russian judiciary.
The HRC carried out this work on behalf of Vladimir Putin on January 3, 2017, which the President gave after a meeting with members of the Council.
At a meeting with members of the council on December 8, 2016, individual cases of judicial arbitrariness, as well as problems of public control in places of detention of citizens were discussed (see "Kommersant" of December 9).
As a result of the work of the HRC, 25 proposals were made, which relate both to the issues of ensuring the independence of judges and identifying miscarriages of justice, as well as the financing of courts and legal education.
One of the ideas of the Kremlin's human rights activists is to limit the powers of court chairmen in order to increase the independence of other judges.
If a candidate for the post of judge has successfully passed the competition and received the support of the judicial community, then the chairman of the court, in the opinion of the HRC, should submit him for appointment, not having the right to refuse, as the law allows now.
It is also proposed to deprive the president of the right to distribute cases for consideration among judges.
To do this, experts admit, can a specially written computer program.
Also, the HRC believes that the chairman does not have the right to "predetermine the results of the qualification certification of a judge, initiate his bringing to disciplinary responsibility, make decisions on the establishment of additional material payments."
At the same time, the Presidential Council considers it necessary to move to "the election of court chairmen by the judges themselves" and "to give them powers for a relatively short period with mandatory rotation."
Now all the chairmen of the courts (from republican to district) are appointed for six years by the president on the proposal of the chairman of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation.
In order to protect judges from the pressure of regional administrations, the HRC proposes to organize appeal and cassation in courts of general jurisdiction in a new way.
Now their structure is tied to the administrative-territorial division in the Russian Federation.
The HRC says that "it is necessary to ensure the organization of separate courts of appeal and cassation instances not at the level of regional judicial bodies in the subjects of the Russian Federation, but in judicial districts."
Experts take as a basis the practice of arbitration courts.
Under them, there are "judicial districts" that do not coincide with the administrative division in the Russian Federation, but thereby guarantee greater independence from regional officials who find it difficult to use the "telephone law".
The HRC proposes to strengthen the justices of the peace with people's assessors in order to consider certain "categories of civil and administrative cases" with their participation.
For example, on the deprivation of parental rights, on reinstatement at work, on the protection of honor and dignity, on the deprivation of a driver's license, etc.
"These are only our proposals," Tamara Morshchakova, a member of the HRC, a retired judge of the Constitutional Court, explained to Kommersant.
She also recalled that the president's instruction applied not only to the HRC, but also to the Supreme Court (SC), which has not yet disclosed its proposals.
The Supreme Court still has time to fulfill the order (among the co-executors are the Prosecutor General's Office and the Commissioner for Human Rights in the Russian Federation).
To report to Vladimir Putin on how effectively the independence of justice is ensured in the Russian Federation, the Chairman of the Supreme Court Vyacheslav Lebedev must before September 1.
Living a high life: a half-storey floor and cunning design techniques have turned this small apartment in Earls Court into a spacious dwelling
Joan Lee, a former banker with a passion for real estate renovations, moved from a spacious home in Knightsbridge to an apartment in Earls Court in 2014.
The apartment is located on the first floor of a cute standard house in the style of Queen Anne, and in favor of the new design says that Joan did not pack her things and did not move again.
"I used to live with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger area," says Joan.
"I was looking for something comparable for my money.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and there were the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and offered the price the same day."
Since the first viewing, the 1,000-square-foot apartment has undergone a complete renovation.
Originally, it was a one-bedroom apartment of a complex layout – to get into the bedroom, you had to go through the kitchen – and Joanna wanted to add storage space and a half-floor to get the most out of the generous ceiling heights.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
Those were my demands," she says.
To that end, she hired Erfan Azadi of The Duck & Shed, an architectural and design studio in Notting Hill, to use the 12.5-foot-tall ceilings and create a dwelling that would not only be a successful project, but would be suitable for Joan's living.
The ceiling was not high enough to arrange two rooms one above the other, so the architectural task was to create a half-floor where it would be possible to stand in full growth.
Erfan had to think creatively to cope with the brief.
"Working with steel structures is very difficult," he explains.
"We needed to arrange the rooms so that they were one above the other, and we did not have to bend.
It was necessary not just to build a simple platform, but to bend the structures so that they were at the right height and allowed the use of rooms from above and below. "
This decision allowed Erfan to arrange two full-size rooms one above the other in the allotted space - and many more interesting things.
From the half-floor through the vintage copper light window from "Retrouvius" you can see the chic living room below.
Mirrored furniture with golden finishes, silver accents and vintage lighting fixtures from Serge Mooye set the style of the project.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding spectacle, spaciousness and light.
The short corridor is framed by mirrors to make it seem longer.
In the kitchen, the mirrored protective panel seems to be a window to another room.
At the entrance, mirrored cabinets serve to store all of Joan's utensils.
To create the feeling of a more luxurious space, the beauty of the living room can block the kitchen when it is not used.
Folding kitchens are nothing new.
The uniqueness of this kitchen is that it is a sliding up door, like in a garage.
"Engineering was involved here," Erfan says of the steel-reinforced wood-fiber shield door.
"It's equipped with a counterweight, so when you push the door up, it slides very easily."
Thanks to the judicious use of space and storage space, Joan received an additional 16 square meters, an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day, floor space is exactly what you're going to sell, that is, what your property is valued against," says Erfan.
"Roughly speaking, a real estate agent will come in and make calculations based on the floor area."
Here, they were able to increase the floor area using quality materials that give the space a touch of luxury.
"Materials are something we touch, so they help create an emotional connection to the home," says Erfan.
"No one falls in love with the electrical wiring in the walls.
It's important, but it doesn't touch the strings of our hearts."
This serves as evidence that due to good design and increased footage, the apartment can turn from something ordinary into something amazing.
In fact, like Joan, you may decide to stay.
The government approved the creation of a commission on cultural policy
The Russian government approved the creation of a commission on state cultural policy.
The corresponding resolution is published on the government's website.
According to the document, the main task of the commission will be the development and adjustment of strategic approaches to the implementation of cultural policy.
The commission will also develop draft strategies for cultural policy, clarify tasks and prepare new programs for its implementation.
Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation was appointed head of the commission.
The composition of the commission will be approved separately.
Prime Minister of the Russian Federation Dmitry Medvedev in 2016 approved a plan for the implementation of the strategy of the state cultural policy until 2030.
The plan includes 193 events and provides for measures to expand the influence of Russian culture in other countries, preserve a single cultural space and cultural heritage, and it will also contribute to the creation of conditions for the development of culture in the country.
Inflation in the G20 countries fell to an eight-year low
The growth of consumer prices in the countries included in the G20, fell to the lowest levels over the past eight years, reports The Wall Street Journal, citing data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
According to OECD estimates, inflation in June 2016 was 2% - lower values were observed in October 2009, when the price growth index reached 1.7%.
Earlier, Rosstat reported a decrease in the consumer price index in Russia by 0.1%.
Thus, the agency recorded the first weekly deflation in 2017.
The inflation target in Russia, according to the calculations of the Ministry of Finance, is 4.1%.
The Ministry of Economy, however, believes that the target value has already been achieved - according to this department, the figure is 4%.
Putin warned against illegal felling of the Baikal taiga
Russian leader Vladimir Putin during a meeting on the environmental development of the natural Baikal territory warned against illegal destruction of forests.
During the event, the Minister of Natural Resources Sergey Donskoy noted that a bill had been prepared earlier.
It allows deforestation during fire suppression, and the government plans to adopt it in the fall.
In turn, the president said that this project should be monitored so that in the process of felling "everything is not cut down in a row."
Donskoy noted that this bill involves control by the Ministry of Emergency Situations and supervisory agencies.
Media: soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine secretly from the command negotiate with the donbass militia
Regular telephone communication has been established on the line of armed confrontation in Donbass.
Fighters of the opposing sides constantly communicate with each other on mobile phones, and this communication is not known in the headquarters.
Soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and Donbass militiamen established communication on cell phones secretly from their high command.
This was reported on August 4 by "Strana.ua" with reference to the participants of the military operation in the Donbass.
According to the publication, the commanders of the units are well aware of the names of their colleagues from the opposite side of the front and communicate with them daily by phone.
Communication is not at all everyday: commanders are trying to reach some "tactical agreements".
Often, as a result of such conversations, a truce is concluded in a certain sector of the front.
Journalists became aware of cases when a particular officer received birthday greetings from behind the front line, from his formal enemy.
Soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and militiamen of the DPR and LPR have been sitting in trenches on the demarcation line since the spring of 2014, when Ukraine launched a combat operation against Donbass.
The Foreign Ministry was outraged by the blocking of UN Security Council statements about attacks on the Russian Embassy
The Russian Foreign Ministry is outraged by the actions of some Western diplomatic representatives who block the statements of the UN Security Council in the press condemning the terrorist attacks on the Russian Embassy in Syria.
This is reported by the Russian Foreign Ministry.
The ministry recalled that the territory of the Russian Embassy in Damascus on August 2 for the third time in a month was subjected to mortar fire by terrorists of the groups "Hayat Tahrir al-Sham" (formerly "Jabhat al-Nusra", banned in the Russian Federation) and "Failak al-Rahman".
Taking into account that the international community is unanimous in the qualification of Nusra as a terrorist organization, and the UN Security Council resolutions call for opposition to this structure, the Russian Foreign Ministry noted that "it would seem to go without saying that the Nusra terrorist attacks should meet with universal unconditional and resolute condemnation, and there should be no ambiguity in the assessments of attacks against diplomatic missions."
However, as the diplomatic department emphasized, "for the third time in a month, diplomatic representatives of the United States, Great Britain, France and Ukraine in the UN Security Council, alternately, varying the tone of objections, hiding behind arguments about the alleged lack of necessary information, blocked the proposal of the Russian Federation to adopt a standard brief draft statement of the Security Council for the press condemning terrorist attacks on the Russian diplomatic mission in the Syrian capital."
Let the unwillingness to show diplomatic solidarity with us remain on the conscience of those delegations.
"The most outrageous thing is that the inability of the Security Council to condemn the actions of terrorists encourages them to new provocations and terrorist attacks, makes them feel impunity," the Foreign Ministry said, adding that "I would not like these barbarians to create a conviction that someone in the Security Council is with them."
Vladimir Putin spoke in favor of limiting the number of unscheduled inspections of business
Russian President Vladimir Putin during a meeting on investment projects in the Far East said that the number of unscheduled inspections of entrepreneurs should be reduced to 30% of the number of planned ones, and also said that it was necessary to limit the period of inspections to ten days.
"Unscheduled inspections are carried out, as a rule, without the appropriate coordination with the prosecutor's office; only 2-3% is coordinated with the prosecutor's office, everything else goes on its own," TASS quoted the president as saying.
Vladimir Putin also said that it is necessary to prohibit investigators from seizing servers and hard drives at enterprises.
In addition, according to the president, business associations should have the right to protect the interests of their members in court.
"This, I hope, will bring a certain positive to the consideration of cases related to entrepreneurial activity, or related to the violation of the law in the field of entrepreneurship," the head of state said.
As reported by "Kommersant", due to the moratorium on scheduled inspections, the number of other types of inspections of entrepreneurs is growing.
In May, on the order of the business ombudsman under the President of Russia Boris Titov, a survey was conducted, as a result of which it turned out that in fact there was a replacement of scheduled inspections with unscheduled ones (the share of those who encountered them increased from 21.9% in 2015 to 30.8% in 2016), prosecutor's inspections (from 16.9% to 21.8%), raid (from 7.9% to 13.3%), as well as inspections at the request of citizens (an increase from 15% to 19.5%) and administrative investigations (10.8% to 15.5%).

The brothers fight for a real estate empire worth more than $ 500 million
The two brothers are fighting over one of Victoria's largest empires in the more than $500 million property trade — forty years after their Italian ancestors founded the dynasty.
Former Carleton Football Club director and real estate developer Colin de Lutis lives in the Turak Palace three doors from his younger brother Paul, who has filed a Supreme Court action against him for the division of possessions and assets.
Paul has been wanting to leave the family business since 2014, but there has been a bitter dispute in the Supreme Court over the terms of the divorce.
Along with their mother Anna, the brothers own 87 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, bought since their family bought a store in Smith Street in Collingwood in 1973.
There, the family founded the company "Westco Jeans", which grew into a network of 160 outlets.
It was sold in 1999 for $85 million.
The money was invested in real estate, and the list of de Lutis family's possessions includes today office buildings, building plots in Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments on the Gold Coast and in Mount Buller, and shopping centers in the suburbs.
By arrangement with his late father, Colin — whom Paul describes as the "main driving force and dominant personality" of the De Lutis family — owns roughly two-thirds of the company's assets, and Paul owns about one-third.
According to the court, this means that Colin's property is 316 million and Paul's is 176 million.
The division of property and money became a stumbling block for Paul.
"The section proposed by Colin gives him, in my opinion, the best parts of the property," he wrote in his first testimony in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed attempts at reconciliation, the first hearings in the Supreme Court took place.
The brothers are now arguing over who will control the existing business — from which Paul believes Colin has excluded him.
Colin claims that this is not the case, but accuses Paul of incompetent management of some objects.
In testimony given by Colin at the beginning of the trial, he says he hopes for a resolution of the dispute.
"My Italian roots make me consider family a top priority," he wrote.
Legal costs are snowballing, with hundreds of pages of testimony, emails and reports from companies such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer attached to the case; both sides brought in some of the most prominent lawyers, including M.C., Allan Myers, and the best.
Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were immigrants from Italy; from the late 1950s they ran dairy bars and deli, and in the early 1970s bought a shop in Brunswick.
Under financial guarantees, they bought a store in Collingwood, in which Colin opened the first family jeans store.
Colin says he started Westco when he was "in the last grades of school, and Paul was then a boy (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass on their possessions to their sons without conflict.
"Luigi often told me he didn't want the brothers to look into court," she wrote.
The other two brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies; Colina says Mark got 10 million when he went out of business, and Luke got 26 million.
According to Paul, both Luke and Mark were "dissatisfied with the financial conditions of their separation."
Colin was not a public figure, although he was a former member of the board of directors of the AFL club and, according to a biography published in 2015 of Eddie McGuire, the best friend of the TV star.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul and their lawyers on Friday.
Only Colin responded with a text message saying that since the case hadn't yet been tried, "I really don't have much to say."
"I am very, very sorry that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and rattle the name of our family in court," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in testimony that he was trying to meet his brother's demands.
"Our father wouldn't want to see Paul and I arguing in court," he said, adding that he was "still hoping for a resolution of the conflict."
On Friday, that hope seems to have dissipated.
"The decision in our case will be made by the court soon," Colin wrote.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to limit the flow of information to the president.
Others tried to do so and were defeated.
Maybe John F. Kelly will actually succeed.
In this case, it will be the first.
Politico says the new White House chief of staff plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump, including news reports from the media, hoping to keep the chief calmer.
Here's what reporter Josh Dawsey reports.
"At a meeting held by the new White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly with the leadership of the staff on his first working day, he outlined the main problem in the White House under President Donald Trump, which he hopes to solve: poor channels of information to the president."
Kelly told employees that information should flow through him — in paper form or through briefings — because the president would be better at making decisions if he got the right information.
Kelly's diagnosis is completely correct, but others have already failed in trying to pacify Trump by tracking the flow of information to him.
President Trump's relationship with television developed decades ago — and now that he's in the White House, his TV habit is still strong.
"When Trump, as a candidate, resented unfair campaign coverage, it was helpful to demonstrate to him that he was getting fair coverage in publications that could be persuaded," Sam Nanberg, a former campaign adviser, told Politico in February.
Tara Palmeri wrote in Politico at the time that "according to six former members of the campaign, in order to keep Trump's habit of tweeting under control, it was necessary to ensure that there was a constant stream of praise in the information coming to him personally."
Ok.
But the idea that Trump's Habit of Tweeting has ever been "under control" is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign members know something we don't — like that if it weren't for them, Trump's tweets would be even more provocative.
We may never know about tweets that Trump didn't release.
If his staff saved him from trouble at least a few times, their efforts were not in vain.
But no one has always been able to deter Trump from adding fuel to the fire.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, divided into rival factions, people are constantly trying to push their agenda by feeding Trump material — reliable or not — that confirms their views.
"Politico" - just for this story - wrote in May about the tendency of advisers to constantly slip the president dubious information.
Here's one example, described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
Current and former Trump employees say Trump can react very harshly to negative press coverage, especially those containing dangerous leaks, and will not rest until he finds who was behind them.
That's what happened in late February, when someone slipped the president a printout of an article from GotNews.com, the website of Internet provocateur Charles K. Johnson, in which Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Welsh was accused of "standing behind a series of leaks" in the White House.
It doesn't matter that Johnson is forever banned from Twitter for aggressive behavior, that he didn't provide specific facts, or that he's made false accusations in the past and then retracted them.
Trump read the article and started asking staff about Welsh."
Goldmacher adds that then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and Chief of Staff Rob Porter "tried to build a system to manage and document the flow of papers that Trump receives."
How did that work?
Three months later, Kelly tries to do the same.
He may prove to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump still has an impulsive nature and his aides are still fighting each other for influence.
These constant factors make Kelly's task very difficult.
Tyumen Prosecutor's Office fights HIV dissident
The prosecutor's office challenged the decision of the Kalininsky District Court of Tyumen, which terminated the criminal case against a local resident whose young daughter died of HIV.
According to the investigation, the child died due to the fact that the mother is an HIV dissident and refused treatment.
However, the court acquitted her of responsibility in connection with reconciliation with the injured father.
The prosecutor's office believes that the crime cannot be left unpunished, so as not to create a precedent for other HIV dissidents.
The case against a resident of Tyumen was initiated under Part 1 of Art. 109 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (causing death by negligence) in April - after her three-year-old daughter died of HIV infection of stage 4B.
According to the prosecutor's office, the mother herself is HIV-positive.
"The woman was not treated herself and refused to treat her daughter, believing that HIV infection does not exist," the prosecutor's office of the Tyumen region explained.
The criminal case was submitted to the Kalininsky District Court of Tyumen, which on July 25 decided to terminate it.
A petition for this was filed by the father of the deceased girl, explaining that "he forgave his wife, has no claims against her, she made amends and apologized."
The prosecutor's office did not agree with the court's decision and appealed, demanding to cancel the decision to dismiss the case and send it for a new trial.
The girl died, and it is impossible to make amends for the harm caused by the crime.
The HIV-infected mother, contrary to the recommendations of doctors, refused to examine the baby and treat her for a dangerous infection," the press service of the prosecutor's office said.
According to the supervisory authority, she must be punished, otherwise other HIV dissidents will follow her example.
According to the Tyumen AIDS Center, now in the Tyumen region about 12 children with HIV do not receive medical care due to the refusal of their parents.
"And this situation has already improved - for a year of work of the special group, half of the parents who categorically refused to treat children with HIV changed their minds - they allowed them to diagnose, began to take drugs," said Elena Loseva, press secretary of the AIDS Center.
According to her, it is impossible to influence parents in a legislative way, and as a result, not all HIV-infected children can be detected - mothers do not allow them to be examined, hide, run away with children from hospitals.
What danger do HIV dissidents pose?
At the end of last year, St. Petersburg sociologists presented the results of the first study in Russia of the so-called movement of HIV dissidents.
HIV dissidents are people who deny the existence of HIV and refuse to take medication.
Doctors and activists of AIDS-service NGOs call such views anti-medical, and in their spread they see a serious threat.
A terrible photo shoot, which ended in tragedy, occurred on Thursday, August 3, at the Grechany railway station in Khmelnitsky.
A cheerful company of drunken young people strolled the bridge over the railway tracks, where a freight train was just standing.
One of the friends had the idea to make a spectacular selfie on the roof of the car, facts were told in the communication sector of the police in the Khmelnytsky region.
The guy began to descend from the bridge to the train, but because of his indiscretion, he caught on the power line and instantly received an electric shock.
Fortunately, this case became known to the station dispatcher, who immediately called an "ambulance".
Before the arrival of the doctors, the victim was moved to a safe place, and then hospitalized in the burn unit of the Khmelnitsky Regional Clinical Hospital.
The man was diagnosed with burns of the trunk of 1-2 degrees.
Now doctors assess his condition as stable.
Law enforcers remind that recently extreme selfies on the roofs of high-rise buildings, bridges, moving vehicles have become increasingly popular.
The police urge people to be vigilant and not to allow such photo shoots, especially among children and adolescents.
Scientists have allowed the existence of oceans on ancient Venus
On ancient Venus, oceans could exist.
This assumption was made by French scientists.
Experts have created a computer model that demonstrated the process of water formation on the surface of planets, writes Science News.
It turned out that on Venus at the beginning of its history, oceans were formed, in which there was 10% more water than now on Earth.
Earlier, "Arguments of the Week" wrote that, according to the hypothesis of scientists, the ocean 4 billion years ago could exist on Mars.
Foreign experts in the course of their research came to the conclusion that the water body was located on the northern hemisphere of the Red Planet.

rock band Louna will present a new album in Barnaul
The concert of the rock band Louna will be held in Barnaul on October 17.
The musicians will present their new album "Brave New World", which has become one of the most anticipated releases of the year.
The band is preparing a concept show, which will be the brightest in the concert history of the group.
"Brave New World" is the fourth album of the Russian rock band Louna.
Its name is associated with the famous dystopian novel by O. Huxley "Brave New World".
The new songs do not retell the book, but tell about a society that lives by the law of dystopia, "blinding faith in propaganda and imposed values."
Listeners helped the band to raise money for the recording of the album: more than 1200 people supported the project on the Planeta.ru website.
His first album "Make It Louder!" Louna was released in 2010.
Two years later, the musicians presented the album "Time X", and in 2013 they recorded the album "We are Louna" (2013).
In the autumn of 2015, the band Louna performed with a symphony orchestra in the "Crocus City Hall" with the program "Songs about the world".
The band consists of Lusine Gevorgyan (vocals), Vitaly Demidenko (bass guitar), Ruben Kazarian (guitar), Sergey Ponkratyev (guitar), Leonid Kinzbursky (drums).
The concert will be held in the Barnaul club "Pharaoh" on October 17 at 19.00.
Ticket price: from 1200 to 2600 rubles.
Louna is one of the most popular bands on the Russian rock scene.
The band was founded in 2008.
Their debut concert took place in 2009.
The group several times won in different nominations of the hit parade "Devil's Dozen".
Gypsies crossed the moat and returned to the "street of millionaires"
Some of west Midlands' wealthiest homeowners are once again clashing with determined Roma who have crossed a moat dug by the municipal authorities to reoccupipe a field next to their homes.
Gypsies parked 20 houses on wheels in a field bordering the rich Solihalla Street, jokingly called "Millionaires Street".
Bringing horses, babies and many motorhed houses with them, they returned after being kicked out as late as May, and were not prevented by a ditch dug by municipal authorities to prevent their intrusions.
This tactful company found a gap in the defensive structures and squeezed its vehicles through the area that had been left unfenced to leave room for a path.
Angry residents attacked the municipality of Solihull, saying it was "unable to solve this problem".
An anonymous local resident reported: "They came here on Monday evening, after they were chased out of Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at passers-by."
The municipality should be shamed and forced to act, because they are completely incapable of solving this problem.
The Gypsies were here in May, they were chased away, and now they are back.
Last night, more Gypsies arrived, and today, perhaps even more.
"The Birmingham Municipality knows how to solve this problem, they get long-term court orders to protect their parks," she added.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I don't like that I keep paying the council tax and the municipality can't even put an end to it."
One local resident, who wished to remain anonymous, said: "It's ridiculous, we just saw these Gypsies leave last time, and now, please, this scourge continues."
This time there were more of them, and we even saw a horse grazing in the meadow."
A spokesperson for Solihull Municipality said: "We are aware of the illegal camp on the ground near Streetsbrook Road and are cooperating with Solihull police; we are taking the necessary legal action to drive them away as soon as possible."
To help us gather evidence, it is very important that as many locals as possible report any antisocial or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This allows us to get an idea of the situation that the court will consider when we present our case to them.
Crimea corporatizes the factory of sparkling wines "New World"
The State Unitary Enterprise of the Republic of Crimea "Plant of Sparkling Wines "New World"" decided to corporatize, transforming into JSC "Plant of Sparkling Wines "New World"", follows from the order of the Minister of Property and Land Relations of the Crimea Anna Anyukhina.
100% of the company's shares will remain in the state property of the Crimea.
The authorized capital of the joint-stock company will amount to 595.5 million rubles. and will consist of 5.955 million ordinary shares with a par value of 100 rubles. each.
The Ministry of Agriculture of Crimea stated that if within the next three years there are no funds for the modernization of the enterprise, then there will be a threat of stopping the plant.
Depreciation of fixed assets in the enterprise is about 60-70%.
The modernization of the enterprise requires 1.2 billion rubles Due to the peculiarities of the organizational and legal form, it is obliged to give 50% of the profit to the budget income.
What remains is not enough to implement the modernization plan.
"It is problematic to get money from the owner, it is difficult to talk about attracting borrowed funds from large credit organizations," said Sergei Petelin, deputy head of the Crimean Ministry of Agriculture, in April this year.
The Crimean parliament included the company in the forecast privatization plan for 2017.
It was proposed to carry out its corporatization and put it up for auction.
An Interfax source in the Crimean authorities estimated the possible cost of selling the enterprise at $ 40 million, the investor's investments in modernization - another $ 30 million.
In 2016, Novy Svet increased the production of sparkling wines by 2.8% compared to the level of 2015 - up to 1.52 million bottles.
In 2017, Novy Svet intended to produce 1.6 million bottles.
The enterprise was founded in 1878 by Prince Lev Golitsyn as a factory for the production of sparkling wine in the Novy Svet estate acquired by him.
The plant is located on 11 hectares of land.
Nizhny Novgorod third-graders smashed more than 40 tombstones
Employees of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in the Nizhny Novgorod region established the identities of citizens who destroyed 46 gravestones in the cemetery of the city of Lyskovo.
The attackers were third-grade students.
The first statement that the gravestones were damaged by unknown persons was received by the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia in the Lyskovsky district on June 27.
In total, 24 people turned to the police on this matter.
As a result, a criminal case was initiated under article 244 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation "Destruction, damage or desecration of burial places".
As a result of the investigation, the police identified the suspects, they were two schoolchildren aged 8 and 9 years.
Juvenile offenders told the police that they were interested in watching the monuments fall, which prompted them to hooligan actions.
Preventive measures have been taken with children and their parents.
Italy is toughening its tone towards NGO ships rescuing migrants.
Italy has warned NGOs that own rescue vessels in the Mediterranean that they will not be able to continue operating unless they obey the new rules governing their activities.
"If NGOs do not comply with the new code of conduct, it is difficult to say whether they will be able to continue their activities," Interior Minister Mario Minniti said in an interview with the Turin-based daily Stampa.
Minniti's warning came a day after Italian authorities confiscated a vessel belonging to the German humanitarian organization Jugend Rettet on suspicion that its crew was actually cooperating with traffickers and facilitating illegal immigration.
The humanitarian organization, which has only worked for a year, declined to comment on the merits of the detailed charges brought against it by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartozio.
"For us, saving human life is and will remain the highest priority, so we are very sorry that we cannot continue activities in the search and rescue zone now," the organization said in a statement on social networks.
"We will only be able to assess all the allegations made now after we have gathered all the information and are able to assess the situation."
Italian authorities have been monitoring the Juventa vessel, owned by jugend rettet, since October.
Its crew is suspected of taking on board migrants who were sent directly to them by lifeboats and allowing smugglers to leave with boats they could reuse.
At least one such meeting is believed to have taken place just 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecution materials, the content of which was published in the Italian media.
The crew is suspected of violating the regulations of the Italian coastal authorities, who monitor rescue operations in this zone, more out of humanitarian zeal than for any other reason.
The code of conduct assumes, mainly, that the Juventa-class vessels will have on board an Italian police officer who will monitor their activities.
So far, only three of nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to comply with the code: Save the Children, Malta's MOAS and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday it considered the new rules unnecessary but acceptable as long as they did not entail any "meaningful changes or interference" with its rescue operations.
Among those who refused to sign is the Nobel Prize-winning Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF).
Meanwhile, Minniti said the sharp decline in recent weeks in the number of migrants arriving in Italy as a result of rescue operations indicates that efforts to support the Libyan coast guard and cooperation with local mayors are bearing fruit.
"In recent days, we have started to see light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He outlined plans for further talks with Libyan mayors on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
"In Libya, we do not want to be associated with any of the parties to the conflict"
The Russian authorities have recently noticeably intensified their policy in the Libyan direction, and delegations of the opposing Libyan parties often visited Moscow.
The head of the Russian contact group on the intra-Libyan settlement under the Russian Foreign Ministry and the State Duma, an assistant to the head of the Chechen Republic, Lev Dengov, told Kommersant what goals Moscow pursues in this region and on whom it relies.
Almost nothing is known about the contact group on Libya, which you are chairing.
For example, the contact group on Ukraine – everyone knows about it.
And here is the veil of secrecy.
What exactly do you do, what goals do you pursue?
The contact group was established at the initiative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation and the State Duma.
Its activities are supervised by Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov and Adam Delimkhanov (Duma deputy from Chechnya. - "Kommersant").
The latter is authorized to work in the Libyan direction by the Speaker of the State Duma Vyacheslav Volodin.
The impetus for the creation of the group was the detention in Libya of the Russian tanker "Mechanic Chebotarev" (in September 2015, there were 11 people on board. - "Kommersant").
We thought about how to help the crew.
Then a contact group of military specialists, representatives of the State Duma was created, our work was supported by the head of Chechnya Ramzan Kadyrov.
And how did it happen that you headed it?
Since I have been working on Libya since 2008, I was approached to lead the group.
Our activities were not limited to the release of sailors from the Chebotarev Mechanic.
We managed to establish contacts with representatives of all the main groups opposing each other in the Libyan conflict - both from Tripoli (where the UN-recognized government led by Fayez Sarraj is based. - "Kommersant"), and with Tobruk (the residence of the parliament, which opposes the government and supports Marshal Khalifa Haftar, who controls the eastern regions of Libya. - "Kommersant").
Thanks to the active participation of Ahmed Metig (Deputy Prime Minister of Libya - "Kommersant"), we managed to quickly agree on the release of Russian sailors.
Then it was decided, in order to use these contacts more effectively, to create a contact group.
Its task is to analyze the situation, identify key factors and players, and engage in dialogue with all parties to the conflict.
I want to emphasize that in Libya we do not want to be associated with any of the parties to the conflict, we are engaged in a dialogue with everyone.
How many people are in the contact group and how many of them are permanently in Libya?
Now the contact group includes five people.
Among them there are people with experience in law enforcement agencies, including the Ministry of Defense.
We also want to introduce representatives of the Institute of the Middle East of the Russian Academy of Sciences into the group of specialists in the region.
None of our employees are permanently in Libya, there is no need for this yet.
Are there any Russian military advisers and instructors in Libya now?
And if so, on whose side?
There are no Russian military specialists in Libya.
All conversations and publications about this do not correspond to reality.
But your contact group includes former military personnel...
Yes, and their presence is necessary.
For example, when we visit hot spots.
Or such closed cities as Misrata (where militia units that played a role in the overthrow of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 and noticeably intensified in subsequent years) are based. - "Kommersant").
We arrived in Misrata in January this year.
We were frightened, they said that everyone there was all Islamists, terrorists.
But it was important for us to assess the situation there ourselves, to analyze the real military potential, who is responsible for what, why there are such rumors, what is the real role of the Islamists there.
In Misrata, we met with all representatives of the detachments that were engaged in the destruction of isIS in Sirte (in December 2016, this city on the Mediterranean coast was recaptured from the militants of the Islamic State banned in Russia - "Kommersant").
We wanted to look at them, get to know these people, check the information that they played a decisive role in the destruction of ISIS in Libya, and not Khalifa Haftar, who attributed to himself these merits.
And what conclusion did you come to?
Is it not Haftar who defeated the Islamic State in Libya?
He didn't do it.
Haftar conducted operations on another front, in Benghazi.
And isIS in Sirte was fought by structures subordinate to the government in Tripoli.
And, by the way, we invited to Russia the people who conducted this anti-terrorist operation.
And they arrived - the visit lasted from April 19 to April 23 of this year, the Libyan delegation was received in the Federation Council, in the Duma, the Foreign Ministry and Rosgvardia.
As we understand, you visit all Libyan regions and probably imagine the mood of local elites and field commanders.
Do you think it will be possible to implement the agreements on a ceasefire, on the holding of elections that Khalifa Haftar and Fayez Sarraj reached in Paris at the end of July?
Or again, as has happened many times in the past, will the agreements be disrupted, hostilities will resume, the parties will try to seize power alone?
For us, a good signal was the fact that Sarraj and Haftar agreed to another meeting, not so long ago it was impossible.
In the recent past, both leaders spoke extremely negatively about each other.
As for Russia's position...
It is often written and said that Moscow actively supports Haftar, many believe in this.
We encountered this situation when we were in Misrata, and Haftar was on this very day boarding the Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov.
It was a coincidence.
But Misrata did not believe in a coincidence.
We were told: "You are probably very brave people who came to us today."
But our task is precisely to show that we do not support only Haftar, we are engaged in dialogue with all key parties to the conflict in Libya.
You and Haftar communicated.
Does the mutual understanding with Russian partners at the human, emotional level facilitate the fact that he studied twice in the USSR?
And, by the way, does Haftar know Russian?
If he knows Russian, it is very relative.
But the fact that he studied with us, of course, facilitates a dialogue with him.
And by the way, not only with him.
When we talk to the military in Tripoli and Misrata, we meet generals who studied either in Russia or in the Soviet Union.
And now they speak perfect Russian.
And they are drawn to Russia, to some extent they feel nostalgia for it.
Do you think that the arms embargo imposed on Libya will soon be lifted?
Are your Libyan interlocutors interested in the supply of Russian weapons?
They are interested, of course, but, as I have already said, we do not take sides in this conflict and would not like to arm some to the detriment of others.
We would like everyone to be in roughly equal positions.
As for the arms embargo, libyans constantly call for Russia to somehow contribute to its lifting.
Now in Libya, the process of drafting a constitution is actively progressing.
We hope that the parties will reach compromise solutions and achieve an internal consensus.
Then elections should be held, which was discussed at the meeting between Sarraj and Haftar.
If elections are held and a legitimate government is finally elected (and now none of the parties has such a status), then we can raise the issue of lifting the arms embargo in the UN Security Council.
Raising this issue now is pointless and dangerous, it will only lead to an escalation of the conflict.
The other day, the media reported that Italy, faced with the problem of African refugees sailing from Libya, feels abandoned to the mercy of fate by its EU allies.
Can Moscow help its Italian partners in this situation by using its ties with the Libyans?
How realistic, for example, is it that Haftar's forces would take control of the coast and put an end to the business of smugglers transporting immigrants to Europe?
A very timely question.
We are actively working on this.
The Italians need Russia's support because Moscow is engaged in a dialogue simultaneously with Haftar, Sarraj, Misrata and the south of the country.
And in this matter, tribes in the south of Libya play a big role, and they are ready to cooperate with Russia.
Is it about southerners stopping the flow of migrants on the distant approaches?
That is, relatively speaking, they turned back the buses in which Nigerian migrants are traveling?
That's what we're trying to do.
But it's not easy.
Some clans and groups are interested in keeping these streams going.
We hope to help unite the southerners in the negotiation process between Sarraj, Haftar and the tribes in the south.
But first, we would like to see a unity of opinion on this issue between Haftar and Sarraj.
The head of government in Tripoli, Fayez Sarraj, is considered an Islamist, a supporter of the introduction of Sharia norms in the country.
How radical is he?
Will this not become an obstacle in building relations with Russia or the West?
I will express my personal opinion about him.
In my opinion, he is, on the contrary, an opponent of radical Islam.
But there are Islamists in his coalition.
Yes, but he himself adheres to the position that Libya should be an absolutely normal country - moderately Islamic, open to the world.
And he is also actively fighting terrorists.
Where does he get that reputation?
It was created by those countries that are not interested in Russia communicating with Tripoli.
Tripoli is, after all, the capital, there is a legislative, executive and judicial power.
There is a national oil corporation, a national bank and other state structures.
Of course, some countries were interested in us not going there.
And we mixed all the cards for them and began to actively communicate with both Tripoli and Tobruk.
And we are already reaping the fruits of this work: Rosneft has signed a cooperation agreement with the state oil company of Libya - NOC.
NOC Director Mustafa Sanalla, with whom Rosneft CEO Igor Sechin made the deal, is himself directly from Tripoli.
And two weeks ago, the first shipment of Libyan oil to Rosneft took place.
What will Russia do with it?
I guess resell.
And what are Russia's economic interests in Libya?
There are plans to re-sign contracts concluded under Muammar Gaddafi.
We are talking, in particular, about previous agreements in the transport sector (construction of railways), energy (electrification) and a number of others.
Do Libyans have something to pay?
Well, they have oil.
That is, as in the case of Iran, we are talking about the "oil for services" scheme?
I do not know what the scheme will be, I do not deal directly with these issues.
In fact, the economy for Russia in Libya is not the main thing.
We are, in fact, engaged in peacekeeping work there.
For us, the main thing is to stop the bloodshed, to help the Libyans to come to an agreement among themselves, so that they can establish order in their country and Libya ceases to be a favorable environment for the development of terrorism.
For Russia, this is the main task - to help the Libyan people and squeeze out the terrorists from there.
Do you have any data on the presence in Libya (now or before) of radical militants from Russia or other countries of the former USSR?
One of the tasks of our contact group was to find out.
I met with a representative of the Libyan State Security Committee, who said that to date, not a single immigrant from Russia and other countries of the former USSR is there.
He said that he has about 50 thousand records of telephone conversations of representatives of Islamist and radical groups (in Libya. - "Kommersant") and Russian speech does not sound there.
And from which states then are these militants?
I wouldn't want to go into those details.
Then let's phrase the question differently.
How many Of the Islamist militants in Libya are Libyans themselves?
There are practically no Libyans among them, they are no more than 5%.
The rest are newcomers.
Can Moscow hold intra-Libyan talks following the example of Paris?
There are such plans.
We are conducting active negotiations with the Libyans, several delegations from Libya have already visited Moscow, and have declared their readiness to come again - to Moscow or to Grozny.
And when can such negotiations take place?
It's hard to say now.
There are still a few visits to be made, and then, I hope, there will be clarity about the time and place of the talks.
In the Chekhov Museum, benefactors collected money for an expensive gift to a sick boy
In the Melikhovo Museum-Reserve near Moscow, a nine-year-old boy Sasha Matsola, who has cerebral palsy, hydrocephalus and complete blindness, will receive a specialized treadmill as a gift on August 5.
A useful gift will be presented to Sasha by the Minister of Culture of the Moscow Region Oksana Kosareva and the Director of the Museum Konstantin Bobkov.
The money for the simulator was collected during the charity marathon "Do not get tired of doing good", which was held in Melikhovo on July 15 on Chekhov Memorial Day.
On the eve of the marathon, the museum received a letter from Sasha, who lives in the village of Manushkino, Chekhov District: "My eyes do not see at all, so I asked my mother to write this letter."
"I would love to get a treadmill as a gift so that my legs become strong and I would learn to walk a little bit."
And now Sashina's dream came true!
After the presentation, the museum-reserve will host a "Postscript Concert" - the famous pianist, Honored Artist of Russia Alexander Gindin will perform a medley of popular classical works.
During the charity marathon in Melikhovo, the choir of the Voznesenskaya Davydov Desert, the bell ringers of the ilya Drozdikhin workshop, students of the Moscow Conservatory named after P.I. Tchaikovsky and the Gnessin Russian Academy, artists of the Melikhovsky Theater "Chekhov Studio" performed.
Auctions were held for visitors, a book fair and a charity sale of souvenirs with the marathon logo were organized.
The Museum-Reserve "Melikhovo" took the initiative to make Chekhov Memorial Day on July 15 a single day of charity in all museums of the Moscow region.
A 30-year-old resident of Olevsk, Zhytomyr region, near the local football stadium, shot several times in the direction of teenagers who were there.
According to the suspect, he was angered by noise, told "FACTS" in the communication department of the police of zhytomyr region.
After that, the man went to a cafe located nearby.
In the building, he had a conflict, during which the man used a device for shooting rubber bullets, wounding one of the visitors.
The 34-year-old victim was provided with the necessary medical care, there is no threat to his life.
Police and ambulance arrived at the scene, but the shooter had by this time fled.
Law enforcers established his identity and detained him on the same day, August 2.
The man could not explain his actions.
A device for shooting rubber bullets was seized from him, which was sent for examination.
Criminal proceedings have been initiated under Article 296 (hooliganism) of the Criminal Code of Ukraine.
The detainee faces imprisonment for a term of 3 to 7 years.
Recall that in Kiev on Lukyanivka in the area of Tatarskaya Street on the night of July 28 there was an attack with shooting.
Michelle Carter's sentence for reports prompting the suicide of Conrad Roy
A resident of Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years in prison for the fact that she used text messages and phone calls to induce the suicide of her boyfriend Conrad Roy.
Michelle Carter, who is now 20 years old, will have to serve 15 months of her sentence behind bars and another 5 years of probation.
Carter was found guilty in June of manslaughter of Conrad Roy, who committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
Roy's father told Thursday's hearing: "My family is heartbroken.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to remain at large pending appeal.
She faced a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her lawyers said both she and Roy suffered from mental disorders.
Carter, dressed in red pants and a cream blouse, listened to the verdict standing, clenching her hands and lowering her eyes.
"By her actions, she killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"She interrupted his life to improve hers.
She did not acknowledge responsibility," she said.
"She showed no remorse."
But Carter's lawyer said it was a "tragic incident that she deeply regrets."
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said he believed her "age, maturity level or even mental illness did not significantly affect her actions".
The prosecutor read out statements from Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, which said: "Not a single day has passed when I would not mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and the way I cope – I try to support his sisters despite all the pain that will stay with us forever," it reads.
Roy's sister Camdeen Roy said she was relentlessly haunted by the thought that she could never attend his wedding or become his children's aunt.
"To lose a person who has always been with me since I was born is a pain that will stay with me for the rest of my life," she said.
The case appears to set a legal precedent, as there is no law in Massachusetts that provides for responsibility for advising a person to commit suicide.
In 2014, when Roy was found dead in the car with symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning, Carter was 17 years old.
The incident attracted the attention of the whole country when it became known that he was pushed to suicide by Carter's messages.
"You can hang yourself, jump off the roof, stab yourself with a knife I don't know there are many ways," she wrote in several messages sent two weeks before his death, when he was vacationing with his family.
Minutes before her suicide, she wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad," and "You just have to turn on the ignition and you'll be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said Carter wanted attention through Roy's death and forbade her from talking to the press to prevent her from getting what she wanted.
The opinions of lawyers on this issue are divided.
One of the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 for the murder in Italy of her British flatmate and acquitted two years later.
Knox, 30, posted a dissenting opinion in the Los Angeles Times, stating, "Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help, not prison."
Evgeny Bogachev: "I let go of Langford like a bird of high flight"
One of the best basketball players of the VTB United League, 33-year-old Keith Langford left UNICS.
The departure of the American defender "Izvestia" commented on the president of UNICS Evgeny Bogachev.
Keith made this decision for family reasons," said Evgeny Bogachev.
He has a small child, a wife, who did not want to move to Kazan.
Keith wants to be closer to home.
I decided to meet him halfway.
Sure, I could say no and extend his contract, but he deserved a different treatment.
He played in UNICS for three seasons and in each match showed a high level, gave 100%.
So I let it go like a high-flying bird.
We thanked him.
We wish him success in his family life and playing career.
Keith Langford played in the Kazan club for three years, winning the silver medal of the United League-2015/16.
In the 2016/17 season, he received the award for the most productive player of the Euroleague season.
He averaged 21.75 points per game.
This result is the second since 2004, when this award was established.
Langford, who also won the award in 2014, became the second player in EuroLeague history to win the award more than once.
In the near future, Langford will sign a contract with the Chinese "Shenzhen", informs Eurohoops.
It is expected that the American will conclude a 2-year contract worth $ 5 million.
Langford will be the second EuroLeague star in July to advance to the Chinese league.
Earlier, former Panathinaikos center Yannis Bourousis moved to the Chinese CBA.
Sunburned tourist from the Moscow region evacuated by helicopter in Adygea
Adyghe rescuers today by helicopter evacuated from the mountainous region of the republic a tourist near Moscow, who received severe sunburn.
The man rested in the shelter "Fisht", located at an altitude of 1.6 thousand meters.
The 27-year-old tourist had increased blood pressure, as well as difficulty breathing.
The preliminary diagnosis is a serious allergic reaction.
The head of the tour group turned to the rescuers, who said that the man received burns on the hike.
Audi will have to modify up to 850,000 diesel cars
A day before the announcement from Audi, BMW said it would offer software updates to more than 350,000 vehicles.
BMW's chairman said the company believes "there are more intelligent ways than driving restrictions," referring to European cities — including Munich, where BMW is based — that have considered banning or restricting the use of diesel cars.
Daimler said on Thursday it would modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce their diesel exhaust.
None of the companies called their move a recall.
European automakers have actively promoted the use of diesel cars in Europe and the United States to promote compliance with carbon dioxide emission regulations.
But the nitrogen oxides that diesel engines emit are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost to automakers of installing equipment that neutralizes the exhaust gases of diesel cars is also rising, and maintaining a competitive price for cars is becoming difficult.
While German automakers are under scrutiny, Chancellor Angela Merkel's government has also been accused of pandering to powerful automakers and ignoring signs of trouble.
Companies are trying not to repeat the mistakes of Volkswagen, which hid the use of so-called "damage devices", which during testing could correct the amount of harmful gases emitted so that it complied with the rules, and in normal driving conditions were turned off.
In the United States, several Volkswagen executives have been convicted, with the rest under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, Germany arrested the former head of the thermodynamics department as part of the Audi engine development group.
The former manager, Zakkeo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian, and is therefore not protected from extradition and may stand trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi came under German criminal investigation involving Volkswagen after authorities accused Audi of installing a system to circumvent European emissions regulations and expanded the investigation, which previously focused on the United States.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could create serious problems for Volkswagen: the manufacturer of luxury cars is the source of a disproportionately large share of Volkswagen's income.
In Astrakhan, a visitor to a cafe paid with fake money
The police received a message from an employee of the bank branch about the discovery of a suspicious bill with a face value of 5 thousand rubles during the recalculation of funds received from a catering outlet.
A study conducted at the Forensic Science Center showed that it is fake.
According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia in the Astrakhan region, one of the visitors of the cafe, who bought shawarma, paid with the banknote.
It is worth noting that the cash register was not equipped with a device for determining the authenticity of banknotes.
Currently, the police are identifying persons involved in the manufacture and sale of a knowingly forged ticket of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation.
Such crimes are punishable by imprisonment for up to 8 years with a fine of up to 1 million rubles.
The Regional Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs calls on residents of the Astrakhan region to be careful when making financial transactions; employees of trade facilities are recommended to install devices to verify the authenticity of the money received.
Astronomers have found a "hellish" planet on which even iron can melt
Having first studied the properties of the stratosphere of a giant exoplanet called WASP-121b, astrophysicists were quite surprised by its temperature, which is able to evaporate iron and other metals.
Experts have noticed that water molecules are so heated by the light of the star that they emit infrared radiation.
The Hubble telescope captured the radiance of water molecules on this gas giant: this high temperature causes the water in the planet's atmosphere to glow in the infrared range.
WASP-121b belongs to the so-called "hot Jupiters" - gas giants, comparable in size and mass to the largest planet in the solar system, but located ten times closer to the parent star.
Because of this, a year on an exoplanet lasts only 1.3 "Earth" days, and its gas shell is heated to almost 2,500 degrees Celsius.
Climate change threatens lavender in Provence.
It has become a symbol of Provence and Southern France, but now there are fears that it is threatened by climate change.
Lavender began to grow worse due to dry weather and disease-carrying insects; this has caused a constant headache for scientists and farmers who are trying to find a solution.
Eric Sches, an expert at the Provence-based agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM, says: "Lavender in Provence is really under threat, because in recent years this plant has felt the effects of climate change: in spring and especially in autumn, rains have become much less.
This affects the lifespan of lavender.
And then there are the little cicadas, the insects jumping on the leaves, carrying micro-bacteria; in very dry weather, there are a lot of them."
There's a lot at stake.
Lavender not only attracts vacationers; lavender oil is very much in demand in perfumery and cosmetology.
Eric Shes says: "Instead of very long ears with a large number of large flowers, we have small, underdeveloped, weakened or absent altogether.
So we have fewer parts containing essential oil."
Solutions that are now under consideration include improving water distribution and slowing evaporation from the soil, as well as spraying plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and developing varieties that are more resistant to drought.
The Ambassador of the Winter Universiade 2019 met with Krasnoyarsk schoolchildren
Two-time world hockey champion, ambassador of the Winter Universiade 2019 Alexander Semin met the day before with novice hockey players and signed autographs to fans.
The meeting was held in the tent of the Winter Universiade 2019 as part of the thematic week dedicated to ice hockey.
Any visitor to the tent could skate on a platform with artificial ice.
In addition, relay races, quizzes and games with the drawing of souvenirs of the student games, a warm-up from the aerobics federation were organized.
The event was attended by 50 schoolchildren.
Alexander Semin advised the children to do as much as possible on sports grounds and stressed that the most important thing at the initial stage of training is hard work and a great desire to play hockey.
"It's great that in Krasnoyarsk there is such a platform as the tent of the Winter Universiade 2019, where novice athletes can directly ask questions to the coaches of the teams," the champion said.
It should be noted that the ambassadors of the Winter Universiade-2019 help to promote student sports and a healthy lifestyle among Krasnoyarsk residents.
The tent of the Universiade will work throughout the summer season until September 25, the press service of the Directorate of the Winter Universiade 2019 reports.
The State Department commented on the words of Medvedev
The official representative of the US State Department, Heather Nauert, commenting at a briefing on the words of Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, said that it was necessary to find "areas for interaction" with Russia.
According to her, such areas should be found in order to "improve bilateral cooperation."
An example of such successful cooperation, Nauert called the agreement on Syria on a truce.
We are two nuclear superpowers.
"And people around the world agree that the U.S. and Russia should be able to work with each other," the diplomat said.
At the same time, Nauert refused to comment on Medvedev's statement about a full-fledged trade war between Russia and the United States.
"If Russia said this, then, of course, it has the right to say, but I cannot say anything more on this topic," the State Department spokeswoman said.
Earlier, US President Donald Trump signed a bill to tighten sanctions against the Russian Federation.
Commenting on the new package of sanctions, Russian Prime Minister Medvedev said that Washington had declared a full-fledged trade war on Moscow, putting an end to the hope for improving bilateral relations.
Medvedev also said that US sanctions will be in effect for decades.
In addition, the Prime Minister believes, the American establishment "completely beat" Trump.
A bodybuilder who disappeared in the Moscow region was found at someone else's dacha who lost his memory
Bodybuilder Shamil Khanmetov disappeared on the road to Noginsk on July 25 under very piquant circumstances: he left the car to go to the toilet.
For seven days, friends and locals searched for him unsuccessfully.
And Shamil was found at someone else's dacha in Ramenskoye.
He was found completely naked in his toilet by the owner.
The Dagestani athlete could not explain how he got here and what happened to him.
He couldn't even remember his name, and his passport was gone.
To establish the identity helped announcements about his disappearance.
Doctors who arrived on the call recorded a partial memory loss and a traumatic brain injury in Khanmetov, according to the public Mash.
Probably, the athlete is waiting for other surprises.
The attackers who kidnapped Shamil have probably already visited his apartment, the keys to which were also stolen from him.
Oil and gas revenues in July exceeded the forecast by 7.4 billion rubles
In fact, the oil and gas revenues received in July 2017 exceeded the estimate by 7.4 billion rubles, according to the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation.
The excess, as the agency explains, was mainly due to the higher exchange rate of the US dollar to the ruble compared to the monthly average value of June used for the assessment, as well as due to the excess of the actual volume of gas production and the volume of exports of petroleum products at the projected levels.
"The deviation of oil and gas revenues of the federal budget from the monthly estimate corresponding to the Federal Law on the Federal Budget for 2017-2019 in August 2017 is projected at + 40.2 billion rubles," the Ministry of Finance said.
Thus, the total amount of funds allocated for the purchase of foreign currency in the domestic foreign exchange market in the period from August 7 to September 6, 2017, is 47.6 billion rubles.
Accordingly, the daily volume of purchases of foreign currency will be equivalent to 2.07 billion rubles.
The Bank of Russia will be involved in the purchase of foreign currency by the Ministry of Finance of Russia.
Every working day during the specified period, the Central Bank will conclude transactions for the purchase of foreign currency at organized auctions of the Moscow Exchange evenly during the trading day.
The purchased foreign currency will be credited to the accounts of the Federal Treasury in the Central Bank.
The murder of the journalist underscores that Mexico is becoming increasingly dangerous.
Employees of the weekly newspaper Riodoce usually meet on Wednesdays to discuss plans to cover the latest violent crimes in the state of Sinaloa related to organized crime, corrupt officials or the ongoing war of drug traffickers.
But today, overwhelmed by their own tragedy, they met to talk about security.
They were told they had to change their habits.
Two senior journalists discussed what seemed safer: taking the children with them to the office, which in 2009 had already been thrown a grenade, or leaving them at home.
Security experts wrote three words on a blackboard hanging in the room: enemies, neutral people, allies.
They asked journalists to name names for each column - no evidence is needed, suspicions and internal feelings will be enough.
These are drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of being supported by the government or cartels, a whole list of scoundrels, because of which the work of covering the chaos in Mexico becomes dangerous.
Violence has not given respite, and there are more and more journalists among the corpses that are multiplying in the country: according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, at least 25 since President Enrico Pena Nieto took office in December 2012; 589 people are under federal protection after attacks and threats; and this year, at least seven people have died in seven states.
Among the latter is their publisher and inspirer, the co-founder of "Riodoce" Javier Valdés Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on violent drug-related crimes.
His absence is felt very keenly, although his presence is ubiquitous - a large photograph of Valdés showing his middle finger, with the inscription "Justice" hanging on the facade of the building "Riodos"; two reporters in their 30s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts that show his smile, face with glasses or his trademark panama.
The seminar takes place less than two months after his death; journalists discuss their common trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although an office of a special federal prosecutor was set up in 2010 to investigate journalistic cases, so far, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, only two cases have been investigated.
As with most of the thousands of murders committed each year related to drug trafficking and organized crime, the killers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.
Riodos journalists insist they will write about the violence in Sinaloa, although they are heartbroken, although it is now much more dangerous around them.
Without information about the killers, without justice, talking about security at meetings is of little use," Ibarra said.
"It's very stupid to waste time at this seminar," he says.
"Until we know the cause, we suspect everyone."
On the morning of May 15, Valdés left the Riodos office in the state capital of Culiacana.
He only managed to drive a couple of blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men; he was pulled out of the car and shot 12 times, probably because of the newspaper's name – which means "Twelfth River".
The shooter drove away in his car and crashed it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He is survived by his wife and two adult children.
Rumors usually quickly spread through Culiacán.
But almost everyone is silent about Valdez.
Since Guzman was arrested and extradited to the U.S. last January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields in the country as rival factions struggle to fill the vacuum.
Let's not talk about the fact that every day on the streets of Sinaloa one or more people are killed, or that the cemetery is filled with decorated two-story mausoleums of drug farms, which are larger than the homes of many living people.
Let's forget for a moment that the state of "calm" is simply when one of the cartels takes control of a coastal state with important ports and drug trafficking routes leading to the United States.
Despite this and the fact that Valdés was well aware of the dangers of his job, Ismail Bohorquez, the 60-year-old co-founder and director of Riodos, is crushed by guilt for failing to protect his friend.
He thinks two mistakes helped the murder.
First, an interview was published in February with Damaso López, the leader of one of the cartel's rival factions that is at war with Guzman's sons.
The publication could anger the sons; people who were allegedly members of the gang bought all copies of the publication as soon as they were delivered to the kiosks.
The second mistake was that he did not force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after another newspaper that was writing about the same story was seized.
Valdés was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder was seen as the latest milestone in the development of violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had been evading danger for so long, his friends and colleagues thought he would always be.
He was an experienced reporter at Noroesta and in 2003, along with five colleagues, founded Riodos, selling his $50 shares.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalism without touching on the topic of drugs," Bohorquez said.
Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation as a bold and honest publication, sales and advertising revenues grew.
Journalists liked that they could publish bold reports without fear of censorship, and readers were attracted that in this publication they could read about what no one else dared to write about.
Eight years after its founding, Riodose received the prestigious Maria Moores Cabo Award for her reporting in Latin America.
That same year, Valdés won the International Press Freedom Award for his courage in investigating drug trafficking in Mexico wherever it went.
He frankly admitted that he was scared.
"I want to move on with my life," he said at the CPJ Awards.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa is "a way of life," he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento TV.
"You have to accept the tasks that fall on you as a journalist – either that way or you're just fooling around."
I don't want to be asked, "What did you do when there were so many deaths around... why didn't you say what was going on?"
The employees of Riodos miss Valdés, the prankster who swore like a longshoreman in the port, a friend generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to get together in the living.
They relied on the order he had.
He had to wear his hat at all times.
He had to go to "El Guayabo," the bar opposite the office, and always sit there at the same table.
Now they ask: Was he ruined by the love of the once established order?
His death caused them to question their calculations of how best to do their job and stay alive.
"They don't like it when you understand their wives, their children, their legal business and clandestine drug shipping airfields.
"Those things were over the line," Bohorquez said.
The result, even in the best of times, was a high level of self-censorship and a desire for self-preservation.
You have to believe your instincts.
Stay away from what smells bad.
The problem, says Riodose editor Andres Villareal, is that "the sense of smell can be deceived ... and then what happened to Javier happens."
The old rules, he says and others, no longer apply in Sinaloa — as they do in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where there is a toxic mixture of lucrative smuggling routes, weak state institutions and corrupt officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodos employees had gathered for security training, it was suddenly forbidden to bring cell phones: a few days earlier, it became known that spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, is used in Mexico to spy on journalists and social activists.
Outside, two police officers take cover in the shade of a tree from the 104-degree heat (40 degrees Celsius).
They were tasked by the state government to guard the office of Riodos, which is located in a four-story building in the bourgeois quarter of Culiacana.
Some journalists half-jokingly asked whether these police officers were among the 50 percent of the law enforcement officers about whom the governor himself said that they could not be trusted.
A few months ago, journalists traveled to a mountainous area that is de facto under the control of drug gangs.
In the next issue, Riodos counted on three main themes.
This is the murder in Sinaloa of the brother of former boxing champion Julio Cesar Chavez.
They also had an exposure of government spending concentrated in the governor's hometown.
And there was a gang kidnapping at one of Culiacán's most expensive restaurants, a block from the prosecutor's office.
It wasn't officially announced who was kidnapped or how it happened, so care had to be taken when it came time to write about what everyone in town knew: that it was a favorite restaurant of both drug dealers and authorities.
One journalist learned from open databases that the restaurant was registered in the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which dominated all levels of government for most of the past century.
Recently, several governors from the PRI have faced high-profile allegations of corruption.
Villarreal asked reporters to write about previous incidents at the restaurant, including when the son of "El Chapo" Guzman eluded a military raid.
A few months ago, readers would have searched for Valdez's column with the most reliable information about the kidnapping.
"We would have known what happened before," said Villareal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco", for his thin physique.
"Today, all channels of communication with our sources are broken."
Valdez's cabinet is now used as a warehouse for posters and stickers protesting the killings of journalists because employees have become what they never thought they would become: activists speaking on behalf of the press.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez picked up several posters and went to a demonstration outside the local prosecutor's office the next morning dedicated to another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the state of Michoacán in the west of the country three days after Valdés was killed.
They found the burned body, and authorities said it was him, based on DNA tests.
Across the country, journalists began to speak louder, organize protests and write "SOS Press" on the sidewalks and walls of houses.
On that day, Director Bohorquez was in Washington, D.C., trying to garner international support in demanding justice in the Valdés case.
In a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez's murder, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and ordering their murders for telling the truth.
After that, she asked not to be given any more assignments to cover the activities of the government, fearing that anger would damage her objectivity.
Valdés has said many times that journalists in Mexico are "surrounded" by organized crime, its accomplices in government and an indifferent society.
In his latest book, Narco-Journalism, he wrote that it's not just gangs of drug traffickers who kill reporters; they do so on the orders of politicians and security services in cahoots with organized crime.
The Article 19 Press Protection Committee estimates that half of the attacks on journalists last year were ordered by police and government officials.
"In Mexico, you're dying because they want to shut you up," Ramirez says.
Of course, murder terrifies people.
Everyone remembers the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias six years ago in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
A note was found on her body, presumably written on behalf of the Zetas cartel: "I am here because of my articles."
A computer keyboard and headphones lay next to her severed head.
Some publications chose to shut down, like the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua, after her correspondent Miroslava Brich was killed in March.
Others continue to hold on, like "El Magnana" from Nuevo Laredo after the assassination of its leader in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juárez publicly addressed drug cartels through a front-page editorial entitled "What Do You Want from Us?"
Some journalists have left their home states or the country altogether.
It's a painful decision.
It's hard to find work in exile, and they still look out for danger in the streets.
And sometimes they are killed, as apparently happened to photographer Ruben Espinoza, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico three months after fleeing Veracruz.
Those who stay and continue to work balance risky decisions on a daily basis.
Ibarra – who once dreamed of being a poet – admits that he is afraid to write about the drug trade.
"Mexico is going to hell and that's why I became a journalist," he says.
Last Friday, at midnight, when the last issue was ready for printing, the publishers of Riodoce were sitting on the sidewalk next to the office drinking beer when suddenly their phones rang at the same time.
A series of shootings between rival gangs and security forces near the resort town of Mazatlan left behind, according to confirmed data, 19 corpses.
The war continued to rage, as promised in a series of messages from cartels discovered in the area.
Sitting on the sidewalk, they posted the news on the Riodos website via their mobile phone.
The next day, the first page had to be redone.
Nearby, sirens rang out - another shootout in the vicinity.
Bohorkes looked to see if the police officers guarding them were ready to defend themselves.
If they were scared, they didn't show it.
Sitting under a huge portrait of the deceased founder of their newspaper, whose middle finger was on display throughout Sinaloa, the Riodos staff continued his work.
"How can you think about shutting down," Bohorquez said, "if on the very day Javier was killed, an intern asked me to send her outside to report?"
Dinosaur used camouflage to avoid enemies
At first glance, it seems like a statue, albeit a terrifying one.
The researchers said that the first remains of an incredible creature the size of a rhino, discovered by a Canadian miner, were preserved so well that experts called it the "Mona Lisa among dinosaurs."
It is so well preserved that they were even able to determine that the color of its scaly skin was reddish-brown – and to say that it had, in a way, a "dark past."
In a report published in the journal Modern Biology, it was described as "the best preserved of the Thyreophores in the history of the finds and one of the best specimens of a dinosaur in the world."
This fossil is a recently found specimen of Nodosaurus, which lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period, between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
Its incredibly good condition has stunned researchers who call it "truly remarkable."
This herbivorous thyrophore is the best-preserved fossil of this species in the history of the finds, according to articles in National Geographic magazine.
It was found by Sean Funk while he was working at the Suncore Company's Millennium mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
He stumbled upon something that seemed different from the surrounding rock and decided to take a closer look.
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Paleontological Museum.
For the next six years, work was carried out to find an animal inside an earthen block weighing 2500 feet (1100 kilograms).
Now that all this hard work is done, the finished result can be demonstrated.
"You just have to squint a little, and you can almost believe that he is asleep," said lead author Caleb Brown, a research fellow at the Royal Tyrrell Paleontological Museum, where the creation is demonstrated.
"It will go down in the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved specimens of dinosaurs – the Mona Lisa among dinosaurs."
By studying its skin, the researchers found that this herbivore, despite being covered in a shell and resembling a walking tank, appeared to be exposed to significant danger from carnivorous dinosaurs.
This powerfully shelled dinosaur used red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and applied a protective technique known as protective coloration, which is also used by many animals of our day.
That would allow it to blend in more quickly with its surroundings and avoid encountering enemies, experts say, suggesting it was hunted by larger dinosaurs.
The 110-million-year-old creature, part of the Nodosaurus family, was widely pressed in May and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrell Paleontological Museum.
Scientists have already studied the animal and gave it the name Borealopelta markmitchelli in honor of museum laboratory assistant Mark Mitchell, one of the members of the group who spent more than 7,000 hours on its painstaking excavation.
The amazing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of the scales and shell plates on his body.
They found a protective coloration, a common method of protection in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its underside.
Although protective coloration is well spread, the discovery came as a surprise because the size of the dinosaur Borealopelta far exceeds the size of living animals with protective coloration.
It can be assumed that this dinosaur was so actively hunted by carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution preferred the disguise of confrontation as a way of survival.
But most modern animals with protective coloration – for example, deer, zebras or armadillos – are much smaller and are more accessible prey, which indicates that Nodosaurus had to seriously struggle for survival.
"The serious threat from predators to the massive, powerfully shelled dinosaur shows how dangerous the predatory dinosaurs of the Cretaceous period were," Brown said.
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in the dinosaur's scales also suggests that its skin must have been reddish-brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal, looking for information about its life, including the preserved contents of its digestive tract, to find out what it ate during its last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, it fell into the river and was carried away into the sea, where it sank and lay back down to the bottom of the ocean.
In those days, Alberta was as warm as it is now in South Florida, and rivers and oceans were likely to extend much further inland than they are now.
"This Nodosaurus is truly remarkable in that it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin, and at the same time completely preserved in three dimensions, retaining the original shape of the animal," brown said.
"As a result, the animal now looks almost the same as it looked then, in the Early Cretaceous period.
You don't have to resort to imagination to recreate it, you just have to squint slightly, and you can almost believe that he is asleep. "
The Cretaceous period is the era when giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs standing on two legs, roamed the Earth.
Although the most remarkable of these, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years later than Borealopelta, the thyreophore could have been hunted by one of its formidable ancestors.
These include acrocanthosaurus, a 38-foot-long (11.5-meter)-long monster weighing six tons.
Scientists whose latest discoveries are published in the journal Modern Biology believe that Borealopelta was carried away to sea after death and mummified in silt.
The creature was found by Sean Funk when he was working at the Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
According to museum staff, it is the best-preserved thyreophore in the world, along with skin and shell, and it is intact, from the muzzle to the femur bones.
On average, these creatures reached about 18 feet (five meters) in length and weighed up to 3000 pounds (1300 kilograms).
Their characteristic feature was two twenty-inch spikes protruding from the shoulders.
Researchers believe that this herbivorous thyreophore stepped heavily on what is now Canada, until a flooded river carried it into the open sea.
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur preserved its shell with accuracy to the smallest detail.
The fossilized remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the remains of the skin still cover the bumpy shell plates along the dinosaur skull.
As Michael Greshko wrote in an article for National Geographic magazine, such a degree of preservation is "rare as winning the lottery."
The longer I look at it, the more striking it seems.
Fossilized remains of the skin still cover the bumpy armored plates that dot the animal's skull.
His right front leg is elongated along the side, five fingers on it are turned upwards.
I can count the scales on its sole."
Mikheil Saakashvili managed to get to Poland without documents
Mikheil Saakashvili, who previously headed Georgia, and then the Odessa region in Ukraine, flew to Poland.
At the same time, he did this without having documents confirming his identity and citizenship.
Saakashvili's arrival is reported by the Polish edition of Telewizja Republika, which posted a video of his speech on its YouTube channel.
Saakashvili spoke at an event to commemorate the anniversary of the Warsaw Uprising against Hitler's troops in 1944.
Since the politician does not know Polish, although he tried to start speaking in this language, he had to speak English through a Polish translator.
During his speech, the politician touched upon the topic of cooperation between Georgia and Poland, and also spoke about Ukraine.
The fact that the migration service of Ukraine deprived him of citizenship, the disgraced politician learned while in the United States.
How exactly he managed to make a transatlantic flight without documents is still unknown.
Earlier, the former governor of the Odessa region, Mikhail Saakashvili, said that his signature on the questionnaire for obtaining Ukrainian citizenship was forged.
The politician stressed that he did not fill out any questionnaires.
The term of the investigation in the case of Weinzikher and Olkhovik has been extended until January
The term of the preliminary investigation in the case of the co-owner of the Renova group of companies Evgeny Olkhovik and the head of the T Plus energy holding Boris Vainzikher has been extended until January 2, 2018.
On Thursday, August 3, the Basmanny Court is considering the issue of extending the accused's house arrest.
The representative of the IC at the meeting announced the decision to extend the term of the preliminary investigation for the last time.
"The particular complexity and duration of the investigation is due to the need to seize and conduct an examination of a large number of documents, as well as conduct investigative actions in the territory of several subjects of the Russian Federation," the investigator said.
He added that the suspects regularly bribed Comey's leadership.
Their total size is estimated at at least a billion rubles.
According to the investigation, Vainzikher, Olkhovik, as well as the former head of Complex Energy Systems CJSC Mikhail Slobodin, who headed VimpelCom until September 5, transferred bribes to senior officials of the Komi Republic for establishing the most favorable tariffs for heat and electricity, as well as for creating favorable conditions for business.
Vainzikher and Olkhovik were detained, transferred to Syktyvkar and arrested for two months, Slobodin fled from the investigation and was put on the federal wanted list.
How did one activist find out the answer to the question "Whose streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to the core.
Just a day after arriving in New York city as part of a tourist trip, the St. Louis native was sitting on a bed in an apartment rented through Airbnb, scrolling through the Facebook feed on her phone.
She came across a post from a high school.
It said: "Police have just killed an eighteen-year-old child and he is still lying in the middle of the street."
Noticing that no one else in her feed posted this information, puzzled, she shut down Facebook and opened Twitter.
In her feed there were many reposts of a user with the nickname @TheePharoah.
A rapper from Greater St. Louis tweeted the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed, eighteen-year-old black boy killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a photo of Brown's lifeless body spread out in the middle of the street where it would stay for four hours.
"It's wild," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to her and her circle.
She put down her phone and later in the evening returned to tweets about people gathering at Canfield Drive.
There were photos of a signal tape and screaming people and a man claiming to be Brown's father holding a poster saying, "A Ferguson cop just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a live broadcast of a police officer standing in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, another policeman, she said, cocked the trigger of his rifle and yelled, "I'm going to kill you all... animals!"
"It's not a standard situation," Ferrell said at the time.
"This is not the same murder as the ones to which we are accustomed and which we can call typical.
At that moment, I felt chills.
I was angry and crying."
She took a ticket for the return flight and flew home the next day.
Landing at 11 p.m., she picked up her six-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided they would both head to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next nearly three years was the subject of a new documentary, "Whose Streets?" that will be released on August 11.
It's a tale of survival and protest, of love and loss, of strength and resilience from the perspective of the people living in the community and filling the streets demanding answers.
As Ferrell drove to Ferguson with her daughter dressed in a floral dress and a wreath to match the color, they recalled a conversation they had had had had before this morning countless times "about the experiences of blacks and their situation."
She recalls saying, "Remember how I told you about how black people had to fight for what they believed?
We're going to Ferguson now because a police officer killed an eighteen-year-old boy and it was wrong."
"I couldn't help but take her," Ferrell said later.
"What is happening today is the culmination of ... what happened before.
She needs to know about it, see it, and be educated on it.
She must not only be well-versed in activism and organization, but also understand the different levels of black experience and their positions and what we must do to become free, to be free.
Even if I manage to provide her with an environment in which she personally does not face obvious racism, she is no different from any other black girl.
I feel like I would have done her a disservice if I had shielded her from that."
When they arrived in Ferguson, they made their first stop at South Florissant Road, a site across the street from the police station, which had become something of a tent camp, while activists waited for reports of officer Darren Wilson's final non-indictment.
There, Ferrell and his daughter joined a local entrepreneur who was preparing lunch packages.
They collected packages and helped distribute them to protesters.
Little by little, a new type of activism took shape in Ferrell's mind.
"My activism has completely changed since Aug. 9," she said, noting that as a student at Missouri-St. Louis University, she was president of the Association of Minority Health Students and worked on food equity and health inequalities among black communities.
"I had no experience as an organizer.
It came by itself."
A few weeks later, at an evening demonstration, Ferrell met Sabaa Folayan, one of her co-directors.
Folayan said she and her chief cinematographer, Lucas Alvarado-Farrer, "just wanted to document" the events.
Ferrell came up with the question, "Do you want to document, or are you trying to find a story to play on?"
This skepticism was inspired by numerous people, often white, who came to the community to capitalize on its pain and resilience.
As Folayan explained in a recent interview, "We've heard that the voices of people who were born and raised in Ferguson don't get the spotlight, and wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already teamed up with her co-director Damon Davis, a local artist known for his activism on death row.
His involvement sparked sympathy for the project in Ferrell and six other locals with whom the "Whose Streets?" team had been in touch in the years since Brown's murder.
"In this documentary, it's not someone speaking for us or with us, it's us talking," Davis said.
"That was the most important thing to me how these people would be represented, because that's how I'm going to be represented."
And while the goal of the project was not to focus on Ferrell's experience at all — in an effort to show that the movement "is not about a leader-savior, but about how the community comes together," as Folayan said — she was the most open of the film's participants.
As a result, "Whose Streets?" shows unexpectedly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, such as how she fell in love and married her wife.
"I felt naked," Ferrell said, laughingly about the first time she saw the finished product.
"But I understood that when you do this kind of work and humanize black people, there has to be some level of vulnerability."
In addition, Ferrell's story again discusses and emphasizes the role of the black homosexual woman in the broader context of the Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the movement's three founders — those who created the #BlackLivesMatter tag on social media after the murder of black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 — identify as homosexual.
"Black gay women in leadership positions support this whole movement," Ferrell says. - And all because we are constantly fighting on several fronts.
Black gay women have to bear all this burden."
Folayan agreed, noting that "the movement is actually supported by black women and a host of gay black women."
However, she insists that "this is not a case of positive discrimination", and that Ferrell was not chosen as the central character of the film because of her distinctive features.
"She was the person who awakened that energy," she said.
"On the other hand, it's not a coincidence that she's come to the fore because when"
You can feel her energy through the screen."
Meanwhile, Ferguson has long since no movie cameras, but complex racial ties between the community and the police remain.
Ferrell will be on probation for another two and a half years for blocking the highway during the demonstration.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the place she calls home simply: "A mess."
She still holds on to the speech she learned when she took to the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
We must fight for our freedom.
We have to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains."
Two Salvadoran footballers disqualified for biting US players
Salvadoran national team players Henry Romero and Darwin Seren received lengthy suspensions for unsportsmanlike conduct.
During the quarterfinal match of the Gold Cup of the Confederations of Football of North and Central America and the Caribbean (CONCACAF), Salvadorans bit American players.
Defender Henry Romero scored first.
The Salvadoran bit striker Josie Altidore, after which he pinched his chest.
Midfielder Seren then bit US defender Omar Gonzalez for a corner in his own penalty area.
As a result, Romero was suspended for three matches and Seren for six.
The meeting itself ended with the victory of the Americans with a score of 2:0, reports Goal.com.
The emergence of similarities: the artist creates portraits using the DNA of Chelsea Manning
In the center of the hall at the Friedman Gallery in New York, people's faces hang from the ceiling on a wire - white, black and brown, all somehow subtly similar to each other.
These 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Harbourg from cheek strokes and hair clippings sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent clippings from Fort Levenworth Prison, where a former intelligence analyst is serving a 35-year sentence for famously transmitting confidential diplomatic cables on the WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition, which opened on August 2, is called "The Emergence of Similarities."
It's the result of a two-year correspondence between Dewey Harborg, whose art combines technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transgender woman and famous dissident whom Barack Obama commuted just three days before the end of his presidency.
By analyzing the DNA obtained from Manning with a computer program and using it to create three-dimensional portraits of faces that people with such a genome might have, Dewey-Harbourg created a profound, if difficult to understand, manifesto devoted not only to the plasticity of DNA data - the various ways of interpreting them and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also the concept of identity.
Manning, who was born with the name Bradley Edward but has openly said since she was a teenager that she considered herself a woman, was sentenced to 20 counts in 2013, including six Espionage Act violations, computer fraud and theft.
Photos of her in prison were not available, so only one photo of her was known: a grainy black-and-white selfie in which Manning, in a platinum-shaded wig, clearly feeling awkward, sits behind the wheel of a car; she became associated with this photograph.
In 2015, Dewey-Harbourg completed her 2012 project Visions of Strangers with great success.
In it, the artist created portraits of unknown people with the help of forensic evidence such as cigarette butts and chewing gum, extracting DNA from this garbage and creating images of what these people could look like.
And then she got an email from Paper Magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted some kind of portrait to illustrate the article," Dewey-Hagborg explained at a preview screening of the new exhibition to the press.
At the time, Chelsea couldn't be visited or photographed, so they contacted her and asked if she wanted a portrait made from her DNA.
In this unusual way, the artist and her imprisoned muse became pen pals and exchanged several letters over the course of two years.
They even wrote a comic book, "Depressed Images," illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, who depicted how in the future the president would mitigate Chelsea's punishment and she would be able to visit the exhibition in person.
That Obama did decide to release Manning just days after the book was published came as a pleasant surprise after seven hard years in a military prison in Kansas.
There's something profound and powerful about the fact that the exhibit opens right now that Donald Trump is declaring war on people who disclose classified information in the government and inventing new ways to foment the hatred on Twitter that he is designed to soften.
When Dewey-Harbourg was asked about the coincidence of all this time, she said that "nothing happens by chance."
In the artist's statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning's huge signature at the bottom (with a heart instead of an i in her last name) calls for an end to "automatic separation based on gender, race, sexual orientation and culture."
On the opposite side is its mitochondrial DNA, a long caterpillar of pencil-drawn C, G, and A.
By including 200 letters (or nucleotides, as the artist scientifically exquisitely puts it), Dewey-Harbourg hoped to show how we are all remarkably similar, at least in our biological structure.
"I hope to explain to people that our genome doesn't determine what we are, how open the genetic data is to interpretation, and how subjective it is," Dewey-Harbourg said. her 2007 video work False Memories is also featured here.
"DNA data can tell us so many different stories, and 30 of those stories are here."
The last part of the exhibition, which fits in one room, is the aforementioned novel in the comics.
In it, King Kong-style Manning appears above the U.S. Correctional Barracks building with a loudspeaker in his hand.
"If they kill your speech, they will win," it reads.
"So never shut up."
"This is a direct quote from a letter she wrote to me," says the artist, who greets us from Philadelphia.
"I still get goosebumps when I talk about it."
Manning has yet to see the exhibit in person — as was presciently portrayed in the comics — but when she arrives, she will be greeted by masks in the center of the room, her own genomic simulacra gathered like crowds of protesters.
This is also done intentionally, like everything in the exhibition up to the height (5"2, Manning's height), on which genetic haplogroups were drawn with a pencil.
"I used to hang them on the walls, but now I wanted them to look like a crowd of people," Dewey-Harbourg says of the portraits.
"I wanted them to be like the mass movement that formed around Chelsea, as a movement that was behind her release. "
A Professor at Northwestern University and an Oxford University staff member is wanted by police on murder charges
According to police, there is a nationwide raid on a professor at Northwestern University and an employee of oxford University, who are wanted as suspects in connection with the fact that a man stabbed to death was found in a luxurious room in Chicago.
According to Cook County Court records, arrest warrants were issued Monday for premeditated murder without the possibility of bail for forty-two-year-old Windam Latham and fifty-six-year-old Andrew Warren in connection with their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton G. James Cornell-Duranloe.
According to the documents, twenty-six-year-old Cornell-Duranlo died after being stabbed multiple times.
A warning issued by the Chicago Police Department said the body was found on July 27.
The police received a call, they arrived at the Grand Plaza apartment complex and found the victim with several wounds on his body.
Cornell-Duranlow was pronounced dead at the scene and detectives are now investigating the death from stab wounds, considering it a murder, according to officials, while police are intensely searching for two suspects.
Latham has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Kabbaj, the university's vice president of communications, said in an emailed statement that Latham is on administrative leave and that he is barred from entering Northwestern University campuses.
"Now this is a criminal case that is being investigated by authorized persons, and Northwestern University is cooperating with the investigation," Kabbaj said.
Warren is a senior finance officer at the University of Oxford.
A spokesman for the university and Somerville College said in an emailed statement: "We have spoken to uk police and stand ready to provide any necessary assistance to U.S. investigative authorities."
The statement also said Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to give up.
Chicago Police Department communications chief Anthony Guglielmi said he strongly advised suspects to surrender to authorities.
"The police have assumptions about their whereabouts, but our attempts to find them are intensifying," Guglielmi said.
According to Guglielmi, local, regional and federal authorities are helping in the search for suspects.
According to Guglielmi, the police received a call from the administrator of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious message that something had happened in the number 1008.
The police called the crime scene terrible.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident itself occurred on July 27.
According to him, the data from the video cameras confirm that Latham and Warren were in the building.
"We believe professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said.
The management of Grand Plaza issued an appeal to the guests, which reported: "At the moment, the police are working on the chronology of the incident, collecting information about the victim and considering a number of motives, including a possible domestic incident."
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko: "We will fulfill the requirements of the WADA roadmap in the near future"
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that the conditions of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), set for the resumption of the work of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA), will be met in the near future.
"A certain stage in the fulfillment of the requirements was passed, RUSADA received the right to plan and conduct tests together with UKAD (the UK Anti-Doping Agency).
WADA's roadmap has been updated accordingly," Mutko said on Thursday.
The Prime Minister commented on the second part of WADA's roadmap to restore compliance with the Code, which lists the conditions for the resumption of RUSADA's work and was recently published on the organization's website.
According to Mutko, it does not contain anything that could present difficulties for Russia.
"Everything has been announced, everything will be done.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," he added.
However, one of the requirements included in the list implies that Russian anti-doping structures must publicly acknowledge the results of the investigation commissioned by WADA by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, which claimed that doping in Russian sports is controlled by the state.
Touching on this issue, Mutko said: "We are investigating because our anti-doping system has failed.
All measures have been taken.
But there were no state programs, and we will not recognize what did not happen."
Mutko repeated the words of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
On the morning of the same day, in an interview with the Russian edition of Rsport, Smirnov acknowledged the previous problems in the Russian anti-doping structures, but added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains certain controversial positions and provisions.
No one is going to accept this report unconditionally," Smirnov added.
WADA suspended RUSADA from doping controls in November 2015 after a doping scandal.
However, in June this year, he was allowed to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
After visiting the organization's Moscow office in July, WADA Director General Olivier Niggli said RUSADA was "moving in the right direction" to restore its work.
Extinguished fire in 79-storey tower in Dubai
A major fire that occurred in one of the tallest residential buildings in the world, The Torch Tower, has been extinguished, Reuters reports.
It is noted that firefighters managed to cope with all the fires by 4.00 local time (3.00 Moscow time).
Local authorities said no one was injured in the incident.
At the time of extinguishing the fire, the streets adjacent to the skyscraper were blocked.
The causes of the incident are still unknown.
Earlier it was reported that in Dubai, the 79-storey residential skyscraper The Torch, which is one of the tallest buildings in the world, is on fire.
All residents were evacuated in time.
Buzova's unimaginable outfit shocked fans: pants that do not cover their panties
The scandalous host of the reality show "Dom-2" Olga Buzova amazed the audience of the Europa Plus Live festival with dancing in shorts.
In front of thousands of fans, the newly-appeared singer performed the song "We will be hot" in a duet with Nastya Kudry.
Both girls took the stage in provocative "trousers", sewn in such a way that the singers' underwear was in plain sight.
On the trousers were made the inscriptions Buzova and Kudry.
Earlier it was reported how changes in the appearance of Buzova commented on a specialist of one of the Moscow clinics of plastic surgery.
Stoltenberg acknowledged the deterioration of relations between NATO and Russia
This was reported on Friday, August 4, by the news service "Radio 4" with reference to foreign media.
According to him, it is the Russian authorities who are responsible for the deterioration of relations between the West and Russia.
In an interview with CNN, the NATO Secretary General also criticized Russia for the situation with the Crimea and the "destabilization in the east of Ukraine."
At the same time, Stoltenberg assured that a dialogue with Russia, nevertheless, is possible, and further escalation of the situation will not benefit any of its participants.
Earlier on Thursday, US President Donald Trump said that relations between the US and Russia are at a dangerously low level, and blamed the US Congress for this.
Metro Ekaterinburg is mastering a new method of payment
In October, travel in the Yekaterinburg metro can be paid by credit card, said Pavel Vedernikov, general director of I-Set OJSC, in an interview with the Regional Gazette.
Our goal is to introduce the same metro fare payment system for the 2018 FIFA World Cup as in other major cities: Moscow, St. Petersburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Novosibirsk.
"We want fans from other countries, guests of the World Cup, to be able to use the metro with their bank cards, without purchasing tokens and without standing in line," he said.
Startups that will help your company not to become another Uber
Aimee Errett wanted to gauge the level of satisfaction among her e-commerce startup's employees, but the surveys didn't work.
The answers were often vague, useless, or worse, disingenuous.
And even though she promised anonymity, some employees did not trust the process.
"It's never been consistent and objective," said Errett, who runs 75-person company Madison Reed, a San Francisco-based company that e-commerces hair cares.
So she turned to third parties for help.
Now there is a new kind of startups in the field of working with personnel, which help companies find out how their employees feel.
By developing and licensing software designed to measure employee engagement, they allow companies to conduct rapid surveys, reach out to specific teams and demographic groups, offer employees anonymity and hotlines for complaints, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass top management and contact the directorate directly.
"We now have tools like Strava and Fitbit to monitor health, and where is Fitbit for your company?" says Jim Barnett, co-founder and president of Redwood City-based startup Glint, whose analytics programs are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett said she has gained a greater understanding of what her employees are thinking and feeling in three years of using Glint.
In addition to express surveys and questionnaires of certain teams, the product offers a heat map of the company and shows in a visual form which departments have more complaints and which managers have a low approval rating, which allows it to understand why.
Companies are slowly realizing that they need to control the situation in the workplace, otherwise they will become the next Uber, which was involved in the scandal when a former employee published a blog post in which he described an aggressive environment in which those who expressed discontent were punished.
For startups like Glint, it's a desire to control the situation – an opportunity for profitable business.
Let's Talk About Payment, an online portal dedicated to financial technology, estimates that the global governance, regulatory and compliance industry could be worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020.
Denver, Colorado-based startup Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw a slight increase in interest and activity earlier this year amid Uber's declining reputation.
Convercent has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Recently, Uber appeared among the clients.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to submit custom-made employee opinion polls, collect confidential responses in real time, and view heat maps of problem areas.
It also provides a hotline for anonymous text messages that allows employees to report bad behavior.
And if a top manager is affected, complaints go directly to the directorate.
"The public opinion court has seized power from the inspectors," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and president of Convercent.
If a company finds itself mistreating employees or behaving unethically, even if inspectors don't intervene, the company could face costly consequences in the form of boycotts by customers, employee churn and lawsuits, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees in 500 establishments, has used Convercent for more than a year to make sure employees are up to date with policies and procedures and to offer an easy way to contact the company's head office.
Previously, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to look up the phone number or email of the head office, file a formal complaint, and hope that it would be taken seriously.
It was often a frightening and embarrassing experience, said James Vitrano, head of legal at Ruby Tuesday, who said there was no normal way to track employee complaints.
Now that the company is using Convercent, problems that used to be hidden from managers sitting in offices in other cities or states – such as discrimination, harassment and unfair pay – can be more quickly detected and addressed.
"I can get closer to a holistic, comprehensive understanding of employees' situations," said Vitrano, who leads the Ruby Tuesday network's risk management team.
"And we protect our shareholders from litigation with employees."
According to Quinland, companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002, after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations as a result of the Enron Case.
But it wasn't until "social media gained mass adoption" that companies realized they couldn't keep their dirty laundry from spreading virally online.
"Before they started using technology to control ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, charging companies a regular fee for using their products.
It's a business model and opportunity that has been endorsed by venture capitalists who have backed both startups.
In February, Convercent received $10 million in funding from firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing the company's total capital to $47 million.
Glint received $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing the company's total capital to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising when you consider the interconnected nature of companies, culture, and venture capital.
A growing body of research demonstrates that today's employees expect more from their jobs than they did before.
In highly competitive markets like Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are just the bare minimum.
Employees want to feel accepted and appreciated, and that they are dedicating their time to a company with a positive mission.
"When people are happy to work for a company, feel that they are being heard, and that the work they do is paying off, they try harder to make that company a success," said Nina McQueen, vice president of global benefits and employee satisfaction at LinkedIn, which employs both Convercent and Glint.
Investors earn income when companies in their portfolio are doing well; companies are doing well when employees are dedicated and engaged.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee loyalty and engagement, then it's no surprise that they find support.
According to workplace culture experts, it is important to have data on employee engagement.
But the data is useless until the company's trustees take action.
In fact, if a company asks employees for feedback, it can give the impression that change is coming.
And if change doesn't come quickly enough, or doesn't come at all, frustration can develop and employees lose interest.
"If you're going to ask for 4,000 proposals, you have to be willing to have 4,000 conversations," says Russell Rath, president of consulting at management firm Kotter International, who has seen companies make the mistake of relying too much on data collection.
"Because if you don't go all the way, employees will be guessing, 'Did you really hear me?
Do you care?
And if you don't care, why shouldn't I care?"
According to Errett, Madison Reed, which now conducts monthly employee surveys, is able to take action on the same day someone reports a problem using Glint.
And, after collecting feedback from employees dissatisfied with the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and introduce communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday is gaining new knowledge about its employees and hopes that in the long term this knowledge will help it to retain employees more effectively in an industry known for high turnover.
"If you don't try to create a culture of transparency, you're going to lose people," Vitrano said.
If you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose companies.
In Barnaul, open new asphalt on Krasnoarmeysky Avenue
In Barnaul, cardinal measures were taken to eliminate the cause of asphalt failures on Krasnoarmeysky Avenue.
The place where pits twice appeared on the recently asphalted roadway (intersection with Molodezhnaya Street), it was decided to "open".
Recall that the collapse of a small section of the road near the tram tracks occurred due to the fact that the land sank in the area of the ownerless unused network.
According to ivan Garmat, Deputy Chairman of the City Committee for Road Management, Improvement, Transport and Communications, a detailed survey will be carried out for a detailed examination and elimination of the prerequisites for the collapse.
Depending on its results, the necessary measures will be taken.
It is assumed that it will be necessary to restore the formwork of ownerless communications and their concreting.
This was reported on the official website of the regional capital.
The Bruins have to exercise longer due to the fact that the National Collegiate Athletic Association canceled training twice a day.
The time is approaching eleven in the evening; a crowd of soccer players from the University of California, Los Angeles, lingers to chat on one side of the team's new training fields located on campus.
Some of them pulled down their T-shirts, exposing their backs, glistening with sweat after the tense first day of sports camp.
For many of the team's players, these moments of idleness constitute a break in the middle of the day.
Players enrolled in summer classes will travel back to their dormitories after a three-hour practice session to prepare for the final exams, and return to the Wasserman Football Center the next morning for meetings at 6:30 a.m.
Shortly before Monday turned into Tuesday, Bruins coach Jim Mora said, "In the next three days, these guys are going to have a meat grinder."
The fact that the National Collegiate Athletic Association canceled training twice a day, which was invented to reduce the workload for players, actually lengthened their working day – at least until the end of exams on Friday.
Therefore, the first three training sessions of the University of California, Los Angeles team were scheduled to begin at 7:15 p.m. to fit into the already tight schedule of players.
A side effect of not having two workouts a day has been more days with one workout, and Bruins is pushing the start of camp by almost a week compared to last year and conducting training during summer school for the first time in Mora's six seasons in Westwood.
According to the schedule, they will have to conduct 18 training sessions until August 20 inclusive, before starting official preparations for the first game of the season against the Texas A&M University team in September.
Mora said he supports the change in the rules by the National Collegiate Athletic Association, despite the fact that it has created another item in the tight schedule of players.
"For three or four days, we're giving them this huge workload, it's a serious test," Mora said.
"And they just got over it, they're working, they're great guys.
I think when we get to Saturday and we have more time, it's going to be really great."
When camp is over, the University of California, Los Angeles will make training closed; this is not an easy task, as its fields are in direct line of sight from the adjacent parking lot and from the nearby Laskin Center, an expensive hotel that has already been bombarded with soccer balls that have broken through the protective net behind the gate.
Players from the Bruins should occupy the hotel starting this weekend, but Mora admits that when the rooms are free during the season, there may be a problem.
"We're going to have security," Mora said.
"It's a serious problem, and I'm not exaggerating the danger by assuming someone might rent a room, sit there, and record a workout on video.
If you have a video recording of your workout, it's very serious.
But we're going to have security there and we're going to have security in parking number 8.
We'll do the best we can with what we have.
I won't worry too much about it.
We have a plan."
All victims of the terrorist attack in St. Petersburg were discharged from hospitals
All those injured during the terrorist attack in the metro of St. Petersburg in April were discharged from hospitals.
This was reported by the press service of vice-governor Anna Mityanina.
As of the end of July, three people remained in hospitals, TV Center reports.
Recall, the explosion in the metro of St. Petersburg thundered on April 3 of this year.
The bomb was detonated by suicide bomber Akbarjon Jalilov.
As a result of the terrorist attack, 15 people were killed, as well as the perpetrator himself.
In the criminal case, 11 people, including the alleged organizer Abror Azimov, were arrested.
Recall, on the eve of Rospotrebnadzor recommended that the metro of St. Petersburg revise the action plan to ensure transport security, in particular, by increasing the number of metal detector frames.
Facebook steps up fact-checking in the fight against fake news
Facebook will more often send texts suspicious of hoaxes to independent experts and show their conclusions under original posts, the world's largest social network, which is trying to fight so-called fake news, said on Thursday.
In a statement on its website, the company said it is starting to use improved machine learning algorithms to recognize possible hoaxes, send them for verification and possibly show the results of fact-checking under the original post.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main ways of spreading so-called fake news, which many believe had an impact on the 2016 US presidential election.
The issue is also being actively debated in Europe after French voters were misled by false messages before the presidential election in May, and in Germany, before the September elections, they announced support for a plan to fine social networks if they did not promptly remove posts inciting hatred.
On Thursday, in a separate statement in German, Facebook announced testing a new fact-checking algorithm that has been launched in the U.S., France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to seeing which posts are being challenged by independent reviewers, people want to have broader context to make informed judgments about what they read and share," Sarah Sue, Facebook News Feed Manager, wrote in her block.
She added that Facebook will continue to test the "related articles" feature and work on other changes to the news feed to address the issue of fake news.
Create a comic book novel: One Castle in English History
In the recent past, the tiny Scotney Castle was filmed in the music video "Squeeze", and in the 70s and 80s served as a haven for Margaret Thatcher.
But for 700 years, from his cozy place in the Bule River Valley in Kent, he watched the turbulent history around him, and now inspired Jamie Rhodes, a Yorkshireman with a spear hair and a penchant for historical documents, for a comic book novel.
"I think it's so beautiful to look at the handwriting of a man who died 300 years ago," he says enthusiastically.
"You feel it so personally when you hold this letter in your hand."
"The Castle in England" covers the period from the Middle Ages to the Edwardian era and tells about the families who lived in Scotch; each story was illustrated by one of the young British artists - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Bryonie May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabelle Greenberg.
This is not the first book by Rhodes to be based on archival data: in 2014, he wrote Teeth of a Dead Man and Other Stories, a collection of British Library documents; this project suddenly touched him to the core.
"I could have been touched simply by the fingerprint on the edge of a letter written in the 1700s by a double agent working for the Jacobites," he says.
"It's his fingerprint"
And letters always smell like smoke, because in those days a fire was lit for lighting.
And 300 years from now, in the future, you feel like you're there too.
Oh, how I love archives!"
For a man gripped by such a passion for old papers, getting support from the National Trust and the English Art Council and living in a castle for four months ("Honestly, I got a little late there") seems too good to be true.
Rhodes spent days studying the "new" Victorian castle, going through the archives and looking at the numerous treasures of the estate and antiques - for example, the heads of hyenas on the walls or bottles that had lain in the moat for centuries.
He walked around the park and the ruins of the old castle, talking to foresters, gardeners and sometimes with artists working on illustrations for his book.
Then at night he would "drink whiskey and sit down to write."
The history of Scotney Castle is not well studied because the National Trust only gained full access to it in 2006, when the last heiress, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the staff were just beginning to deal with the archive, which he describes as "what aristocrats have been dumping in the attic for centuries."
Diaries, letters from british times, maps showing who owned what: "You think land disputes are boring," rhodes says, "but two families fought for this birch tree.
It happens, folks!"
In some of the collection's stories, the castle becomes the starting point for broader explorations in English history: for example, in The Worker, the hero leaves the newly built castle to join the Peasants' Revolution of 1381.
"There are accounts of a revolt that took place at the castle in 1380 in a book called The Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex," Rhodes says.
"The peasant uprising started in these places, and I thought the revolt was the right start.
Maybe they were related?"
Other subjects are strongly connected with the history of the castle - for example, "The Priest", which tells about the Jesuit priest, whom the Darrel family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or "The Smuggler," about the eighteenth-century smuggler Arthur Durrell, who is believed to have staged his own funeral by stuffing the coffin with stones (this was discovered a few years later when the coffin was dug up).
The Darrels are Rhodes' favorite family of all that the Scottish people inhabited: "Gentlemen seem to have been a perfect crook, forever going into debt and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
In different generations, Darrell men have solved their debt problems by marrying wealthy older women – I imagine them as a company of pretty guys who know how to care for the heiresses of large fortunes. "
After finishing his work at the castle, Rhodes looks for other opportunities to gain a unique writing experience.
He lived for two weeks in the Finnish wilderness, where he wrote a graphic novel about Eljamänmäki - a place where at the beginning of the XX century there was a sanatorium, and then it was again overgrown with forest.
But Scottish remains a special place for him.
"I was sad to leave," he says.
"I felt something like this: damn, I need to go back to real life."
Fifteen largest banks choose "Russia"
The conflict in the Association of Russian Banks (ARB) is developing: following Sberbank, VTB, VTB-24, Alfa-Bank, Gazprombank, Rosselkhozbank, Binbank and FC Otkritie, seven more credit institutions are going to leave this public organization.
Thus, the share of organizations that have left arB will account for at least 80 percent of the market.
But this is not just a way out - all the banks that announced a break with the ARB are negotiating with another public organization that unites credit institutions - the Association of Regional Banks "Russia", which is headed by the well-known politician Anatoly Aksakov, Chairman of the State Duma Committee on the Financial Market, recognized, by the way, at the end of the last session and the most effective head of the Duma Committee and deputy in terms of the number of draft laws prepared.
The beginning of the conflict within the ARB was laid during the discussion in the Federation Council, when the Interregional Banking Council considered new bills, in particular, suggesting a new classification of banks depending on the size of the authorized capital.
Then Garegin Tosunyan, president of the ARB, said that, according to the association, this bill is adopted in the interests of the largest banks, which thus try to limit the capabilities of small and medium-sized banks in the regions, intercepting their clientele.
Among other claims, there was criticism of the Central Bank, which, according to Tosunyan, does not always justifiably revoke licenses from some banks, which, however, was opposed by a representative of the Central Bank: many heads of the penalized banks, in particular, Vneshprombank, were members of the governing bodies of the ARB.
Apparently, this exchange of mutually exclusive views in a very sensitive banking environment with the main regulator became a visible reason for the fifteen largest banks, having declared disagreement with the policy of the ARB, to begin to prepare for joining the Association "Russia", noting that "the effectiveness of the ARB will be at a low level, and a constructive dialogue within the banking community is actually not carried out."
Depositors will be better off
How will the case end?
Let's immediately answer the main question that arises at the slightest failure or conflict in the banking sector or next to it: depositors are not threatened by anything, rather, on the contrary, the reliability of the banking system will increase.
The head of "Russia" is Anatoly Aksakov, known for his scrupulousness in all that concerns the interests of banks and their customers, a high-level professional who is highly appreciated in the Central Bank: almost all the leadership of the Central Bank is present at the annual events of the association, and all significant legislative initiatives of the regulator pass through expert assessments of the "regionals".
In terms of personnel and organization, obviously, no special shocks are expected either.
Undoubtedly, ARB finds itself in a difficult financial and managerial situation after it loses such powerful and influential participants with their contributions and lobbying opportunities.
However, in this oldest - established in 1991 - organization that defends the interests of the banking community, there is considerable potential in order to continue to improve banking legislation and the sphere of monetary circulation as a whole.
It cannot be said that the Rossiya Association is ready to accept new members on any terms with open arms, judging by the reaction of its head, Anatoly Aksakov ("maybe they want too much"), who on July 21 at a briefing in the press center of the Parliamentary Gazette, said that "literally the next day, representatives of the banks that left the ARB asked me to consider the possibility of increasing the potential of our association "Russia"."
Their proposals are to strengthen the voice of bankers in the Association Council, as well as to pay more attention to new banking technologies.
Now the negotiation process is underway, the proposals of both sides are being studied, the agenda of the extraordinary congress of the association, which will be held in Sochi in mid-September as part of the international banking forum, is being prepared.
We'll decide there.
Also, Anatoly Aksakov, stressing that "he does not hold on to the chair", called a possible new head of the renewed association "Russia" Georgy Luntovsky, who leaves the post of Deputy Chairman of the Central Bank in September, highly describing his business and human qualities.
On August 18, Anatoly Aksakov, who is currently on vacation in Crimea, plans to interrupt his vacation for one day and arrive in Moscow for an extraordinary meeting of the Association Council "Russia", where it is planned to consider the agenda of the extraordinary congress of "Russia".
The entry of cars with a gasoline engine in major cities of Russia will not be limited
Deputy head of the Ministry of Transport Nikolai Asaul said that, contrary to media reports, the entry of cars with a gasoline engine into major cities of Russia will not be restricted yet.
It's a more radical form of our concept.
Our concept is that it is necessary to gradually raise the environmental class.
And there is a concept to immediately switch to zero emissions.
I believe that technically we are not ready for this.
The question is: from what year?
It's such a slogan-level phrase - let's ban it.
Where and when?
Tomorrow?
Will we close the whole city?
"In 20 years - I don't know, maybe it will happen," Prime quoted the minister as saying.
Earlier, the newspaper "Izvestia" reported that by August 17, Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich was instructed to study proposals for possible options for state support for electric transport, submitted to the government by the General Director of KAMAZ PJSC Sergey Kogogin.
Among the proposals, according to the newspaper, is the use of cars with internal combustion engines in large cities and resorts.
Washington is changing the rules for obtaining a green card.
According to media reports, President Donald Trump said that a new US immigration plan will be adopted, according to which the rules for obtaining a green card will change.
The plan calls for reducing the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 a year, stricter rules for obtaining temporary work visas and restrictions on obtaining family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republican Party and supported by the president.
The bill will be debated in two houses of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, raise wages, and save taxpayers billions of dollars, and it will do so by changing the way the U.S. issues green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the existing scheme.
The new application process will provide benefits to candidates who speak English, have the financial resources that allow them to support themselves, and have skills that will benefit our economy," Trump said, according to U.S. media.
The emergence of sex robots is real, and this should worry us
No sooner had we thought that 2017 could not get worse, a new report on technological advances in the production of sex robots was released.
Yes.
Sex robots are now in the spotlight.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently released a report on the development of sex robots in the next 5-10 years.
According to Noel Sharkey, Distinguished Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we must take their emergence seriously.
Users will be able to choose the eye color of robots, the shape of the nipples and the type of nails.
"People are giggling about it, but firms are already sending them to consumers in large numbers, and soon we'll see a lot more of them," Sharkey said at the launch of the new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable counterparts into robots with silicone skin, warm to the touch, and with almost human replicas controlled by artificial intelligence.
Users can also "customize" their robots to their liking, choosing everything from the color of the eyes and the shape of the robot's nipples to the shape and color of the nails.
But the fact that many robots have a "personality" compared to which Stepford's Wife would seem very progressive is even more troubling.
Modern sex dolls have turned into robots with silicone skin.
For example, RealBotix robot allows users to customize the qualities in robots that they find attractive, such as shyness.
Then there are the Roxxxy Gold sex robots developed by True Companion, which come with an already programmed personality – for example, Cold Farrah gives the impression of being shy, and Wild Wendy has a "bold" personality.
"Roxxxy Gold has a character that fits yours perfectly," the True Companion website enthusiastically reports.
So she loves what you love, doesn't like what you don't love, and so on.
Her mood changes during the day, like a real person!
She may want to sleep or chat, or she may be 'in the mood'!"
There's a lot of anxiety about the emergence of sex robots — not least because they replace real human relationships — but what's most troubling is the subordinate image of a woman, the associations with rape that the possession of Cold (read: resistive) Farah evokes.
On the "True Companion" website, Roxxxy is compared to a vibrator, only for men.
"If a woman (sic!) maybe a vibrator, why can't men have Roxxxy?" the site says.
But these sex robots aren't just fetishes or just new sex toys.
Their appearance and increasing complexity indicates something darker and deeper in our culture, a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards the desire for sex with submission as an optional additive.
Most men, of course, will not buy sex robots, and although FRR notes their growing popularity, they still remain on the periphery of consumer culture.
But what comes to us from the periphery can be very instructive about the meanings of the era in which we live.
And many people are not bad or aggressive until the free market gives them the opportunity to do so.
It's no coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots came about just when women's rights around the world were threatened, when there's a president in the White House who brags about molesting women.
The scariest thing about the television series "The Handmaid's Tale" is not the graphic images, twisted bodies and squeezed eyes, but how realistic this vision seems.
The Republic of Gilead is an exaggeration, but it doesn't seem that big now.
The goal of the sex robot industry is to achieve such a physical resemblance to real women (only with the proportions of stars) that technology allows.
Their creators want them to appear to be people to the touch, to copy the movements of the human body.
But it is precisely with their "characters" that robots do not resemble real women.
They can't break up with their partners or get away from them.
They have no life of their own, nothing that would indicate independence or anything else that could shatter the illusion of total dependence.
In other words, they are beautiful slaves.
Or, as they say in 2017, maids.
Los Angeles native Eugene (Pooh) Jeter, who has been playing for the Ukrainian national team since 2013, will not help our national team at the European Basketball Championship, the final part of which starts on August 31.
This was announced in an interview with the beBasket portal by the general manager of the "blue-yellow" Andrei Lebedev.
We tried to negotiate with Jeter, but unfortunately he will not come for family reasons.
We will go to EuroBasket without a naturalised player because we don't want to take someone we don't know.
"This situation will provide opportunities for the development of our young players," he said.
Let me remind you: with the direct participation of Jeter, the Ukrainian national team took a record sixth place for itself at EuroBasket 2013 and for the first time got to the World Basketball Championship, where the Yellow-Blues could not overcome the group stage, and the native of the United States averaged 15.4 points per game, made 3 rebounds and gave 5 assists.
Jeter has stopped playing for the Ukrainian national team since the departure of American Mike Fratello, who left this position in 2015, from the post of head coach of our national team.
Men's EuroBasket 2017 will be held simultaneously in four countries: Turkey, Romania, Israel and Finland.
The Ukrainian team will hold its matches of the group tournament on the Promised Land.
Evgeny Murzin's charges will have five matches in Group B: with Germany (August 31), Italy (September 2), Georgia (3rd), Lithuania (5th) and Israel (6th).
In preparation for the tournament, our men's team held two test matches, in which they lost to the Dutch and Belarusians.
Trump's great feat?
Pretending to be Mita Romney seems very reasonable.
In the Age of Trump, the common ground has become the fact that the political controversies that have polarized the American electorate have microstrated some families.
Between Thanksgiving and Christmas, American newspapers were full of columns about how to deal with terrible relatives voting for Trump.
We all seem to be so tense that we're about to burst.
There is less talk about Trump's ability to connect families.
I'm writing this because my cousin, a left-leaning poet from Chicago who has long been on knives with Republicans in her family, visited me in New York this week.
She reminded me that uniting against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
Under Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including her Republican brother, with whom she has been arguing about politics for decades, suddenly and strangely found herself on the same side.
At dinner, this is undoubtedly a good thing; but I can't help but think that in a broader context it can be quite dangerous.
Trump has breathed energy into the left flank, but the warpant effect of his rule could move us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and "normalization," we mean the unlikely possibility that one day we will stop being struck by his antics.
There is, however, an even more dubious scenario in which Trump "normalizes" the most right-wing Republicans, who, against the background of his standards, suddenly seem to be a model of common sense.
I've caught myself missing Mitt Romney's old-fashioned madness today — with a dog on the roof of a car and a 14 percent income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like) — compared to Trump, both seem like very little evil.
When Trump leaves, the next Republican candidate will only need to be in his mind to be seen as a huge step forward.
When my cousin drove to the center, we went with the kids to a carousel in Central Park — the largest carousel in the New York City Parks Department's estate and the best way in the city to spend three dollars if you don't need caffeine.
Horses are formidable and huge, the fiberglass pictures on the central drum - grimacing clowns and animals that, curved, look at their backs in horror - are extremely ominous, and the ringing music, oddly enough, delights.
So many famous things in this city are disappointing: the views from skyscrapers are outdated, the silhouettes of the buildings are too boring to cause awe, and the reality of the city can not keep up with the dream.
Thirty-five years have passed, and I'm still reliving the day I learned that the Suisse Cottage area is not really a Swiss chalet (the themed pub "Ye Olde Swiss Cottage" doesn't count), but a large circular intersection in North London.
And the carousel in Central Park is still an unusual, magical place in which a child of two years, a child of eleven years and two women in their forties can have a great time.
If I could give the carousel a rating, I would give a high five, but luckily no one asked me to.
And at the department store this week, I was asked to rate my shopping "experience" on a scale of one to five stars before swiping my card through the terminal.
The coffee shop on the corner of my street is all the same plus the option to accompany the tip score of 15 percent - this is for ordering at the counter.
As a result, not only does the seemingly neutral interaction slow down, but it is also necessary to introduce a personal attitude into a situation that does not imply it.
The poor saleswoman at the department store smiled embarrassedly as I tiredly rated my experience handing her a five-star credit card.
Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital due to chest pain
Pistorius leaves prison for a visit to the doctor for the second time.
Last year, he was transferred to the hospital for treatment of cuts on his wrists, which, according to the prison administration, he received as a result of a fall in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of premeditated murder after the prosecutor's office appealed against the original conviction for manslaughter.
He killed Steenkamp in the early morning hours of Valentine's Day in 2013, shooting her several times through the door of the restroom at his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius stated that he mistook his girlfriend for a night thief hiding in his toilet.
Prosecutors have said they intend to lodge another protest, this time against Pretorius' six-year sentence, which it says is too mild.
The Attorney General's Office said it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal would be heard this year.
Pretorius' sentence could be increased by 15 years if the prosecutor's office succeeds.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
Suspect in beating NTV journalist chosen recognizance not to leave
The capital's law enforcement officers chose a measure of restraint in the form of a pledge not to leave the country for a man who attacked NTV journalist Nikita Razvozzhaev during a live broadcast from Gorky Park on August 2.
It is reported by TASS with reference to the official representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation Irina Volk.
"As part of the investigation of the criminal case initiated under Art. 116 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation ("Beatings") against a 32-year-old man who hit the face of a correspondent of one of the TV channels in the Central Park of Culture and Recreation named after Gorky, the suspect was chosen a preventive measure in the form of a pledge not to leave the country and proper behavior," Volk said.
The representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs added that an administrative protocol was drawn up against the suspect for disobedience to the police.
On Wednesday, August 2, during a live broadcast for Airborne Forces Day, a drunken man approached the correspondent and hit him in the face.
As it turned out later, the hooligan has nothing to do with the Airborne Forces.
According to Razvozzhaev himself, the paratroopers, on the contrary, tried to detain the Muscovite.
Two Bulgarian citizens detained in Greece for illegal tent parking
According to the MINISTRY of Foreign Affairs, two Bulgarian citizens were detained in Greece for illegal tent parking.
On the morning of August 1, a group of people who had set up tents in the wrong place, including two Bulgarian citizens, were detained in Sithonia.
They were released on the same day, while the investigation is still ongoing.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the TV channel "BTV" that the Bulgarian citizens were then released.
The Greek authorities have tightened control over free camping and are already imposing serious fines on everyone who is caught while parking in a place not intended for this.
Inspections will be carried out throughout the season.
According to the ministry, the court may impose a fine.
The Russian Foreign Ministry accused the US vice president of the rhetoric of the Cold War
Statements made during the European tour of US Vice President Michael Pence were criticized by the Russian Foreign Ministry.
"It is regrettable to note that Washington is sliding deeper into the primitive ideological clichés of the Cold War, which are completely divorced from reality," the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
This is how the Foreign Ministry reacted to Pence's words about the "Russian threat" and attempts to forcibly redraw the borders, said by him in Podgorica.
The Russian Foreign Ministry pointed to the destructiveness of the choice "either with the West or with Russia" and the non-obviousness of the thesis about the allegedly uncontested entry of the entire South-Eastern Europe into NATO.
Russian diplomats also recalled that it was the United States that violated international law by using force to separate Kosovo from Serbia and thus created another hotbed of tension.
"We call on our American colleagues to stop slandering Russia and its foreign policy, which is invariably based on respect for partners and readiness for joint constructive work, on mutual consideration of interests," the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
Paramedic was injured in an accident with an ambulance in the suburbs of Moscow
The accident occurred in Stupino near Moscow, as a result of the collision of a foreign car with an ambulance, a paramedic was injured.
Today, at about 08:10 Moscow time, a Mitsubishi car collided with an ambulance in the city of Stupino, Moscow Region.
"As a result of the collision, the ambulance overturned," the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in the Moscow region told TASS.
Law enforcement officers are working at the scene of the accident, the circumstances of the incident are being clarified.
In the Odessa region, a woman threw away her newborn son at a construction site, wrapped in a cellophane bag.
On the evening of August 3, the Razdelnyansky police department received a message from a local resident that he had found a package with a baby in an unfinished private house.
"Law enforcement officers and doctors went to the scene of the incident, who promptly delivered the child to a medical institution," the Odessa head of the National Police reported.
Doctors determined that the boy was born a few hours before his discovery, as evidenced by the presence of the umbilical cord.
In the course of priority operational and investigative measures, the identity of the woman in labor was established - a 36-year-old local resident.
It was also established that the woman has three more young children.
As noted in the chapter, the family had not previously fallen into the field of view of law enforcement officers and was not on a special register.
Currently, the police are establishing the circumstances and reasons that led the woman to this act, after which a procedural decision will be made.
Now the baby is under the supervision of doctors.
As previously reported, in Nikolaev, a 21-year-old woman threw her premature baby into a garbage chute.
Grigory Leps: "I'm eager to fight, although 55 is not 30"
One of the most successful artists of the Russian stage Grigory Leps next Sunday will celebrate his 55th birthday.
Before the celebration, the singer talked with the observer of Izvestia.
I remember your "poltinnik" being noted.
A special tent in the Luzhniki Stadium, Gloria Gaynor sang for the birthday boy, a powerful salute over the Moskva River.
You must have figured out then how you would like to spend your next five-year plan.
Have your plans come true?
If we talk about the profession, it was a good period.
I worked hard, toured the whole country three times, gave 120-130 concerts a year.
He released two good albums.
Of course, I'm not the same now as I was, say, 20 years ago.
The biological clock is not fooled.
Singing the way I sang in my 30s is getting harder.
Nevertheless, I am eager to fight, I do not want to stop.
And I'm going to a different level with new people, I think.
With them, you record a new album, the first in three years.
Yes, work on it is now underway.
Actually, we have already recorded everything in my studio and now we will send it to Los Angeles for mixing.
It is called "Why are you so serious?" after the song of the same name, which was written jointly with Timati.
It's not quite ready yet, so we haven't posted it anywhere yet.
We'll do it later, when we shoot the video for it.
And the album will be presented in November - for a series of my anniversary concerts in the Moscow "Crocus City Hall".
Your new record has a hand in the great American drummer Chris Coleman.
You seem to want to get him on your touring lineup as well?
In my opinion, Coleman today is one of the most outstanding drummers in the world.
He would come to my studio and record his parts.
I offered him to join my band, and Jeremy Colson (a famous drummer involved in various projects. - "Izvestia") offered.
But for long-term work in Russia, they put forward, to put it mildly, excessive conditions.
It was about fees from € 35 thousand to € 45 thousand per month.
Then I thought that in the post-Soviet space I would find worthy musicians.
And I found an excellent drummer Max Malyshev.
In general, it is better to feed your own (smiles).
Sometimes I want to find fault with one of them, not for anything.
For example, guitarist Fyodor Dosumov is highly regarded internationally.
Western music magazines write about him, he is invited to various guitar festivals.
Steve Vai, after listening to him play, said that "a new generation of guitarists has come, with a different performing technique."
Your album is mixed in Los Angeles, American musicians collaborate with you, but you still can't come to the United States?
Are you trying to lift this ban?
I honestly don't do anything now.
There are a number of attorneys who are looking into this issue.
As a musician, I'm really sorry that I can't get to America.
I have repeatedly said that I study there.
The more you communicate with real professionals, the more useful.
We are not dumber than them, but we do not have such experience, school.
For 70 years, our performers of popular music have not been given the tasks that American musicians have always solved.
They sought the highest quality sound.
And I'm trying to follow the same principles.
Now, for some reason, the UK has denied me entry for ten years.
But I will still apply for a visa to the British Embassy every year so that I can again be allowed to go there and most importantly - to work there.
The rest of Europe treats me favorably.
And already in August you are planning a concert in Monaco, not ordered, but poster, right?
Yes, there is a good Gym in Monte Carlo, I have already performed there once.
Now they have been invited again, and, as far as I know, all tickets for the concert have already been sold out.
Will you go to the "Laima Vaikule Rendezvous", which will begin on July 20 in Jurmala?
She invited me, and of course I responded.
Laima is a wonderful singer and a great woman who knows how to present herself with beautiful vocals, and even whispers.
After the tour and anniversary concerts, as far as I know, you once again want to turn to the work of Vladimir Vysotsky.
You already have two albums with his songs in your discography.
When will the third one come out?
Probably next year.
But it will be done in a completely different way.
I want to record about 80-90 songs by Vysotsky in about the same presentation as he did himself.
Only voice and guitar.
No other arrangement.
I will be accompanied by our famous musician Timur Vedernikov.
I will try to involve Alexander Yakovlevich Rosenbaum in the album.
I discussed this topic with him, we have a good relationship, but he is a busy man, so we'll see how it goes.
You gradually introduced boris Grebenshchikov's songs into your repertoire.
Maybe then you will record an album of his belongings?
Boris Borisovich is a wonderful person and a great musician.
I crossed paths with him several times and asked: can I sing this or that of his songs?
He said, "Gregory, I write songs to be performed."
Please try, sing.
It's probably interesting to record such an album.
So far, I do not have such a task, but in the future, in a year or two, if Boris Borisovich does not object, I may make such a project.
If you don't focus entirely on the affairs of your production center.
I guess you haven't realized its potential yet, signed contracts with all the artists you're interested in?
There are a number of performers that I would like to have under my wing, but they are independent, accomplished people.
Do you mean Sergey Lazarev?
Seryozha is a brilliant singer, I invited him.
I may not agree with his repertoire, but he is a professional and he has his own development strategy.
And in my center now there is Alexander Panayotov, whom I led in "The Voice".
We have signed a contract with him and are working.
In our pop music, such singers are a rarity.
It will be a real pity if he does not reach the heights that he deserves.
I try to pick up his repertoire, shoot clips.
I hope for a good result.
I also try to promote other artists of my center: I buy them songs, cry poets, sometimes their tracks fall into the rotation of television and radio channels.
If they do not reach great heights, I will still bring our cooperation to its logical conclusion.
At the output, they will receive a recorded album, several clips.
And then, if they want, they can go their own way, and I will not insist that they return the money invested in them.
Although I will be pleased if one of them achieves commercial success and pays me the interest that we agreed on in the contract.
But if this does not happen, I am not going to cut off the oxygen to anyone.
Let everyone work, make their way, prove, as I once argued.
If tomorrow you are offered to make a tour of Ukraine and guarantee entry into the country, will you go?
I'm still invited there.
Basically, we are talking about closed events.
As for the big tour...
I am a man of my country, a Russian, by my own conviction, I flew to Syria on the very plane that then crashed.
If tomorrow they say that you need to fly to some other point in the interests of the state, I will fly.
And I don't care what bloggers and other critics think of me.
I sincerely regret that we have such a situation with Ukraine.
Because I believe: we are one people and should be together.
I regret that this is unlikely to happen, at least in the near future.
And earlier I gave 40-50 concerts per year in Ukraine.
Greeted like nowhere else.
Very grateful audience.
And he collaborated with several Ukrainian artists: Ani Lorak, Sveta Loboda, Artem Loik...
There are a lot of gifted people in Ukraine, and it is a pity that now they cannot fully vent their talent on a wide Russian audience.
Music should unite and entertain people.
I would love to invite some cool Ukrainian performer to Russia, for example, Slava Vakarchuk, and do a joint concert with him.
But I think it's unlikely at this point...
Andrey Okhlopkov was transferred from the cosmodrome
As it became known to "Kommersant", the technical director of the Vostochny cosmodrome Andrei Okhlopkov began work at the Khrunichev State Space Research and Production Center (GKNPTS).
Previously, he was de facto engaged in the construction of the Vostochny cosmodrome, but due to disagreements with the leadership of the Center for the Operation of Ground and Space Infrastructure (TsENKI), he was transferred to an enterprise in Moscow's Fili, where he will coordinate production.
Mr. Okhlopkov will not have a replacement: the post of technical director is likely to be abolished, and the functionality will be scattered among the divisions of TsENKI.
The fact that the technical director of Vostochny and the deputy general director of TsENKI for technological development Andrei Okhlopkov went to work in the Khrunichev ScNPC, Kommersant was told by top managers of several space industry enterprises, as well as an employee of the government apparatus.
"He has been working in his new post for several weeks," Kommersant's interlocutors in the industry said.
It was not possible to get a prompt comment from TsENKI on Thursday, and Mr. Okhlopkov himself was not available for comments.
However, the information of "Kommersant" was officially confirmed in the GKNPTS.
He decided to move to the position of director for production coordination, the company said. - Andrey Okhlopkov fully fulfilled the task assigned to him to ensure a launch minimum for the first launch at the Vostochny Cosmodrome.
Mr. Okhlopkov joined TsENKI in 2013, having served in the space forces, in particular at Baikonur, and in Plesetsk - at the "northern" cosmodrome he held the post of first deputy commander with the rank of colonel.
In 2009, Andrei Okhlopkov became a defendant in a criminal case.
The investigation accused him of bribery: allegedly at his instigation, regional merchants received state orders for kickbacks, but did not fulfill their obligations to clean the separated parts of launch vehicles in the Arkhangelsk region and the Komi Republic.
In 2012, a jury found him not guilty.
The responsibilities assigned to him in TsENKI for technological development extended to various projects, but the main one was the construction of a cosmodrome in the Far East.
Oleg Ostapenko, who was then the head of the Federal Space Agency, in an interview with Kommersant, directly said that the state of affairs in Vostochny "was critical already in October 2013."
The fact is that a strategic mistake was made during the planning: the completion of construction and the first launch of the Soyuz-2.1 launch vehicle were scheduled for the same time - the end of 2015.
In order to carry out the launch before the end of the year, it was decided to complete the construction six months earlier and the deadlines were shifted from December to July 2015.
To speed up the process, it was necessary to go on a trick: TsENKI specialists began to conduct parallel installation of technological equipment at unfinished facilities.
The main supporter of this idea was Andrei Okhlopkov.
Despite the existing risks and the postponement that still happened (instead of December 2015, the Soyuz flew away only on April 28, 2016), this idea justified itself, says a Kommersant source at the cosmodrome: "Otherwise, we would not have carried out a single launch from Vostochny, but would have been engaged in construction."
Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, who oversees the creation of the cosmodrome, jokingly called Andrei Okhlopkov his "space Susanin", but it was from him that he almost always asked for information about the progress of construction.
Mr. Okhlopkov was also remembered for his directness: for example, in an interview with Kommersant, he proposed to deprive the Federal Agency for Special Construction (Spetsstroy) of the status of the only executor in Vostochny and work directly with subcontractors: "Why should we put all our eggs in one basket of Spetsstroy?"
This idea was supported by the government.
Since 2017, TsENKI has assumed the duties of the general contractor in order to complete the construction and installation works at the launch and technical complex by the planned fourth quarter.
According to Kommersant, the reason for the transition of Mr. Okhlopkov to a new place of work was disagreements with the leadership of TsENKI regarding the ways to complete the construction of structures and complexes of the cosmodrome, as well as methods of working with subcontractors.
"It was decided that this would be better for everyone," says one of the top managers involved in the construction of vostochny.
An employee of the government apparatus, in turn, calls the decision strange: "He was one of the best specialists, it will not be easy to find an equivalent replacement for him."
According to Kommersant, this will not be required: the post of technical director of the cosmodrome will be abolished, and its functions will be scattered among the units of TsENKI.
In music schools there will be a training program for two specialties
In the future, students of children's music schools will be able to receive two specialties at the same time.
According to The Deputy Director of the Department of Science and Education of the Ministry of Culture Svyatoslav Golubenko, for this it is possible to re-read re-read repetitive disciplines to students, and the issue of paying for the remaining classes in the second specialty can be solved with the help of special grants, RIA Novosti reports.
"The Ministry of Culture has taken this issue under control, and we, together with the expert community, will develop a mechanism that will allow us to master two specialties, but at the same time will not contradict the current legislation in the field of education," Golubenko said.
Last Friday, during Vladimir Putin's "Non-Children's Conversation" with pupils of the Sirius Children's Center, student Maria Andreeva said that she was forced to pay for repetitive subjects in the second specialty at the Central Music School at the Moscow Conservatory.
The girl said that she studies violin and piano and has awards of competitions in both areas.
The head of state recognized her issue as very relevant and promised to help.
In Mexico, detained climbing the wall on a skyscraper 17-year-old Russian
In Mexico, 17-year-old Russian Kirill N. was detained, who climbed the wall on the roof of a high-rise building, reports the portal El Universal.
The incident occurred in the capital Mexico City.
The young man, with the help of two unknown men, climbed over a three-meter fence into the territory of the Nestle complex of office buildings and independently climbed one of its towers.
At the same time, he did not use any special equipment, insurance and ropes.
The young man was detained already on the roof.
Employees of the Ministry of Public Security lowered him to the ground in a helicopter.
He was then sent to the National Institute of Migration.
They find out whether the young man is legally in the country.
Meanwhile, a video with a young man climbing a high-rise has become popular on the Web.
Users called the young man "spider-man".
According to the media, such experiments are a hobby for him.
Red meat, dairy, and chocolate can help relieve IBD.
Red meat and chocolate are considered to be a nightmare for your digestive tract.
But recent studies suggest otherwise: A diet rich in meat proteins and dairy products may help relieve symptoms in those suffering from inflammatory bowel disease.
This incurable disease, which affects an estimated 1.3 million people in the US and 300,000 in the UK, leads to colic and bloating, chronic or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Usually, to alleviate symptoms, patients are advised to avoid meat and dairy products, but researchers from the University of Washington found that the main amino acid of the protein tryptophan promotes the production of immune cells that increase intestinal tolerance.
Lead researcher Dr. Marco Colonna explained that immune cells in the gut make sure that harmful microbes coming from food do not enter the body.
Cells that can trigger the inflammatory process are balanced by cells that increase tolerance, protecting the body and at the same time not harming sensitive tissues.
If the balance is too much disturbed in the direction of inflammation, it can lead to inflammatory bowel disease.
Experiments have shown that mice that have a certain bacterium in their gut develop tolerance-boosting cells.
And this bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of protein - to trigger the appearance of these cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have established a link between one species of bacteria – Lactobacillus reuteri – which is part of the normal gut microbiome, and the development of a population of tolerance-boosting cells.
The more tryptophan the mice had, the more of these immune cells they had."
He suggested that the same would work in humans: a combination of L. reuteri and a tryptophan-rich diet may promote a more tolerant and less inflammatory environment in the gut.
Postdoc Dr. Luiza Cervantes-Barraghanvas, studying a variety of immune cells that increase tolerance, found that one group of experimental mice had these cells, and the other group, which belonged to the same lineage, but was kept separately, did not have them.
She hypothesized that the difference could be caused by the gut microbiomes of mice — communities of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The DNA of the mice's gut cells were sequenced, and six species of bacteria were found present in mice that had immune cells but were absent in mice that did not have them.
Mice raised in a sterile environment that did not have a good microbiome and did not develop this kind of immune cells received L. reuteri, and immune cells appeared in them.
To understand how the bacteria affect the immune system, the researchers grew L. reuteri in a liquid medium and then transferred small portions of the liquid — without the bacteria — to underdeveloped immune cells isolated from mice.
Immune cells have turned into cells that increase tolerance.
When the active ingredient was separated from the liquid, it turned out to be a by-product of tryptophan processing, known as indole-3-lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice's food, the number of these cells increased by about 50 percent, but when tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells also dropped by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragán explains that humans have the same tolerance-boosting cells as mice, and most of us have L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether the byproducts of tryptophan from L. reuteri contribute to cell development in humans in the same way as in mice, but in people suffering from inflammatory bowel disease, defects in genes associated with tryptophan have been found.
She says: "Perhaps we need to strengthen the development of these cells, because the inflammatory processes on the inner surface of the intestines depend on these cells.
High levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri could potentially lead to an expansion of their population."
According to Jose Mourinho, Manchester United hired a "genius" in the person of Nemanja Matic
Manchester United have hired a "genius" in Nemanja Matic, jose Mourinho said after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
The player, acquired for £40 million from Chelsea, started with a 2-1 win in Dublin in United's last pre-season match before the UEFA Super Cup match against Real Madrid on Thursday and made an impression as a midfielder, while players like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira pushed forward whenever they pleased.
However, as Matic did not take part in Chelsea's pre-season tour of Asia, he seriously lacked preparation for the game and withstood only 45 minutes, which Mourinho said needs to be refined before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, his mind, his genius in the way he thinks – he thinks football," Mourinho said.
"We'll help him prepare sooner rather than later."
Just like Matic, his fellow new players Victor Lindelöf and Romelu Lukaku started the game at the Aviva Stadium when Mourinho began to form his first team for the start of the following season.
The Independent newspaper reported this week that Mourinho wanted to hire three more players, but stressed that the club had already achieved fantastic results by hiring three of the four players it would like to hire first.
"I am grateful to the club for getting three out of four," he added.
"I'll be even happier if they get me four out of four, but they've already tried very hard for me."
Former leaders of Lithuania's Social Democrats persuade them to stay in the ruling coalition
Former chairmen of the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania, ex-prime ministers Algirdas Butkevicius and Gediminas Kirkilas, as well as the former speaker of the Seimas from the Social Democrats Česlovas Juršėnas appealed to party members to remain in the ruling coalition.
As reported by the "Parliamentary Gazette", due to friction with partners - the Union of Peasants and "Greens" - a discussion was initiated in the Social Democratic Party whether it is necessary to remain in the ruling coalition.
And so three senior experienced comrades appealed to the party members with an open letter, which, in particular, says: "It is understandable that the party's comrades are disappointed with the results of the elections, but the coalition with the "peasants" created for us, albeit not very easy, but still conditions for the further implementation of the goals of social justice, which, on our initiative, are provided for in the program of the government,  and to preserve the political dominance of the centre-left over right-wing parties."
According to former leaders of the party, in the discussion so far "the prevailing expression of opinion based on emotions without specific arguments."
The authors of the letter fear that by rash actions their party could lead Lithuania to political, economic and social instability.
Disabled Anton Mamaev was fined
The Moscow City Court mitigated the punishment of wheelchair user Anton Mamaev from four and a half years in prison to a fine of 200 thousand rubles.
Earlier, by the decision of the Timiryazevsky court, the convict was released from the pre-trial detention center.
At the same time, the Moscow City Court confirmed that the accused is a criminal, since he organized the robbery and theft of a motor scooter from a former special forces soldier.
The Moscow City Court, by its decision, mitigated the punishment of Anton Mamaev to 200 thousand rubles. fine.
"Mamaev is the organizer of the robbery, which also forms part of the crime, and, accordingly, such a person should be brought to criminal responsibility," Moscow City Court spokeswoman Ulyana Solopova explained to Kommersant.
In this case, the court took into account The state of Mamaev's health, the factual circumstances of the case, and the absence of aggravating circumstances.
In addition, the court applied Art. 64 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, according to which it is possible to impose a punishment below the lower limit.
As for Mamaev's assistant Vasily Seroshtanov, the court did not establish circumstances that would become the basis for changing the category of severity of the crime and changing the sentence.
Anton Mamaev himself said that he was dissatisfied with the decision of the Moscow City Court.
I am disappointed with the court's decision.
The only legitimate solution would be an acquittal, intends to continue to fight for justice.
His lawyer Andrei Orlov did not rule out appealing the verdict to the cassation instance of the Moscow City Court and the Supreme Court.
"We will use all levers up to the European Court of Human Rights," he told RIA Novosti.
Recall, 28-year-old Muscovite Anton Mamaev, suffering from spinal muscular atrophy, became a defendant in a criminal case last fall.
The disabled person claims that he bought a motor scooter from friends for 160 thousand rubles in order to then sell.
However, the owners of the scooter, including a former special forces soldier, said that the disabled man and his assistant Vasily Seroshtanov took away their property, threatening to use violence.
On June 30, the Timiryazevsky District Court of Moscow sentenced Vasily Seroshtanov to three years in prison, and Anton Mamaev to four and a half years in prison to be served in a general regime colony (under Part 2 of Article 162 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation).
After the immobilized disabled person was placed in a pre-trial detention center, the Public Chamber, the Prosecutor General's Office, and the Presidential Commissioner for Human Rights Tatyana Moskalkova joined the case.
As a result, in mid-July, Anton Mamaev was released from jail by the decision of the same Timiryazevsky court.
The defense, in turn, appealed the decision of the first instance to the Moscow City Court.
ONF will prepare a report on ecology for the president
The final "Action Forum" of the All-Russian Popular Front (ONF) in 2017 will be devoted to environmental issues, a source in the All-Russian People's Front told Izvestia and confirmed by the head of the movement's executive committee Alexei Anisimov.
According to him, following the results of the forum, the "front-line soldiers" plan to prepare a report to the president on the problems of the domestic ecology, as well as to propose a strategy for their solution.
Izvestia's interlocutors in the All-Russia People's Front note that the report to the head of state will contain "in-depth analytics" on the situation in all federal districts of the country.
According to Izvestia, the final forum of the All-Russia People's Front will be held in the autumn.
The exact date of its holding has not yet been determined - as a rule, it adapts to the schedule of the president, who is the leader of the movement and is traditionally present at key events of the All-Russia People's Front.
The Front held several interregional environmental conferences, one for two federal districts - in Rostov-on-Don, Kaliningrad and Kirov.
The final conference will be in the capital of the Republic of Buryatia, Ulan-Ude.
Based on the proposals that were made and will be expressed at these events, we will form systemic proposals for solving environmental problems," the interlocutor in the All-Russia People's Front told Izvestia.
Co-chairman of the Central Staff of the movement Olga Timofeeva, who heads the State Duma Committee on Ecology and Environmental Protection, said that the "front-line soldiers" will report to the head of state on the work carried out within the framework of the Year of Ecology in Russia.
The final environmental forum and the "Action Forum" of the All-Russia People's Front are likely to be combined.
Over the year, we have acquired a powerful team of experts in the field of environmental problems, saw gaps in the legislation, stopped dozens of violations of the law.
All this will be included in the report that we are preparing for the president as the leader of our movement.
In addition to this document, the "front-line soldiers" will also report on the work on the priority projects of the All-Russia People's Front," Olga Timofeeva told Izvestia.
According to her, the special representative of the head of state on environmental protection, ecology and transport Sergey Ivanov will also be invited to the forum.
Previously, he has already taken part in the work of the ONF Media Forum, which was held in St. Petersburg in April.
In a few months, the Year of Ecology will go down in history, and the most important thing that needs to be done today is to launch environmental mechanisms so that they work for many years.
So that these issues do not fall off the agenda, - added Olga Timofeeva.
Andrey Kolyadin, Head of the Regional Policy Laboratory of the Expert Institute for Social Research (EISR), noted that by raising environmental issues, the All-Russia People's Front is acting in line with the presidential agenda.
As experts, they proposed many things at various forums, and these initiatives received the support of the president," Andrei Kolyadin told Izvestia.
He stressed that today it is impossible to exclude the economic potential of the environmental agenda, which can give the regions an additional impetus to development.
In the future, with the help of the All-Russia People's Front, the regions will be able to lobby not only for the solution of their environmental problems, but also for the development of ecotourism," the expert added.
The relevance of environmental issues was demonstrated by a "direct line" with Vladimir Putin in June.
In particular, the president was asked questions about the garbage dump in Balashikha (already closed) and about coal dust in the port of Nakhodka (a bill has already been developed to ban open transshipment of coal in settlements, one of the authors is Olga Timofeeva).
Experts in the field of ecology believe that the legal framework for solving environmental problems in Russia as a whole has been created, the question is in further law enforcement practice, as well as in the position of civil society.
We need a clear implementation of the decisions taken by the state, - said the head of the charitable foundation "Ecology for All" Leonid Bochin.
Member of the HRC, head of the non-governmental organization "Greenpeace Russia" Sergey Tsyplenkov in a conversation with "Izvestia" stressed that for the successful solution of environmental problems a responsible approach of society and business is necessary, legislative efforts alone are not enough.
As soon as society and business realize that solving environmental problems is a much more profitable step in the strategic perspective, the situation will change," said Sergey Tsyplenkov.
The expert stressed that it is necessary to reverse the trend that violation of environmental legislation is an economically profitable solution for business.
The British inventor implanted himself a microchip to get into the house and car with a wave of his hand.
The British inventor became the first person in the country to have a microchip installed so that he could open the door of his house, enter the office and even start the car with a simple wave of his hand.
Thirty-three-year-old Stephen Northam implanted himself a tiny chip between his thumb and index finger and now, through his firm BioTech, offers this service to firms and individuals who want to simplify their lives through technology.
He teamed up with Dr. Jeff Watson, a consulting anesthesiologist from the Royal in Winchester, to ensure that the implantation procedure was carried out in accordance with medical standards.
The technology is similar to a microchip that is implanted in cats and dogs, and the procedure takes only 30 seconds.
Northam's company is also replacing locks in homes and cars with chip-compatible ones for £300 per lock.
The married father of one child has already installed the technology in his home and in his BMW Z4 car, which starts when his hand is on the steering wheel.
Props for the White House cost taxpayers thousands of dollars
According to military records provided to TIME magazine, the White House's decision last month to drive a Marine corps helicopter to the South Lawn for an event dedicated to American industrial production cost taxpayers as much as $24,000.
The white-and-green Sikorsky VH-3D, known as "Marine One" with the president on board, was the centerpiece of a July 17 White House event that showcased U.S. construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and top White House officials inspected technology products from all fifty states.
The helicopter, manufactured in Connecticut, was stationed next to a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a forklift truck from Mississippi.
According to records from the First Marine Helicopter Squadron (HMX-1), the department responsible for operating the helicopter, the White House Military Office ordered the presence of the helicopter in a private order, or "FRAGO," just 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn on the occasion of the "unusual" event.
"I just wanted you to make sure you were aware because this is an unusually widely publicized event," the HMX-1 commander wrote in an email to his superior, the Marine Corps First Deputy Chief of Aviation, on the eve of the event.
The letter stated that the helicopter would arrive on the South Lawn at approximately 7 a.m. on July 17 to attend an event scheduled for 3 p.m. and would remain there until the lawn was cleared between 6 and 9 p.m. on the same day.
The letter adds that if departure from the White House is delayed, a second crew will be required for the return flight in accordance with restrictions on hours of operation.
The first crew accompanied the helicopter during the event, and the unit's security personnel remained close to the aircraft while it was on the ground.
From the records obtained by TIME magazine, it remains unclear whether a second crew was eventually required.
Hatch's Law prohibits federal employees from using public property for political purposes.
According to records, HMX-1 clarified whether the event contradicts this ruling.
"Among other things, we asked if this was a violation of Hatch's Law, and we were told that it was not," the commander wrote.
"It looks like you have nowhere to go," the deputy chief replied.
The "Made in America" event was declared an official event by the White House and was not covered by Hatch's Law.
But even official events have a political touch.
During the event, the president made efforts to advance health care reform, then in the Senate, and touted attempts to regulate government regulations.
The use of aircraft known as "Marine One" and "Air Force One" for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are instructed to use them for travel.
But requesting them solely in the interest of photo capability is unusual.
Trump was already the subject of discussion in February, when a presidential plane drove in the background during his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account was inundated with messages complaining about his predecessor's use of the presidential plane.
"The White House is thrilled with the 'Made in America' show, which featured products from 50 states made by American workers from American materials," said White House Deputy Press Secretary Lindsey Walters.
HMX-1 crews often perform training flights around the Washington metropolitan area and on the South Lawn to train the transportation of the President of the United States to the White House with an inch accuracy.
When Trump attended the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 training landings outside the White House.
According to one of the officials, the flight performed for the "Made in America" event was credited to the crew against the necessary training flights for the month.
The unit's helicopters also flew 11 additional hours that day as part of "non-presidential support tasks."
According to the White House, taxpayers did not bear the cost of any of the other exhibits presented at the event.
A representative of the company "Sikorsky" said that the company did not take part in the organization of the demonstration of the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not keep records of the budget for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact amount spent on the event.
But, according to the Department of Defense's hourly rates for fiscal year 2017, the Department of Defense's reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is $24,380 per hour of flight.
The unit's records record the aerial vehicle's time in the air was 30 minutes each way from its airfield at Marine Corps Air Base Quantico in Virginia.
The White House claims that the real cost of using a helicopter is much lower than this rate.
"Calculating the cost to taxpayers based on an estimated reimbursement rate is completely flawed," Walters says.
"These approximate rates include personnel, maintenance and many other irreversible costs that are included in annual appropriations."
According to a 2015 study by RAND Corporation, reimbursement rates do not include the cost of personnel, but do take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance and expenses specified in the contract.
At the time, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer was advocating the use of a helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to showcase things made in America this week," Spicer said.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to national security, and that there are, I assume, hundreds, if not thousands, of people whose jobs depend on it.
And I think, like most Americans, that we're all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly to build.
So, of course, it's entirely appropriate to pay attention to that."
It was unclear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter while inspecting the South Lawn during the event, but he definitely sat in the driver's seat in the fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump reached out to Sikorsky, joking with the press about his own fleet of the company's products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the president said. "I have three."
Moscow will allocate grants for resuscitation departments of city hospitals
Every year, grants "Saving Lives" will be allocated to intensive care units and intensive care units of the capital's medical clinics.
The funds will be used to encourage doctors and nurses.
Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin visited the Yudin City Clinical Hospital.
During the inspection of the clinic, he presented a letter of gratitude to the traumatologist-orthopedist Viktor Protsko, under whose leadership a complex operation was performed to reconstruct the adolescent's foot.
Sergei Sobyanin also spoke about the decision to annually allocate grants to intensive care units and intensive care units of city clinics.
The funds will be used to encourage doctors and nurses.
According to the mayor of the capital, the Yudin Clinical Hospital today is one of the largest in Moscow.
In recent years, the clinic has received new modern equipment that allows its doctors to perform unique operations.
The clinic was opened in 1961 on the basis of the Kolomna Rural Hospital.
Currently, the departments of the medical institution are designed to receive over a thousand patients.
In addition to resuscitation and hospital, there are day departments.
The staff of the hospital has 2800 people.
The total area occupied by the medical clinic is 23.7 hectares.
In February of this year, the medical institution became a participant in a pilot project for the organization of short-term stay hospitals (UPC).
They are designed for relatively small operations.
In the process of surgical interventions, advanced medical equipment is used, which can significantly reduce the rehabilitation time of patients.
After surgery in the hospital, they spend only a few hours.
Only in the first half of this year, inpatient medical care was provided to 36 thousand patients at the Yudin Clinical Hospital.
Medical staff of the clinic performed 15800 operations of varying degrees of complexity.
NBU reported the absence of buyers of the Ukrainian "daughter" of Sberbank
The National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) reported the absence of applications for the purchase of the Ukrainian "daughter" of Sberbank.
On Friday, August 4, reports TASS with reference to the representative of the press service of the NBU.
The NBU confirms that on August 3, 2017, a package of documents from a citizen of Belarus and Cyprus Viktor Prokopeni for approval of an indirect (through Paritetbank) acquisition of 100 percent of Sberbank shares was withdrawn.
"The NBU has not received documents from other potential investors for the purchase of Sberbank shares," the report says.
On August 3, Belarusian businessman Viktor Prokopenya withdrew his application for the purchase of a subsidiary of Sberbank.
On July 28, it became known that the National Bank of Ukraine refused Russian businessmen Said Gutseriev and Grigory Guselnikov to acquire the Ukrainian "daughter" of Sberbank.
The regulator justified its decision by the fact that the businessmen did not provide the necessary documents for verification for their compliance with the requirements of the legislation of Ukraine.
Sberbank announced the sale of its Ukrainian subsidiary to a consortium of Norvik Banka and a private Belarusian company in March this year.
The majority shareholder of the consortium was Said Gutseriev, the son of Russian businessman Mikhail Gutseriev.
Sanctions against the "daughters" of five Russian banks in Ukraine, among which was Sberbank, were introduced in mid-March.
During the year, they are forbidden to withdraw capital from the country in favor of parent organizations.
The trailer for the third season of "Narcos": in the popular series of the studio "Netflix" after the death of Pablo Escobar, the central role is played by the Cali cartel
Despite the fact that in the second season of "Narcos" the identity of the killer of Pablo Escobar was revealed, the netflix series is far from complete.
The streaming service has already confirmed that a third and fourth seasons are planned, and a third has already been unveiled by the first trailer showcasing the villains of the upcoming show.

Democracy in Afghanistan depends on the role of women in politics, the UN said.
Elections can only be representative when they involve all members of society, including women, the head of the U.N. mission in Afghanistan said Wednesday.
According to Nicholas Haysom, the current head of the UN assistance mission in Afghanistan, hundreds of women are running for provincial council elections, three women are vying for vice president, and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overstated," he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Choices can be fully representative only when women participate fully and are included in all stages of the electoral process.
Provincial council and presidential elections will be held in Afghanistan on 5 April.
The Taliban are threatening to disrupt the electoral process, which coincides with the transition of international forces from combat operations to the role of advisers.
In this year's elections, for the first time, power is being transferred peacefully from one democratically elected government to another.
Haysom said that increasing the role of women will contribute to the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Independent Electoral Commission of Afghanistan, out of a total of 3.6 million registered voters, 1.2 million are women.

In Venice, toughened fines for tourists for inappropriate behavior
The Venetian authorities have toughened fines for swimming in the canals from 50 euros to 500 euros.
For walking around the city in a swimsuit or with a naked torso will now be fined 200 euros.
100 euros will be demanded from those who will have a picnic in a public place or ride a bicycle through pedestrian areas, TASS reports with reference to the Association of Tour Operators of Russia.
In addition, it is mentioned that the authorities provide for a fine for inscriptions on monuments of 400 euros and for garbage 25 euros.
Tourists will be informed about the need to comply with the rules of conduct in Venice with the help of a special company "Enjoy, respect Venice" (#EnjoyRespectVenezia) in social networks, as well as through announcements and posters on the website of the city council, on billboards and in places of the greatest concentration of tourists.
The campaign will be conducted in 10 languages.
According to the tourism adviser of Venice, Paola Mar, information about fines will be transmitted to the embassies of the home countries of violators in order to warn their compatriots against such mistakes.
"The problem is that Venice is perceived as a beach," she said.
In April, the administration of the Italian city announced plans to limit the tourist flow.
Venice already has a successful limit on the number of tourists visiting the city center.
Instead of 100,000 people wanting to watch the Festa del Redentore festival, only 60,000 guests were allowed to enter the venue.
In addition, a moratorium has been introduced on the creation of new hotels and fast food restaurants in the historic part of Venice.

The senator also noted that the decision to leave was not immediate.

The Senator has been leading the Committee on Defense and Security since 2001.
Electricity is becoming cheaper for both residents and producers of Buryatia
The decades-long efforts of the Soviet and post-Soviet authorities of the Republic of Buryatia (Eastern Siberia) to establish fair tariffs for electricity consumers are beginning to bear fruit.
From September 1, the cost of low-voltage electricity for industrial recipients will be reduced by 25%.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service of the country in accordance with the Decree of the Government of the Russian Federation "On Amendments to the Rules of the Wholesale Market of Electric Energy and Capacity and to the Consolidated Forecast Balance of Production and Supply of Electric Energy (Capacity) within the Unified Energy System of Russia by Subjects of the Russian Federation" (dated 17.07.2017 No. 842) established indicative prices for electricity and capacity for industrial consumers of the Republic of Buryatia.
As a result, the cost of electricity for Buryat producers is reduced by a quarter, which will greatly facilitate the life of small and medium-sized enterprises and individual entrepreneurs.
For many decades, the republic's leaders have been circling the thresholds of Moscow offices in futile attempts to equalize the region in tariffs with the neighboring Irkutsk region with a cascade of hydroelectric power plants on the Angara River flowing from Lake Baikal, the main catchment area for which is Buryatia.
And only this year the movement began.
In March, tariffs for electricity for the population of the republic were reduced from 4.24 rubles / kWh to 3.93 rubles / kWh, or by 7.3%.
With the inclusion of Buryatia by the decision of the federal government in the List of territories of price zones of the wholesale market, for which the features of the functioning of the wholesale and retail markets are established, it is the turn of industrial consumers.
According to analysts, this is only the beginning, since the population of the Irkutsk region pays 1.01 rubles per kilowatt / hour.
But no one dares to name at least an approximate date for new tariff shifts downwards for Buryatia.

The National Union of Unskilled, Municipal and Boiler Workers (GMB) is concerned about the investment in McVitie's factory in Glasgow
The union is seeking guarantees from managers of biscuit maker McVitie's due to its long-term commitment to production at the Glasgow plant.
The Scottish branch of GMB reports that the company was silent on the issue of future investments at the Tolkros facility.
The factory, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits, among other products, employs more than 500 people.
Pladis, owner of McVitie's, says it has invested more than £5 million in the property over the past few years.
The company adds that in the event of any changes in the operation of the facility, employees and union representatives "will be the first to know about them."
In a letter to the head of the company's facility, gmb's Scottish branch demanded mcVitie's response to concerns that funding would not be used to upgrade production lines.
Senior organiser Drew Duffy said: "Members of our union are deeply concerned that we cannot get clarity from the facility's general manager on the needs of the business and investment plan for the future of Tolkross. "
Families have worked here for generations, and the concentration of workers is high in the local community and in greater Glasgow; it is an essential pillar of decent work in an area of high unemployment and social deprivation.
So, in terms of jobs, wages and prosperity, and against the backdrop of Brexit, rising living wages and chronic decline in manufacturing, the East End of Glasgow desperately needs production to flourish at McVitie's factory.
According to a Pladis spokesperson, "The manager of the Tolkros facility only yesterday received a letter from the Scottish branch of GMB, and the company will respond immediately, as we appreciate our continued cooperation with employees and union representatives."
Two months ago, we held a regular meeting with GMB employees and representatives in Tolkross to openly discuss a number of issues.
We spoke to employees about how, like all companies operating in the most competitive and volatile economic climate, we are constantly reviewing our actions – and this applies to all our facilities and activities – in order to remain competitive.
"In recent years, we have invested more than £5 million in our Tolkros facility, particularly in production lines and performance improvements."
We are fully aware of the value of Tolkross as a production facility, and in the event of any change in the work at this facility, employees and union representatives will be the first to know about it."
Putin said that the authorities will not give instructions to Rosneft and Gazprom
Vladimir Putin said that the Kremlin and the Cabinet of Ministers should get involved in the issue of gas supplies to the Eastern Petrochemical Company (VNHK), but no one will give instructions to Gazprom, like Rosneft.
So Russian President Vladimir Putin responded to the request of Igor Sechin to assist in resolving the contradictions that have arisen.
The head of state drew attention to the fact that relations between Rosneft and Gazprom should be resolved exclusively on the basis of market principles.
Earlier, the head of Rosneft, Igor Sechin, at a meeting on the implementation of major investment projects in the Far Eastern Federal District, said that the lack of an agreement with Gazprom on gas for VNHK jeopardizes the project implementation period.
Sechin noted that the dialogue with Gazprom on this issue continues.
Gazprom offers to find gas resources from the perimeter of Rosneft, but we do not have such resources," Sechin added.
Recall that Rosneft asked to be allowed to use for the Eastern Petrochemical Company gas from the Kirinskoye field of Gazprom, located on the shelf of Sakhalin.
In June, Gazprom said that negotiations on this issue were continuing, and "there are no sharp corners there."
Did PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar's transfer three years ago?
A La Liga participant may regret his interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain won't stop stalking Neymar after the club offered £189 million for his ransom, but did they warn Barcelona about the world-record raid three years ago?
The sensational offer has revived the summer transfer window as the Ligue 1 club was poised to break the world record for the cost of a move, more than double the previous mark linked to Paul Pogba's return to Manchester United last season for £89 million.
When the transfer is complete, Neymar will become the most expensive player in the world, as well as the highest paid professional athlete in the world, as PSG offer him a salary of more than £500,000 a week net.
Barcelona are known to be furious with the way the offer was made and how Neymar terminated his contract, despite the fact that, as a source close to the Catalan club's management insists, the club has always done everything possible for the player since his transfer from Santos in 2013.
But wasn't the football world warned of such a possibility three years ago by the PSG president?
When Manchester City expressed interest in hiring Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al Khelaifi issued a stern warning to any club that wanted to lure one of PSG's best players.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will turn against them, we will make offers to their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
"We treat all clubs with respect.
But if they try to recruit one of our players, they will face consequences."
Barcelona appear to have crossed that line when the Spanish club earlier this summer expressed interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti.
PSG have made it clear that they will not let go of the Italian national team player on any terms, and now it is likely that Barcelona are feeling the consequences of their offer in the form of the loss of one of their most valuable players, Neymar.
Putin instructed to deal with payments to victims of forest fires.
Russian President Vladimir Putin instructed to understand the material assistance that is allocated to residents affected by forest fires and for the construction of new housing.
Today, I would like to hear how the work is going.
In particular, I would like to ask you to report on the situation with payments and compensations to the affected citizens.
I have some discrepancies.
"On this occasion, I would also like to ask questions to the relevant colleagues about how much money has been allocated," Putin said at a meeting with the heads of the regions located on Lake Baikal.
On August 4, Vladimir Putin visited the Baikal State Nature Biosphere Reserve.
Putin was accompanied by the Plenipotentiary Representative of the President of the Russian Federation in the Siberian Federal District Sergey Menyailo and the head of the Baikal branch of the FGBI "Glavrybvod" Leonid Mikhailik.
They talked about the work on cleaning the lake.
Then they showed the fry in an open container next to the container, which were prepared for breeding.
First, Putin released a few fry from the net.
Then I pulled on a special lever on the lid of the container and released the rest.
Also during the trip, the leader instructed to deal with the environmental situation on Lake Baikal and build a road on the island of Olkhon.
According to the Ministry of Construction, one volume is needed, and allegedly another volume is provided.
"I want to deal with this, what, in fact, is happening there with financing," the Russian leader stressed.
Recall that during the forest fires of 2017, the fire covered the settlements of Buryatia, the Irkutsk region, residential buildings and outbuildings were destroyed.
In Ukraine, it was proposed to send Russians to prison for illegally crossing the border

"Magnet" was released in wholesale
The second largest food retailer "Magnit" announced the opening of three test stores of the new format "Magnit-Opt", which are designed to purchase products in small wholesale.

"The new service will allow companies and entrepreneurs to make purchases with financial benefits, and residents - to purchase products in reserve: for a week or a month," Magnit is sure.
Metro Cash & Carry and Selgros Cash & Carry are already operating in the small-scale wholesale segment.
In 2017, Lenta launched a special program Called Lenta Pro: it invited legal entities and private entrepreneurs to make purchases at special hypermarket cash desks, receive invoices to account for costs and VAT refunds.
The project is focused on the HoReCa segment, small retail and offices.
In Russia, there will be two new territories of advanced socio-economic development - "Abaza" and "Novotroitsk".
The relevant resolutions of the Government of the Russian Federation will come into force today, August 4.
The boundaries and types of economic activity of the TOR on the territory of the city of Abaza in the Republic of Khakassia have been determined.
In the city, where 15 thousand people live, there will be a special legal regime for entrepreneurial activity, as well as a minimum amount of capital investments of residents, a minimum number of new permanent jobs.
It is assumed that this will attract about 2.5 billion rubles of investment to the city, and more than 600 new jobs will be created.
The list of types of economic activity in which a special legal regime of entrepreneurial activity will operate in the Abaza ASEZ, for example, includes crop production, animal husbandry, food production, soft drinks and clothing.
Already now, the Government of the Republic has signed framework agreements on the implementation of 8 investment projects.
It is also planned to reduce the dependence of the territory on the city-forming enterprise LLC "Abakan Mine".
In January 2017, the authorities of the region reported that Khakassia had fulfilled all the conditions of the Ministry of Economic Development for the creation of the ASEZ.
The authorities of the Orenburg region did the same.
There, in the city of Novotroitsk, a territory of advanced socio-economic development will also be created.
This will diversify the economy of the single-industry town, reduce its dependence on the city-forming enterprise of JSC Ural Steel, as well as create more than 2.3 thousand jobs and attract investments in the amount of more than 8 million rubles.
The list of types of economic activity in which a special legal regime for entrepreneurs will operate in the new ASEZ includes, in particular, freshwater fish farming, the production of feed, medicines and medical materials.
Novotroitsk became the first single-industry town in the Orenburg region to receive the status of ASEZ.
Recall that the territory of advanced development is an economic zone with preferential tax conditions, simplified administrative procedures and other privileges, which is created to attract investment and improve the lives of the population.
Among the benefits for residents of the ASEZ are the following: income tax in the amount of not more than 5% for the first five years, and at least 10% for the next 5 years, social contributions in the amount of 7.6% for 10 years, the use of the free customs zone regime, preferential mode of connection to various infrastructure facilities, as well as preferential rental rates.
Loza called Manson a "scumbag" and threatened to "punch him in the face."
Yuri Loza expressed his indignation at the statement of the American rock musician Marilyn Manson, who insulted Moscow.
In an interview with Komsomolskaya Pravda, the Russian singer called Manson a "scoundrel" and a "scumbag."
According to Loza, foreign artists who allow themselves such statements should not be invited to Russia.
In addition, Loza believes that Manson should be "punched in the face" for his words.
Recall, the American artist, known for his outrageous actions, rudely spoke about the Russian capital at a concert in Kiev.
Earlier on Thursday, "Arguments of the Week" wrote that Manson's statement was commented on by domestic producer Joseph Prigozhin.
