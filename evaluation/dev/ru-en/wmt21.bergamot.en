Semilarski vs. Prosecutor's office: the cassation of the former vice-mayor of Tartu will be considered on August 4
This means that the decision on it is likely to be made in early September.
The courts of the first two instances refused to consider the claim of Semilarsky, but in April his cassation appeal was accepted by the State Court.
On December 12, 2019, the Tartu Administrative Court returned the complaint to the applicant, since its permission is not within its competence of the administrative court.
The court's decision stated that the complaint contained a claim for damage caused during criminal proceedings.
"The prosecutor's office and the county court should regulate such issues," Anett Kreitsmann, spokesman for the Tartu Courts, told ERR.
According to her, Valvo Semilarski appealed this decision in the district court, which on February 5 did not change the decision of the court of first instance.
Now the state court will have to say his word.
According to defender Semilarski, sworn lawyer Oliver Nyaes, his client was unreasonably under suspicion of bribery for about two years.
Now he demands from the prosecutor's office to refute the wrong allegations in his address and to compensate him for moral damage.
The reason for filing a complaint to the court was the statements of the prosecutor for special cases of the Lyuna district prosecutor's office Margus Gross, made by him in October 2017, when Semilarski, along with the other at the time, Vice-Mayor Tartu Artem Suvorov was detained on suspicion of committing several crimes.
"Recall that when I was detained, the Security Police and the prosecutor's office immediately organized a press conference and informed the entire Republic of Estonia that the leaders of Tartu, one of the most influential local governments, are corrupt.
These public suspicions hanging in the air have accompanied me for about two years.
And now that these allegations and suspicions have turned out to be false, the prosecutor's office does not want to say anything about it," - commented Semilarski in early August 2019.
According to Oliver Nyaes, at a press conference, the prosecutor went beyond the legal framework in which the prosecutor's office should operate.
"The claim of bribery and corruption turned out to be false, but that's not the only problem here.
The European Court of Human Rights, for example, has repeatedly stressed in its rulings on Russia, as well as in Lithuania, that at the stage of the investigation, representatives of the state should be careful when choosing words so that the suspects would not be represented as criminals before the sentencing.
To this prosecutor's office is obliged by the presumption of innocence, which, unfortunately, was not respected in this case against Valvo Semilarski," - said Nyase.
"Semilarsky's public submission as a serious offender and bribe-taker in circumstances where the facts underlying the suspicion of bribery are still being clarified is inadmissible, which is contrary to the presumption of innocence and unfair to the applicant," he added.
As rus.err.ee wrote, former vice-mayor of Tartu Valvo Semilarski will not be prosecuted on charges of bribery - the criminal case against him in July was partially closed.
At the same time, the former official is being tried on charges of deliberate violation of anti-corruption legislation in transactions in particularly large amounts.
According to the indictment, in the period from 2015 to 2017, the former deputy mayor of Tartu more than thirty times participated in meetings of the city administration when making decisions related to the companies operating in Tartu, with the owners or leaders of which Semilarsky actively communicated at the personal level in off-time.
According to Gross, in all these cases, Semilarsky had personal interests, and therefore he had to withdraw from participation in decision-making.
Earlier, as wrote rus.err.ee, the prosecutor's office presented Semilarski suspicions of receiving a bribe and violation of anti-corruption legislation during transactions on a particularly large scale.
This happened in October 2016, when he was detained along with another deputy mayor Artem Suvorov (Centrist Party).
Then the prosecutor's office and the security police said that there is good evidence against both vice-mayors.
Both officials then resigned.
The case of Suvorov later reached the court, which fully justified the politician.
The trial in the Valvo Semilarsky case is still ongoing.

How will the decision of the Central Bank to reduce the key rate on the economy will affect the economy
The Bank of Russia has expectedly again lowered the key rate.
It fell by another 0.25 percentage points, to 4.25% per annum - formally another historical minimum.
Judging by the return of a short rate of rate cuts, as well as the tone of the Central Bank's statements and updated forecasts for the Russian economy, the regulator looks at economic prospects more optimistic than before.
This means that the current monetary easing cycle may soon stop.
"We continued to ease monetary policy, primarily given that there are still risks of inflation from 4% in 2021," said Elvira Nabiullina, head of the Bank of Russia.
They are associated with a significant decrease in economic activity, a fall in domestic and external demand.
The recovery of the economy, according to Nabiullina, will take more than a year and a half.
At the same time, she noted that after the lifting of restrictions due to the pandemic, economic processes have revived: energy consumption, consumer and investment demand were restored, construction and production of consumer goods were expanding, the annual rate of decline in freight turnover, industrial production slowed down.
According to the updated forecast of the Central Bank, in 2020 the economy will be 4.5-5.5% (before that was expected 4-6%), and the recovery growth of the economy in 2021 will be 3.5-4.5%, in 2022 - 2.5-3.5%.
In addition, the Bank of Russia revised the forecast for annual oil prices to $ 38 and $40 per barrel of Urals in 2020 and 2021, respectively.
Previously, the Central Bank expected $27 and $35 per barrel.
Finally, the Bank of Russia's forecast for inflation for 2020 was 3.7-4.2% against the previously expected 3.8-4.8%.
The view of the Bank of Russia on the situation in the economy is becoming more optimistic, which brings us closer to the end of the easing cycle, according to economists in Russia and the CIS "Renaissance Capital" Sofia Donets and Andrei Melashchenko.
So, the Bank of Russia has consistently reduced the key rate for more than a year, since the beginning of last summer it has fallen by 3.5 percentage points.
And at the last meeting in June, the Central Bank lowered it by one percentage point at once due to low inflation rates due to the suppressed demand and the need to stimulate the stalling of the economy that has stalled due to the pandemic and associated restrictions.
The chances for the adjustment of monetary policy remain (at the next meeting on September 18 and until the end of the year), but the limit is already close, agrees the chief analyst of Rosbank Evgeny Koshelev.

The authorities of the Moscow region told about the fate of closed landfills
In the suburbs continue to close landfills of solid household waste.
This year, the authorities promise to eliminate the latter.
Some of the 39 landfills that existed in the area are being upgraded to modern waste processing complexes.
But this option is not possible for every landfill - many of them are overgrown with dense residential buildings.
After the landfill is closed, it stands for reclamation - the body of the polygon is overflowed with soils, degassing systems and drainage infiltrate are mounted.
This allows you to stop the chemical processes inside the landfill, so that it is not ignited, does not exude stench, does not poison the soil and ground water.
And then the former landfill remains to rise a useless pile among the encircled of its residential buildings.
Why not make something useful?
For example, in Ruza, where the remediation of the Annino test site was completed just the other day, the authorities are considering the option of making a ski slope from a heap.
This landfill, operated from 1976 to 2016, grew so that it went beyond the boundaries of the land allocated for it.
Therefore, during the reclamation, it was necessary to buy neighboring plots, de facto long clogged with garbage under the tie.
"For some time it will take, the landfill will "stop," the fortresses will be recruited, and we will think about what can be done so that it begins to benefit.
Right in the eye catches the eye - a ski resort," - told reporters the head of the Ruzsky district Nikolay Parfenov.
Two landfills will become sites for the production of renewable energy
The Torbeevo polygons in Lyubertsy and Tymokhovo in the Bogorod district will be sites for the extraction of renewable energy sources from landfill and biological gases.
On the territory of Torbeyev, a gas piston power plant will be launched by the end of the year, capable of producing up to 8 million kilowatt-hours of electricity and about 0.95 gigacalorie of thermal energy per year, which will provide its own needs of the landfill - heat supply to administrative and industrial premises.
"Timohovo" will produce 72.5 million kilogram-hours and will continue to operate as a waste processing complex.
And at the Balashikha training ground "Kuchino," which was closed after complaints from residents on the "Direct line" with the President of the country, a museum can be created.
"There was such an idea - to create a museum of reclamation of polygons of the Moscow region," - said the Deputy Prime Minister - Minister of Ecology and Nature Management of the region Dmitry Kurakin.

Beautiful high minarets only adorned Ayia Sophia
Once again about Ayia Sophia - the text of Fr. Vladimir Zelinsky was caught, which, they say, should be protested.
First, there was a free entrance - a hurrah!
I was not in Istanbul, but the House of God is better free entrance than paid.
Secondly, the Muslims also honestly conquered this land, as the Orthodox conquered the Volga-Ok interfluve, the Muslim Caucasus (and put the church in Grozny) and planted an apple tree on Mars.
God to help you!
The Jews conquered the Holy Land.
The Americans conquered the American.
We'll give it back to everyone?
Do you think there are no pagans who will demand the return of their home, where the Church is in which the Church is located?
Third, the Muslims improved this building, invested in it.
That is, it is as well as their factories and estates, which the Leningraders took from the bourgeois to their property, belong to the Leningraders - Putin and other nomenclature.
They improved everything from the Kremlin to the Angara, so it's all of their progressors.
Beautiful high minarets very adorned Ayia Sophia, very much.
There was a stupid inkwell, became a stupid inkwell with beautiful minarets.
Fourth, there are no "Islamic" and "Orthodox" civilizations.
There are believers, there are hypocrites, and there are hypocrites, and there are hypocrites.
Believers in the categories of civilization do not think.
This is the thinking of British Foreign Ministry official Toynbee, a believer is ashamed to think so.
And the believers are everywhere in prayer.
And always.
The believer does not pray only where he is asked to leave - he is removed to another place and prays there.
He is a believer, not a defender.
We're craps, not gloomy stones.

Kobe had the killer's instinct, so I tried on the court to talk to him so that he didn't perceive the game in an aggressive way.
On the court, I gave him compliments: "Oh!
Kobe, well scored, great passage!
Listening to my enthusiastic responses, he forgot a little bit that it is necessary to once again take the ball and score another 3 - 4 points.
We communicated well with Kobi," Kirilenko said, "Evening Moscow."
He also spoke about his first game against Jordan.
"I took care of him.
The first three minutes of the match I ran in my delight that next to me a legend that I saw only on TV.
While I have a spill in the goon smoles, Michael scored a lot of points.
I soon walked away from the delights, covered his shots a couple of times...
In that game, my team won, and Jordan still scored 44 points," - said the head of the RFB.
Kirilenko spent 12 seasons in the NBA.
He was selected by Utah Jazz in the 1999 draft under the 24th overall number.
In addition to Utah, for which he spent ten seasons, the Russian forward played for the Minnesota Timberwolves and Brooklyn Nets.
In total, he scored 797 matches, in which he averaged 11.8 points, performed 5.5 rebounds, 2.7 assists and 1.8 block shots.
Earlier it was reported that Kirilenko will nominate his candidacy for the election of the head of the RFB.
