The prosecution insisted on forced labor for a period of three years.
A measure of restraint was chosen against me in the form of restriction of freedom, which consists in the fact that I cannot attend mass events in public and cannot communicate with the organizers of the protest action on April 7th.
“All this time I wore an electronic bracelet and a base.
That&#39;s how they tracked my whereabouts.
I note that in the movements I was not limited.
I recently arrived from Moscow, where I was trained,&quot; Andrey Borovikov said.

Pavel Mogilevets: &quot;Everyone in Rubin should think about the reasons for unsuccessful matches.&quot;
Rubin midfielder Pavel Mogilevets spoke about the reasons for the team&#39;s unsuccessful game.
Kazan in the championship of Russia suffered four defeats in a row, and also flew out of the Cup.
We tune in to every game, - Mogilevets is quoted by Izvestia.
Therefore, each of us needs to think about the reasons for such unsuccessful matches.
There are still meetings ahead - we need to prepare for them and correct the situation.
How?
If we knew, we probably would have fixed it by now.
But first of all, it seems to me, we need to improve in such a component as martial arts.
In my opinion, we have a problem with this.
The Kremlin supports a ban on smoking on the balconies of residential buildings
The Kremlin supports any measures that will save lives, said presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov, commenting on the ban on smoking on balconies and loggias of apartments.

Administrative liability is provided for violation.
The Kremlin has a positive attitude towards any decisions that help save human lives.
“We know how many fires occur, many of them have very tragic consequences and public outcry.
Therefore, any saved life justifies such decisions,&quot; Peskov said.
First of all, the spokesman evaluates this as a fire prevention measure, and not a way to protect neighbors from tobacco smoke.
Peskov also noted that Russian President Vladimir Putin does not welcome smoking and is a supporter of a healthy lifestyle.

China strongly opposes U.S. passage of Taipei bill
China strongly opposes the US passage of the so-called &quot;Taipei bill&quot;, which seriously violates the One China principle and the principles of the three Sino-US joint communiqués.
This was announced on Friday by Ma Xiaoguang, official representative of the State Council Office of the People&#39;s Republic of China for Taiwan Affairs.
The US Senate Foreign Relations Committee&#39;s approval of this bill is also a serious violation of international law and the basic principles of international relations and gross interference in China&#39;s internal affairs, Ma Xiaoguang said.
According to him, Taiwan is part of China, and issues related to it belong to China&#39;s internal affairs.
&quot;We urge the US side to clarify the situation, immediately stop pushing relevant negative bills, and immediately stop interfering in the Taiwan issue in order to avoid further damage to China-US relations and peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait,&quot; he said.
China must be and will be reunited.
This historical trend cannot be stopped by anyone and no force, stressed Ma Xiaoguang.
TikTok hides objectionable videos from users
TikTok has over 500 million users worldwide, 40% of which are under 18.
Imagine China/Reuters
Chinese social networking site TikTok is censoring videos that mention Tiananmen Square, Tibetan independence, or the banned religious group Falun Gong.
The documents obtained by the publication reveal that the owner of TikTok, ByteDance, is using the app to promote Chinese foreign policy goals abroad.
The bulk of violations concerning Chinese policy fall under &quot;hate speech&quot;.
In each case, TikTok puts objectionable posts in a context that fits the general rules so that the actions of the social network do not look like censorship.
For example, the prohibition against criticizing China&#39;s socialist system falls under the general prohibition of &quot;criticizing or attacking the policies and social rules of any country, such as the constitutional monarchy, parliamentary system, etc.&quot;
The ban on mentioning the Tiananmen incidents or the Cambodian genocide falls under &quot;distortion of the history of China or other countries.&quot;
The document also lists the banned names of twenty &quot;foreign leaders or statesmen&quot;, including North Korean leaders Kim Jong Il, Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Un, Indian politician Mahatma Gandhi, US Presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, South Korean President Park Geun-hee, Indonesian President Joko Widodo and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the document says.
Prohibited material falls into two categories, the document says.
Publications from the first category are deleted by social network administrators and may result in blocking the user.
Not too severe violations fall into the second category: such posts remain on the site, but their distribution is limited by TikTok&#39;s algorithms.
ByteDance representatives told The Guardian that these rules are outdated and no longer apply: &quot;Now we use a localized approach for moderation, and also involve independent local specialists.&quot;
Russian TikTok users have no specific restrictions on publications, co-founder of the Producer Center Rustem Bogdanov says.
&quot;Producer Center&quot; is one of the Russian media companies that officially cooperates with TikTok.
All advertising materials of bloggers &quot;Producer Center&quot; coordinates with representatives of the social network, but user materials can be posted without approval, Bogdanov reports.
When asked whether it is possible to speak about politics or Putin on TikTok, Bogdanov answers in the affirmative and says that he has seen such publications.
Roman Zaripov, the founder of the Our Didgital agency, agrees with Bogdanov: “The basic rules for TikTok users are listed in the user agreement: you can’t post shocking content, discriminatory statements, and so on.”
But under these rules, you can bring any content that moderators do not like, Zaripov notes.
Zaripov&#39;s agency is another Russian TikTok partner.
According to TikTok, the number of its users in the world exceeds 500 million, 40% of which are under the age of 18.
According to the user agreement, only persons over the age of 13 can use TikTok.
Social network administrators check their age using artificial intelligence: a neural network analyzes faces and determines how old a person looks, says Bogdanov.
If the neural network decides that the user is younger, his account can be deleted, he adds.
According to RBC, in September 2019, ByteDance opened an office in Moscow on the territory of the WeWork coworking space.

34 people were injured, ten of them are still in hospitals.
Melike, a resident of Istanbul, admitted that she had a panic attack for the first time in her life.
&quot;I cried so much.
Sobbed right at the workplace.
Later it became easier, I returned to business.
But I&#39;m so ashamed now!&quot;, - the girl told the 360 TV channel.
&quot;There was a really strong earthquake in Istanbul
I still can&#39;t go back!

I don&#39;t think anything has gone wrong in our relationship.
Roszdravnadzor reported on the results of an audit on the fact of amputation of a child&#39;s hand
A child&#39;s arm was amputated in the Rostov region due to a mistake by doctors, Vzglyad reports with reference to the website of the territorial body of Roszdravnadzor.
An 11-year-old boy broke his arm, after which he was put in a cast in a hospital in the Zernograd region.
Some time later, the child developed gangrene, and an amputation was performed.
As a result of the audit, it turned out that there were violations of the timeliness and correctness of the diagnosis, as well as the standard and volume of assistance provided.
The materials of the check were transferred to the SU of the Investigative Committee of Russia for the region.
Earlier URA.RU reported that the head physician of the city hospital of Yuzhnouralsk had been arrested.
Russians warned about fake calls from banks
In Russia, the number of calls from scammers who replace the bank&#39;s phone number has increased.
It is reported by &quot;Kommersant&quot; with reference to the data of the Central Bank.
In the summer of 2019, the regulator handed over to telecom operators information about more than 2.5 thousand numbers from which customers of various financial institutions called.
In 189 cases, operators detected a number change.
Another 218 numbers were blocked, and in 59 cases restrictions were placed on the use of financial services.
Artem Sychev, deputy head of the information security department of the Central Bank, said that a wide range of Russian banks faced the substitution of the number.
He explained that operators do not always respond to warnings from the Central Bank about fraudulent calls, citing the absence of such a duty in the Law on Communications.
Otkritie Bank, Rosbank and Alfa-Bank confirmed information about an increase in the number of fraudulent calls with a number substitution.
According to the Beeline press service, some of the information about fraudulent calls that the Central Bank transmitted was incorrect: the lists included numbers that are actually used by banks to communicate with customers.
Their blocking would lead to disruptions in the work of the organization.
Artem Sychev said that the Central Bank plans to create a database of scam numbers, which the telecom operator will contact with each call to verify the number.
He explained that in order to create such a base, amendments to the legislation would be required.

Piskarev also said that he would ask the Foreign Ministry to decide on the further accreditation of the German Deutsche Welle, in whose publications the commission found signs of justifying extremism.
In September, Roskomnadzor revealed political advertising on Google, Facebook and Youtube.
According to the agency, this happened during the Russian elections on September 8.
The facts of violations were transferred to the commission of the State Duma.
Later, Google said that the company supports responsible political advertising.

Stoltenberg discussed Ukraine&#39;s accession to NATO with Zelensky
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky discussed Ukraine&#39;s membership in the alliance on the sidelines of the 74th session of the UN General Assembly.
The secretary general spoke about this during a speech at Columbia University in New York.
Answering the question whether the relevant topic was raised during the meeting, Stoltenberg said that they really discussed this issue, and also stressed that in his response he did not name the terms for Ukraine&#39;s entry into NATO.
According to him, any country that would like to join the North Atlantic Alliance is obliged to fulfill certain conditions in order to meet specific standards, writes RT.
In Crimea, Zelensky was offered an alternative to the NATO course
Instead of joining NATO, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky should start building good neighborly relations with Russia.
This was announced on Friday, September 27, by the co-chairman of the Assembly of Slavic Peoples of the Republic of Crimea Roman Chegrinets.
&quot;The President of Ukraine should not repeat the mistakes of his predecessor, but should heed the advice of [U.S. President] Donald Trump, which he listened to with a sour face, and improve relations with the President of Russia,&quot; Chegrinets told RIA Novosti reporters.
Chegrinets noted that Zelensky is a good actor for him, but a bad politician.
According to him, the Ukrainian president will be able to stay in power only if relations with the Russian Federation are improved.
Earlier, on September 27, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said that he had a conversation with Zelensky on the country&#39;s entry into the alliance.
According to him, for this Ukraine is obliged to fulfill certain conditions.
On June 5, Rada deputy Yevgeny Balitsky said that the possible entry of Ukraine into the alliance does not guarantee an improvement in life in the country.
Money is more important than football.
Barcelona blackmail Neymar
Spanish “Barcelona” and its former Brazilian footballer Neymar are trying to settle a financial dispute that arose after the striker moved to the French “Paris Saint-Germain”.
The case almost went to court, but the Catalans offered the player to resolve the dispute without the intervention of Themis.
Otherwise, they refuse to return him.
Neymar and his dodgy father, who is also an agent of the Brazilian, started an interesting trick: under an agreement with Barça, which the player signed in 2016, he was supposed to receive 40 million euros.
However, just a year later, the striker ended up at PSG for a record 222 million euros.
However, he received 22 million from the Catalans and now wants to take the remaining 18.
Moreover, the Brazilian&#39;s lawyers insist that the club also owes him interest for late payment.
When Neymar&#39;s claims became known in the Catalan capital, Barcelona filed a counterclaim.
The Blue Garnets insist that the bonus was based on the performance of the entire contract - from 2016 to 2022.
Accordingly, the club believes that the player was entitled to only a quarter of 40 million euros and demand a return of a proportional part of the first payment.
But the most interesting thing is that in the summer Neymar and Barça almost agreed on the return of the &quot;prodigal&quot; player to the fold of Catalonia.
True, the deal fell through, but there is still hope for the forward to move back.
And now, according to Sports.Ru with reference to insiders, the club&#39;s lawyers told the player&#39;s representatives that if the issue of financial claims is not settled out of court, this will exclude the possibility of the return of the Brazilian.
Neymar himself wants to return so much that he asked for guarantees that the Catalans will buy him back.

But to this Laar replied that the goal of the Reform Party was to get two seats on the board of the Bank of Estonia - so that, in addition to Jaanus Tamkivi, Andres Sutt would also be on the board.
On Tuesday, 24 September, the Riigikogu rejected Laar&#39;s proposal to appoint new members of the Board of the Bank of Estonia.

Media representatives visited the fourth power unit of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant
A video taken in the control room of the fourth power unit at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant appeared on the Internet, first published on YouTube by the Ruptly video agency.
It is noted that a group of 15 media representatives received access to the fourth reactor control room of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant as part of the presentation of a guide to the exclusion zone.

On the Web, they condemned for several days whether rapper Guf is worthy of being the new &quot;Bachelor&quot;.

More respect for him.
I wish him good luck in the future.
He is a real man.

Football player Pavel Mamaev, released last week from a colony on parole, will not return to the Krasnodar football club.
The former midfielder of this club may sign a contract with FC Rostov in the near future, - reports the Championship portal.
According to the publication, negotiations between representatives of &quot;Rostov&quot; and Mamaev are now in the final stage.
Presumably, the contract with the 31-year-old football player will be signed for two years with the possibility of extension for another season.
&quot;Sport-Express&quot; writes that the day before, Pavel Mamaev was supposed to undergo a medical examination at Dynamo Moscow, but the check did not take place due to &quot;an uncertain situation in the club.&quot;
Krasnodar terminated the contract with Mamaev last week by agreement of the parties.

Together with the Zenit player Alexander Kokorin, Mamaev was serving a sentence for participating in fights in the center of Moscow in October last year.
In mid-September they were released from the colony on parole.
Zenit signed a new contract with Kokorin.
A man with a samurai sword tried to defend a cart found in a garbage heap
A resident of the American city of Oakland Park, Florida, was arrested on charges of attempted murder after he brandished a samurai sword at his opponent in an argument over a cart found in the trash.
54-year-old Curtis Miller (Curtis Miller) dug in a pile of garbage near an empty house.
This was noticed by Todd Beavers, who went out for an evening walk.
The latter decided to join the search and found a black cart among the garbage.
Miller saw the discovery of Beavers and was upset.
He believed that he could claim the cart, as he was the first to start digging through the garbage.
The men began to argue.
Suddenly, Beavers grabbed the cart and ran with it towards his house.
Then Miller took the samurai sword he found in the same heap and began to pursue his opponent.
He caught up with Beavers near his house.
Miller drew his sword from its scabbard and began swinging it in the direction of the cart thief.
Beavers informed Miller that what was happening was being recorded on video.
Noticing the video camera, Miller fled, but threatened to return.
Beavers left the cart in the yard and entered the house.
Shortly thereafter, he saw an unfamiliar woman enter his yard and take the cart away, shouting insults.
The police were already looking for Miller for driving without a license.
The man was arrested and charged with attempted murder.
In September, it was reported that in the American city of Hardiston, New Jersey, a hedge fund manager attacked an unfamiliar woman and wounded her with a sword.
Thus he reacted to the fact that the guests at the wedding, which was celebrated in the same hotel where he was staying, did not let him light up.
Mass riots for three
The &quot;Moscow case&quot; against the participants of the summer protests is falling apart more and more noticeably into separate fragments and loses its political content.
The evidence for the &quot;mass riots&quot; itself does not stand up to scrutiny, but in the absence of a political decision to let the case go on the brakes, a weak evidence base would not necessarily lead to the charges being dropped.
The collapse of the case should inspire society, but it will certainly leave the security forces in extreme annoyance, whose efforts to fill the case with defendants and evidence were in vain.
On Thursday, September 26, one of the three defendants remaining in the case under Art. 212 of the Criminal Code (mass riots) - Aleksey Minyailo was unexpectedly released from custody without any obligations, and a few hours later he was completely rehabilitated: the ICR dropped the charges against him.
Minyailo spent almost two months under arrest, several professional communities stood up for him at once: historians, priests, writers.
After that, only two accused of participating in mass riots remained in the case (initially there were 13 accused): Sergei Fomin, who was placed under house arrest on September 3, and Samariddin Radjabov, whose arrest was extended until the end of December the day before (he is also accused of using violence in in relation to a representative of authority, Article 318 of the Criminal Code).
The court sentenced the author of a comic petition for the accession of Latvia to the United States
The court of the Vidzeme suburb of Riga sentenced Denis Bartecki, the author of a humorous petition for Latvia&#39;s accession to the United States of America.
It is noted that the man was assigned 80 hours of corrective labor and one year of probation.
&quot;Common sense is not the strongest side of our system,&quot; Bartetsky commented on the court&#39;s decision.
He also added that usually the punishment is less than requested.
The collection of signatures on the accession of Latvia to the United States was organized in 2016.
Meanwhile, simultaneously with this petition, signatures were being collected on the site about Latvia joining the &quot;Galactic Empire&quot; and about the country&#39;s exit from the solar system and the Milky Way.
It is noted that a criminal case was initiated against Bartetsky under the first paragraph of Article 82 of the Criminal Law of the country - &quot;Public call to undermine the territorial integrity of the Republic of Latvia.&quot;
Prior to that, in 2016, the author of an online petition for the accession of Latvia to Russia received six months in prison.

The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia proposes to punish for insulting the police on the Internet
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia has prepared amendments to the law &quot;On Police&quot; in order to protect law enforcement officers from the dissemination of slanderous and discrediting information on the Internet.
On Friday, an application for public discussion of the bill appeared on the federal portal of normative legal acts, the draft document itself has not yet been published.
The explanatory note to the document notes that it is being developed in connection with the need to protect the honor and dignity of a police officer from &quot;dissemination in information and communication networks, including the Internet, information of a discrediting nature, including those of a defamatory nature.&quot;
How exactly it is supposed to protect the police from slander in the network is not specified.
At the same time, the explanatory note to the document notes that the provisions of the amendments will be applied &quot;by individualizing the mechanism&quot; already provided for by the law on blocking posts that offend government officials, and the law on fines for such posts.
Both laws came into force in March of this year.
The final text of the bill will be published after public discussions and independent anti-corruption expertise.
According to the explanatory note, the amendments to the law &quot;On Police&quot; should come into force in January 2020.
On March 18, President Vladimir Putin signed a law punishing &quot;clear disrespect for the state&quot; on the Internet.
According to this document, Roskomnadzor warns the resource about the violation and gives it a day to eliminate it.
For the first violation of the bans, a fine of 30,000 to 300,000 rubles is provided, and for a repeated violation - an administrative arrest for up to 15 days.
On April 12, Roskomnadzor applied this rule to the media for the first time by blocking the Yaroslavl edition of 76.ru.
Shortly thereafter, the Chudovsky District Court of the Novgorod Region fined a local resident 30,000 rubles for posting &quot;two entries containing information in an indecent form that offends human dignity and public morality and expresses clear disrespect for society, the state, bodies, exercising state power in the Russian Federation.
Called the deadline for lowering mortgage rates
Interest rates on housing loans in Russia will decrease until the end of 2019.
This was stated by the general director of the credit organization &quot;Dom.rf&quot; Alexander Plutnik, reports &quot;Interfax&quot;.
As Plutnik noted at the collegium under the Ministry of Construction of Russia, most banks in the remaining months of the year will conduct another cycle of lowering mortgage rates, and the market average will reach 8.9 percent - the level provided for by the national project &quot;Housing and Urban Environment&quot;.
According to the project passport, in 2019 the average mortgage rate should be 8.9 percent, in 2021 - 8.5 percent, by 2024 - 7.9 percent.
The program envisages &quot;providing affordable housing for middle-income families, including the creation of opportunities for acquisition (the construction of housing by them using a mortgage loan, the rate of which should be less than 8 percent)&quot;.
Earlier in September, it became known that one of the largest players in the Russian mortgage market, Sberbank, plans to carry out another reduction in housing loan rates by the end of 2019.
Will phytoestrogens and phytoandrogens help prolong youth?
The topic of phytoandrogens is poorly studied.
Of the most famous - pine pollen.
But phytoestrogens have been studied well and have a positive effect on the body.
They reduce the risk of certain diseases associated with age (among them cardiovascular, some types of cancer).
Known sources of phytoestrogens are all legumes (the most popular is soy), hops, flax seeds.
However, many experts believe that such dietary supplements cannot be a full-fledged replacement for natural hormones.
Possible harm from such additives cannot be ruled out.
For example, against the background of their intake, the production of their own hormones may decrease due to the fact that too many analogues from outside enter the body.
Veretennikov called for the revival of the Kazakh &quot;Zhenis&quot;.
Former striker of Rotor and the Russian national team Oleg Veretennikov joined the campaign to revive the Kazakhstani Zhenis.
The club from Astana, which in different years was called Dynamo, Tselinnik, Astana and Zhenis, was disbanded in 2014.
Veretennikov defended his colors in 2004 and 2008.
“I learned about the campaign to revive the Zhenis football club, organized by its fans.
And he couldn&#39;t stay away!
I spent a season and a half in this club.
These were not the best times in terms of results and funding, but I will never forget this club and its dedicated fans who have always been with the team!
The stadium named after Munaitpasov, where I scored my 200th goal in my career, will forever remain in my memory!
&quot;Zhenis&quot; should be revived!
It has a great history and great fans.
I wish them all the best and believe that the city authorities will return their home club to them!&quot; Veretennikov wrote on Instagram.
The Bastion complex launched the Onyx rocket in Chukotka
The Ministry of Defense for the first time launched a cruise missile from the Bastion complex in Chukotka.
Onyx was launched at a distance of 350 kilometers from the target, and 200 of them flew over land, which is a record for this type of missile.
The firing safety was provided by about 10 warships and vessels of the Pacific Fleet, as well as naval aviation aircraft, the Department of Information and Mass Communications of the Russian Defense Ministry reported.
Earlier complexes &quot;Bastion&quot; have never been used in Chukotka.
The hydrometeorological center named true folk omens
In Russia, there are many folk signs by which people try to predict the weather.
Unfortunately, not all of them work.
The Hydrometeorological Center checked all the signs that supposedly work.
Meteorologists came to the conclusion that only two of them can really be trusted, however, in the short term.
As the scientific director of the Hydrometeorological Center of Russia Roman Vilfand said, if the sun is red at sunset, then the next day will really be fine, as our ancestors noticed.
And if the heavenly body is whitish, then the next day it will rain.
The second working sign is based on bird watching.
More often they talk about swallows, if they fly low, then this is usually rain.
This is explained simply - when the air humidity is high, then the wings of the midges get wet and the birds are forced to descend in order to hunt insects, writes TASS.
Different continents have their own folk signs.
Groundhog Day is a traditional folk holiday in the United States and Canada, celebrated annually on February 2nd.
It is believed that on this day you need to watch the groundhog crawling out of its hole in order to determine the time of the arrival of spring.
Unidentified oil slicks found on beaches in northeastern Brazil
Oil slicks of unknown origin have been found on 99 beaches in northeastern Brazil.
The centers of pollution were scattered over two thousand kilometers of the coastline.
Reports of the first discovered oil slicks began to arrive as early as September 2nd.
However, every day until Thursday, their number, as well as the territorial coverage, continued to increase.
The Brazilian Institute of the Environment carried out a chemical analysis of the identified samples.
It turned out that they are all identical and we are talking about crude oil.
The state oil corporation Petrobras, to which the found samples were transferred for analysis, said that in their composition they did not correspond to oil extracted from fields in Brazil.
&quot;It&#39;s thick oil.
It can be dropped from one of the ships after cleaning the tanks.
Many continue to do so.
And most likely it fell into the ocean current,&quot; Rogerio Almeida, coordinator of the union of oil workers in the states of Pernambuco and Paraiba, told the Brazilian news portal G1.
He also added that, despite the ban on this practice, many ships continue to dump waste on the high seas.
On the beaches of four of the eight affected states in the northeast, environmentalists found nine sea turtles completely covered in oil.
And only two of them managed to save.
In the coming days, the Brazilian Institute of the Environment, together with Petrobras, will start cleaning up polluted beaches.
In the meantime, the institute&#39;s specialists recommend that tourists and local residents avoid oil slicks and report all detected sources of pollution.
Medvedev instructed to revise the norms of work of catering enterprises
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev instructed Rospotrebnadzor, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Economy and the Ministry of Industry and Trade, together with the business ombudsman and the business community, to revise the sanitary and epidemiological rules and regulations for catering organizations.
They will also have to study the issue of transition to the application of the requirements established by the technical regulations of the Eurasian Economic Union in catering.
The departments must submit their proposals to the government no later than October 15, according to the list of instructions of Mr. Medvedev following the results of the Dialogue program broadcast on September 11 on the Rossiya 24 TV channel.
By the same date, Mr. Medvedev instructed all the above-mentioned departments, in addition to the Ministry of Justice, to submit proposals for conducting an experiment from January 1, 2020 to limit control measures for catering organizations in a number of regions, including Moscow, Tatarstan and the Kaliningrad region.
By November 11, the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Economy were instructed to submit to the government a bill amending the Code of Administrative Offenses on the application of an administrative suspension of activities for violating the requirements for catering, due to which harm was caused to health.
In addition, the Ministry of Labour, the Ministry of Economy, Rospotrebnadzor and the Ministry of Finance need to work out the issue of a gradual transition from 2021 to the formation of a consumer basket based on a basic set of products that allows forming a complete healthy diet.
Recall that the business community started talking about outdated standards of requirements after one cafe from the Anderson network was closed.
The business community demanded to cancel the existing SanPiNs, Rospotrebnadzor announced the joint development of new ones.
The list includes 33 departments.
Meanwhile, Rospotrebnadzor intends to reduce the number of sanitary norms and rules by 40 times by 2021.
Currently, investigators have information about three thefts, in which the detainee is involved.
A man was operating in the Skuratovsky microdistrict of Tula.
He stole batteries and radios from cars.
Of the two cars - VAZ-2106 and VAZ-2107 - the thief took away the batteries, presumably for the purpose of further sale.
“And from another VAZ-2107 car, for the same purpose, the attacker took the car radio and subwoofer,” the Ministry of Internal Affairs for the Tula region said.
The stolen attacker probably intended to resell.
Currently, a 26-year-old unemployed man has been detained.
Russians have nothing to save for their retirement - V. Matvienko
Federation Council Speaker Valentina Matviyenko believes that Russians do not have sufficient savings for the draft law on a guaranteed pension product to work in full force in the country.
The practice of increasing pensions through personal savings is quite common in the world.
Another thing is how timely its introduction is in our country.
&quot;In my opinion, now a significant part of the population has incomes, of which they simply have nothing to allocate to increase pensions in the future,&quot; V. Matvienko said.
The Russians, according to the speaker, cannot understand the mechanisms for the formation and calculation of pensions, since &quot;constant changes in this area have completely confused them.&quot;
The foregoing does not mean that I am against the improvement of the pension system and the legislation that regulates it.
&quot;Russia is a welfare state, and we must do everything to improve the size of pensions and the social security of citizens.
But steps in this direction must be thoughtful, responsible, taking into account domestic realities,&quot; V. Matviyenko told RIA Novosti.
The head of the Federation Council stressed that if this initiative (a bill on a guaranteed pension product) is developed, then several basic principles must be provided for, including voluntariness, tax preferences for citizens and employers, and strict guarantees and responsibility of the state for ensuring the safety of pension savings.
On September 6, the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation announced that it had sent a bill on a guaranteed pension product (GPP) for approval.
Among its main elements are an exclusively voluntary procedure for citizens to join the savings system, guaranteeing the safety of citizens&#39; long-term pension savings by the state, registration of citizens&#39; savings accounts by the central administrator, tax benefits for businesses and tax deductions for citizens.
Spider-Man remains in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
Sony and Disney agree
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The news of the departure of a beloved superhero from the Marvel Cinematic Universe has angered many loyal fans
One of the most famous comic book heroes, Spider-Man, will remain in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
Disney and Sony Pictures managed to negotiate the rights to use it in the films of the franchise.
This became known from a press release from Sony, which states that the third part of &quot;Spider-Man&quot; with Tom Holland will be released on July 16, 2021.
Earlier it was reported that Disney and Sony Pictures could not reach a consensus on the division of income, because of which &quot;Spider-Man&quot; will leave the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
Sony owns the movie rights.
She loaned them out to Marvel movies, which is owned by Disney.
As a result, Sony received income from box office revenue, and Disney - from souvenirs and toys.
As reported, at some point, this situation ceased to suit Disney, and the company wanted to revise the agreement.
Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige said he was delighted.
It&#39;s amazing that Spidey&#39;s [Spider-Man] journey in the MCU will continue.
&quot;All of us at Marvel Studios are very excited to be able to continue working on it.
Spider-Man is an iconic figure.
This is a hero whose story touches all generations and audiences around the world,&quot; he said in a press release.
At the same time, Feige recalled that Sony is also creating its own cinematic universe, built just around Spider-Man.
&quot;It so happens that he is the only superpowered hero who ended up in different MCUs.
So while Sony continues to develop its own Spidey universe, the future may bring unexpected surprises,&quot; he said.
Tom Holland, who played Spider-Man in five films, apparently commenting on the news, posted on his Instagram account an excerpt from the movie &quot;The Wolf of Wall Street&quot;, in which Leonardo DiCaprio&#39;s character screams &quot;I&#39;m not leaving!&quot;
Information about the contradictions between the companies appeared in August.
According to media reports, Disney wanted to receive half of the box office revenue from Spider-Man films on the condition that both companies would pay half of the cost of producing the films.
But that didn&#39;t sit well with Sony.
The news of the possible departure of a beloved superhero from the Marvel Cinematic Universe has angered many loyal fans.
Details of the new conditions have not yet been disclosed.
According to CNBC, Sony declined to comment on the agreement, but said, &quot;We&#39;ve worked together very well over the past four years, and our joint desire to continue working together was commensurate with the wishes of many [Spider-Man] fans.
We&#39;re glad we can move forward together.&quot;
The film &quot;Avengers: Endgame&quot;, which united Spider-Man, Thor, Hulk and other Marvel superheroes, became the highest grossing film in the history of world cinema, displacing &quot;Avatar&quot; from the first place.

The well-known blogger Andrei Poltava came with searches: what is known at the moment
On Friday, September 27, in Poltava, the house of relatives of volunteer and blogger Andrey Karpov, known as Andrey Poltava, is being searched.
This was announced by the blogger himself on Facebook, noting that he does not live at this address.

The second similar explosive device planted in the car will be detonated today near the house of the famous Ukrainian propagandist Andrey Anatolievich Karpov (also known as Andrey Poltava) ...
Death to the punishers.&quot;
Karpov believes that the Russian invaders do not like his activities as a volunteer, politician and blogger.
Poltava subscribers are sure that he makes the necessary transfers and wish him strength and perseverance.
Recall that Poltava is talking with the Russians about the war in the Donbass, the annexation of Crimea, peace, politics, and then uploads the video to the Internet.
The blogger ran for the Verkhovna Rada from the European Solidarity party.
Now he broadcasts on the channel &quot;Direct&quot;, where he harshly criticizes Russian propaganda.
In 2017, according to the ICTV channel, Karpov was recognized as the best blogger in Ukraine.

Chairman of the commission Anneli Ott noted that three hearings have been held in the commission so far.
Experts, entrepreneurs and representatives of the Ministry of the Environment presented their vision of achieving carbon neutrality in Estonia.

Riina Sikkut, deputy chairman of the commission, said that Estonia needs a clear plan for achieving climate goals, agreed with all stakeholders.
International agreements and the high cost of carbon dioxide emissions will be in any case.
“In addition to energy, the Riigikogu could focus on measures in agriculture, transport, forestry and housing within the framework of national discussions.
It is necessary to take into account the socio-economic impact of all changes,&quot; Sikkut stressed.
This autumn, the European Union Affairs Committee of the Riigikogu launched a series of parliamentary hearings to prepare a decision with which Estonia will take part in EU negotiations on climate targets for 2050.

Trade with Russia is not only about tanks
Trade turnover between Russia and India may double due to the geopolitical situation.
Manish Kumar, Deputy Director of the Confederation of Indian Industry, spoke about this at the 5th anniversary forum of small and medium-sized businesses in the regions of the SCO and BRICS member countries.
It is important for us to learn from the SCO and BRICS countries, including Russia, the guest from Delhi stressed.
- Our confederation has 9,000 direct members and 300,000 partner companies from 130 countries.
All this is small and medium business that cooperates with the countries of the Shanghai Organization.
And we are not standing still, but developing, and all these sanctions against Russia and the geopolitical situation in general only help us all to grow.
Now our bilateral trade exceeds 10 billion US dollars, but these figures can be doubled.
First of all, due to new technologies in the field of healthcare, artificial intelligence and robotics.
Our trade is not only tanks and heavy industry.
According to Manish Kumar, India has already established the first contacts with the modern centers of Russia.
Thus, a delegation from Delhi and other cities recently visited Skolkovo and Innopolis.
We signed a memorandum on the creation of systems in which it will be possible to build our modern business.
After all, entrepreneurship is not a whim, but a necessity.
We need a step towards economic well-being.
We need to expand, attract small and medium-sized businesses, and together with Russia, China and other countries, we will definitely do this, - the Indian industrialist emphasized.

Congress sees &quot;Russian trace&quot; in Trump&#39;s conversation with Zelensky
In the lower house of the US Congress, the Russian Federation was accused of involvement in the scandal caused by a telephone conversation between the head of the White House, Donald Trump, and Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky.

The White House had to provide congressmen and the public with a transcript of the scandalous conversation.

The expert told why you should give up tea bags
A team of scientists from Canada representing McGill University found that when a tea bag is brewed, more than ten billion microplastic particles enter a cup in five minutes.
Sawdust particles may also be added to the packaged drink, food safety expert Elizaveta Tikhonova told Nation News.
According to the agronomist, the consumer cannot get reliable information about the composition of tea bags - the manufacturer can add ingredients that will not be indicated on the package.
Sawdust at the end of the season is not thrown away, so they may end up in tea.
&quot;Moreover, tea bags do not always include exactly tea plants,&quot; Tikhonova said.
According to her, it is better to abandon the use of such a drink in favor of loose tea, which is sold in specialized stores.
In addition, she stressed that the danger of tea bags lies not only in the composition, but also in the method of its production - microparticles are heated to high temperatures, which can cause them to release harmful substances.
&quot;It is best to buy pure green or black tea - this drink will have the least additives,&quot; the expert said.

Regions were invited to share the secrets of business support
As it became known to &quot;Parliamentskaya Gazeta&quot;, on September 27, Chairman of the Federation Council Committee on Economic Policy Andrey Kutepov sent a letter to the Minister of Economic Development Maxim Oreshkin and Minister of Finance Anton Siluanov with a proposal to express their position on the initiatives of the subjects of the Federation to improve legislation in the field of supporting small and medium-sized businesses (SME).
It&#39;s time to establish inter-regional ties
The Federation Council Committee on Economic Policy summarized the information received from the regions on their business development programs and the legalization of the self-employed, as well as on the results of such programs.
In their letters, the regions told the senators about the problems of SME development and sent proposals for improving the current legislation.
&quot;Today, communication between the regions is not well established, as a result of which the entrepreneurial community in all regions visited by the senators raised the issue of the lack of information about regional programs for the development of entrepreneurship in the country as a whole,&quot; Andrey Kutepov stated.
In the annex to the letter, which was sent to the Government, he presented a set of positive developments of the regions on the legalization of self-employment and summary data from the regions with proposals and issues (available to the editors).
In addition to the relevant ministries, summary data from the regions was also sent to the heads of regional executive authorities.
The exchange of information on positively implemented developments in the regions could give impetus to the development of entrepreneurship in general.
The first step towards such an exchange will be the forwarding of the information available to the Committee on Economic Policy,&quot; the senator told Parlamentskaya Gazeta.
Useful experience
Today, in many regions of the country, programs to support small and medium-sized businesses have been adopted and are successfully operating.
For example, in the Vologda Oblast there is a Center for Entrepreneurship Support, which, in addition to financial support measures, assists businessmen in certification of finished products.
In the Ivanovo region, a business support system has been developed that provides for the implementation of the one-stop-shop principle through multifunctional centers.
In the Krasnodar Territory, start-up agricultural consumer cooperatives are provided with grants at the expense of the regional budget.
In the Oryol region there is a center for cluster development.
The Amur Region, within the framework of the federal project &quot;Acceleration of small and medium-sized businesses&quot;, provides for the possibility of subsidizing business incubators created on the basis of existing non-state co-working centers at the expense of the federal budget.
And in a number of other regions, special support measures are being taken for youth entrepreneurship.
The self-employed continue to be led out of the shadows
According to the regional authorities, in order to more effectively support small and medium-sized businesses, a number of changes should be made to the current legislation.
For example, the Arkhangelsk region proposed to replace the term &quot;self-employment&quot; with &quot;entrepreneurial activity&quot;, since this &quot;most corresponds to the content of the state service to promote the self-employment of unemployed citizens.&quot;
In the Ivanovo region, they consider it necessary to make amendments that provide for an expansion of the list of activities provided by self-employed citizens, including activities for finishing and repairing residential premises, summer cottages, and conducting physical training classes.
The Bryansk region considers it important to strengthen control over unscrupulous dairy producers with the help of the Mercury veterinary system.
And in the Kostroma and Magadan regions, they advocate fixing the concept of &quot;social entrepreneurship&quot; and areas of support for social entrepreneurship in the legal field.
All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of state programs to support small and medium-sized businesses, and the most important ones will be developed in the form of specific bills.
&quot;All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of state programs to support small and medium-sized businesses, and the most important ones will be developed in the form of specific bills,&quot; Andrey Kutepov assured.
The airline helped passengers avoid the neighborhood with crying children
Japan Airlines (JAL) has launched a new feature: when booking seats on an airplane, you can now find out where small children will sit.
Now, if desired, the neighborhood with them can be avoided.
Passengers of the Japanese airline Japan Airlines (JAL) were able to take advantage of a new option and avoid unwanted neighborhood with small children.
The airline has launched a feature that allows you to track where children will sit.
When selecting seats in the cabin during the booking process, passengers will be able to see a picture of a child&#39;s head in the seats occupied by children aged eight days to two years.
Thus, those who do not want to fly next to the babies due to the possible inconvenience associated with their crying can sit as far away from them as possible.
Internet users who use the airline&#39;s services were delighted with the innovation.
Some of them thanked the carrier, noting that other airlines should do the same.
One of the users complained that a few weeks ago he flew from New York to Doha, and three crying children were sitting next to him at once.
Another commenter suggested introducing &quot;flights only for adults&quot;, expressing a willingness to pay extra for such a flight.
Many tourists have noted that they will now try to always choose Japan Airlines for their movements, as they do not see anything pleasant in flying next to a crying baby in an enclosed space.
Previously, a woman traveling with a baby tried to appease fellow travelers during the Seoul-San Francisco flight.
She prepared for each of the 200 passengers a bag of sweets, each containing a note of apology.

Pavel Ustinov joined the pickets in support of the defendants in the &quot;Moscow case&quot;
Actor Pavel Ustinov has joined a series of single pickets &quot;Freedom to All&quot;, which are held on Friday in front of the presidential administration building on Staraya Square in Moscow, an Interfax correspondent reports.
A series of pickets began on September 18 in support of Ustinov himself and has continued every day since then.
At present, the protesters, replacing each other, are standing holding a poster with the inscription &quot;Freedom to all&quot; and the names of those convicted and arrested after unsanctioned rallies in Moscow in the summer of 2019.
In addition to Ustinov, on the poster are the names of Yegor Zhukov, Kirill Zhukov, Danil Beglets, Evgeny Kovalenko, Konstantin Kotov, Ivan Podkopaev, Aidar Gubaidulin, Alexei Minyailo, Sergei Fomin, Samariddin Radzhabov, Nikita Chirtsov, Eduard Malyshevsky, Vladislav Sinitsa.
On September 16, the Tverskoy Court of Moscow sentenced 24-year-old Ustinov to 3.5 years in a penal colony on charges of using violence against an OMON fighter of the Russian Guard at an unsanctioned rally on August 3 in the center of Moscow (part 2 of article 318 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation).
After that, on September 20, at the request of the Prosecutor General&#39;s Office, the court changed Ustinov&#39;s preventive measure from detention to a written undertaking not to leave.
Thus, the petition for the release of Ustinov gained more than 112 thousand signatures in a day.
Theater and film artists started a flash mob in support of their colleague.
To participate in a single picket in solidarity with the actor on September 18, a queue lined up on Staraya Square.
Human rights activists, journalists, scientists, teachers, doctors, Orthodox priests demanded a review of the case.

Deliveries of &quot;sanctions&quot; to Russia fell 100 times
The government of the Russian Federation has calculated that the supply of agricultural products and food to Russia from countries that fell under the Russian food embargo has decreased by more than 100 times since 2013.
According to the report sent to Russian President Vladimir Putin, in the first half of 2019, 31,000 tons of products were imported from the sanctioned countries against 3 million 442.2 thousand tons for the same period in 2013, Interfax reports.
At the same time, the cost of imported products decreased to $226.5 million from $4 billion 975.5 million, respectively.
We are talking about the supply of goods that did not fall under the embargo.
As indicated in the report, the dropped volumes of products prohibited for import were compensated for by increasing imports from the CIS countries, Africa, Southeast Asia, and Serbia.
Recall that at the end of August, the government extended until December 31, 2020 the validity of the rules for the destruction of agricultural products, raw materials and food, which are prohibited from being imported into Russia under counter-sanctions.
The document posted on the official portal of legal information noted that the validity of the rules was extended for another year - from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020.
Initially, the effect of the decision to destroy the sanction applied to products from the US, EU, Australia, Norway and Canada.
Later, from August 13, 2015, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland, Liechtenstein &quot;joined&quot; this list, from January 1, 2016 - Ukraine.
The decree signed by Putin on the destruction of illegally imported &quot;sanctions&quot; (products that fell under the food embargo that Moscow imposed in response to Western anti-Russian sanctions) entered into force in 2015.
In turn, the government allowed to destroy the &quot;sanctions&quot; food in any legal way.
As Western sanctions persist, Russia has also extended its retaliatory measures.
At the same time, this measure does not apply to products that citizens import for personal use.
The ban does not apply to the import of goods for personal consumption weighing up to 5 kilograms.
However, the head of the Council under the President of the Russian Federation for the development of civil society and human rights, Mikhail Fedotov, earlier called the destruction of food &quot;simply immoral&quot;, and this, according to him, negatively affects the education of people.
Moreover, the Rospotrebnadzor came up with the initiative to ban the destruction of food suitable for consumption in early June.
After that, a similar recommendation to the government was given by the Human Rights Council under the President of the Russian Federation.
And Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation Alexei Gordeev said that it is wrong to destroy food, and we need to think about how to use them for their intended purpose, assessing the quality.

Chile starts construction of €1bn telescope
This is reported by TASS with reference to the press service of the European Southern Observatory (ESO).
According to ESO, construction officially began this week on the dome of the building that will house the European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT), the most expensive and ambitious ground-based astronomical project so far.
Its total cost, according to ESO estimates, will exceed one billion euros.
Most of this money will be spent on the manufacture of equipment and the construction of the observatory building.
The most expensive and complex component of the telescope is its record-breaking large mirror, whose diameter will be about 39 meters.
It will be assembled from 798 hexagonal segments measuring 1.4 meters.
This huge mirror, as well as two auxiliary reflecting surfaces with a diameter of 4.2 and 3.75 meters, will help the E-ELT get the first detailed photographs of planets outside the solar system, stars in other galaxies, and also search for Earth&#39;s twins.
In addition, scientists will try to use this observatory to observe the vicinity of Sgr A*, the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way.
Despite the fact that the construction of the dome has just begun, scientists, engineers and other specialists have been developing mirrors, scientific instruments and other components of the observatory for three years - since the announcement of the first plans for the construction of the E-ELT.
The contract for the production of the main mirror, whose total cost was about 400 million euros, was awarded to the German company SCHOTT and the French company Safran Reosc.
