Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law introducing administrative liability for violating the terms and procedure for paying for goods (works, services) when making purchases for state and municipal needs.
This law is designed to solve a very acute problem of non-fulfillment of their obligations by customers in the implementation of state and municipal procurement.
Two years ago, the situation when entrepreneurs could not receive payment under already executed state and municipal contracts was widespread.
At the same time, the President of Russia instructed the General Prosecutor&#39;s Office of the Russian Federation to take the problem under special control.
Because the businessmen themselves could not cope with unscrupulous customers who entered into contracts that were not supported by financing, tried in every possible way to evade their payment obligations and included illegal conditions in the contracts.
The problem was systemic in the country as a whole.
Since 2015, in the interests of protecting the rights of entrepreneurs to receive payment under public orders, the prosecutor&#39;s office has made 9.7 thousand submissions, based on the results of their consideration, 4.5 thousand officials have been brought to disciplinary liability, 533 to administrative liability, to investigative bodies to organize procedural inspections, 75 materials were submitted, 46 of them criminal cases were initiated.
As a result, the debt to entrepreneurs in the amount of more than 66 billion rubles was repaid.
Moreover, these huge sums were not accumulated as a result of non-payment of multibillion-dollar contracts.
Numerous, systematic delays in paying services to entrepreneurs for much more modest amounts led to fabulous debts.
Here is a typical case.
The head of a small company won a competition for the provision of social transportation services for several million rubles.
The person invested all his working capital, fully fulfilled his obligations, but did not receive the due money on time.
The result is a growing financial lump of debts on salaries, taxes, loans, which would have led to bankruptcy if the entrepreneur had not turned to the prosecutor&#39;s office for help.
Now in a number of regions the problem has been maximally leveled.
Nevertheless, as of the first half of 2017, the total amount of debt under state and municipal contracts, identified by the prosecutors of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation, amounted to about 27.4 billion rubles.
In regions where debt indicators continue to reach critical values, the prosecutor&#39;s office works in manual anti-crisis management.
The Prosecutor General personally conducts field meetings with representatives of local authorities, at which all violations discovered by prosecutors and measures for their immediate elimination are substantively examined.
Such operational meetings have already been held in Yaroslavl and Yekaterinburg this year.
The implementation of Federal Law No. 189-FZ &quot;On Amending the Code of the Russian Federation on Administrative Offenses in the Part of Establishing Administrative Responsibility of the Customer&#39;s Officials for Violation of the Terms and Procedure for Payment for Goods (Works, Services) in Procurement to Ensure state and municipal needs&quot;, which was signed by the President of Russia last week.
The draft law was developed by the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia at the initiative of the Prosecutor General&#39;s Office.
The new law will supplement the Code of Administrative Offenses of the Russian Federation with an article that provides for a fine of 30,000 to 50,000 rubles for violation by an official of the customer of the deadline and procedure for paying for goods, works and services in state and municipal procurement.
And if an official has already been subjected to administrative punishment for a similar offense, then he will be disqualified for a period of one to two years.
All prosecutors of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation have already been instructed to ensure the application of these legislative novelties in practice.
Civil rights group issues travel alert in Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People issued a warning to people of color traveling to Missouri due to the state&#39;s discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
The group&#39;s statement reads: &quot;The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People&#39;s Travel Warning, effective through August 28, 2017, urges African-American travelers, visitors, and citizens of Missouri to be especially vigilant and exercise extra care when traveling within the state due to a number of questionable incidents on racist motives that have recently taken place throughout the state and are listed here.
According to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the group&#39;s movement alert was prompted by a recent law in Missouri that makes it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, as well as state law enforcement disproportionately targeting minorities. .
“Your people are subjected to human rights violations.
They are stopped on the roads because of the color of their skin, they are beaten and killed,” Rod Chapel, president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in Missouri, told the Kansas City Star newspaper.
&quot;We hear complaints more often than ever before.&quot;
This is the first warning of its kind issued by the organization to a US state.
The group cited incidents such as the racial humiliation of black students at the University of Missouri and the death of twenty-eight-year-old Tory Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in suspicious circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of gas while touring the state and the Missouri State Police arrested him without being charged with a crime.
The warning also cites a recent report from the Missouri Attorney General&#39;s Office that found black drivers were 75 percent more likely to be stopped on the road than white drivers.
&quot;The purpose of the warning is to keep people aware of the situation and warn their families and friends and colleagues about what might happen in Missouri,&quot; Chapel said.
&quot;People need to be prepared in one way or another whether they&#39;re taking bail money with them or telling relatives they&#39;re traveling across the state.&quot;
According to the latest figures from the FBI&#39;s Hate Crime Reporting Program, Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, making the state sixteenth in the state for hate crimes.
The travel warning is also in response to a new Missouri law that will make it harder to sue an entity for housing or employment discrimination.
Earlier, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued warnings to travelers in Texas and Arizona after those states enacted new immigration control laws that required local law enforcement to arrest people for violating immigration laws, which the ACLU said should increase the number of checks based on race.
Movement warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but recently community organizations have resorted to this measure in response to certain laws and trends within the US.
Two killed in shooting at police patrol in Egypt
Unknown people fired on a police patrol in the Egyptian city of Isna, Reuters reports citing the Egyptian Ministry of the Interior.
During the shootout, two people, including one policeman, were killed and three people were injured.
All the wounded were taken to the hospital.
According to the agency, the police stopped the car, after which two armed men in the car opened fire on law enforcement officers.
One of the attackers was detained, the second managed to escape.
Rostourism supports the law on the abolition of free baggage for non-refundable air tickets
The head of Rostourism, Oleg Safonov, said in an interview with RBC television that he was &quot;positive&quot; about the adoption of a law abolishing free baggage allowance for non-refundable air tickets.
“It is necessary to create conditions under which a person who does not have luggage can buy a ticket cheaper than one who has luggage,” he stressed (quoted by TASS).
At the same time, Mr. Safonov noted that, despite the fears of citizens, they would not have to pay for the transport of outerwear and a mobile phone in hand luggage.
&quot;It would be right to reassure all our citizens and tourists and declare this, say that it will not have anything to do with outerwear, an umbrella, a mobile phone, an iPad or even some kind of computer,&quot; the head of Rostourism said.
Earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law providing for the right of airlines to exclude the free baggage allowance for non-refundable tickets.
The point is that airlines can determine the number of pieces and weight of baggage included in the non-refundable fare.
Vladimir Putin instructed to eliminate pollution of Lake Baikal
Russian President Vladimir Putin at a meeting on the protection of Lake Baikal said that in recent years, significant areas of the lake have been subjected to extreme pollution.
He instructed to determine the sources of funding, plans and executors for the elimination of pollution.
Mr. Putin also instructed to carry out a full-fledged reclamation of the contaminated territories.
&quot;It is necessary to deal with the facilities that continue to work here, the treatment facilities of most of them are worn out,&quot; RIA Novosti quotes the president.
He also added that the Russian Prosecutor General&#39;s Office should conduct an audit to identify environmentally harmful activities.
According to him, there are problems in the lake area associated with the appearance of spontaneous dumps and a number of violations in the field of ecology by the organizers of the recreation.
&quot;I want to emphasize this: not everything is checked, here you also need to know the measure, but precisely - illegal and environmentally harmful activities and take appropriate measures,&quot; he stressed.
Earlier, the Prosecutor General&#39;s Office announced a reduction in fish stocks in Lake Baikal and proposed to increase the number of objects subject to environmental supervision.
Recall that on June 15, Vladimir Putin, during a direct line, announced the need to change legislation to ensure the rights of citizens living in natural areas of a special protection regime.
The residents of Olkhon Island, which is part of the Baikal Natural Territory, told him about problems with the conduct of economic activities.
The head of the Ministry of Natural Resources, Sergei Donskoy, immediately proposed to solve the problem by clarifying the boundaries of the Baikal water protection zone, but the government of Buryatia reminded that such a change is not enough, since the restrictions are associated with a number of regulations.
Earlier, the Ministry of Economy proposed to solve the problem by changing the Land Code and the law on environmental protection.
A new temple will appear in Ugra
In the village of Sosva, members of the Rakhtynya community of indigenous peoples of the North, together with residents of the Berezovsky district, are taking part in the construction of an Orthodox church in honor of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker.
Its location is the river bank, the temple will be clearly visible from afar, so it will serve as a beacon for the fishermen.
According to representatives of the community, construction work will be completed this year, domes have been installed, and church bells are available.
Igrimskaya EW Fleet provided transport support.
The temple is named after St. Nicholas the Wonderworker, since he is revered by the Orthodox Church as the patron of travelers, including fishermen.
In Sosva, however, fishing gives the settlers work and feeds them.
Locals are waiting for the temple to open its doors, and children even write in school essays about it as a local landmark.
Disneyland with the death penalty.
Why are laws enforced in Singapore?
I&#39;m talking to local businessman Chang while I&#39;m sitting at an outdoor diner.
Commenting on the situation in Singapore, Chang smokes one cigarette after another, while carefully storing the cigarette butts in an iron box taken with him from the office.
After the end of the conversation, the businessman goes to the nearest urn - a hundred meters from it - and throws the bulls into it.
The fine for littering in a public place is 500 local dollars, Chung says.
You know, since childhood, I just developed a reflex: you can’t throw a candy wrapper on the pavement, you’ll be fined instantly.
Now there are video cameras everywhere.
And indeed - the sidewalks of Singapore in the city center are clean, like in a museum.
Chang says that three months ago, his neighbor&#39;s 18-year-old son graffitied the wall of an old colonial building.
The court found the guy guilty of vandalism and sentenced him to flogging.
What?!
Imagine.
He received ten blows to the buttocks with a wooden stick and spent a week in prison.
In general, corporal punishment is not uncommon.
How the highest standard of living and incredibly harsh laws are combined in Singapore, the AiF observer figured out on the spot.
Here, no one thinks of abolishing the death penalty, - explains lawyer Victor Li Hong.
And the government has long spit on the opinion of both the European Union and the United States on this matter.
If a person transports a large consignment of drugs or sells them, he is entitled to the gallows.
In 2002, a 22-year-old Australian citizen was detained at Changi Airport: he was carrying 400 grams of cocaine with him.
The Australian Prime Minister came to his defense, threatening sanctions, international human rights activists and even the Pope.
However, the guy was eventually hanged anyway.
After that, drug couriers diligently go around our country.
The point is this: in Singapore it is supposed that EVERYONE must comply with the laws, and not just modest and poor people.
It doesn&#39;t matter who you are - a millionaire, vice-premier, famous artist or a resident of the European Union.
There is only one option in this case: if they find a pound of cocaine on you, you will be hanged.
When you walk around Singapore and everywhere you meet signs with a bunch of warnings, you simply wonder how many prohibitions there are in this city-state!
For example, chewing gum is sold only in pharmacies, and you can buy it strictly by prescription (!) Of a doctor.
The gum will not be taken away from the tourist upon arrival, but it is worth sticking a &quot;gum&quot; in the subway, they will impose a fine of 1 thousand local dollars.
In four days, I met two people with white signs around their necks: &quot;I littered.&quot;
For a cigarette butt thrown past the urn, in addition to a fine, they are often sentenced to &quot;link to the janitors&quot;: they clean up parks and beaches for a week.
6 thousand rubles the &quot;criminal&quot; who forgot to flush the water in the public toilet pays, and when trying to relieve himself of a small need in the elevator of a residential building, a special detector is triggered - the doors are blocked and a signal is sent to the police.
Among the completely exotic laws are bans on feeding pigeons on the street, public performance of songs and even excessive watering of a houseplant (!): It is believed that the abundance of water attracts mosquitoes.
To avoid fires, smokers cannot carry lighters on the subway, otherwise they will be fined 5 thousand Singapore dollars.
In general, the thought appears: no matter how hard you try, you will definitely break something.
This is not so at all, - Mohammed Kabir-Kajaria, the owner of a local travel agency, is trying to dissuade me.
Particularly fantastic laws exist only on paper, and over the past twenty years I have not seen anyone prosecuted for violating them.
Why are they saved?
So that citizens do not relax.
Compliance with the basic rules is strictly monitored.
For example, if a minor is sold cigarettes in a kiosk, then everyone along the chain will be punished: the owner of the store will pay a huge amount, the violator himself will receive blows on the &quot;back&quot; with sticks, and the seller will also be whipped and sent to prison.
It is thanks to such harsh laws that offenses in Singapore are very rare.
Is it justified?
Back in the seventies, we had chaos on the roads - motorists ignored traffic lights, drove as they wanted, got behind the wheel drunk.
After the introduction of fines for the year, everything calmed down.
Now the driver, having drunk a portion of whiskey, knows: if they stop, the policeman will not let him go for a bribe, they will impose a fine in the amount of the cost of the apartment and send him to jail for years.
To many foreigners, the city-state in Southeast Asia seems like a kind of concentration camp.
In 1993, the American writer William Gibson called Singapore &quot;Disneyland with the death penalty&quot; - a visitor from the United States was horrified by the general wealth of the inhabitants, &quot;a frighteningly clean airport&quot; and &quot;cultivated nature.&quot;
They say that such things are unnatural, they look artificial, and in principle this should not be so.
The first days in Singapore and you are truly afraid to throw a piece of paper on the sidewalk, you remember if you went to the subway with ice cream.
But then you come to the &quot;Little India&quot; area, and suddenly there is a &quot;break in the pattern&quot;: plastic cups are lying around the bus stop.
&quot;How is it?&quot; - you are surprised.
And so, Singaporeans grin.
Anything happens.
Not every such &quot;crime&quot; will be caught on the spot, but you should know: if you are found out, you will not excuse yourself - after all, you have violated the law.
Most often, this is enough for a person to behave normally.
Of course, the government in Singapore is quite authoritarian.
But you know what?
In Vietnamese Ho Chi Minh City, I moved very carefully - motorcyclists often snatch smartphones and cameras from the hands of tourists.
The center of Paris is full of dirty homeless people and beggars.
On our streets, too, not everyone tries to throw garbage into the bins.
Singapore, thanks to a set of draconian fines and ruthless (up to the death penalty) laws, has become the calmest, cleanest and safest city on Earth.
Think about it.
Such is human nature: remember, in Russia, no one was wearing seat belts while driving until they began to fine.
Although the main thing in Singapore is not fines, but voluntary compliance with laws.
And one must think that in Russia, people would also be happy with clean streets, the absence of garbage in the subway and would welcome the arrest of those who confuse an elevator with a public toilet.
Here is corporal punishment - thank you, no need.
Otherwise, the laws of Singapore are at least worth looking at.
Nothing sacred?
Now the Trump White House has set its sights on the Statue of Liberty.
The surest sign of a regime change is when he starts fighting the statues.
Americans understand this as well as anyone else - hence the deliberately theatrical demolition of Saddam Hussein&#39;s statue in Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the Trump administration&#39;s key ideologues, no doubt knew what he was doing when he raised the symbolic ax over the Statue of Liberty during a heated argument with CNN journalist Jim Acosta about the president&#39;s proposals to drastically reduce legal immigration.
Let&#39;s be honest, Miller didn&#39;t attack the statue itself.
Hordes of pleasure boat owners and Statue of Liberty performers would lynch him if he tried.
But he attacked its meaning, and especially the meaning that was attributed to it in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, when poems by Emma Lazarus were added to the pedestal.
As Miller grumbled at Acosta: “I don’t want to go deep into history here, but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem you are referring to was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty.&quot;
Miller got the facts right, but as he himself said, it&#39;s not really about history.
This is about the current sound of the startling words of Lazarus, the only ones in which the state does not invite any immigrants, but the poorest: &quot;Your tired, your poor, / your crowds dreaming of breathing freely, / The unfortunate dregs of your abundant shores.&quot;
Never before have &quot;unfortunate scum&quot; been so visible on our screens.
Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not expected in America.
This dispute over the meaning of the statue is part of a larger political and cultural war: it is indeed a dispute over the meaning of America.
Lazarus - and her friends, who fought to place her words on the statue&#39;s plinth after her death - knew very well that they were committing an entirely political act.
The sculpture was supposed to mark the connection between the French and American republics with the help of a banal classical figure - the female image of Liberty.
Lazarus changed its meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract, she has a voice.
And she received a completely different name: Mother of the Exiles.
The combination of poem and image was a brilliant feminist move and a crushing attack against American nativism.
And as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, right though change it back.
The vociferous Rush Limbaugh, the sort of John the Baptist who heralded the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that Liberty invites no one, rather it is an early neocon bringing the flame of America to a world lying in darkness: “Liberty marches forward.
She carries the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not needed to light the way to the USA.&quot;
Against his wont, Limbaugh really hit the spot here.
The meaning of the statue depends solely on the angle of view.
It was Lazarus&#39; great creative achievement to see her the way haggard, unhappy, but hopeful people on the decks of ships after a long and often difficult voyage would see her.
It means literally looking at the world through the eyes of people who are looking for shelter and a chance at a better life.
Her statue answers them with words of hope and hospitality that they long to hear.
And, of course, this is not a prospect that Miller and Trump will ever want to acknowledge.
Their torch is needed not to light the way, but to kindle hatred, which is the only source of their strength.
2017 World Cup: Neil Blake praises the Scottish members of Team GB.
Eilid Doyle recalls the time when there were only two Scots in the Great Britain team
Neil Blake, UK Athletics director of play, said the 16-man Scottish squad at the World Championships will make a &quot;significant contribution to the team&#39;s performance&quot;.
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for the 2017 London Championships starting on Friday.
Blake believes that &quot;something special is being born&quot; in Scotland and the British Athletics Federation should take this into account.
&quot;We know that and we&#39;re trying to understand and will support them as long as they have the potential,&quot; Blake said.
“I have spoken to people at the Sport Institute of Scotland and they think it has something to do with what they have done.
The Scottish Athletics Federation thinks that what they have done needs to be worked on.
British Athletics: What they&#39;ve done needs to be worked on.
And people on the street think the same way.
I don&#39;t know why the circumstances are this way, but it&#39;s absolutely brilliant.&quot;
Some of the Scottish athletes are up for medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Bachert - who will take on Sir Mo Farah in the 5000m; and Eilid Doyle was chosen by the team as their captain.
&quot;Eilid is modest.
Her captain&#39;s speech was great,&quot; says Blake.
“Many athletes, whether they are Scottish or not and where they live or train, have walked out of this room feeling proud and determined to win.
The passion and sincere feelings that Eilid put into her were wonderful.&quot;
The Commonwealth silver medalist, who will run the 400m hurdles at her fifth World Championships, says 16 Scots on the British team is &#39;incredible&#39;.
The previous record for most Scots in the World Cup was seven, in 1983 and 2005.
Leading the way is Laura Muir, a middle-distance racer who broke five British and two European records last year.
She will run 1500 and 5000 meters.
Chris O&#39;Hare, who will be running the 1500m, is another Scot to watch out for, having had a strong season behind him, including victories in the British Team Qualifiers and at the Annual.
Doyle reminisces about her first World Cup when, besides her, the only Scot on the team was Leigh McConnell.
The team captain says she is &quot;incredibly proud&quot; that so many of her compatriots are not only on the team, but in some cases will qualify for medals and compete for the finals.
&quot;The captain of the national team is chosen by the other members of the team, so it was a huge honor anyway, but to know that your comrades voted for you and you were chosen is a very special thing for me,&quot; she added.
“Of course, I am very proud of all the Scots who have made it to the national team.
This shows how much we have achieved.
And they are all accomplished athletes who will strive to get on the podium.
And what about my captain&#39;s speech?
Yes, I think she was good.
I just noticed that we were very lucky to host the World Cup at home.
So it&#39;s just about how important it is to get support from the fans and take advantage of the fact that we will be back at the Olympic Stadium.
I got another chance to enter his arena and take part in competitions, and the atmosphere there will be just wonderful.&quot;
Blocking critics on Facebook: Don&#39;t run for public office if you&#39;re not ready to listen to criticism from voters
The founder of our country understood what the critical press was.
Americans loved George Washington, but that didn&#39;t stop them from criticizing him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
Criticism, of course, irritated him.
But he did not silence his critics.
Because back in 1783, Washington said: &quot;You can take away the freedom of speech and we, deaf and dumb, will be led like sheep to the slaughter.&quot;
I now turn to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who should try to be more like Washington.
Hogan&#39;s subordinates blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And this week, the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for it.
The governor&#39;s subordinates called this suit null and void, and the comment on the Internet was written in the spirit of &quot;so what.&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s just Facebook,&quot; many will say.
But this is also important.
And that&#39;s especially important when it comes to a guy like Hogan.
He&#39;s a remarkably popular Republican governor in a predominantly Democratic state.
He is in second place in the approval rating among the 50 governors of the country.
Hogan is not a hardened reactionary.
He has demonstrated a firm hand in the management of the state and a commitment to his principles.
He also deftly uses Facebook as a primary way to connect with his constituents and jokingly shows off his chemo-bald head on his page.
Therefore, blocking people who come to the governor&#39;s page - which is billed as an official public forum and run by administration officials with taxpayer money - is unnecessary and ultimately harmful.
In an interview with The Washington Post, spokeswoman Amelia Ches defended the governor&#39;s actions, arguing that blocking comments was simply moderation.
But it&#39;s too easy to use the image of trolls, spammers and haters who are vicious on the Internet.
The Post spoke to some of the real people Hogan blocked.
And these are real people, not trolls - a teacher, a businessman, a pastor who are talking to their elected leaders.
They all say their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and not rude.
The pastor quoted the Bible, referring to the fact that Hogan is a Catholic.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramana of Bowie, Maryland, did not express hate but asked about the hate crimes.
&quot;I wrote a polite comment that I was disappointed by his lack of response to hate crimes and other recent news,&quot; she wrote in the comments section of the Post article.
&quot;I also don&#39;t like the idea that when a lot of people leave comments on the same topic, some immediately say that this is a so-called cheat, instead of admitting that they are dealing with a large group of disgruntled citizens.&quot;
What the governor&#39;s subordinates call a &quot;concentrated spam attack&quot; others would probably call &quot;an active lifestyle.&quot;
In the era of Facebook, it&#39;s easy to edit your image by simply blocking critics or deleting negative comments.
It&#39;s a much less dusty job than it used to be, when it required sending people in, collecting and burning newspapers with critical editorials, or arresting and gagging protesters.
But this is exactly what is happening now, only in numbers.
Haugen is not the first official to be criticized for not wanting to listen to Facebook and other social media.
President Trump has been sued by Twitter users who have been banned from his Twitter account.
One of the first, pivotal decisions on this topic was made this week in Virginia.
According to U.S. District Judge James C. Casheris of Alexandria, the Chair of the Loudon County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment by banning the voter from her Facebook account.
And in Kentucky, Republican Gov. Matt Bevin was sued by the American Civil Liberties Union for his behavior on Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn&#39;t be that hard.
During the Washington era, the era of affordable postage was about as revolutionous as the Internet is today.
From 1776 to 1800 the number of newspapers quadrupled, and the writers of anonymous letters severely undermined his authority.
And even then, Washington was dealing with anonymous trolls.
People under the pseudonyms &quot;Juricola&quot;, &quot;Valerius&quot;, &quot;Belizarius&quot; and &quot;Porcius&quot; wrote letters to newspapers ridiculing Washington&#39;s decision.
According to historical documents compiled by the George Washington Papers online project, his office was inundated with petitions attacking his position on the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation.
But he didn&#39;t try to silence them.
Freedom of speech, dissent and speech lies at the very foundation of our state.
And true leadership means going along with it.
Ronan Rafferty looks forward to home comforts at the Renaissance Club
Former European champion Ronan Rafferty is looking forward to home comforts over the next three days when the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the twenty-fifth Scottish Open Senior Golf Tournament.
The Northern Irish native, who led the neighborhood at Archerfield Links and moved towards the final round last year before losing to Paul Eales, is attached to the new seat and serves as the tournament spokesperson on behalf of the club&#39;s founder and director Gerry Sarwady.
&quot;I&#39;ve seen the Renaissance Club build and we&#39;re watching it grow to success with this event,&quot; Rafferty said.
“The players will see this field at its best, it is in excellent condition.
Jerry did a great job setting up this place.
He is an ardent supporter of this game and is proud of his achievements here.
It&#39;s a great demonstration for this field.&quot;
Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending his first title despite winning both the European Tournament and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
&quot;It&#39;s a really special feeling,&quot; said the Southport player.
“I didn&#39;t get to try to win the Extremadura Open again because it was taken off the schedule a year after I won it.
To return to this corner of the world is magical.
This is a great place to play golf.
The memories of last year are coming back and it was a very special experience for me and my wife Sharon to win last year.
It was a really special time and we will always remember it.&quot;
Returning to action on home soil is Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tournament after turning 50 earlier this year.
The event will be his first public appearance in Scotland since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
&quot;When you play at home, it&#39;s always a little more important,&quot; Helensboro resident Orr said.
&quot;You want to do well, but you feel that extra burden.&quot;
I played again with great pleasure and I showed good golf.
I&#39;m happy with how it&#39;s turned out so far.&quot;
joining the trio on the field are former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and Senior Senior Major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are two of six Scots on the pitch; the rest are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Participation in the tournament is free, and parking costs 5 pounds per hour if there is one person in the car, and 10 pounds if there are two or more people.
All proceeds go to the British Prostate Cancer Foundation.
British roads will learn to absorb harmful emissions
Peculiar tunnels over highways, capable of absorbing carbon monoxide emitted by cars, are already being tested on UK roads.
The country&#39;s transport agency, according to Autocar, reported positive test results of a 100-meter tunnel installed on one of the highways in the north of the country.
The 6-meter-high tunnel is built from some of the latest polymeric materials that are capable of absorbing harmful substances contained in car exhaust.
However, the creation of a whole network of such tunnels is only part of the large-scale measures that the UK authorities are going to take to improve the atmosphere.
In addition to the tunnel network, the British are going to expand the network of charging stations for electric vehicles, implement a number of measures to reduce traffic on the roads, expand the use of electric commercial vehicles and modernize the fleet of heavy trucks.
According to official statistics, a quarter of all air pollution comes from transport, and poor air quality causes up to 40,000 premature deaths per year.
The Moscow City Court changed the punishment for disabled Mamaev to a fine
The Moscow City Court changed the punishment for disabled Anton Mamaev, who was sentenced to four and a half years in prison, to a fine of 200 thousand rubles.
It is reported by TASS.
Earlier, the prosecutor&#39;s office asked the court to replace the term with a suspended sentence, explaining its request by the fact that Mamaev&#39;s illness &quot;prevents him from being in prison.&quot;
28-year-old Anton Mamaev was sentenced to four and a half years in prison in a penal colony for robbery, the victim of which was a former special forces soldier.
On July 19, the court released the man from custody at an offsite hearing in the pre-trial detention center.
Poverty and death in the Indonesian &quot;golden land&quot;
When preparing dinner, Bardina Degei does not use the stove.
She rarely even uses the potty.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Panyai district in the rebellious Indonesian province of Papua, a housewife usually just places a sweet potato, locally called &quot;nota&quot;, right on the hearth.
Half an hour later, the charred tuber is taken out and eaten with impatient, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the dirt floor - she has no furniture - and it is here that she does her chores, such as washing clothes with muddy water from a nearby swamp.
The latrine is a bucket in a room without a roof.
She is the youngest of her husband&#39;s four wives and therefore was not assigned to work in the fields.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: many of the men in this village are unemployed, many drink, and there are soldiers.
“No one dares to walk around the village after five in the evening,” she says.
This is a rare glimpse into daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was annexed to Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum in which only 1,026 elders were forced to vote by raising their hands in public in front of the occupying troops.
The existing independence movement from the Netherlands has quickly turned its ire against the Jakarta government, which maintains tight control over the region, keeping out foreign journalists and human rights activists.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent state of Papua New Guinea occupying the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is a city as remote as it is abandoned; the road here includes an hour and a half flight from Jayapura, the capital of the province, to Nabire, and then a five-hour jogging in a hired car.
There is no public transport here.
The city, with a population of about 19,000, consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences; the corrugated steel roofs are rust-painted in a variety of reddish hues.
Few Indonesians made it here, let alone journalists, and almost none of the foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, the Mee Pagos of Papuans worshiped a god named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes as well.
“It was strange for us to wear these clothes,” says Degei, pointing to his bright, hand-woven turban, dark skirt and bright shirt.
“We used to wear only leaves on our bodies.”
Papua is Indonesia&#39;s poorest province, with 28% of its population living below the poverty line, and child mortality and literacy rates among the worst in Asia.
But it is also the Indonesian land of gold.
The world&#39;s largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Phoenix-based Freeport McMoran, is only sixty miles from Paniai, a highland province roughly the size of New Jersey and home to 153,000 people.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined about $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper here.
In addition, Papua boasts forest reserves valued at $78 billion.
These riches, however, bring one misfortune to the Papuans, ensuring that the mighty Indonesian military maintains a stifling presence here.
Between 1998 and 2004, Freeport paid local military personnel and units nearly $20 million, including up to $150,000 to one officer, according to a 2005 New York Times investigation.
Demands for greater autonomy on the part of the Papuans threaten the existence of this gold mine and are ruthlessly suppressed.
More than 500,000 Papuans have been killed by Indonesian military forces since 1969, according to human rights activists, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, massacres in the indigenous highlands of Papua in the 1970s can be considered genocide.
Last year alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region.
&quot;We will lose everything,&quot; a report published in 2016 by the Diocese of Brisbane contains testimonies of atrocities committed in the previous year, such as summary executions, torture - rape and electric shocks are particularly frequent, another report alleges - and brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations.
&quot;It&#39;s hard to count the number of casualties because incidents happen every week,&quot; says Andreas Harsono, a researcher in Indonesia for Human Rights Watch.
The nuts were tightened as Papua&#39;s resources attracted an influx of migrants from other parts of Indonesia.
The province&#39;s population of 3.5 million is 83% Christian, but demographics are shifting as Muslim economic migrants arrive from the densely populated Indonesian islands of Java, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese stalls, &quot;warungs,&quot; sell fried chicken and &quot;gado-gado&quot; mixed vegetables served with peanut sauce.
Local residents are trying to withstand the competition.
“The migrants started selling chicken and vegetables at the traditional market for less than the natives of Papua,” explains Abet Yow, a 24-year-old Panyai native who moved to Jayapura, the provincial capital, for work.
&quot;Because of this, the indigenous people of Papua - the mother-mother (women) of Papua - have lost their market.&quot;
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, vowed to address inequality and rights abuses in Papua during his 2014 presidential campaign.
On his way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta, the former carpenter enlisted the support of 27 of Papua&#39;s 29 districts, including Paniai.
But little has changed in Papua, and the locals feel betrayed.
“Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014, expecting him to fulfill our hopes for justice,” Yow says.
In reality, just two months after the October inauguration, Jokowi Paniai experienced a tragedy.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were outside singing Christmas carols around a campfire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers on a motorcycle burst out of the darkness.
The frightened children told them that they should turn on the headlights.
According to local pastor Jawedt Tebay, one of the soldiers was offended by their tone and after a while returned with four soldiers.
According to the victims and eyewitnesses, the soldiers, who were drunk, chased the children and beat them with rifle butts.
Then one of the soldiers fired at a group of children.
One child, sixteen-year-old Julianus Eimo, was beaten so badly that he fell into a coma.
A couple of hours later, someone set fire to a nearby government election commission building, and the situation escalated the next day.
About a thousand Papuan men, women and children gathered on the football field in front of the local police station and military command center to demand justice.
They brought ritual hunting bows with them and performed the vaita, the dance of the Papuan mee pago tribe: they ran in circles and imitated bird singing.
Some protesters started throwing stones at the police station and the military base.
As the situation escalated, the order was given to the soldiers via intercom: &quot;If the crowd resists more than three times, shoot them,&quot; according to an official document seen by TIME magazine, but not published in local media.
Fifty-six-year-old Eremias Kayame, head of the Kyogo Koto district in Enarotali, sensed the approach of danger and called for calm, asking the crowd to go home.
Nobody wanted to listen to him.
“As I turned around, my left wrist was suddenly hit by a bullet,” he told TIME magazine, standing on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn&#39;t know who fired the shot, but says that the bullet came from the direction of the ranks of the assembled soldiers.
“There was a crowd, there were a lot of shots,” he adds.
Local resident Alfius Yove was hit three times, according to his cousin who witnessed the shooting.
&quot;I ran up to him and looked at his body to make sure it was him,&quot; Yohanes, who like many Indonesians only goes by one name, told TIME grimly.
&quot;I saw that he was dead... I kissed him.&quot;
General Yotje Mende, Papua Police Chief Inspector, told reporters that his officers were only &quot;protecting&quot; their base because it was under attack.
“We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us,” Papua police spokesman Commissioner Pujo Sulistiyo said in 2015.
&quot;It&#39;s a matter of life and death.&quot;
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more were injured.
News of the killings did not reach Jakarta until the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi delivered an impassioned speech in Jayapura, expressing condolences to the families of the victims and vowing to address the issue of historic abuses of power in Papua.
“I want this situation to be resolved immediately so that it never happens again in the future,” he said.
In October 2016, Security Minister Wiranto said he would establish a non-judicial organization to end historic human rights violations.
But almost immediately there were excuses.
“Most of the violations happened long ago.
Some of them took place in the nineties or early zero.
The fact is that we certainly want to deal with these violations, but there are procedures that need to be passed,” he said.
Wiranto then retracted his words when speaking to TIME magazine on June 5 in Jakarta and said he had no plans to establish an organization to deal with complaints in Papua.
Instead, he said: &quot;Everything will be decided through the courts.&quot;
Wiranto, who was accused by the United Nations of &quot;crimes against humanity&quot; in connection with the death of more than 1,000 people during the bloody vote for the independence of East Timor in 1999, said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua had already been resolved, including the incident in Paniai.
The families of the victims in Paniai greeted such statements with grim disbelief.
“In the past three years, I have been asked four times, but there has been absolutely no change,” Johanes says.
&quot;I&#39;m tired&quot;.
He says he still lives in fear years later.
“I&#39;m scared,” he says.
“I am afraid that the military will arrest me, I am afraid that they will shoot me.”
His brother Jacobus also expressed the opinion that the inhabitants of Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four victims.
“After we buried the bodies, the military came for me,” he says.
The shooting didn&#39;t stop.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police fired on villagers in the neighboring Deiyai district of Panyai.
A clash between villagers and a construction company manager who refused to help take the unconscious man to the hospital left one person dead and 17 others injured, including children.
A man, twenty-four-year-old Ravianus Dove, who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on the way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested in front of the construction site office owned by the company.
The villagers hurled stones at the officers, who fired warning shots in response, police said.
But local residents claim that a mobile brigade (Indonesian special forces) began shooting at the crowd and killed one person.
&quot;We were in such a panic, we are afraid of retribution,&quot; Dominggu Badii, 29, who lives near the hospital and saw the wounded being rushed in, told TIME magazine.
&quot;I hid in my house for two days.&quot;
The Deiyai Parliament demanded that the officers involved in the incident be called to account and that the mobile police brigade be withdrawn from the region.
Paniyai has always been a sore spot for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development has angered the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes scattered throughout Papua&#39;s verdant central highlands.
Many have joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), a rebel army that claims to protect the rights of the Papuans by staging sporadic attacks and kidnappings against Indonesian soldiers.
Some of OPM&#39;s top leaders come from Paniai, including Thadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, thousands of people have been arrested and groundlessly detained by the military in recent years in Paniai under the pretext of &quot;defending national independence&quot;.
Some never returned.
Among the people of Papua, Paniai is considered a &quot;sad, forgotten place&quot;.
Poverty increases discontent.
The small portion of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for the locals.
Bread is equally inaccessible.
People here grow everything they eat: mainly nota, but also some fruits and leafy vegetables.
Farming is the work of women, each of whom can tend four to five fields of sweet potatoes.
They usually keep most of the crop for the family and the rest is sold at the local market.
Ten nota tubers cost only IDR 10,000 (75 cents).
Over time, the economic disparity between the native Papuans and new migrants increased, who arrived in large numbers after the introduction of new flights to Nabire airport.
The few existing vacancies usually go to more educated and wealthy migrants.
The Papuans rarely have the money or the necessary skills to run their own competitive businesses.
“Young people don&#39;t want to stay in the village ... because there is no work or money here,” says John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai tribal council.
Isolation keeps Papua off the radar of the rest of the world.
In addition, restrictions on the work of international media remain tight.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudi and Basile Longchamp were deported from Papua for &quot;lack of coordination with relevant organizations&quot; despite being given rare filming permits.
Phelim Kine, deputy director for Asia at Human Rights Watch, said promises made during Jokowi&#39;s campaign to lift media restrictions to promote transparency and development have not been kept.
&quot;Now foreign journalists trying to report from the rebellious eastern Indonesian provinces, Papua and West Papua face new dangers: visa denials and blacklisting,&quot; he said in a statement.
The lack of media attention means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is mostly limited to Papua&#39;s immediate neighbors.
In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - asked the UN Human Rights Council to investigate &quot;diverse and widespread violations&quot; in Papua, including the shooting in Panyai.
The same countries have supported OPM in the past.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arramanata Nasir brushed aside the group&#39;s claim, telling reporters in Jakarta that &quot;Indonesia still has a democratic system and a free press, so hiding evidence of episodes of human rights violations would be difficult.&quot;
The locals want more foreign governments to pay attention to the situation.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by Dutch Human Rights Ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, the locals broke their silence, pleading, &quot;We want freedom,&quot; according to a source who also attended the meeting but wished to remain anonymous.
Indonesia will hold new presidential elections in 2019, but the Papuans say they are unlikely to vote for Jokowi again.
“Jokowi is a man with good intentions, but he is surrounded by people involved in the Paniai shooting,” said Gobai, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the people of Paniai, in addition to living in the shadow of a threat from a greedy army, are mired in poverty, and their education and health care is in a miserable state.
Gobai says that the inhabitants of Paniai, like other Papuans, consider their vote given to Jokovi as a debt that he must pay.
&quot;They don&#39;t want money, they just want justice,&quot; he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Paniai shooting carried out one last symbolic act of defiance: they buried the body of one of the victims on a piece of land directly opposite the police and military station.
Knowing that justice will probably never prevail, they will at least not let the guilty forget their crimes.
“They killed a member of our family,” Jacobus says without looking up.
&quot;What else were we supposed to do?&quot;
Fire engulfs Dubai&#39;s Torch skyscraper for the second time
A fire engulfed one of the world&#39;s tallest residential skyscrapers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to flee the 337-metre-tall, 79-story structure.
This is the second fire to sweep through the high-rise building - coincidentally called The Torch - in two years.
The building was evacuated, no casualties were reported, and there was no operational news on the cause of the fire.
“We slept and woke up from the fire alarm and the screams of people.
We ran down the stairs and it took us about ten minutes to get down from the fiftieth floor,&quot; a skyscraper resident who identified himself as George told Reuters.
Fire brigades extinguished the fire at approximately 4:00 local time (00:00 GMT) and cooled the building, the Dubai Civil Defense Authority said.
The government said it was working to provide shelter for the victims.
The incident could bring the safety of materials used in high-rise building exteriors around the world back onto the agenda.
During the investigation by the Fakel administration after the fire there in 2015, it turned out that the cladding, the external panels used for decoration and insulation, suffered the most damage.
In the United Kingdom, police said they believe the insulation system and cladding at London&#39;s Grenfell Tower may have accelerated the spread of a fire there in June that killed about 80 people.
The growth of the tourist flow in Ida-Viru County was minimal in June
According to the data obtained by the correspondent of the portal rus.err.ee from the Department of Statistics, in June 2017, a total of 20,519 local and foreign tourists used the services of hotel companies in the Northeast, which is 125 people or 0.6% more than in the same period a year earlier.
At the same time, the number of local tourists has decreased, while the number of foreign tourists has increased.
Thus, the foreign tourist flow increased in June by 7.3% (544 people) to 7994 tourists.
And the number of local tourists decreased by 3.2% from 12,944 to 12,525 people.
The most noticeable increase in the region was the number of Russian tourists - by 8.9% or 318 people compared to June 2016.
In total, in June 2017, 3,885 guests from the Russian Federation stayed overnight in hotels in Ida-Virumaa.
Andrey Malakhov made it clear to fans who is to blame for his departure
Andrey Malakhov hinted to his fans on Instagram who is to blame for his departure from Channel One.
So far, he has not commented on the rumors in any way, but today he posted a fragment of an article in the Vedomosti newspaper for August 1.
Photo Malakhov signed the tag &quot;boss baby&quot;.
An article on how to prevent &quot;burnout&quot; of an employee and pay attention to his condition.
If we recall the numerous reports that the presenter could not find a common language with the newly arrived producer, who undertook to reformat &quot;Let them talk&quot;, it becomes clear what he hinted at so transparently, writes &quot;KP&quot;.
As reported, TV presenter Andrei Malakhov is currently on vacation and has not signed a letter of resignation from Channel One.
The situation with the dismissal may clear up in the coming days.
Car bomb kills five soldiers in Afghanistan
At least five soldiers were killed in an explosion in the Afghan province of Helmand, reports RIA Novosti.
According to the police, a car bomb exploded near the military checkpoint in Girishk county the night before.
It is known about 20 dead.
On Friday morning, a new state of emergency occurred in Girishka.
Armed criminals attacked the currency exchange office.
The exchange of fire between the attackers and the security forces continues.
Diver filmed shark biting his camera
Diver and explorer Greg Skomal captured on video a shark biting his GoPro action camera.
The video was posted on Facebook by a division of the US Marine Fisheries Agency in Massachusetts, of which Skomal is an employee.
The incident occurred on August 2 off the coast of the Cape Cod Peninsula in the northeastern United States, the Necn portal clarifies.
A man while scuba diving tried to film a shark with a camera, which he held on a special stick.
Noticing a man, an animal over three meters long swam up to him.
The shark began to bite the camera, while not trying to attack the scientist.
Skomal explained that the predator acted in a similar way to determine whether the gadget is edible.
The researcher added that the shark could easily destroy the device.
He also noticed that this behavior of a marine animal was new to scientists.
The cause of the mass brawl in the Ural military center became known
A working group of senior officers of the Central Military District arrived at the Yelan training center, where a mass brawl took place, to investigate the circumstances of the incident.
Some details of this massacre have already become known.
According to the Mash public, which appeared on the VKontakte page, contract soldiers from the Ural military unit number 31612 fought violently over an unmade bed.
It all started with the fact that a private named Sayan defiantly ignored the officer&#39;s order to fill the protruding sheet.
Soldiers from the sixth company sided with the officer.
Sayan was supported by the first company.
In half an hour, 140 young guys smashed the beds and sinks in the barracks, smashed the windows.
More than ten people were injured in the mass brawl.
The Central Military District denied the information about the stabbing.
A study found that at least one-fifth of passengers in the United States carry prohibited items on an aircraft.
The study found that more than 20 percent of air passengers knowingly or accidentally carried prohibited items in their luggage on board an aircraft through US Transportation Security Administration screening checkpoints, including at least 6 percent boarding an aircraft inadvertently carrying prohibited knives or other sharp objects.
Nearly 1 percent reported that they later discovered they accidentally carried firearms, ammunition or explosives.
A study conducted by Stratos Jet Charters, Inc. and covering more than 1,000 people, also showed that younger passengers are more likely to break the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted they knowingly tried to fly with something banned by the FTA, 19.7 percent were millennials, compared to less than 15 percent of Generation X members.
Deliberately, food and water are most often carried past the employees of the ATB.
More than 3 percent admitted to deliberately bringing sharp objects through the screening, while 2.2 percent of female respondents and 3.7 percent of male respondents admitted that they knowingly brought prohibited drugs on the plane.
The company said it was studying passengers across the country to find out how many accidentally smuggled contraband through security screening at airports and how many did so knowingly.
It is quite expected that most often - consciously or unconsciously - smuggling smuggling through the inspection of those who fly the most.
As the company points out, the rules of the ATB are quite complex and confusing.
People often do not know exactly what liquids they can carry and how much.
Therefore, it is not surprising that most of what ATB selects are banned liquids.
Some time ago, people thought that ATB might be considered prohibited from carrying a book.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not international ones.
EPA chief Pruitt abandons intention to delay implementation of Obama-era emission reduction rules
The day after the 15-state lawsuit, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency reversed his decision to delay implementation of Obama-era regulations designed to reduce emissions of air pollutants and smog.
Pruitt explained his decision by saying that his agency now listens more than in previous administrations to the needs of state environmental regulators.
He did not mention a lawsuit filed in federal appeals court against his previous position.
The dispute revolves around the October 1 deadline by which states must meet 2015 ground-level ozone standards.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would delay compliance by one year to give his department more time to study the plan and avoid &quot;inconsistency with local decisions or impeding economic growth.&quot;
Pruitt, who was Attorney General of Oklahoma before being appointed by President Trump to his current position, has long been known as a staunch opponent of tougher environmental regulations.
After moving to Washington, Pruitt repeatedly blocked or delayed the introduction of regulations opposed by the chemical or oil and gas industries.
Wednesday&#39;s sudden change of course is yet another legal setback to Pewitt&#39;s return to normality course.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the head of the EPA had overstepped his authority in trying to delay the implementation of an Obama administration rule requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement released Wednesday night, Pruitt suggested that by making the abrupt change of course on ozone standards, he was simply fulfilling EPA&#39;s duty to work with states in a comprehensive process to meet the new standards on time.
&quot;Under previous administrations, the EPA often failed to meet deadlines, then waited for lawsuits from activist groups and others, and negotiated deadlines as the case progressed,&quot; said Pruitt, who filed more than a dozen lawsuits against the EPA in his previous role.
&quot;We don&#39;t believe in regulation by litigation and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take our charter and the power it gives us seriously.&quot;
However, the EPA said in a statement that Pruitt may at some point again use his &quot;powers to defer and other statutory powers&quot; to make sure the rules are &quot;jcyjdfys on a clear course and on all available information.&quot;
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broader overhaul of ozone regulations.
The bill, approved by the House of Representatives last month, seeks to delay implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The Senate has not yet voted on this issue.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that filed a lawsuit against the EPA this week, said the group intends to continue legal pressure.
&quot;The EPA&#39;s change of course - following our lawsuits - is a major victory for the health and safety of the 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by smog in their cities,&quot; Schneiderman said.
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, as well as the District of Columbia joined the New York lawsuit.
Ground-level ozone is created when common pollutants from cars, power plants, refineries, chemical plants, and other sources react with sunlight in the atmosphere.
The resulting smog can cause severe breathing problems in sensitive individuals, resulting in thousands of premature deaths per year.
Public health and environmentalists hailed Pruitt&#39;s unexpected change of course.
&quot;It&#39;s sad to think about how much pressure it took to get this perfectly logical step from the person tasked with protecting the air we breathe,&quot; said Laurie Ann Bird of the Center for Biological Diversity.
&quot;We must continue to resist the Trump administration&#39;s ideological campaign and protect those who pollute the air and their special interests.&quot;
IAAF Congress extended the suspension of the All-Russian Athletics Federation
The Congress of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) voted to extend the suspension of the All-Russian Athletics Federation (ARAF).
Thus, Congress supported the IAAF&#39;s ARAF Restoration Council, which issued a report on Monday recommending that the suspension be maintained.
166 people voted for the extension of the suspension, 21 voted against, TASS reports.
The IAAF Board Report stated that ARAF has made significant progress towards meeting the conditions set by the board for membership renewal, but those conditions have not yet been fully met.
Due to the disqualification of the VFLA at the World Championships in London, Russian athletes were forced to compete under a neutral flag.
The team included 19 people admitted to the IAAF championship.
The ARAF was subject to an indefinite suspension by the IAAF in 2015.
Then a report was published by an independent expert of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) Dick Pound, which spoke of numerous violations of WADA regulations committed by Russian officials and athletes.

Embarrassing defeat
As part of the 3rd round of the Fonbet championship of Russia among PFL teams, Novomoskovsk Khimik played an away match against FC Kaluga.
A little more than 10 days ago, the rivals played each other in the Russian Cup, but this time the picture of the game was completely different.
“Khimik” was in no way inferior to the opponent, but a second of relaxation at the end of the match led to an offensive goal and a fiasco.
After a recent defeat by the Kaluga team with a score of 0:3, many predicted an easy victory for the hosts in advance.
However, from the beginning of the meeting, the Novomoskovites forced themselves to be reckoned with and acted on the defensive, but from a position of strength.
In the 1st half, the Kaluga residents created more and had an advantage in possession of the ball.
Another very high-quality match was held by Aleksey Sirotin, who repelled dangerous blows several times and gave his partners confidence with his actions.
Unfortunately, in the attack, “Chemist” lacked the effort and luck to confound the defense of “Kaluga” and score the first goal on the road.
After the break, the game began to flow on a collision course.
Novomoskovites played more actively in attack.
Alarming bells for our team were errors in defense, which allowed the Kaluga team to create a number of critical moments.
10 minutes before the end of the meeting, “Chemist” intercepted the territorial advantage and carried out several dangerous attacks.
But the experience of the Kaluga team played its role - they played the ending more competently and calmly, waiting for their moment to score.
After a dangerous attack, “Chemist” moved the ball to the corner, the filing of which the home team without resistance ferried into the goal.
Yuri Dubrovin became the author of the goal.
In the reporting meeting, “Chemist” showed a good game, but suffered a humiliating defeat.
There is one more trip ahead of our team - on August 11 at 19:00 in Moscow at the Torpedo stadium named after Eduard Streltsov, Novomoskovites will fight with the favorite of the Center group FC Ararat, which includes Roman Pavlyuchenko, Marat Izmailov, Igor Lebedenko, Alexey Rebko.
Come support Khimik!
Place and time of the meeting of Novomoskovites - 18 hours 30 minutes. near the store &quot;Magnolia&quot; (Vostochnaya, d.2, bldg.
The composition of the &quot;Chemist&quot;: Sirotin, Manokhin (c), Romashchenko, Shayunov, Khomutov, Gogia (Oreshkin), Dudayti, Ryzhov, Svyatov, Belyanin (Adoevtsev), Andreychenko (Lygin)

Trump pressurized Mexico over paying for border wall, according to released transcripts of phone conversations
The Washington Post has published transcripts of telephone conversations between US President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On January 27, in a telephone conversation with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieta, Trump insisted that he stop publicly saying he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The President of the United States scolded him for speaking out publicly against the wall and, according to the leaked information, told him, &quot;You can&#39;t say that to the press.&quot;
Trump began his campaign by promising to build a wall along the US&#39;s southern border and vowed that he would make Mexico pay for the project.
A published transcript of his first telephone conversation with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull also revealed a heated exchange.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement under which the US must take in refugees bound for Australia is &quot;ridiculous&quot;, &quot;disgusting&quot; and &quot;stupid&quot; and insisted that the Obama administration&#39;s deal would make him look like an idiot , as he intended to stop the resettlement of refugees in the United States.
Trump ended the call by telling Turnbull that &quot;it was the most embarrassing conversation of the whole day.&quot;
The bodies of the tourists who died in Abkhazia were sent by plane from Sochi to St. Petersburg
The plane belonging to the Rossiya airline, carrying the bodies of Russian women who died in Abkhazia, took off at 20:15 Moscow time from Sochi to St. Petersburg, TASS reports.
At the place of the final destination, the board will be met by employees of the funeral agency, as well as representatives of the city administration, Deputy Minister for Resorts and Tourism of Abkhazia Astamyr Akhba told reporters.
Earlier, representatives of the Ministry of Emergency Situations of the republic stated that all the expenses associated with the delivery of the bodies back to Russia were borne by the government of Abkhazia.
In addition, the official Sukhum intends to pay compensation in the amount of 500 thousand rubles to the families of the victims.
According to Akhba, the leadership of Abkhazia expressed its readiness to pay for the relatives of the tourists killed in the explosions for flights and accommodation in the republic, but the relatives sent only powers of attorney to the republic for the right of the local authorities to act in accordance with the established procedure.
On August 2, at about 16:20 Moscow time, in the village of Primorskoye, Gudauta district, two explosions thundered at the missile and artillery weapons warehouse of the Ministry of Defense of the Republic, after which large-caliber shells and other ammunition stored there began to detonate.
As a result, the warehouse caught fire, which provoked uncontrolled explosions of shells of various modifications.
As a result of the emergency, two Russian citizens died - Elena Polyakova, born in 1970 and Elena Timofeeva, born in 1962, who were on vacation near a hydrogen sulfide source.
64 people, including 35 citizens of the Russian Federation and 29 citizens of Abkhazia, were taken to medical institutions of the republic with injuries of varying severity.
Currently, seven people remain in the hospital, the rest have been discharged.
Grand Jury to Study Russian Influence in US Elections
Special Counsel for Russia Robert Mueller has convened a grand jury in Washington to examine Russia&#39;s influence in the 2016 US presidential election, The Wall Street Journal and Reuters reported.
A grand jury is a group of ordinary citizens who gather evidence of potential criminal offenses and have the power to question witnesses under oath.
The collected materials will be studied by the special prosecutor and will decide whether they are sufficient for filing charges.
The convening of a grand jury gives Mueller additional authority to collect evidence.
One of the topics of the investigation of the jury, which began work a few weeks ago, will be the details of the meeting between the son of then-presidential candidate Donald Trump and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.
Muller himself promised to check the details of this meeting, which took place in June 2016.
They&#39;ve already been studied by the FBI.
At the end of July, it was reported that Donald Trump Jr. expanded the staff of his lawyers.
Trump Jr. previously said that from a meeting with Veselnitskaya, he expected compromising evidence on the headquarters of Democratic Party candidate Hillary Clinton, but no revealing documents were presented, and in the end it was about adoption.
In early August, a number of media reported that Trump Jr.&#39;s statement about the meeting with Veselnitskaya was literally dictated by Trump Sr.
The White House clarified that the president did not dictate anything, but simply used his authority, which any father would have done.
Vice Mayor of Penza was detained at the workplace
Irina Shirshina, deputy head of the Penza administration, was detained for 48 hours at her workplace on behalf of the Investigative Committee, RIA Novosti reports.
There have been no official reports from law enforcement agencies on this matter yet, but the press service of the Investigative Committee of the Investigative Committee assured that they would follow soon.
Penza City Hall has yet to comment on the incident.
Irina Shirshina is one of the five deputy heads of the Penza administration.
She oversaw urban planning issues and land relations, holding this position since April 2015.
Prior to that, she worked for a long time as the head of the Goszhilstroytekhinspektsiya department for the Penza region.
Irina Shirshina is raising three minor children, it is noteworthy that once again becoming a mother a year ago, she refused maternity leave and returned to work.
Of course, there is no spaceport or launch vehicles in Mexico.
But there is a space agency established in 2010 and a desire to develop its own space program.
And the installation of the bust of Yuri Gagarin is a tribute to the first man who went into space.
Unlike the monuments of the Soviet period, which are being demolished in some countries, the monuments to Gagarin, on the contrary, are &quot;walking the planet.&quot;
In 2012, the monument was installed in Houston, USA, near the former NASA headquarters.
In London, a monument at the Royal Observatory was erected in honor of the 50th anniversary of the first flight into space.
There is a monument to Gagarin in Erfut, Germany, where our cosmonaut visited in 1963.
The monument in Karlovy Vary (Czech Republic) avoided demolition in 1992 due to public protests and was moved from the city center to the square in front of the local airport.
In the year of Gagarin&#39;s 70th birthday, a monument to Yurius Gagarins appeared in Riga.
This is how the name and surname of the first cosmonaut sound in Latvian, and he looks as if he were 70 years old.
Murder at Morse Ford: Activists will lose lynchings on stage to call for justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury drove past spectators in the village of Monroe, Georgia, and roared toward the small Morse Ford Bridge.
As the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, approached the bridge, a group of white men with guns blocked its path.
The leader, a middle-aged man in a pinstripe suit, took a puff on his cigar and peered through the windshield.
Those inside were trembling with fear.
&quot;We need that nigga, Roger!&quot; the man barked.
&quot;Get him out of the car!&quot;
Shrill shrieks broke the silence as a young black man was dragged from the front seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene that played out on July 22 is just a dramatization.
But when a noose was thrown around the neck of &quot;Roger&quot;, almost all the spectators really held their breath.
Since 2005, activists have been returning to the Morse Ford Bridge to re-enact the night that two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcolm and George and May Murray Dorsey, were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one has been convicted of these murders.
&quot;It&#39;s amazing that in all these years not a single person has been arrested - although we see them next to us; although we know who they are,&quot; says Tyrone Brooks, who helped organize the production.
&quot;It&#39;s a stain on our history and it&#39;s a stone on our souls.&quot;
Brooks, 71, is a former Georgia congressman who has fought for human rights all his life.
For him, the play is a dramatic call to action and an annual reminder to the people of Monroe that injustice has never been corrected.
&quot;We want an investigation, we want a conclusion, we want a cure, we want reconciliation, but first we have to get justice,&quot; he says.
&quot;We can&#39;t move on to healing and reconciliation until we get justice.&quot;
A coroner covers the body of one of the victims of the Morse Ford lynching with a sheet on July 27, 1946.
More than 50 people in Monroe and neighboring counties were suspected of participating in the lynching, according to FBI files obtained by NBC News.
But no one has ever been charged.
Although the suspects have remained at large for decades, human rights activists say the city has always known two related vigilante motives: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court ruling for the first time permitted black citizens to vote in the primary that was to be held that summer.
Around the same election, according to the FBI, black sharecropper Roger Malcolm stabbed Barnett Hester, a white landowner, in a fight, apparently over a woman.
Brooks says that rumors circulated around town that Hester slept with Malcolm&#39;s wife Dorothy, and that the child she was to have was not her husband&#39;s.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a large white landowner, paid $600 bail to get Malcolm out of jail, according to the FBI.
He went to jail with Dorothy and their cousins May Murray and George Dorsey.
But as they were driving out of jail and approaching the Morse Ford Bridge, a lynch mob surrounded the car.
&quot;It turns out that Harrison organized and commanded the murders,&quot; such a conclusion is made in one of the FBI reports.
&quot;It is also clear that there was collusion between state and city law enforcement who not only took part in the killings, but also destroyed evidence and covered up the identities of witnesses.&quot;
Brooks calls it shorter.
&quot;It was an attack on voting rights,&quot; he says.
&quot;They were all killed to send a message to black people in the city: if you register and vote, the same will happen to you.&quot;
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Greene has directed an annual re-enactment of the Morse Ford Bridge lynching.
Her performance is graphic, it captures the viewer and tells about the deep racism that many would like to believe does not exist anymore in America.
It&#39;s hard to look at and even harder to turn away, but Green thinks that&#39;s the point.
&quot;We don&#39;t want to talk about lynching because it shows us our own ugliness,&quot; she says.
&quot;But I can&#39;t build a relationship with you if you don&#39;t hear me or hear what I&#39;ve been through.&quot;
Rehearsals for this year&#39;s play began in June, and on the first day nearly 30 actors—a dozen whites, the rest blacks—gathered indoors and listened to a polished review of the play over the years.
Wade Marbo directed with Green.
He played the role of the main member of the clan for several years, but says that the role never got easier.
&quot;I feel like I&#39;m dirty because that&#39;s not the same person that I am,&quot; says Marbo.
&quot;But I think it&#39;s very important to remember this history because we don&#39;t want to go back to that time.&quot;
Indoors, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester, reprise their roles.
The play begins with Malcolm, furious that Hester is sleeping with his wife Dorothy, screaming and pushing him.
&quot;I said nigga get out of my house!&quot;
Screaming Rascon in response.
There is a blow.
And at the same moment, everyone (at least all black actors) burst into laughter.
Greene laughs the loudest.
&quot;What is it?&quot; Ascona asks.
He is worried and confused.
Am I overplaying?
&quot;No,&quot; Green says through laughter.
&quot;I just don&#39;t think white people used to say &#39;nigga&#39; back then.&quot;
&quot;Yes, yes,&quot; one of the black performers laughs.
&quot;You must say a hard &#39;r&#39;.&quot;
And the energy in the room changes in the same way: discomfort is replaced by a sense of camaraderie.
Everyone must do everything right, not only for the sake of the play, but also for the sake of the memory of the four murdered people.
The scene starts over.
This time, when Rascona says the &quot;n&quot; word, it comes out clear and sharp.
Not a single person laughs.
The play ends violently and quickly.
Screams, shots, and then silence.
A woman in mourning black clothes stands over the bodies of the actors and sings Billie Holiday&#39;s sad song &quot;Strange Fruit&quot;.
Her voice breaks through a word.
A hundred yards away, fifty spectators are wiping tears and sweat from their eyes.
There is an almost equal number of blacks and whites among the audience.
One couple traveled from Ithaca, New York to watch the show; many live very close by.
They all endured the heavy heat of Georgia for nearly eight hours as Brooks took them on a pilgrimage to the graves of the Malcolms and Dorseys.
Up to this point, the murders were just history, but now, when they stand in the same place where people were lynched, it seems that their ghosts are right there in the air.
As the last note of the song fades, Green invites people to come closer and inspect the bodies.
Children bend down to their heads, touch the blood paint and motionless bodies, and whisper something to each other.
&quot;They&#39;re not truly dead,&quot; mutters one little boy, as if to remind himself of this.
A few minutes later, Green thanks the audience, and suddenly it&#39;s all over.
The actors drop the ropes from their necks and wipe their tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbo, the man in the suit who played the head Klansman.
Nick Rascona hugs the other two actors and suddenly, crying, falls into their arms: the emotional load of the performance has finally fallen on him.
&quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; one of the women whispers.
&quot;We know you have a good heart.
You had your reasons for doing it.&quot;
Later, the audience sits down to dinner with the actors.
At the same table, a white couple from Atlanta are animatedly discussing a play with a black couple they have just met.
Denise Daplinsky struggles to find words to describe how she feels after the performance.
&quot;It&#39;s hard to listen to these horrible, creepy words and actions... of people who look like you and who do it because they look like you,&quot; she says.
&quot;After that, I think lynchings still happen,&quot; she adds, &quot;only now it&#39;s called police shooting.&quot;
On the other side of the room, Tyrone Brooks is in the spotlight as he reminisces about his work as a human rights activist over a meal.
He says he&#39;s already started planning next year&#39;s show.
&quot;The production inspires us because it not only describes the horror of what we have experienced, but also teaches us,&quot; he says.
&quot;Because if you don&#39;t learn from this lesson, it could happen again.
Those who do not study their history, who do not know their history, are doomed to repeat it.&quot;
The court fined Navalny for violations at the &quot;campaign subbotnik&quot;
The Simonovsky Court of Moscow fined Alexei Navalny 300,000 rubles for violating the procedure for organizing a rally.
The oppositionist was found guilty of committing an administrative offense under Part 8 of Art. 20.2 of the Code of Administrative Offenses of the Russian Federation &quot;Repeated violation of the procedure for organizing a rally.&quot;
Earlier, the judge of the Simonovsky Court of Moscow, Khyzyr Mussakaev, finished considering an administrative case against Leonid Volkov, the head of the headquarters of the oppositionist Alexei Navalny, who was prosecuted under the same article as Navalny.
Volkov was found guilty and sentenced to a fine of 300,000 rubles.
Judge Mussakaev estimated the distribution of leaflets at the &quot;campaign subbotnik&quot; that Navalny&#39;s supporters held in Moscow on July 8-9 at this amount.
Seeing the campaign materials, the police officers who were following the participants of the subbotnik considered that the organizers of the event deliberately concealed its true essence - a public action (for which it is necessary to first request permission from the city authorities).
Leonid Volkov and his lawyers Ivan Zhdanov and Alexander Pomazuev petitioned for the termination of the administrative proceedings due to the lack of corpus delicti and pointed out that the police made certain mistakes in drawing up the protocol.
Volkov was not detained at the “campaign subbotnik” itself, but he received a summons obliging him to appear at the police station to tell about the event held with his active participation.
Navalny himself and another ally of the oppositionist, Nikolai Lyaskin, received the same summons.
Man who shot bride and three wedding guests arrested in Mordovia
A court in Mordovia arrested a local resident who shot four people at a wedding, including the bride.
This was reported in the republican department of the Investigative Committee.
The incident took place on the evening of 29 July.
During the quarrel, a 42-year-old resident of Saransk shot several times at the guests of the event who came to the rural pond to swim.
As a result, three women and one man were injured.
A criminal case has been initiated under paragraph &quot;a&quot; of part 1 of article 213 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (&quot;Hooliganism&quot;), part 3 of article 30 and paragraphs &quot;a&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, &quot;i&quot; of part 2 of article 105 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (&quot;Attempted murder of two and more than persons, committed in a generally dangerous way, out of hooligan motives&quot;).
According to Interfax, local media reported that the man opened fire because the wedding guests, having decided to swim, passed through the territory of his site to the reservoir.
The Ministry of Energy will tighten the requirements for suppliers of turbines for power plants
The Ministry of Energy of the Russian Federation will update the rules for providing information by suppliers of critical equipment, in particular, turbines for power plants.
When launching gas turbines, hydroelectric turbines, oil pumping and oil production facilities, equipment suppliers will be required to share data on access to it with the Ministry of Energy and the Federal Service for Technical and Export Control.
The draft government decree is already ready and submitted for public discussion.
The new requirements will only affect &quot;critical energy equipment&quot; supplied to Russia.
Potential threats in the document are such phenomena as obtaining information and access to the management of an object by foreign intelligence services, criminal elements and structures, unscrupulous partners and hackers.
EU expands anti-Russian sanctions because of Siemens
On August 4, the press service of the European Union announced that anti-Russian sanctions were expanded due to the scandal surrounding the supply of turbines manufactured by Siemens to Crimea.
This was previously reported by Argumenty Nedeli.
The press service of the Council of the EU stated that the sanctions against the Russian Federation were expanded due to the scandal with the Siemens turbines, which were allegedly delivered to Crimea in circumvention of the sanctions.
Today, the Council of Europe is considering all possible complaints and proposals from member countries to expand anti-Russian sanctions.
Earlier it was reported that the final decision would be made before the end of the current day, and now the decision has been made, the sanctions against Russia have been expanded.
Pearson Cuts 3,000 More Jobs, Cuts Dividends to Bring Business Back to Life
On Friday, British education group Pearson announced it would cut another 3,000 jobs and cut its pre-dividend by 72 percent as it embarks on yet another restructuring program to deal with the challenges its business is facing.
These job cuts, which chief executive John Fallon said will mostly take place in late 2018 and early 2019, are on top of the 4,000 jobs cut in the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced that it plans to cut costs by another £300m ($394m) in May in its third cost-cutting program to try to revive a business that has been hit hard by the rapid transition to digital learning methods.
The company, which last month agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to partner Bertelsmann, said its full-year guidance remained unchanged after announcing a 1 percent increase in core product sales in the first quarter. half of the year to 2.05 billion pounds.
Kabul convoy attack: NATO soldier killed in suicide bombing
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital, Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and injuring several others, according to official sources.
Five soldiers and a translator were wounded, according to a NATO report.
According to unverified information from local sources, three civilians also died as a result of the incident in the Karabakh city district.
The bombing is the latest bloodshed to hit Afghanistan this month, with more than 30 people killed in a bombing at a mosque in Herat on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
NATO said the explosion, which occurred Thursday evening, occurred when a joint Afghan army convoy was attacked with a &quot;human-carried improvised explosive device.&quot;
According to the report, all the wounded are in a stable condition and are being treated at the US military hospital at the Bagram airfield.
Correspondents report that the growing power of the Taliban and a group known as the Islamic State (IS) in Karabakh is a major source of concern for NATO forces stationed nearby in Bagram.
According to the UN, there were at least 1,662 civilian casualties in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, about 20% of them in the capital.
In late July, a suicide car bombing killed at least 30 people in the Shia district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they carried out the attack.
On May 31, a massive explosion in the city center killed more than 150 people, the most deadly terrorist attack in the country since US-led forces ousted the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence accentuates the insecurity in Afghanistan as US President Donald Trump assesses whether more US military forces should be added to assist troops and police in the country.
Correspondents say the attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also created a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies, and especially the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA overturns decision to delay air pollution law after lawsuits
The US Environmental Protection Agency has reversed a decision to delay an Obama-era law that would require states to cap air pollutant emissions a day after 15 states sued the agency over the move.
On Wednesday evening, the Environmental Protection Agency announced its decision to implement the so-called &quot;2015 ozone measurements,&quot; stressing that the move shows the agency&#39;s willingness to work with the states.
&quot;We believe in dialogue with and responsiveness to our state partners,&quot; Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the EPA&#39;s intention to delay ozone measurements, which measure existing air pollution in different parts of the country to determine where it needs to be reduced to meet stricter air cleanliness standards, by one year, until October 2018. of the year.
On Tuesday, a group of 15 states, mostly Democratic, along with the District of Columbia, filed a lawsuit alleging that the intent is illegal.
President Donald Trump&#39;s administration is trying to roll back a wide range of environmental regulations introduced by previous President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that Trump says is aimed at sparkling economic growth.
But action in this direction has drawn resistance from Democrats and environmental organizations, concerned about the possible impact of large emissions on public health.
The EPA website states that breathing air containing ozone “may impair lung function and increase respiratory symptoms,” such as asthma.
The Association of European Businesses opposed new anti-Russian sanctions
The Association of European Businesses expressed its disagreement with the US economic sanctions against Russia.
According to the AEB, such measures can lead to a serious reduction in production and the number of jobs.
The AEB statement says that business is one of the important links between countries and people, so the principles of free trade should not be limited.
European business unites more than 500 companies from the countries of the European Union and the European Free Trade Association.
The Association calls on the heads of state and government of the EU, the US and Russia to develop a new line of conduct that would separate business from politics and find a common, mutually acceptable solution in the spirit of peace and harmony.
Deputies ask the police to limit traffic on the embankment in Pskov
Pskov deputies sent an appeal to the head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs for the city, Sergei Surin, about the problem of movement along the embankment of the Velikaya River.
City Duma deputies Konstantin Bolotin, Grigory Storonenkov and Valery Lesnikov believe that motorists prevent people from walking and relaxing in this place.
In their opinion, the control of drivers will help to make this area more peaceful and safe.
The problem is that violators ignore the signs &quot;Pedestrian path&quot; and freely ride along the embankment.
It turns out that major repairs and landscaping were carried out in vain.
Sports and playgrounds become uncomfortable because of cars.
As noted by the Pskov Information Agency, in the evenings the central embankment is patrolled by motorized patrol officers of the PPS and combatants.
Thanks to them, the number of passing cars becomes less, but the traffic does not stop completely.
Putin demanded from the investigating authorities not to confiscate hard drives
Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed to prohibit the investigating authorities from seizing servers and hard drives from working computers at enterprises.
The head of state stated this at a meeting on investment programs for the development of the Far East.
According to the president, it is necessary &quot;to exclude the use of measures in the interests of the investigation that lead to the suspension of the activities of enterprises, including the removal of hard drives from working computers and servers.&quot;
Putin noted that if the investigators have such a need, &quot;it is enough to make copies, certify them and use them during the investigation.&quot;
The head of state added that it is impossible &quot;to create conditions that prevent the continuation of the enterprise&#39;s activities up to the impossibility of paying taxes.&quot;
Olga Buzova told how much she wanted to call her ex-husband

At the moment, the celebrity is in the United States, where he deals with work issues.
Literally the day before, Olga visited Las Vegas, after which she decided to publish a post on the social network Instagram.
She said that she did not get married, did not get new tattoos, and also did not call her ex-husband saying that he ruined her life, although she really wanted to do it.
Buzova said that she would remember this trip forever, as she had a lot of fun.
British actor Robert Hardy dies
British actor Robert Hardy, who played Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge in the film adaptation of the Harry Potter series, has died at the age of 92.
This was reported by the newspaper &quot;The Independent&quot; on Thursday.
The death of the actor was told by his relatives.

Something is rotten in the Danish state: Prince Henrik, and in fact Henri Marie Jean Andre, Comte de Laborde, refused to be buried with his crowned wife, Queen Margrethe.
This year, the couple has a &quot;golden&quot; wedding, but the agenda of the couple is not preparations for the celebrations, but a sepulchral dispute.
His Highness refused the title of Prince Consort, while he quipped to the Queen that she had never granted him the title of King Consort.
Henrik lives in France, although he remains officially the queen&#39;s consort.
Russian Foreign Ministry urged Washington to stop defamation of Moscow
The Russian Foreign Ministry reacted to the statements of Mike Pence, who accused Moscow of trying to destabilize the Balkans.
The Foreign Ministry issued a corresponding statement some time ago.
In its comment, the Foreign Ministry pointed out that the United States is increasingly using Cold War stamps that are inadequate to modern reality.
In addition, Russian diplomats called on the US authorities to stop defamation of the Russian Federation.
As Argumenty Nedeli wrote yesterday, US Vice President Mike Pence accused Moscow of trying to destabilize the Western Balkans and organizing a failed coup d&#39;état in Montenegro.
Mikey Garcia and Vasily Lomachenko meet for the first time, there is talk of the possibility of a showdown
Vassily Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who appear to be steadily on track to have the most exciting 147-pound boxing match in the near future, first met on Thursday.
They occupied separate rooms in ESPN&#39;s offices in Los Angeles until Garcia, the undefeated World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked down the hallway to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization super featherweight champion.
After Garcia&#39;s unanimous victory over former four-weight world champion Arien Broner on Saturday on Showtime, both fighters are in the top five boxers regardless of weight class.
Garcia held out his right hand and said, “How are you, champ?
Good luck&quot;.
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday at 7 p.m. on ESPN.
As the boxers posed for a photo, Lomachenko&#39;s manager Egis Klimas remarked that a potential showdown between the two would be just right.
&quot;I used to be a featherweight,&quot; Garcia recalled.
“I went up a category for Broner [to 140 pounds], but I&#39;m not that big.
I&#39;m too small for 140.
I want to go down to featherweight.
And he needs to get up to featherweight [up to 135 pounds], and then we&#39;ll have a fight.
This is what the fans want.
Let&#39;s arrange it for them.&quot;
Lomachenko agreed.
&quot;Boxing needs this fight.&quot;
Klimas asked if the fight should be streamed on PPV as part of a strategy he is following to have Lomachenko fight his 135weight debut later this year to set up a fight with Garcia (37-0, 30 KOs) next summer. who is also interested in taking on the winner of the bout between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell after their world lightweight title fight at the Forum Arena on September 23rd.
&quot;The fight could be on PPV because all the fans asked for it,&quot; Garcia said, later expressing his willingness to fight on whichever channel offered the best financial terms.
“We are the main names.
No other names will arouse such interest.
Once they&#39;re ready...&quot;
Garcia said he thinks Lomachenko is a &quot;terrific boxer&quot; and might attend his fight on Saturday.
But Lomachenko didn&#39;t immediately shower Garcia with praise and said he thought the three-weight champion from Riverside looked &quot;really slow, sorry Mikey... you were asking for a knockout.&quot;
Garcia said that he focused on showing the power of punching, and only then boxing.
They both said they felt the tension building up ahead of their own fight.
“This fight must take place.
No other fight generates so much interest and talk.
I&#39;m more than happy to work on it,&quot; Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: “I was waiting for one of the top boxers, and here he is, Mikey.
It will be a great fight.&quot;

Putin instructed the Prosecutor General&#39;s Office to check Baikal
Russian President Vladimir Putin instructed the General Prosecutor&#39;s Office of the Russian Federation to inspect the territory of Lake Baikal for evidence of illegal and environmentally harmful activities.
&quot;I ask the Prosecutor General&#39;s Office to check the Baikal territory for evidence of illegal and environmentally harmful activities,&quot; Vladimir Putin said at a meeting on the region&#39;s environmental development.
In addition, the Russian leader asked to take action if violations are revealed.
New test results for assessing the age of asylum seekers in Sweden published
The latest test results of asylum seekers in Sweden who were subjected to a new method of medical age assessment show that more than 80 percent of those tested were assessed as over 18 years old, but not everyone trusts the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish National Agency for Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) started testing earlier this year.
They were designed to make age assessments in the asylum process more accurate, after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticized for failing to determine the real age of some refugees who claimed to be underage.
So far, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases for testing, and the forensic agency has now released the results of 2,481 tests between mid-March and July 31, 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) of those tested were judged to be 18 years of age or older, and in another 25 cases, the Forensic Science Agency assessed that the testee was &quot;probably 18 years of age or older.&quot;
In the case of 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person was &quot;probably under 18&quot;.
Tests are performed only in cases where a person&#39;s age is in doubt.
According to Johan Göransson of the forensic agency, the results are in line with previous months.
&quot;We don&#39;t see much of a difference from last month&#39;s statistics, the numbers are quite consistent,&quot; he told The Local.
A high proportion of cases in which people were rated as over 18 years of age does not necessarily indicate that asylum seekers have lied about their age.
In May, the agency released the results of 581 tests and said that in 442 cases, &quot;the person being tested is likely to be 18 or older.&quot;
However, after reviewing 581 published results, Svenska Dagbladet found that in 243 cases, a person openly stated that he turns 18 this year.
The method of conducting a medical assessment of age, consisting in taking x-rays of the wisdom teeth and tomography of the knee joints and giving them for analysis to dentists and radiologists, has also attracted criticism from some authorities.
One skeptic is Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at the Karolinska Institute, whose job is to assess people&#39;s biological maturity to determine whether they went through puberty earlier or later than usual.
“I had reasons to think about it, and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessary to use the methods of measurement that are used now.
Biological age is thus determined very inaccurately.
If we can&#39;t determine it with certainty, we shouldn&#39;t pretend we can,&quot; he told the Metro newspaper.
However, Göranssen of the forensic agency spoke out in favor of the accuracy of the tests: “In general, it can be said that the risk of mistaking a child for an adult is small.
We face the biggest risk when a person is about to be 18, in which case it is about 10 percent.”
Consider running for president
During a working trip to Buryatia, Vladimir Putin said he was ready to consider running for the Russian presidency in the 2018 elections, Interfax reports.
This statement was a response to the request of the residents of the village of Cheryomushki in the Buryat region.
During a videoconference dedicated to the elimination of the fire in Buryatia and the Irkutsk region, the interlocutor addressed Putin with the words: &quot;Vladimir Vladimirovich, we have a request for you: when the next presidential election takes place, we ask you all to run again for this post.&quot;
&quot;Okay, I&#39;ll think about it, thanks,&quot; the president said in response.
On July 28, Russian presidential press secretary Dmitry Peskov commented on some media statements that Vladimir Putin&#39;s campaign headquarters would be headed by the head of the Russian presidential administration, Anton Vaino.
Peskov called these assumptions &quot;based on nothing, hypothetical reasoning.&quot;
&quot;So far there are no headquarters, far from the creation of headquarters, far from the election campaign,&quot; Peskov said.
&quot;So far, this is not on the agenda,&quot; Peskov said.
West Virginia Governor Says He&#39;s Switching Party
Democratic Gov. Jim Justice of West Virginia announced Thursday at a rally attended by President Trump that he is switching parties.
&quot;Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have moved on from me,&quot; Gov. Justice said.
&quot;Today I say to you with many prayers and much thought ... today I say to you, the people of West Virginia: I can no longer be of any use to you by remaining a Democratic governor.&quot;
The rally burst into applause.
&quot;So tomorrow I will change my registration to Republican,&quot; Justice added.
&quot;As a coach, I would tell you it&#39;s time to play differently.&quot;
Earlier, Trump promised that an important announcement would be made at a rally in West Virginia.
Trump won West Virginia by a 42 percent margin, and Justice did not support Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who according to Forbes is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, as he inherited the coal business from his father.
His fortune is estimated at 1.59 billion dollars.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee on Thursday night released a statement that &quot;Governor Justice&#39;s party switch is another blow to the Democratic Party, which is hindering rather than working to make our country great again.&quot;
&quot;With just 15 governors and control of the fewest state legislatures in history, Gov. Justice&#39;s announcement is just another rejection of a party that has no leaders from top to bottom and is unable to find a positive, unifying message,&quot; CBS News said in a statement. Republican National Committee Representative Ronna McDaniel.
Heavyweight cat Mister Pretty finds a home thanks to social media
A cattery in Pittsboro (North Carolina, USA) adopted a cat named Mister Handsome weighing more than 14 kilograms after he became famous thanks to the Internet.
Mashable reports.
At the end of June, a photo of the cat was posted on the cattery&#39;s Facebook account with a request to find its owner, because &quot;he was obviously fed by someone before.&quot;
In the comments, users noted that the expression of the animal&#39;s face could become a new meme.
The post got over 3,200 likes and 15,000 comments.
In the comments, dozens of people expressed their desire to adopt Mister Handsome.
As a result, he was given into the hands of Angela Frazee (Angela Frazee), who promised to deal with his excess weight.
In an interview on WNCN radio, the American said that she had already had a similar experience: she took home a cat weighing about 10 kilograms, and now he weighs just over five.
In July, Reddit users drew attention to a cat from Australia with unusually long legs.
A post with a photo of an animal has collected more than 68 thousand views.
Commentators noted that she could well make a career in the modeling business.
Coe praised Russia&#39;s &#39;sincere&#39; apology over doping scandal
International athletics specialist Sebastian Coe on Thursday praised what he called a sincere apology from Russia over the doping scandal, but reiterated that now is not the right time to allow the country to compete again.
Dmitry Shlyakhtin, a Russian representative of the athletics federation, told the congress of the International Association of Athletics Federations, which took place on the eve of the World Championships in athletics, that his country&#39;s suspension from sports competitions was fair and that he was determined to fight doping.
He apologized to &quot;all the athletes whose gold and silver medals were stolen in competitions.&quot;
Despite his comments, the Congress of the International Association of Athletics Federations voted to maintain the suspension, imposed in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) released a report on found evidence of state-sponsored doping.
“It seemed to me that today&#39;s answer, today&#39;s report, was very sincere,” Coe, president of the International Association of Athletics Federations, told reporters.
&quot;The whole council and the whole congress liked ... that the Russian Federation itself admits that it has gone through extremely hot times and is now doing everything possible to take care of the restructuring of the federation.&quot;
Coe said he also &quot;loved&quot; that Russia agreed to the criteria for its restoration.
“I think this has been a very constructive day and that we are moving forward, but Congress supports the recommendations of the special commission that now is not the time to reinstate Russia,” Coe said.
“Over the next few months, we must do everything to resolve this situation.
Our guiding principle was our desire to separate clean athletes from a tainted system,” he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes who meet the strict criteria of the International Association of Athletics Federations will compete under a neutral flag in the World Championships in Athletics, which begins on Friday in London.
The head of the special commission of the International Association of Athletics Federations, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that a number of requirements have yet to be met for Russia to recover.
As he told reporters in London after a report given to the board of the International Association of Athletics Federations, drug testing is still not carried out sufficiently, and suspended coaches are still quietly doing their job.
Court arrests Ukrainian journalist suspected of treason
Journalist Vasily Muravitsky, detained by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), was placed under arrest for two months, the SBU reports.
An employee of the Zhytomyr Journal online publication is suspected of high treason by posting his publications on Russian websites and of encroaching on the territorial integrity of Ukraine.
At the same time, Russia does not support the measures of the Ukrainian authorities against the journalist, considering it a &quot;barbaric policy&quot; against the media.
Two years after the peak of the migration crisis in Europe, Italy has decided on a limited military operation in the Mediterranean.
The patrol ship &quot;Comandante Borsini&quot; entered the territorial waters of Libya, then, together with the Navy of this country, to stop the influx of illegal migrants.
The decision to start the operation was made by the Italian Parliament on Wednesday.
Rome coordinated it with the internationally recognized government of Libya, which, however, does not control most of the country&#39;s territory.
Opposing the cabinet and based in Tobruk, the Libyan parliament accused Italy of violating Libya&#39;s sovereignty.
And the commander of the Libyan National Army, Field Marshal Haftar, ordered his subordinates to counter the Italian ships.
In Rome, however, they said that they do not believe these threats and intend to send another warship to Libyan territorial waters.
The situation was discussed last week at the talks between Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni and the head of the Libyan cabinet recognized by Europe, Faiz Saraj.
The Italian authorities decided to establish a maritime mission to combat illegal migration after the statistics on the number of illegal immigrants who sailed into the country from Libya were published in July: 95,000 people since the beginning of the year.
The government said that the resources to receive migrants have been exhausted.

Two leaders of the Ukrainian national athletics team were suspended from participation in the World Cup
Olga Zemlyak and Olesya Povkh, who specialize in sprinting, have been excluded from the Ukrainian national team for the 2017 World Championships in London.
This was reported on the website of the country&#39;s Athletics Federation (FLAU).
This decision was made by the executive committee of the organization in connection with the initiation of disciplinary proceedings against female athletes by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF).
Coach Zemlyak Sergey Basenko was also excluded from the Ukrainian delegation.
According to Sportarena, the IAAF suspects athletes of doping.
Povkh is the bronze medalist of the 2012 Olympics and the 2011 World Championship, the 2010 European champion in the 4 x 100 meters relay, Countryman is the winner of the 2012 European championship in the 4 x 400 meters relay.
The World Championships in Athletics in London will be held from 4 to 13 August.
How football&#39;s financial rules will affect Neymar&#39;s move to Paris
Rules aimed at preventing unlimited spending by European football clubs will not prevent Neymar&#39;s world-record transfer from Spain&#39;s Barcelona to France&#39;s Paris Saint-Germain.
Whatever the consequences may come down the chain, for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, the governing body that controls European football, which has the power to ban teams from the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial fair play rules introduced by UEFA in 2011 suggest that PSG will eventually have to show that Neymar&#39;s transfer was financed without major losses.
Barcelona were paid 222 million euros ($262 million) just to release the Brazilian from his contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar&#39;s move to France.
PSG could certainly shell out to hire Neymar and add him to a galaxy of other stars, given the team&#39;s funding from Qatar&#39;s energy-rich ruling family.
Clubs have the right to spend large sums to acquire players, but they have to balance it with legitimate sources of income in order to reach the profitability threshold in their football business.
FFP was introduced by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA President in 2007.
The former French footballer believed that clubs that ran into huge debts in their pursuit of success were, in effect, cheating and risking ruin if banks or owners stopped funding.
In 2011, FFP stopped focusing on club debt and instead switched to tracking their losses.
As a result of this change, the business model that Roman Abramovich had originally used at Chelsea in 2003 – to buy a club with good potential and then spend heavily to improve the team and create a global brand – has become a difficult plan.
During this three-year assessment period, which spans 2018, clubs could face losses of €30m.
And despite Platini&#39;s ignominious removal from the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksandar Čeferin is still determined to curb overspending.
&quot;Of course the FFP is alive and we will tighten the rules as we move forward,&quot; Andrea Traverso, who controls the FFP at UEFA, told The Associated Press last week.
Although PSG will pay the buyout of Neymar&#39;s contract at a time, they can distribute this amount over the entire term of his contract for reporting purposes.
Neymar signed a five-year deal, so the transfer fee can be shown in the annual accounts as a cost of 44.4 million euros over the next five years.
During the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, PSG, as well as Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City, were heavily sanctioned.
PSG were fined 60 million euros ($82 million at that rate), which was later reduced to 20 million euros, and were ordered to limit their Champions League squad for the 2014-1015 season to 21 players instead of the usual 25.
UEFA is tracking down clubs that might try to outwit its financial controls by inflating their income at the expense of companies linked to the club&#39;s owners.
Although the Qatari company could sponsor PSG, if the amount of funding was considered to exceed the standard market rates, UEFA would not allow it to be considered legitimate income.
This is exactly what happened in 2014 when UEFA ruled that PSG&#39;s funding from the Qatar Tourism Authority had been inflated.
It has been reported that part of Neymar&#39;s earnings at PSG may have come in the form of payments from the organizing committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Neymar will become a World Cup ambassador, and such a maneuver could easily be detected by UEFA inspectors.
Past sanctions imposed on PSG mean that UEFA will be even more closely monitoring any attempts to circumvent the rules.
UEFA has not held preliminary discussions with Paris Saint-Germain over the transfer of Neymar, according to people familiar with the situation on Thursday.
They spoke with the Associated Press agency on condition of anonymity, as they are not authorized to discuss the position of PSG.
According to the latest published reports, in 2015-1016, PSG received more than 10 million euros in profit on a turnover of 542.4 million euros.
The financial statements for the last financial year have not yet been published.
PSG expect Neymar&#39;s arrival to be fertile ground for sponsorship deals, merchandise sales and team-branded T-shirts.
The club expects turnover to increase by at least 30 percent due to the hiring of a new player.
Undoubtedly angry that one of the best players is leaving, the Spanish league tried to block the transfer of Neymar, saying that PSG would violate financial fair play.
&quot;This is a clear case of &#39;financial doping&#39;, with the club and the state,&quot; La Liga president Javier Tebas told Spanish newspaper AS, referring to Qatar as PSG&#39;s ultimate owner.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by the American sports mogul, shares La Liga&#39;s doubts about the club&#39;s state funding.
&quot;It&#39;s all equity and it&#39;s completely changed the landscape of football in the last fifteen years,&quot; Wenger said on Thursday.
“When the club belongs to the country, everything is possible.
It becomes very difficult to comply with financial fair play, because a country can have many paths and many reasons to be represented by such a serious player.
The procedure and places for taking the oath will be determined by the President
Where and how new Russian citizens will swear allegiance to the Russian Federation, the president will determine - such amendments to the second reading in the relevant law were developed by the State Duma Committee on Legislation and State Building.
A week ago, the deputies planned to directly determine the procedure for taking the oath in law.
Children under 18 years of age, as well as those incapacitated, will be exempted from taking a solemn oath, follows from the finalized text of amendments to the bill &quot;On Citizenship of the Russian Federation&quot; (available to Izvestia), which the committee will consider on July 11 before the second reading at its meeting.
On June 6, President Vladimir Putin supported the idea of introducing an oath upon becoming a citizen of the Russian Federation instead of formally signing documents during a meeting with State Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin.
The deputies formalized this idea in the form of an amendment to the second reading in a bill providing for the abolition of the decision to grant citizenship to those who were subsequently convicted of a number of crimes of a terrorist or extremist nature: for example, for public calls for terrorism or its public justification in the media or on the Internet ( Part 2 of Article 205.2 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation), as well as for hijacking an aircraft, train or water transport, but only if this act is related to terrorism (Part 4 of Article 211 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation).
According to the bill, its logic was as follows: when filling out documents for citizenship, a person signs a promise to comply with Russian legislation - by embarking on the path of extremism, he violates this promise.
The bill was submitted to the State Duma in April by the leaders of the Duma factions Vladimir Vasiliev (United Russia), Gennady Zyuganov (KPRF), Vladimir Zhirinovsky (LDPR), Sergei Mironov (Fair Russia) and State Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin.
On May 19, the deputies adopted it in the first reading.
Last week, the State Duma Committee on State Construction and Legislation approved the text of the bill for the second reading, but now it has been revised again.
Now it says that the procedure for taking the oath will be established by the President of the Russian Federation.
Earlier, parliamentarians were going to describe the procedure directly in the law &quot;On Citizenship of the Russian Federation&quot;, indicating that the ceremony should take place in a solemn atmosphere in front of the state emblem and flag of Russia in the presence of a representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
However, it was not clear from the text of the bill where such an event should take place - the list of places where the coat of arms of the Russian Federation can be placed is regulated by the relevant federal constitutional law.
These include courts, offices of heads of state authorities of subjects, municipalities, judges, prosecutors, heads of federal executive bodies, etc.
Most likely, it could be the registry offices.
Those wishing to obtain Russian citizenship will take a solemn oath after officials check their documents.
But a person will receive a Russian passport only after he takes the oath, follows from the revised text.
A week ago, the draft said that the oath should precede the signing of the decree.
The updated text says that they will swear allegiance to Russia from the age of 18, and not from 14.
The rule has been preserved according to which the incapacitated or partially incapacitated, as well as those who cannot pronounce, read or sign the text of the oath with their own hands, will be exempted from taking the oath.
In addition, the President of the Russian Federation has the right to exempt &quot;other persons&quot; from this procedure.
Also, the updated bill spells out a special procedure for admitting residents of Ukraine to Russian citizenship, who are considered native speakers of the Russian language.
They will have to officially renounce Ukrainian citizenship by submitting an appropriate application to the authorized body of Ukraine for this.
A notarized copy of the application will need to be handed over to Russian officials.
The renunciation of &quot;foreign&quot; citizenship, as now, will not be required if it is provided for by an international treaty or if this is impossible &quot;due to reasons beyond the control of the person.&quot;
The corresponding amendment to the law was proposed by a group of deputies, including First Vice Speaker of the State Duma Ivan Melnikov (KPRF), Natalya Poklonskaya, Pavel Krasheninnikov and Airat Farrakhov (all United Russia).
I think many of you know that getting a certificate from Ukraine is unrealistic, simply impossible.
Accordingly, a lot of people are waiting for a decision on their fate regarding the citizenship of the Russian Federation, - explained the day before the head of the Duma Committee on State Building and Legislation Pavel Krasheninnikov (ER).
In addition, a clarification appeared in the text that restrictions on holding certain positions for foreigners will not apply to those who renounced their &quot;other&quot; citizenship in writing and handed over their previous passport to the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs, but &quot;for reasons beyond his control&quot; it was not stopped be considered a citizen of another country.
Now foreigners are prohibited from holding positions in the municipal service, being hired at facilities and organizations whose activities are related to ensuring the security of Russia.
Also, a person with dual citizenship or a residence permit of another country cannot become a State Duma deputy or a member of the Federation Council.
It is planned that the law should come into force on September 1, 2017, by which time the necessary by-laws should be ready.
Nostalgia becomes a niche in Hot American Summer and Fellow Detective
The current iteration of the story is nostalgically reminiscent of the characters&#39; glorious days in the 80s at the same time; about the grunge era in the 90s (around the time when masterminds David Wayne and Michael Schowalter made the sketch comedy The State for MTV); and about herself - that is, about 2001, before her stars like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd moved on to more serious things.
As a fact of culture, it is both the elevation and the embodiment of our era with its constant reminders from Facebook.
But as a franchise, it feels like an anachronism.
&quot;First Day of Camp&quot; was surprisingly good, and not just because of the absurd humor (including the original story of the talking can of vegetables, voiced by H. John Benjamin).
The result doubles as a major joke: middle-aged actors play horny children who have just come of age; thanks to this, the inability to return to becomes part of the joke.
&quot;Ten Years Later&quot;, where adults played adults, has less deep emotional roots, and its parody is more haphazard and includes riffs from stalker films of the 90s like &quot;The Hand That Rocks the Cradle&quot;.
In one episode, a character pulls out an Apple Powerbook, four-wheel inline skates, and &quot;a bunch of other stuff from 1991.&quot;
Many of the plot lines are the same.
Good-natured Coop (Showalter), now a writer, still hasn&#39;t won over Kathy (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn&#39;t lost his virginity.
And then there&#39;s the insane and dastardly conspiracy that involves Ronald Reagan (also Showalter), who is now instigated by George W. Bush (a tried and true travesty by Michael Ian Blake).
As always, the best part of the franchise is its retreats.
It&#39;s especially funny to see the eternally young Rudd humming Matt Dillon&#39;s song from The Loners, whose character, former big man Andy, now looks like an old man.
The success of this franchise could be occasional frenzy like the recursive series &quot;Seven Up&quot; until it gets to what, in my opinion, would be its logical conclusion: &quot;Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later&quot;, where in the last stage, the whole company would go to the cinema for the premiere of the film &quot;Hot American Summer&quot;.
&quot;Comrade Detective&quot; on Amazon appeals to a different type of nostalgia: Cold War memories from &quot;The Americans&quot;, &quot;Blast Blonde&quot; or even &quot;Shine&quot; with its imagery of the struggle between East and West.
Created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka and directed by Reese Thomas, this comedy is a TV movie: an 80s Romanian police drama about two policemen in Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the Marxist-Leninist way.
Florin Piersik Jr. and Corneliu Ulich play the lead roles - Gregor, who has seen life, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, the idealistic Josef.
This is a brilliant idea.
But just an idea.
There are a few visual jokes (cops spend their time watching a chess match like Americans might watch football).
A team of acclaimed voice-overs - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny - make for a fun &quot;guess the voice&quot; game.
But &quot;Comrade Detective&quot; clings to the plausibility of a clumsy propaganda drama—there&#39;s even a hitman wearing a Ronald Reagan mask—that it often looks like.
Six long episodes are drawn out, and it&#39;s not very funny and not often.
If it had been made shorter, &quot;Comrade Detective&quot; could have done a better job with its satire in the spirit of agitprop; for example, every time Gregor and Josef visit the American embassy, there are two fat people sitting in the lobby eating a bunch of hamburgers.
To the imaginary communist viewer, this image says that Western culture is capable of turning anything into a gorge.
The fictional Romanian filmmakers are not so wrong: We do this even with our own recent history, and with theirs too.
The prize fund of the match for the Russian Football Super Cup between Spartak and Lokomotiv will be about 30 million rubles.
This was announced by the President of the Russian Football Premier League (RFPL) Sergey Pryadkin at a press conference.
According to the head of the RFPL, the winner will receive 70% of this amount, RT reports.
He also added that by now there are almost no tickets left for the match.
The match &quot;Spartak&quot; - &quot;Locomotive&quot; will be held on Friday, July 14, at 21:30.
According to TASS, Spartak is the current champion of the Russian Federation, and Lokomotiv is the owner of the Russian Cup.
Two young Ufa residents robbed a furniture shop for 200,000 rubles
Recently, a 37-year-old Ufa man who owns a furniture company turned to the police.
The man reported the theft of expensive tools from the workshop, which caused serious damage to his production.
The prey of the thieves was tools with a total value of almost 200 thousand rubles: two welding machines, a rotary hammer, hydraulics, a winch.
Law enforcement officers began to search for criminals and soon came to the residents of the Blagoveshchensky district of Bashkortostan, friends of 23 and 24 years old.
According to the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the republic, the accomplices entered the territory of the enterprise, broke down the front door and took out the tools.
Immediately after that, the guys sold the stolen equipment to the first car service they came across.
A theft case has already been initiated against them, and law enforcement officers managed to return only part of the stolen tools to the rightful owner.
The State Department commented on Medvedev&#39;s words about relations between the Russian Federation and the United States
The US and Russia must be able to work with each other.
This statement was made by State Department spokesman Heather Nauert in response to the words of Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev about relations between the two states.
Earlier, the head of the Russian government said that by adopting new anti-Russian sanctions, the United States put an end to the hope of improving bilateral relations and declared a full-fledged trade war to the Russian Federation.
Commenting on these words, Nauert acknowledged that Russian-American relations are at a &quot;low level&quot;, but noted that &quot;areas for interaction&quot; should be sought.
&quot;Look at the truce in southwestern Syria that has been holding for almost a month now.&quot;
&quot;And this is an example of good cooperation between the United States and Russia,&quot; RIA Novosti quoted the diplomat as saying.
At the same time, the representative of the foreign policy department refused to comment on the statement of the Russian prime minister that the sanctions are tantamount to a trade war.
US President Donald Trump signed a bill on new sanctions against Russia, Iran and North Korea last Wednesday.
At the same time, he admitted that the document was unsuccessful and contrary to the American Constitution.
Dior &quot;grown&quot; roses from amethysts and quartz
The jewelry division of the French fashion house Dior - Dior Joaillerie - has expanded the Rose Dior Bagatelle and Bois de Rose collections.
They have five new rings and three choker necklaces with velvet ribbons.
In the Rose Dior Pré Catelan line, two new rings and a pendant made of amethysts, rose quartz and diamonds, made in glyptic (hand-carved stone) and pavage, dedicated to the 70th anniversary of the house, have been released.
The head of Dior Joaillerie, Victoire de Castellane, was inspired by the roses grown on his estate in Granville by fashion designer Christian Dior and the Parisian gardens of Bagatelle and Pre-Catelan.
Trump found the culprits of the deterioration of relations with Russia
U.S. President Donald Trump has spoken out with harsh criticism of members of Congress.
According to the American leader, their actions led to a deterioration in relations with Russia.
Our relations with Russia are at an all-time low and dangerous level.
&quot;You can thank Congress, these same people can&#39;t even give us medicine,&quot; the president tweeted.
Yesterday, Donald Trump signed into law new sanctions against Russia, Iran and North Korea.
They, in particular, will affect Russian banks and energy companies.
Subsequently, the White House issued a presidential statement in which he indicated that the law would prevent the United States from entering into profitable deals and would bring Russia, China and North Korea even closer.
Belarusian businessman refuses to buy Ukrainian subsidiary of Sberbank
An entrepreneur from Belarus Viktor Prokopenya withdrew from the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) an application for the purchase of a subsidiary of Sberbank.
The businessman explained his decision to RBC by his intention to &quot;concentrate on our other planned investments and projects that we are working on.&quot;
According to Mr. Prokopenya, such a step would be &quot;the best investment of time&quot;, despite the investment attractiveness of buying a subsidiary of Sberbank.
Mr. Prokopenya became the main contender for the purchase of the Russian bank&#39;s division in Ukraine after the NBU rejected the application of the NorvikBank consortium Grigory Guselnikov and the Belarusian company Said Gutseriev in July.
Russian banks began to leave the Ukrainian market after President Petro Poroshenko imposed sanctions on their subsidiaries in March.
One of these financial institutions - in addition to VTB and Vnesheconombank - was Sberbank.
Novak called the reason for the blackout in the Crimea
The Ministry of Energy of the Russian Federation called the reason for the blackout in the Crimea.
With explanations about the incident, the head of the department, Alexander Novak, spoke.
According to him, the peninsula was left without electricity due to a traffic accident in the Krasnodar Territory.
The truck that got into an accident touched power lines, as a result, the Kuban and related Crimean networks were disconnected.
Failures in the power supply of large Crimean cities were recorded last week.
Experts fixed the problem within a few hours.
Initially, it was reported that abnormal heat could be the cause of the blackout.
Bank of England to keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and waning inflation dampened rumors of a possible hike.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth would remain sluggish and left interest rates unchanged amid growing pressure on household incomes.
The Bank&#39;s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 6 to 2 to keep rates at 0.25%, with fewer committee members in favor of a rate hike this month as weak economic growth dampened support for a hike.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank limited its upside forecasts to 1.7% percent in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018, and warned that the pressure on family incomes would continue, while inflation is still expected to rise by about until 3%.
However, the bank has warned that rate hikes over the next few years will be needed to control Brexit-driven inflation, and said borrowing costs are likely to have to be raised more than expected in financial markets.
The members of the committee also voted to abandon part of the huge package of measures to develop the economy, launched a year ago as a result of Brexit.
Starting next February, the bank will close a term financing plan under which it provides cheap loans to banks, although it said it now has another £15bn to lend up to £115bn under the plan.
In the minutes of the rate decision, the bank said: &quot;According to MPC key forecasts, gross domestic product (GDP) growth remains slow in the near term, while pressure on household real incomes continues to weigh on consumption.&quot;
On the issue of rates, he reiterated that &quot;some tightening of fiscal policy&quot; would be needed to stem inflation, &quot;somewhat more&quot; than markets are expecting.
At the moment, markets are predicting the first rise in the third quarter of next year and another one in 2020.
But the bank stressed that all increases would be &quot;gradual&quot; and &quot;limited.&quot;
The bank&#39;s upside forecasts for this year and next are lower than those made in May, which were 1.9% and 1.7%.
The bank left unchanged its forecast for 1.8% in 2018.
Following the news, the sterling fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell 0.5% to $1.31 and 0.4% to €1.11.
The decision not to change the rate was taken after the recent disappointing growth figures weakened the increased expectation of an increase; GDP then grew by 0.3% in the second quarter against 0.2% in the previous three months.
Growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will pick up slightly later in the year, a bank spokesman said.
The bank&#39;s latest inflation report gave households little cause for rejoicing, hit by high inflation and modest wage hikes: the bank said the pressure would increase before easing.
The bank added that fiscal policy &quot;cannot prevent&quot; a payroll blowout in the next few years, but expects wages to recover &quot;significantly&quot; by the end of its three-year forecast.
The economy is also set to grow as a result of growing demand for British goods, thanks to the weak pound, which offsets some of the lower consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after rates were cut to 0.25% last August following the shocking results of the Brexit referendum that sent the pound down.
The bank estimates it will likely take four years to fully impact prices and the economy.
Before the bank made its latest rate decision, the buzz around the proposed rate hike was mounting as inflation pushed harder on already under pressure households, with three committee members asking for a rate hike to 0.5% in July.
Inflation fell to 2.6% last month from 2.9% in July, although the bank said the fall was expected and will be offset again in the coming months.
According to the bank, the higher rate compared to the planned 2% is entirely a consequence of the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of Koreko Mortgage Brokers, said: “Given the recent drop in swap rates, it looks like the mortgage market will become even more competitive again as lenders demand business opportunities and expect a good end to the year.
The market looks especially good for those nearing the end of their existing contracts, as refinancing loans, often with the option of no fees and low rates, is becoming more popular than ever.”
NHS to prescribe controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people
Beginning in September, patients will have access to a &quot;revolutionary&quot; HIV prevention drug following a battle in the High Court over NHS funding for the drug.
The NHS has announced that HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a pill taken before sex that has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in those at risk by an average of 86 percent, will now be available from the public health service for an initial three-year trial period of approximately 10,000 people.
She agreed to fund the trial after an appeals court upheld a High Court ruling last year that held that the National Health Service had the ability to pay for PrEP despite her claims that it should be funded by local authorities.
The move, announced on Thursday, was hailed as a &quot;major innovation&quot; by NHS England President Simon Stevens, and the National AIDS Control Office (NAT) called it a &quot;turning point&quot;.
Before the full launch of the program across England by April 2018, STDs in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to start enrolling people, with more to join the program in October.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a course of HIV medications taken before sex to reduce the risk of contracting HIV.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces the risk of HIV infection among people at risk.
When PrEP is taken before sex, there are enough certain drugs in the body to prevent HIV infection.
Such drugs can be taken daily or no later than two hours before sex.
Eligible patients include gay and bisexual men, transgender people, and people whose partners are HIV positive and are not receiving successful treatment.
Dispensaries will select eligible participants who agree to participate in the study, including men, women, transgender people, and individuals whose partners are not known to have their HIV status controlled by antiretroviral therapy.
People living and registered with a general practitioner in England will also be able to apply for potential participation in the nearest participating STI clinic.
The program will cost £10m and NHS England this week signed an agreement to provide the drug after an international tender for procurement.
The study is designed to explore the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical data on who the drug&#39;s target audience is, its uptake, and its use on a large scale.
“This critical innovation should complement and enhance the broader and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
This is another milestone in more than three decades of progress in the fight against one of the biggest health threats facing humanity.
Deborah Gold, president of NAT (National AIDS Control Agency), said: “This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if properly targeted to people who need help and are at risk, has the potential to make a difference in the HIV epidemic in England.
Starting in September, people at risk for HIV will have access to a new and empowering drug through this NHS-sponsored study in England that can be controlled by the individual without having to discuss it with a partner, leading to to the improvement of many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this news.&quot;
Ian Greene, president of the Terrence Higgins Foundation, said: “Now the first priority is to ensure that the trial rolls out rapidly across the country and that no one at risk for HIV is left behind.
Now that we have the experimental drug PrEP, we are on our way to protecting more than 10,000 people at risk for HIV.”
Shadow Minister of Public Health Sharon Hodgson said: &quot;We very much welcome the start of the PrEP trial, which is very late due to months of delays and procrastination by the government.&quot;
The data demonstrates how revolutionary this drug can be as part of our approach to preventing HIV and stopping the transmission of this fatal infection.
This trial will bring us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that the trial be rolled out across the country as soon as possible to protect those at risk for HIV and move us one step further towards ending the spread of HIV in society.
The World Congress of Tatars adopted a resolution to support the agreement between Tatarstan and Russia
The Sixth Congress of the World Congress of Tatars (WCT) adopted a resolution in which it noted the importance of maintaining the post of president in Tatarstan.
According to the document, the post is &quot;a positively recommended form of organizing the highest state power in the republic and expressing the national interests of the entire Tatar people.&quot;
In addition, the congress emphasized in the resolution the importance of the agreement on the delimitation of powers between Russia and Tatarstan.
According to the document, he &quot;played a positive role in the ethno-cultural, socio-economic and socio-political development of Tatarstan and the Russian Federation as a whole.&quot;
It should be reminded that the agreement between Moscow and Kazan, effective since July 24, 2007, was concluded for 10 years.
On July 11, deputies of the State Council of Tatarstan appealed to the President of Russia with a request to extend the agreement and keep the title of the head of the region.
Now Tatarstan is the only subject of the federation that has an agreement with Russia.
The head of the region is the only one whose position is called &quot;president&quot;.
In Russia, there were difficulties in obtaining an international driver&#39;s license
The traffic police departments are experiencing a shortage of international driver&#39;s licenses (IDPs).
To obtain such rights, one has to wait in line for several weeks, which has become a real problem for vacationers who want to go on vacation abroad in their car or rent it there.
It is worth noting that the situation with international driving permits remains controversial.
The IDP was introduced in order to make it easier for foreign police to understand what is written in the national certificate, since the information in it is explained in five languages.
The requirements for international rights are recorded in the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic of 1968, but in countries that have ratified the Vienna Convention, Russian rights are recognized in this way.
However, in reality, it all depends on the specific police or rental office: some require an IDP, while others need national rights.
To be safe, drivers still receive international rights, but it should be borne in mind that in countries that have not ratified the convention (for example, the USA, Spain, Mexico, Indonesia), the authorities have the right not to recognize either national rights or IDPs.
Now there is a problem with the forms in almost all departments of the traffic police, Kommersant reports, after conducting a study in a number of regions.
So, in Moscow, in the subdivisions of the UGIBDD, coupons are simply not issued, forms have not been enough for four months.
You can make an appointment on the public services website, but there the queue has already stretched until mid-August.
In Krasnoyarsk, it is impossible to obtain an IDL &quot;for technical reasons&quot;, without going into details, in the Samara region they honestly say that there are no forms, a similar situation is developing in other cities.
Many Muscovites have already faced the problem, the following messages are increasingly appearing in social networks:
Irina Burmistrova: &quot;Guess why you can&#39;t get international driving license in Moscow?&quot;
That&#39;s right, because all traffic police departments have run out of forms.
Elena Podkolzina: &quot;A question for knowledgeable people!&quot;
It is necessary to obtain international rights very urgently.
In Moscow, it is always crowded far ahead, coupons are not issued at all on the spot (there is a button, but it cannot give a coupon).
It seems that the public services portal shows that in St. Petersburg there is a lot of free time.
Has anyone tried to receive in another city?
Will it work?
As explained in the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation, the requirements for the forms of international driver&#39;s licenses have changed, therefore, new forms are being supplied to the subdivisions of the State traffic inspectorate.
The deficit may be connected with this, however, it is not clear what changes are in question, this was not previously reported.
The forms are purchased by the Center for Special Purpose in the Field of Road Safety (TsSN BDD) of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation and then delivered to the traffic police units.
In recent years, all contracts were concluded with Goznak JSC: in 2014-2015, almost 200 thousand forms of IDP were produced, in 2016 15 thousand forms were purchased, in 2017 - 90 thousand, but the last contract was signed 18 July with LLC &quot;First Printing Yard&quot; for the production of 70 thousand forms.
There is a version that the CSN simply did not manage to hold a tender on time, which is why there was a shortage.
However, there are other versions of the lack of forms: because of the crisis, many people began to travel on their own not to Europe, but to cheaper Asian countries - China, Thailand, and so on.
What rights are accepted there is not completely clear, therefore people are reinsured, and therefore there was a rush demand for international &quot;crusts&quot;.
Recently it became known that professional drivers will have to take an exam to confirm their qualifications.
This proposal was made by the Ministry of Transport.
The international driver&#39;s license (IDP) of the new sample is valid from May 31, 2011.
Minister of Justice of Ukraine refused to believe in the construction of the Crimean bridge
Ukrainian Justice Minister Pavlo Petrenko said he did not believe in Russia&#39;s ability to build a bridge to Crimea.
On Friday, August 4, he said in an interview with the Obozrevatel portal.
Not a single self-respecting international company will even put a bolt or a nut there, because it risks losing its business in the EU, the USA, Japan - in countries that have joined the sanctions against Russia regarding Crimea.
&quot;That is, in my deep conviction, this project actually has no prospects,&quot; Petrenko said.
He added that he considers Russia incapable of implementing a major infrastructure project on its own.
Russia cannot normally build smaller facilities either.
I know that after the Olympics in Sochi, entire stadiums have already begun to collapse.
“Therefore, I think the best tool in this situation is sanctions against companies that have turned out to be so short-sighted as to join this project,” the official said.
On July 31, the builders completed the construction of the arch of the automobile arch of the Crimean bridge.
On the Kerch coast, the pre-assembly of the road arch of the Crimean Bridge has been completed: its vault is closed at a height of 45 meters from the base of the structure.
&quot;At the same time, the bridge builders prepared a railway arch for installation on the fairway supports,&quot; the information center of the project said.
In April, the head of the Ministry of Transport, Maxim Sokolov, informed Russian President Vladimir Putin that the construction of the facility was ahead of schedule.
The Crimean bridge will connect the Crimean peninsula and the Krasnodar Territory.
Spanish official sacked after not going to work for 10 years
What kind of angelic patience (or absolute indifference to public service) should the head of the Spanish official Carles Recio have?
Permanent absenteeism stretched out for 10 long years.
However, Mr. Recio was nevertheless fired.
But not your immediate superior.
What only in the world of bureaucrats does not happen.
The inhabitants, it seems, have long been accustomed to all the pranks of the &quot;servants of the people.&quot;
And, nevertheless, officials all the time manage to surprise those on whose taxes they live well.
This time the &quot;sensation&quot; came from Spain.
There, an employee of the archive of Valencia, Carles Recio, managed not to go to work for ten years.
At the same time, he regularly received a salary.
And all solid - 50 thousand euros a year.
And now the &quot;wonderful times&quot; of Mr. Recio are over.
He was fired by decision of the Legislative Assembly of Valencia.
During the investigation, it turned out that the malicious truant came to the office every working morning at 07:00 to check in the electronic system.
And then he went home.
Once again, he appeared at the workplace at 16:00 to again register in the system that he had left.
And so 10 years.
It also became known that the truant devoted all his free time to drawing comics at home.
Now deputies of the Legislative Assembly of Valencia are thinking how to punish the immediate boss, Mr. Recio, who could not help but know how his subordinate should &quot;work actively&quot; at his workplace.
Judges are offered to be protected from chairmen
The Presidential Council for Human Rights (HRC), on behalf of Vladimir Putin, has developed proposals to strengthen the independence of the judiciary.
The Human Rights Council proposes to limit the powers of chairmen of courts and introduce their election.
For the courts of appeal and cassation, the HRC wants to introduce special districts that will not be tied to the administrative-territorial division in the Russian Federation.
The Supreme Court should also submit its proposals within the framework of the presidential order.
The HRC has completed the development of proposals that will strengthen the independence of the Russian judiciary.
The Human Rights Council carried out this work on the instructions of Vladimir Putin dated January 3, 2017, which the President gave after a meeting with members of the council.
At a meeting with council members on December 8, 2016, they discussed, among other things, individual cases of judicial arbitrariness, as well as problems of public control in places of detention of citizens (see &quot;Kommersant&quot; dated December 9).
The work of the HRC resulted in 25 proposals that relate both to the issues of ensuring the independence of judges and the detection of judicial errors, as well as the financing of courts and legal education.
One of the ideas of Kremlin human rights activists is to limit the powers of court chairmen in order to increase the independence of other judges.
If a candidate for the position of a judge successfully passed the competition and received the support of the judiciary, then the chairman of the court, in the opinion of the HRC, should nominate him for appointment, without having the right to refuse, as the law now allows.
It is also proposed to deprive the chairman of the right to distribute cases for consideration among judges.
To do this, experts admit, a specially written computer program can.
The HRC also believes that the chairman has no right &quot;to predetermine the results of a judge&#39;s qualification assessment, to initiate disciplinary action against him, to make decisions on the establishment of additional material payments.&quot;
At the same time, the Presidential Council considers it necessary to switch to &quot;the election of court chairmen by the judges themselves&quot; and &quot;to empower them for a relatively short period of time with mandatory rotation.&quot;
Now all chairmen of courts (from republican to district) are appointed for six years by the president on the proposal of the chairman of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation.
In order to protect judges from the pressure of regional administrations, the HRC proposes to organize appeal and cassation in courts of general jurisdiction in a new way.
Now their structure is tied to the administrative-territorial division in the Russian Federation.
The HRC says that &quot;it is necessary to ensure the organization of separate courts of appeal and cassation not at the level of regional judicial bodies in the constituent entities of the Russian Federation, but in judicial districts.&quot;
Experts take as a basis the practice of arbitration courts.
Under them, there are &quot;judicial districts&quot; that do not coincide with the administrative division in the Russian Federation, but due to this guarantee greater independence from regional officials, who find it difficult to use the &quot;telephone law&quot;.
The HRC proposes to reinforce justices of the peace with people&#39;s assessors in order to consider certain &quot;categories of civil and administrative cases&quot; with their participation.
For example, about the deprivation of parental rights, about reinstatement at work, about protecting honor and dignity, about depriving a driver&#39;s license, etc.
&quot;These are just our proposals,&quot; Tamara Morshchakova, a member of the Human Rights Council and a retired judge of the Constitutional Court, explained to Kommersant.
She also recalled that the president&#39;s order applied not only to the HRC, but also to the Supreme Court (SC), which has not yet disclosed its proposals.
The Armed Forces (the Prosecutor General&#39;s Office and the Ombudsman for Human Rights in the Russian Federation among co-executors) still have time to fulfill the order.
Chairman of the Supreme Court Vyacheslav Lebedev must report to Vladimir Putin on how effectively the independence of justice is ensured in the Russian Federation by September 1.
Living the High Life: A mezzanine floor and clever design tricks transform this small Earl&#39;s Court apartment into a spacious home
Joan Lee, a retired banker with a passion for real estate renovation, moved from her spacious Knightsbridge home to an apartment in Earl&#39;s Court in 2014.
The apartment is on the first floor of a pretty typical Queen Anne house, and it&#39;s in favor of the new design that Joan didn&#39;t pack up her things and move out again.
“I used to live with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger area,” says Joan.
“I was looking for something comparable for my money.
They showed me this apartment in Earl&#39;s Court, and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and bid the same day.&quot;
The 1,000-square-foot apartment has undergone a complete renovation since its first viewing.
It was originally a complex one-bedroom apartment—one had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom—and Joanna wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine floor to make the most of the generous ceiling heights.
“I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
Those were my requirements,” she says.
To that end, she hired Erfan Azadi of Notting Hill-based architecture and design studio Duck &amp; Shed to use 12.5-foot-high ceilings to create a home that would not only be a successful project, but fit Joan for life.
The ceiling was not high enough to arrange two rooms one above the other, so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine where one could stand upright.
Erfan had to think creatively to get through the brief.
“Working with steel structures is very difficult,” he explains.
“We needed to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were one above the other, and did not have to bend.
It was necessary not just to build a simple platform, but to curve the structures so that they are at the correct height and allow the use of rooms from above and below.”
This decision allowed Erfan to arrange two full-sized rooms one above the other in the allotted space - and much more.
From the mezzanine, a vintage copper skylight window from Retrouvius overlooks the chic living room below.
Mirrored furniture with golden finishes, silver accents and vintage lighting fixtures by Serge Mouy set the tone for the project.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding spectacle, space and light.
The short hallway is lined with mirrors to make it seem longer.
In the kitchen, a mirrored privacy panel feels like a window into another room.
At the entrance, mirrored cabinets serve to store all of Joan&#39;s crockery.
To create a feeling of a more luxurious space, the beauty of the living room can block off the kitchen when not in use.
Folding kitchens are nothing new.
The uniqueness of this kitchen is that it is a door that slides up, like in a garage.
“The art of engineering was involved here,” says Erfan of the steel-reinforced wood fiber panel door.
&quot;It&#39;s equipped with a counterweight, so when you push the door up, it slides very easily.&quot;
Through judicious use of space and storage space, Joan gained an additional 16 square meters, an extra bedroom and an improved layout.
“At the end of the day, floor space is what you will be selling, which is what your property is valued at,” says Erfan.
“Roughly speaking, a real estate agent will come in and make calculations based on the floor area.”
Here they have been able to increase the floor area by using quality materials that give the space a touch of luxury.
“Materials are what we touch, so they help create an emotional connection with the home,” says Erfan.
“No one falls in love with electrical wiring in the walls.
It is important, but does not touch the strings of our hearts.
This is a testament to the fact that, through good design and increased footage, an apartment can turn from something ordinary into something amazing.
In fact, like Joan, you can choose to stay.
The government approved the creation of a commission on cultural policy
The Russian government approved the creation of a commission on state cultural policy.
The corresponding decree is published on the website of the government.
According to the document, the main task of the commission will be the development and adjustment of strategic approaches to the implementation of cultural policy.
The commission will also develop draft cultural policy strategies, clarify tasks and prepare new programs for its implementation.
Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation was appointed head of the commission.
The composition of the commission will be approved separately.
In 2016, Prime Minister of the Russian Federation Dmitry Medvedev approved a plan for implementing the state cultural policy strategy until 2030.
The plan includes 193 events and provides for measures to expand the influence of Russian culture in other countries, preserve a single cultural space and cultural heritage, and it will also help create conditions for the development of culture in the country.
Inflation in the G20 fell to an eight-year low
Consumer price growth in G20 countries has dropped to its lowest level in eight years, The Wall Street Journal reports, citing data from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
According to OECD estimates, inflation in June 2016 was 2% - lower values were noted in October 2009, when the price growth index reached 1.7%.
Earlier, Rosstat reported a decrease in the consumer price index in Russia by 0.1%.
Thus, the agency recorded the first weekly deflation in 2017.
The inflation target in Russia, according to the calculations of the Ministry of Finance, is 4.1%.
The Ministry of Economy, however, believes that the target value has already been achieved - according to this department, the figure is 4%.
Putin warned against illegal logging of the Baikal taiga
Russian leader Vladimir Putin, during a meeting on the ecological development of the natural Baikal territory, warned against illegal destruction of forests.
During the event, Minister of Natural Resources Sergei Donskoy noted that a bill had been prepared earlier.
It allows deforestation during fire suppression, and the government plans to adopt it in the fall.
In turn, the president said that this project should be monitored so that &quot;everything in a row is not cut down&quot; in the process of cutting down.
Donskoy noted that this bill involves control by the Ministry of Emergency Situations and supervisory agencies.
Media: soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine secretly from the command agree with the militias of Donbass
Regular telephone communication has been established along the line of armed confrontation in the Donbass.
The fighters of the opposing sides constantly communicate with each other on mobile phones, and the headquarters do not know about this communication.
Soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and militiamen of Donbass have established communication on cell phones in secret from their high command.
This was reported on August 4 by Strana.ua with reference to the participants in the military operation in Donbass.
According to the publication, the commanders of the units are well aware of the names of their colleagues from the opposite side of the front and communicate with them daily by phone.
Communication is not at all everyday: the commanders are trying to reach some &quot;tactical agreements&quot;.
Often, as a result of such conversations, a truce is concluded on a certain sector of the front.
Journalists became aware of cases when one or another officer received birthday greetings from behind the front line, from his formal enemy.
Soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and militias of the DPR and LPR have been sitting in trenches on the demarcation line since the spring of 2014, when Ukraine launched a military operation against Donbass.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs was outraged by the blocking of the statements of the UN Security Council about the attacks on the Russian embassy
The Russian Foreign Ministry is outraged by the actions of certain Western diplomatic representatives who block the statements of the UN Security Council in the press condemning the terrorist attacks on the Russian Embassy in Syria.
This is reported by the Russian Foreign Ministry.
The ministry recalled that on August 2, the territory of the Russian embassy in Damascus was subjected to mortar fire for the third time in a month by terrorist groups Hayat Tahrir Ash-Sham (formerly Jabhat al-Nusra, banned in the Russian Federation) and Faylak Ar-Rahman. .
Taking into account that the international community is unanimous in characterizing Nusra as a terrorist organization, and the UN Security Council resolutions call for counteracting this structure, the Russian Foreign Ministry noted that &quot;it would seem, it goes without saying that Nusra&#39;s terrorist attacks should meet with universal unconditional and strong condemnation, and there should be no ambiguity in the assessments of attacks against diplomatic missions.&quot;
However, as emphasized in the diplomatic department, &quot;for the third time in a month, the diplomatic representatives of the United States, Great Britain, France and Ukraine in the UN Security Council, alternately, varying the tone of objections, hiding behind arguments about the alleged lack of necessary information, blocked the proposal of the Russian Federation to adopt a standard short draft Security Council statement to the press condemning the terrorist attacks on the Russian diplomatic mission in the Syrian capital.
The unwillingness to show diplomatic solidarity with us should remain on the conscience of these delegations.
&quot;The most outrageous thing is that the inability of the Security Council to condemn the acts of terrorists encourages them to new provocations and terrorist attacks, makes them feel impunity,&quot; the Foreign Ministry said and added that &quot;we would not want these barbarians to be convinced that someone in the Security Council with them.&quot;
Vladimir Putin called for limiting the number of unscheduled business inspections
Russian President Vladimir Putin, during a meeting on investment projects in the Far East, said that the number of unscheduled inspections of entrepreneurs should be reduced to 30% of the planned ones, and also spoke about the need to limit the period of inspections to ten days.
&quot;Unscheduled inspections are carried out, as a rule, without the appropriate agreement with the prosecutor&#39;s office; only 2-3% is agreed with the prosecutor&#39;s office, everything else is carried out independently,&quot; TASS quoted the president as saying.
Vladimir Putin also said that investigators should be prohibited from seizing servers and hard drives from enterprises.
In addition, according to the president, business associations should be given the right to defend the interests of their members in court.
&quot;This, I hope, will bring a certain positive to the consideration of cases related to entrepreneurial activity, or related to violation of the law in the field of entrepreneurship,&quot; the head of state said.
As Kommersant reported, due to the moratorium on scheduled inspections, the number of other types of inspections of entrepreneurs is growing.
In May, by order of the Business Ombudsman under the President of Russia, Boris Titov, a survey was conducted, as a result of which it turned out that scheduled inspections were actually replaced by unscheduled ones (the share of those who encountered them increased from 21.9% in 2015 to 30.8% in 2016) , prosecutorial (from 16.9% to 21.8%), raid (from 7.9% to 13.3%), as well as checks on the applications of citizens (an increase from 15% to 19.5%) and administrative investigations ( 10.8% to 15.5%).

Brothers are vying for a real estate empire worth over $500 million
Two brothers are fighting for one of the largest real estate empires in Victoria, worth more than $500 million - forty years after their Italian ancestors founded the dynasty.
Former Carlton Football Club director and real estate developer Colin de Lutis lives in Toorak Palace, three doors away from his younger brother Paul, who has filed a property division suit against him in the Supreme Court.
Paul has been wanting to get out of the family business since 2014, but there is still a bitter dispute in the Supreme Court over the terms of the divorce.
Together with their mother Anna, the brothers own 87 properties worth over half a billion dollars, purchased since their family bought the Smith Street store in Collingwood in 1973.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans, which grew into a network of 160 outlets.
She was sold in 1999 for $85 million.
The money was invested in real estate, and the De Lutis family&#39;s list of holdings today includes office buildings, building lots in Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments on the Gold Coast and Mount Buller, and shopping centers in the suburbs.
By arrangement with his late father, Colin - whom Paul describes as &quot;the main driving force and dominant personality&quot; of the De Lutis family - owns about two-thirds of the company&#39;s assets, and Paul about one-third.
According to the court, this means that Colin&#39;s property is 316 million, and Paul - 176 million.
The division of property and money became a stumbling block for Paul.
“The division proposed by Colin gives him, in my opinion, the best parts of the property,” he wrote in his first testimony in 2015.
Last Friday, after several unsuccessful attempts at reconciliation, the first hearings were held in the Supreme Court.
The brothers are now arguing over who will control the existing business - which Paul believes Colin has cut him out of.
Colin claims that this is not the case, however, he accuses Paul of incompetent management of some objects.
In the testimony given by Colin at the beginning of the process, he says that he hopes for a resolution of the dispute.
&quot;My Italian roots make me consider my family a top priority,&quot; he wrote.
Litigation costs are snowballing, with hundreds of pages of testimony, emails and reports from companies such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer attached to the case; both sides brought in the most famous lawyers, including Allan Myers QC, and the best lawyers.
Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were immigrants from Italy; from the late 1950s they ran milk bars and delicatessens, and in the early 1970s they bought a shop in Brunswick.
With financial guarantees, they bought a store in Collingwood, in which Colin opened the first family jeans store.
Colin says he started Westco when he was &quot;in the last grade of school and Paul was a boy (about 10 years old)&quot;.
Anna De Lutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass their holdings to their sons without conflict.
&quot;Luigi often told me that he didn&#39;t want the brothers to sort things out in court,&quot; she wrote.
The other two brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies; Colina says Mark got 10 million when he went out of business and Luke 26 million.
According to Paul, both Luke and Mark were &quot;dissatisfied with the financial conditions of their department.&quot;
Colin was not a public figure, although he was a former member of the board of directors of the AFL club and, according to Eddie McGuire&#39;s biography published in 2015, the TV star&#39;s best friend.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul and their lawyers on Friday.
Colin was the only one who answered, with a text message saying that since the case hadn&#39;t gone to court yet, &quot;I really don&#39;t have much to say.&quot;
&quot;I am very, very sorry that my brother Paul decided to file a lawsuit against me and wag the name of our family in court,&quot; he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a deposition that he was trying to meet his brother&#39;s demands.
&quot;Our father wouldn&#39;t want to see Paul and me arguing in court,&quot; he said, adding that he &quot;is still hoping for a resolution.&quot;
On Friday, that hope apparently dissipated.
&quot;The decision in our case will soon be made by the court,&quot; Colin wrote.
Trump&#39;s new chief of staff plans to limit the flow of information to the president.
Others tried to do it and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly will actually succeed.
In this case, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House chief of staff plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump, including news reports from the media, hoping to keep the chief in a more relaxed state.
Here&#39;s what reporter Josh Dosey reports.
&quot;In a meeting held by new White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly with the leadership of the staff on his first day on the job, he outlined a major problem in the White House under President Donald Trump that he hopes to solve: poor channels of information to the president.&quot;
Kelly told staff that information should go through him - either on paper or through briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he got the right information.
Kelly&#39;s diagnosis is perfectly correct, but others have already failed in their efforts to subdue Trump by monitoring the flow of information to him.
President Trump&#39;s relationship with television dates back decades - and now that he&#39;s in the White House, his habit of watching TV is still strong.
“When Trump, as a candidate, resented unfair coverage of the campaign, it was helpful to show him that he was getting fair coverage from publications that could be persuaded,” Sam Nunberg, a former campaign adviser, told Politico in February.
Tara Palmeri wrote in Politico at the time that &quot;according to six former members of the campaign staff, in order to keep Trump&#39;s habit of tweeting under control, it was necessary to ensure that there was a constant stream of praise in the information that came to him personally.&quot;
Fine.
But the idea that Trump&#39;s tweeting habit was ever &quot;under control&quot; is simply ridiculous.
Maybe these members of the campaign staff know something we don&#39;t, like that if it wasn&#39;t for them, Trump&#39;s tweets would be even more provocative.
We may never know about the tweets Trump didn&#39;t release.
If his staff had kept him out of trouble even a few times, their efforts had not been in vain.
But no one has always been able to keep Trump from adding fuel to the fire.
Part of the problem is that in a White House divided into rival factions, people are constantly trying to advance their agenda by giving Trump material - credible or not - that confirms their views.
&quot;Politico&quot; - just in time for this story - wrote in May about the tendency of advisers to constantly slip questionable information to the president.
Here is one example, described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
“Current and former Trump employees say that Trump can react very harshly to negative press reports, especially those containing dangerous leaks, and will not rest until he finds who was behind them.
This happened in late February, when someone slipped the President a printout of an article from GotNews.com, the website of Internet provocateur Charles Q. Johnson, which accused Deputy Chief of Staff Cathy Welsh of being &quot;behind a series of leaks&quot; at the White House. .
It doesn&#39;t matter that Johnson is permanently banned from Twitter for violent behavior, that he didn&#39;t present specific facts, or that he launched false accusations in the past and then dropped them.
Trump read the article and started asking employees about Welsh.&quot;
Goldmacher adds that then chief of staff Reince Priebus and secretary of staff Rob Porter were &quot;trying to build a system to manage the flow of paperwork that Trump gets and document it.&quot;
How did it work?
Three months later, Kelly tries to do the same.
He may prove to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump still has an impulsive nature and his aides still fight each other for influence.
These constant factors make Kelly&#39;s task very difficult.
Tyumen prosecutor&#39;s office fights HIV dissident
The prosecutor&#39;s office challenged the decision of the Kalininsky District Court of Tyumen, which terminated the criminal case against a local resident whose young daughter died of HIV.
According to the investigation, the child died due to the fact that the mother is an HIV dissident and refused treatment.
However, the court released her from liability in connection with reconciliation with the injured father.
The prosecutor&#39;s office believes that the crime cannot be left unpunished, so as not to create a precedent for other HIV dissidents.
The case against a resident of Tyumen was initiated under Part 1 of Art. 109 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (causing death by negligence) in April - after her three-year-old daughter died of HIV infection stage 4B.
According to the prosecutor&#39;s office, the mother herself is HIV-positive.
&quot;The woman was not treated herself and refused to treat her daughter, believing that HIV infection does not exist,&quot; the prosecutor&#39;s office of the Tyumen region explained.
The criminal case was received by the Kalininsky District Court of Tyumen, which on July 25 decided to close it.
The petition for this was filed by the father of the deceased girl, explaining that &quot;he forgave his wife, he has no claims against her, she made amends for the damage and apologized.&quot;
The prosecutor&#39;s office did not agree with the court&#39;s decision and filed an appeal, demanding that the decision to dismiss the case be canceled and sent for a new trial.
The girl died, and it is impossible to make amends for the harm caused by the crime.
The HIV-infected mother, contrary to the recommendations of doctors, refused to examine the baby and treat her for a dangerous infection,&quot; the press service of the prosecutor&#39;s office said.
According to the oversight body, she must be punished, otherwise other HIV dissidents will follow her example.
As told in the Tyumen AIDS Center, now in the Tyumen region about 12 children with HIV do not receive medical care due to the refusal of their parents.
&quot;And this situation has already improved - during the year of the work of the special group, half of the parents who categorically refused to treat their children for HIV changed their minds - they allowed them to be diagnosed, they began to take drugs,&quot; said Elena Loseva, press secretary of the AIDS Center.
According to her, it is impossible to influence parents by legislative means, and as a result, not all HIV-infected children can be detected - mothers are not allowed to examine them, they hide, run away with their children from hospitals.
What danger do HIV dissidents pose?
At the end of last year, sociologists from St. Petersburg presented the results of Russia&#39;s first study of the so-called HIV dissident movement.
HIV dissidents are people who deny the existence of HIV and refuse to take medication.
Doctors and activists of AIDS service NGOs call such views anti-medical, and they see a serious threat in their spread.
A terrible photo session that ended in tragedy took place on Thursday, August 3, at the Grechany railway station in Khmelnitsky.
A cheerful company of tipsy young people was walking along the bridge over the railway tracks, where a freight train was just standing.
One of my friends came up with the idea to take a spectacular selfie on the roof of the car, FACTS was told in the police communication sector in the Khmelnytsky region.
The guy began to descend from the bridge onto the train, but due to his indiscretion, he caught on a power line and instantly received an electric shock.
Fortunately, the dispatcher of the station became aware of this incident and immediately called an ambulance.
Before the arrival of doctors, the victim was moved to a safe place, and then hospitalized in the burn department of the Khmelnytsky Regional Clinical Hospital.
The man was diagnosed with burns of the torso of 1-2 degrees.
Doctors now assess his condition as stable.
Law enforcers remind that in recent years, extreme selfies on the roofs of high-rise buildings, bridges, and moving vehicles have become increasingly popular.
The police are urging people to be vigilant and not allow such photo shoots, especially among children and teenagers.
Scientists admit the existence of oceans on ancient Venus
Oceans may have existed on ancient Venus.
This assumption was made by French scientists.
Scientists have created a computer model that demonstrated the process of water formation on the surface of the planets, writes Science News.
It turned out that on Venus at the beginning of its history, oceans were formed, in which there was 10% more water than now on Earth.
Earlier, &quot;Arguments of the Week&quot; wrote that, according to the scientists&#39; hypothesis, an ocean could exist on Mars 4 billion years ago.
Foreign experts in the course of their research came to the conclusion that the water body was located in the northern hemisphere of the Red Planet.
Three injured in San Francisco park shooting
Three people were injured in a shooting in San Francisco, reports the Associated Press.
The incident took place in Dolores Park when there were a significant number of visitors.
According to witnesses, several men who were on the bridge began to shout threats.
One of them pulled out a weapon and started shooting at people.
The appearance of the intruders could not be seen, since they had everything but their eyes closed.
Another was provided with medical assistance, after which he was released.
The third wounded man is a minor, there are no details about his condition.
Situated on a hill, Dolores Park is a popular destination for locals and tourists.
On July 1, at least 17 people were injured in a shooting at a nightclub in Little Rock, Arkansas.
Several other visitors were injured trying to leave the premises.
rock band Louna will present a new album in Barnaul
The concert of the rock band Louna will be held in Barnaul on October 17th.
The musicians will present their new album &quot;Brave New World&quot;, which has become one of the most anticipated releases of the year.
The team is preparing a conceptual show that will become the brightest in the concert history of the group.
&quot;Brave New World&quot; is the fourth album by the Russian rock band Louna.
Its name is associated with the famous dystopian novel by O. Huxley &quot;Brave New World&quot;.
The new songs do not retell the book, but tell about a society that lives according to the law of dystopia, &quot;blindly believing in propaganda and imposed values.&quot;
The listeners helped the group to raise money for recording the album: more than 1,200 people supported the project on the Planet.ru website.
His first album &quot;Make It Louder!&quot; Louna released in 2010.
Two years later, the musicians presented the disc &quot;Time X&quot;, and in 2013 they recorded the album &quot;We are Louna&quot; (2013).
In the fall of 2015, the Louna group performed with a symphony orchestra at the Crocus City Hall with the program &quot;Songs about Peace&quot;.
The group consists of Lusine Gevorkyan (vocals), Vitaly Demidenko (bass guitar), Ruben Kazaryan (guitar), Sergey Ponkratiev (guitar), Leonid Kinzbursky (drums).
The concert will take place in the Barnaul club &quot;Pharaoh&quot; on October 17 at 19.00.
Ticket price: from 1200 to 2600 rubles.
Louna is one of the most sought after bands on the Russian rock scene.
The team was founded in 2008.
Their debut concert took place in 2009.
The group won several times in different categories of the &quot;Devil&#39;s Dozen&quot; hit parade.
Gypsies overcame the moat and returned to the &quot;street of millionaires&quot;
Some of the wealthiest homeowners in the West Midlands are once again at odds with determined gypsies who have crossed a municipal moat to reclaim the field next to their homes.
The gypsies parked 20 mobile homes in a field bordering Solihull&#39;s wealthy street, jokingly called &quot;millionaires&#39; street.&quot;
Bringing with them horses, babies, and many motorhomes, they returned after being kicked out no later than May, unimpeded by the ditch dug by the municipal authorities to prevent their incursions.
This tactful company found a gap in the defenses and pushed their vehicles through the area they had left unfenced to make room for a path.
Angry residents attacked the municipality of Solihull, saying that it was &quot;unable to solve this problem.&quot;
An anonymous local resident said: &quot;They arrived here on Monday evening after being driven from Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at passers-by.&quot;
The municipality should be shamed and forced to act because they are completely incapable of solving this problem.
The gypsies were here in May, they were driven away, and now they are back again.
More gypsies came last night, and perhaps more tonight.
&quot;The City of Birmingham knows how to deal with this issue, they are getting long-term court orders to protect their parks,&quot; she added.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I don&#39;t like that I keep paying Council Tax and the City can&#39;t even stop it.&quot;
One local resident, who wished to remain anonymous, said: &quot;This is ridiculous, we just saw these gypsies leave the previous time, and here you go, this scourge continues.&quot;
This time there were more of them, and we even saw a horse grazing in the meadow.”
A Solihull municipality spokesman said: “We are aware of the illegal camp on land near Streetsbrook Road and are cooperating with the Solihull police; we are taking the necessary legal action to drive them out as soon as possible.”
To assist us in gathering evidence, it is essential that as many local residents as possible report any anti-social or criminal behavior to the police on 101.
This allows you to get an idea of the situation that the court will consider when we present our case to them.
Crimea joint-stock plant champagne wines &quot;New World&quot;
State Unitary Enterprise of the Republic of Crimea &quot;Plant of Champagne Wines &quot;Novy Svet&quot;&quot; was decided to corporatize, transforming it into OJSC &quot;Plant of Champagne Wines &quot;Novy Svet&quot;&quot;, follows from the order of the Minister of Property and Land Relations of Crimea Anna Anyukhina.
100% of the company&#39;s shares will remain in the state property of the Crimea.
The authorized capital of the joint-stock company will amount to 595.5 million rubles. and will consist of 5.955 million ordinary shares with a nominal value of 100 rubles. each.
The Ministry of Agriculture of the Crimea stated that if funds were not found for the modernization of the enterprise within the next three years, then there would be a threat of stopping the plant.
Depreciation of fixed assets at the enterprise is about 60-70%.
The modernization of the enterprise requires 1.2 billion rubles. Due to the peculiarities of the organizational and legal form, it is obliged to give 50% of the profit to the budget.
What remains is not enough to carry out the modernization plan.
&quot;It is problematic to get money from the owner, it is difficult to talk about raising borrowed funds from large credit organizations,&quot; Sergey Petelin, deputy head of the Crimean Ministry of Agriculture, said in April this year.
The Crimean Parliament included the enterprise in the forecast privatization plan for 2017.
It was proposed to hold it corporatization and put up for auction.
An Interfax source in the Crimean authorities estimated the possible cost of selling the enterprise at $40 million, and the investor&#39;s investment in modernization at another $30 million.
&quot;New World&quot; in 2016 increased the production of sparkling wines by 2.8% compared to the level of 2015 - up to 1.52 million bottles.
In 2017, Novy Svet intended to produce 1.6 million bottles.
The company was founded in 1878 by Prince Lev Golitsyn as a factory for the production of sparkling wine in the Novy Svet estate he acquired.
The plant is located on 11 hectares of land.
Nizhny Novgorod third-graders destroyed more than 40 tombstones
Employees of the Main Directorate of the Ministry of Internal Affairs for the Nizhny Novgorod Region identified the citizens who destroyed 46 tombstones in the cemetery of the city of Lyskovo.
The perpetrators were third grade students.
The first statement that the tombstones were damaged by unknown people was received by the Russian MIA for the Lyskovsky district on June 27.
In total, 24 people turned to the police about this.
As a result, a criminal case was initiated under article 244 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation &quot;Destruction, damage or desecration of burial places.&quot;
As a result of the investigation, the police identified the suspects, they turned out to be two schoolchildren aged 8 and 9 years.
The juvenile delinquents told the police that they were interested to see how the monuments fell, and this prompted them to hooligan actions.
Preventive measures were taken with children and their parents.
Italy is hardening its tone towards NGO ships rescuing migrants.
Italy has warned NGOs that own rescue boats in the Mediterranean that they will not be able to continue their work unless they comply with the new rules governing their activities.
&quot;If NGOs do not comply with the new code of conduct, it is difficult to say whether they will be able to continue their activities,&quot; Interior Minister Mario Minniti said in an interview with the Turin daily Stampa.
Minniti&#39;s warning came a day after Italian authorities confiscated a ship belonging to the German humanitarian organization Jugend Rettet on suspicion that its crew was actually collaborating with human traffickers and facilitating illegal immigration.
The humanitarian organization, which has worked for only a year, declined to comment on the merits of the detailed charges brought against it by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
“For us, saving human life is and will remain the highest priority, so we are very sorry that we cannot continue our activities in the search and rescue zone now,” the organization said in a social media statement.
&quot;We will be able to evaluate all the allegations made now only after we collect all the information and can assess the situation.&quot;
Italian authorities have been monitoring the Jugend Rettet&#39;s Juventa since October.
Its crew is suspected of taking on board full lifeboats migrants sent directly to them by traffickers and allowing the smugglers to leave with the boats they could reuse.
At least one such meeting is believed to have taken place just 1.3 miles from the Libyan coast, according to prosecution materials published in the Italian media.
The crew is suspected of violating the instructions of the Italian coastal authorities, which control rescue operations in the area, more out of humanitarian zeal than for any other reason.
The code of conduct stipulates mainly that the Juventa-type vessels will have on board an Italian police officer who will supervise their activities.
So far, only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to abide by the code: Save the Children, Maltese MOAS and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that it considers the new rules unnecessary but acceptable, provided they do not entail any &quot;significant change or interference&quot; with its rescue operations.
Among those who refused to sign was the Nobel Prize-winning organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Meanwhile, Minniti said the sharp decline in recent weeks in the number of migrants arriving in Italy as a result of rescue operations indicates that efforts to support the Libyan Coast Guard and cooperation with local mayors are bearing fruit.
&quot;In recent days, we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel,&quot; the minister said.
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
&quot;In Libya, we do not want to be associated with any of the parties to the conflict&quot;
The authorities of the Russian Federation have recently noticeably stepped up their policy in the Libyan direction, and delegations from the opposing Libyan sides have made frequent visits to Moscow.
The head of the Russian contact group for intra-Libyan settlement under the Russian Foreign Ministry and the State Duma, assistant to the head of the Chechen Republic, Lev Dengov, told Kommersant what goals Moscow is pursuing in this region and on whom it is relying.
Almost nothing is known about the Contact Group on Libya, which you chair.
Here, for example, is the contact group on Ukraine - everyone knows about it.
And here is a veil of secrecy.
What exactly are you doing, what are your goals?
The contact group was created on the initiative of the Russian Foreign Ministry and the State Duma.
Its activities are supervised by Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov and Adam Delimkhanov (a Duma deputy from Chechnya. - Kommersant).
The latter is authorized to work in the Libyan direction by State Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin.
The impetus for the creation of the group was the detention of the Russian tanker &quot;Mechanic Chebotarev&quot; in Libya (in September 2015, there were 11 people on board. - Kommersant).
We thought about how to help the crew.
Then a contact group was created from military experts, representatives of the State Duma, our work was supported by the head of Chechnya Ramzan Kadyrov.
And how did it happen that you led it?
Since I have been working on Libya since 2008, I was approached to lead the group.
Our activities were not limited to the release of sailors from the &quot;Mechanic Chebotarev&quot;.
We managed to establish contacts with representatives of all major groups opposing each other in the Libyan conflict - both from Tripoli (where the UN-recognized government headed by Faiz Sarraj is based. - Kommersant) and Tobruk (the seat of the parliament, which opposes the government and supports Marshal Khalifa Haftar, who controls the eastern regions of Libya. - Kommersant).
Thanks to the active participation of Ahmed Metig (Deputy Prime Minister of Libya - &quot;Kommersant&quot;), we were able to quickly agree on the release of Russian sailors.
Then it was decided to use these contacts more effectively, to create a contact group.
Its task is to analyze the situation, identify key factors and players, and dialogue with all parties to the conflict.
I want to emphasize in particular: in Libya, we do not want to be associated with any of the parties to the conflict, we are in dialogue with everyone.
How many people are in the contact group and how many of them are permanently in Libya?
Currently, the contact group includes five people.
Among them are people with experience in law enforcement agencies, including the Ministry of Defense.
We also want to introduce representatives of the Institute of the Near East of the Russian Academy of Sciences into the group of experts on the region.
None of our employees are permanently in Libya, there is no need for this yet.
Are there Russian military advisers and instructors in Libya now?
And if so, on which side?
There are no Russian military specialists in Libya.
All conversations and publications about this are not true.
But your contact group includes ex-military...
Yes, and their presence is required.
For example, when we visit hot spots.
Or such cities, closed to a certain point for us, like Misurata (where the militia units are based, which played a role in the overthrow of the Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 and noticeably intensified in subsequent years. - Kommersant).
We arrived in Misurata in January of this year.
They frightened us, they said that everyone there is entirely Islamists, terrorists.
But it was important for us to assess the situation there ourselves, to analyze the real military potential, who is responsible for what, why there are such rumors, what is the role of the Islamists there in reality.
In Misurata, we met with all representatives of the detachments that were engaged in the destruction of IS in Sirte (in December 2016, this city on the Mediterranean coast was recaptured from the militants of the Islamic State banned in Russia - Kommersant).
We wanted to look at them, get to know these people, verify the information that it was they who played a decisive role in the destruction of ISIS in Libya, and not Khalifa Haftar, who attributed these merits to himself.
And what conclusion did you come to?
&quot;Islamic state&quot; in Libya won not Haftar?
This was not what he did.
Haftar conducted operations on the other front, in Benghazi.
And IS in Sirte was fought by structures subordinate to the government in Tripoli.
And by the way, we invited the people who carried out this anti-terrorist operation to Russia.
And they arrived - the visit lasted from April 19 to April 23 this year, the Libyan delegation was received in the Federation Council, in the Duma, the Foreign Ministry and the National Guard.
You, as we understand, visit all Libyan regions and probably imagine the mood of the local elites and warlords.
Do you think it will be possible to implement the agreements on a ceasefire, on holding elections, which Khalifa Haftar and Faiz Sarraj reached in Paris at the end of July?
Or again, as has happened many times in the past, agreements will be broken, hostilities will resume, the parties will try to single-handedly seize power?
For us, a good signal was the fact that Saraj and Haftar agreed to another meeting, not so long ago it was impossible.
In the recent past, both leaders spoke extremely negatively about each other.
As for Russia&#39;s position...
They often write and say that Moscow actively supports Haftar, many people believe in it.
We encountered this situation when we were in Misurata, and on that very day Haftar boarded the Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov.
It was a coincidence.
But in Misurata they did not believe in a coincidence.
We were told: &quot;You are probably very brave people who came to us today.&quot;
But our task is precisely to show that we do not support only Haftar, we are in dialogue with all the key participants in the conflict in Libya.
You spoke with Haftar.
Does the fact that he studied in the USSR twice make it easier to understand with Russian partners on a human, emotional level?
And by the way, does Haftar know Russian?
If he knows Russian, it is very relative.
But the fact that he studied with us, of course, facilitates the dialogue with him.
And by the way, not only with him.
When we communicate with the military in Tripoli and Misrata, we meet generals who have studied either in Russia or back in the Soviet Union.
And now they speak excellent Russian.
And they are drawn to Russia, to some extent they feel nostalgia for it.
Do you think it is likely that the arms embargo imposed on Libya will soon be lifted?
Are your Libyan interlocutors interested in the supply of Russian weapons?
They are interested, of course, but, as I have already said, we do not take sides in this conflict and would not like to arm some to the detriment of others.
We would like everyone to be roughly on equal footing.
As for the arms embargo, the Libyans are constantly calling for Russia to somehow contribute to its lifting.
Now in Libya, the process of drafting a constitution is actively moving forward.
We hope that the parties will reach compromise solutions and reach an internal consensus.
Then elections should be held, which was also discussed at the meeting between Saraj and Haftar.
If the elections take place and a legitimate government is finally elected (and now none of the parties has such a status), then the question of lifting the arms embargo can be raised in the UN Security Council.
Raising this issue now is pointless and dangerous, it will only lead to an escalation of the conflict.
The other day, the media reported that Italy, faced with the problem of African refugees sailing from Libya, feels abandoned to its fate by its allies from the EU.
Can Moscow help its Italian partners in this situation by using its connections with the Libyans?
How realistic, for example, is the option that Haftar&#39;s troops will establish control over the coast and put an end to the business of smugglers who smuggle immigrants to Europe?
A very timely question.
We are actively working on this.
The Italians need Russia&#39;s support, because Moscow is conducting a dialogue with Haftar, Saraj, Misurata and the south of the country at the same time.
And in this matter, the tribes in southern Libya play a big role, and they are ready to cooperate with Russia.
Are we talking about southerners stopping the flow of migrants at distant approaches?
That is, relatively speaking, they turned back the buses in which Nigerian migrants travel?
We are striving for this.
But it&#39;s not easy.
Some clans and groups have an interest in keeping these flows going.
We hope to contribute to uniting the southerners in the negotiation process between Saraj, Haftar and the tribes in the south.
But first, we would like to see a unity of opinion on this issue between Haftar and Saraj.
The head of government in Tripoli, Faiz Saraj, is considered an Islamist, a supporter of the introduction of Sharia law in the country.
How radical are his views?
Will this become an obstacle in building relations with Russia or the West?
I will give my personal opinion about it.
In my opinion, on the contrary, he is an opponent of radical Islam.
But there are Islamists in his coalition.
Yes, but he himself adheres to the position that Libya should be an absolutely normal country - moderately Islamic, open to the world.
And he is also actively fighting terrorists.
Where did he get such a reputation from?
It was created by those countries that are not interested in Russia communicating with Tripoli.
Tripoli is the capital, where the legislative, executive and judicial branches are located.
There is a national oil corporation, a national bank and other state structures.
Of course, some countries were interested in keeping us out of it.
And we mixed all the cards for them and began to actively communicate with both Tripoli and Tobruk.
And we are already reaping the fruits of this work: Rosneft has entered into a cooperation agreement with Libya&#39;s state oil company, NOC.
NOC director Mustafa Sanalla, with whom Igor Sechin, the head of Rosneft, made a deal, himself directly from Tripoli.
And two weeks ago, the first shipment of Libyan oil to Rosneft took place.
What will Russia do with it?
I guess resell.
And what other economic interests does Russia have in Libya?
The plans to re-sign the contracts concluded under Muammar Gaddafi.
We are talking, in particular, about previous agreements in the transport sector (construction of railways), energy (electrification) and a number of others.
And the Libyans have something to pay?
Well, they have oil.
So, just like in the case with Iran, we are talking about the &quot;oil in exchange for services&quot; scheme?
I don’t know what the scheme will be, I don’t deal directly with these issues.
In fact, the economy for Russia in Libya is not the main thing.
We are there, in fact, engaged in peacekeeping work.
The main thing for us is to stop the bloodshed, to help the Libyans come to an agreement among themselves so that they can establish order in themselves and Libya ceases to be a favorable environment for the development of terrorism.
For Russia, this is precisely the main task - to help the Libyan people and squeeze the terrorists out of there.
Do you have information about the presence in Libya (now or earlier) of radical militants from Russia or other countries of the former USSR?
One of the tasks of our contact group was to find out.
I met with a representative of the Libyan State Security Committee, who said that today there is not a single native of Russia and other countries of the former USSR there.
He said that he had about 50,000 telephone records of representatives of Islamist and radical groups (in Libya. - Kommersant) and Russian was not heard there.
And from which states then are these militants?
I would not like to go into these details.
Let&#39;s formulate the question differently then.
How many Libyans themselves are among the Islamist militants in Libya?
There are practically no Libyans among them, they are no more than 5%.
The rest are strangers.
Can Moscow hold intra-Libyan talks following the example of Paris?
There are such plans.
We are actively negotiating with the Libyans, several delegations from Libya have already visited Moscow and have declared their readiness to come again - to Moscow or Grozny.
And when can such negotiations take place?
It&#39;s hard to say now.
There are still several visits to take place, and then, I hope, there will be clarity about the time and place of the talks.
In the Chekhov Museum, benefactors raised money for an expensive gift for a sick boy
In the Melikhovo Museum-Reserve near Moscow, a nine-year-old boy Sasha Matsola, who has cerebral palsy, cerebral hydrocephalus and complete blindness, will receive a specialized treadmill as a gift on August 5.
A useful present will be presented to Sasha by Oksana Kosareva, Minister of Culture of the Moscow Region, and Konstantin Bobkov, Director of the Museum.
The money for the simulator was collected during the charity marathon &quot;Don&#39;t Get Tired of Doing Good&quot;, which took place in Melikhovo on July 15 on Chekhov&#39;s Memorial Day.
On the eve of the marathon, the museum received a letter from Sasha, who lives in the village of Manushkino, Chekhov District, a letter: &quot;My eyes can&#39;t see at all, so I asked my mother to write this letter.&quot;
&quot;I would really like to receive a treadmill as a gift so that my legs become strong and I would learn to walk a little.&quot;
And Sasha&#39;s dream came true!
After the presentation, the Museum-Reserve will host a &quot;Concert-postscript&quot; - the famous pianist, Honored Artist of Russia Alexander Gindin will perform a potpourri of popular classical works.
During the charity marathon in Melikhovo, the choir of the Voznesenskaya Davydova Hermitage, the ringers of the workshop of Ilya Drozdikhin, students of the Moscow Conservatory named after P.I. Tchaikovsky and the Gnessin Russian Academy, artists of the Melikhovsky Theater &quot;Chekhov Studio&quot;.
Auctions were held for visitors, a book fair and a charity sale of souvenirs with the marathon logo were organized.
The Melikhovo Museum-Reserve took the initiative to make Chekhov&#39;s Memorial Day on July 15 a single day of charity in all museums of the Moscow region.
A 30-year-old resident of Olevsk, Zhytomyr region, near the local football stadium, fired several shots at the teenagers who were there.
According to the suspect, he was angered by the noise, FACTS was told in the communication department of the police of the Zhytomyr region.
After that, the man went to a cafe located nearby.
He had a conflict in the building, during which the man used a device for firing rubber bullets, injuring one of the visitors.
The 34-year-old victim received the necessary medical assistance, there is no threat to his life.
Police and paramedics arrived at the scene, but the shooter had fled by then.
Law enforcement officers identified him and detained him on the same day, August 2.
The man could not explain his actions.
A device for shooting rubber bullets was confiscated from him, which was sent for examination.
On this fact, criminal proceedings have been initiated under Art. 296 (hooliganism) of the Criminal Code of Ukraine.
The detainee faces imprisonment for a term of 3 to 7 years.
Recall that in Kyiv on Lukyanovka near Tatarskaya Street on the night of July 28, there was an attack with shooting.
Michelle Carter sentencing for messages that prompted Conrad Roy&#39;s suicide
A Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two and a half years in prison for using text messages and phone calls to encourage her boyfriend Conrad Roy to commit suicide.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will have to serve 15 months of her sentence behind bars and another 5 years of probation.
Carter was found guilty in June of the manslaughter of Conrad Roy, who committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
Roy&#39;s father said at Thursday&#39;s hearing: &quot;My family is heartbroken.
My son was my best friend.&quot;
Carter was allowed to remain at large pending appeal.
She faced a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her lawyers said that both she and Roy suffered from mental disorders.
Carter, dressed in red pants and a cream blouse, stood up to hear the verdict, her hands clasped and her eyes downcast.
&quot;With her actions, she killed Konrad Roy,&quot; the prosecutor told the court.
&quot;She interrupted his life to improve hers.
She did not admit responsibility,&quot; she said.
&quot;She showed no remorse.&quot;
But Carter&#39;s lawyer said it was &quot;a tragic incident that she deeply regrets.&quot;
However, Judge Lawrence Monis said he believed her &quot;age, maturity level or even mental illness did not appreciably affect her actions.&quot;
The prosecutor read statements from Roy&#39;s mother, Lynn Roy, which said: &quot;Not a single day has passed when I have not mourned the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and the way I&#39;m doing - I try to support his sisters, despite all the pain that will remain with us forever,&quot; it says.
Roy&#39;s sister Kamdin Roy said she was haunted by the thought that she would never be able to attend his wedding or be the aunt of his children.
“To lose the person who has always been with me since I was born is a pain that will stay with me for the rest of my life,” she said.
This case is likely to set a legal precedent, since there is no law in Massachusetts that would make it punishable for advising a person to commit suicide.
In 2014, when Roy was found dead in the car with symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning, Carter was 17 years old.
The case received nationwide attention when it became known that Carter&#39;s messages had driven him to suicide.
&quot;You can hang yourself, jump from a roof, stab yourself, I don&#39;t know, there are many ways,&quot; she wrote in several messages sent two weeks before his death, when he was vacationing with his family.
A few minutes before her suicide, she wrote: &quot;You have to do this, Konrad&quot; and &quot;You just need to turn on the ignition, and you will be free and happy.&quot;
Judge Moniz said Carter wanted attention with Roy&#39;s death and banned her from the press to prevent her from getting what she wanted.
Lawyers are divided on this issue.
One of the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 of the Italian murder of her British flatmate and acquitted two years later.
Knox, 30, published her dissenting opinion in the Los Angeles Times, stating: &quot;Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help, not jail.&quot;
Evgeny Bogachev: &quot;I let Langford go like a high-flying bird&quot;
One of the best basketball players of the VTB United League, 33-year-old Keith Langford left UNICS.
Care of the American defender &quot;Izvestia&quot; commented the President of UNICS Yevgeny Bogachev.
Keith made this decision for family reasons, - said Evgeny Bogachev.
He has a small child, a wife who did not want to move to Kazan.
Keith wants to be closer to home.
I decided to go towards him.
Of course, I could say &quot;no&quot; and extend his contract, but he deserved a different treatment.
He played in UNICS for three seasons and showed a high level in every match, giving all the best to 100%.
So I let him go like a high-flying bird.
We thanked him.
We wish him success in his family life and playing career.
Keith Langford played for the Kazan club for three years, winning silver in the 2015/16 United League.
In the 2016/17 season, he received the award for the most productive player of the Euroleague season.
He averaged 21.75 points per game.
This result is the second since 2004, when the award was established.
Langford, who also won the award in 2014, became only the second player in Euroleague history to win the award more than once.
In the near future, Langford will sign a contract with the Chinese “Shenzhen”, informs Eurohoops.
The American is expected to sign a 2-year, $5 million contract.
Langford will become the second Euroleague star in July to advance to the Chinese championship.
Earlier, ex-center Panathinaikos Giannis Burusis moved to the Chinese CBA.
Sunburnt tourist from Moscow region was evacuated by helicopter in Adygea
Adyghe rescuers today evacuated a tourist from the mountainous region of the republic near Moscow, who received severe sunburn, by helicopter.
The man was resting in the Fisht shelter, located at an altitude of 1.6 thousand meters.
The 27-year-old tourist had high blood pressure and difficulty breathing.
The preliminary diagnosis is a serious allergic reaction.
The head of the tour group turned to the rescuers, who said that the man received burns during the campaign.
Audi to modify up to 850,000 diesel vehicles
The day before the announcement by Audi, BMW announced that it would offer software upgrades to more than 350,000 vehicles.
BMW&#39;s chairman said the company believes &quot;there are smarter ways than driving restrictions,&quot; referring to European cities - including BMW&#39;s home of Munich - that have considered banning or restricting diesel cars. .
Daimler said Thursday it is modifying three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce their diesel emissions.
None of the companies called their move a recall.
European automakers have been actively promoting the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help comply with carbon emissions regulations.
But the nitrogen oxides emitted by diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost for automakers to install diesel aftertreatment equipment is also rising, and it is becoming difficult to maintain a competitive price for cars.
While German automakers are under scrutiny, Chancellor Angela Merkel&#39;s government has also been accused of pandering to powerful automakers and ignoring signs of trouble.
Companies are trying not to repeat the mistakes of Volkswagen, which hid the use of so-called &quot;kill devices&quot;, which during testing could adjust the amount of harmful gases emitted to comply with the rules, and in normal driving conditions turned off.
Several Volkswagen executives have been convicted in the United States, and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of the thermodynamics department of Audi&#39;s engine development team was arrested in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and therefore not immune from extradition and could face trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi came under a German criminal investigation involving Volkswagen after authorities accused Audi of installing the system to circumvent European emissions regulations and expanded an investigation that had previously focused on the United States.
Including Audi in the investigation could create serious problems for Volkswagen: the luxury car maker is the source of a disproportionate share of Volkswagen&#39;s income.
In Astrakhan, a cafe visitor paid with counterfeit money
The police received a message from an employee of a bank branch about the discovery of a suspicious banknote with a face value of 5 thousand rubles during the recounting of funds received from a public catering point.
A study conducted at the Forensic Center showed that it is fake.
According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia for the Astrakhan region, one of the cafe visitors who bought shawarma paid with a banknote.
It should be noted that the cash desk was not equipped with a device for determining the authenticity of banknotes.
Currently, the police are identifying persons involved in the manufacture and sale of a deliberately fake ticket of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation.
Such crimes are punishable by imprisonment for up to 8 years with a fine of up to 1 million rubles.
The Regional Directorate of the Ministry of Internal Affairs urges residents of the Astrakhan region to be careful when making financial transactions; employees of trade facilities are recommended to install devices to verify the authenticity of the received funds.
Astronomers have found a &quot;hellish&quot; planet, which can melt even iron
Having first studied the properties of the stratosphere of a giant exoplanet called WASP-121b, astrophysicists were surprised by its temperature, which is able to evaporate iron and other metals.
Experts noticed that water molecules are so heated by the light of a star that they emit infrared radiation.
The Hubble telescope captured the glow of water molecules on this gas giant: this heat causes the water in the planet&#39;s atmosphere to glow in the infrared.
WASP-121b belongs to the so-called &quot;hot Jupiters&quot; - gas giants comparable in size and mass to the largest planet in the solar system, but located ten times closer to the parent star.
Because of this, the year on the exoplanet lasts only 1.3 &quot;Earth&quot; days, and its gaseous shell is heated to almost 2,500 degrees Celsius.
Climate change threatens lavender in Provence.
It has become a symbol of Provence and Southern France, but there are now concerns that it is threatened by climate change.
Lavender has become slower growing due to dry weather and disease-carrying insects; this has caused a constant headache for scientists and farmers who are trying to find a solution.
Eric Chess, an expert from Provence-based agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM, says: &quot;Lavender is really under threat in Provence, because in recent years this plant has been feeling the effects of climate change: in spring and especially in autumn, rains have become much less.
This affects the lifespan of lavender.
And then there are the little cicadas, leaf-hopping insects carrying micro-bacteria; in very dry weather there are a lot of them.&quot;
There is a lot at stake.
Lavender not only attracts vacationers; Lavender oil is very popular in perfumery and cosmetology.
Eric Shes says: &quot;Instead of very long spikes with many large flowers, we have small, underdeveloped, weakened or absent.
Therefore, we have fewer parts containing essential oil.&quot;
Solutions currently being considered include improving water distribution and slowing evaporation from the soil, as well as spraying plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and breeding varieties that are more drought tolerant.
Ambassador of the Winter Universiade 2019 met with schoolchildren from Krasnoyarsk
Two-time World Ice Hockey Champion, Ambassador of the Winter Universiade 2019 Alexander Semin met with novice hockey players the day before and signed autographs for the fans.
The meeting was held in the tent of the Winter Universiade 2019 as part of a thematic week dedicated to ice hockey.
Any visitor to the tent could ride on skates on the platform with artificial ice.
In addition, relay races, quizzes and games with drawing of souvenirs from student games, a warm-up from the aerobics federation were organized.
The event was attended by 50 students.
Alexander Semin advised the children to play as much as possible on the sports grounds and stressed that the most important thing at the initial stage of training is hard work and a great desire to play hockey.
&quot;It&#39;s great that in Krasnoyarsk there is such a platform as the tent of the Winter Universiade 2019, where novice athletes can directly ask questions to the team coaches,&quot; the champion said.
It should be noted that the ambassadors of the Winter Universiade 2019 help promote student sports and a healthy lifestyle among Krasnoyarsk residents.
The Universiade tent will operate throughout the summer season until September 25, the press service of the Winter Universiade 2019 Directorate reports.
The State Department commented on the words of Medvedev
US State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert, commenting on the words of Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev at a briefing, stated the need to find &quot;areas for interaction&quot; with Russia.
According to her, such areas should be found in order to &quot;improve bilateral interaction.&quot;
Nauert called the ceasefire agreement on Syria an example of such successful cooperation.
We are two nuclear superpowers.
&quot;And people around the world agree that the US and Russia should be able to work with each other,&quot; the diplomat said.
At the same time, Nauert declined to comment on Medvedev&#39;s assertion of a full-fledged trade war between Russia and the United States.
&quot;If Russia said such things, then, of course, it has the right to speak, but I can&#39;t say anything more on this subject,&quot; the representative of the State Department said.
Earlier, US President Donald Trump signed a bill to tighten sanctions against the Russian Federation.
Commenting on the new package of sanctions, Russian Prime Minister Medvedev said that Washington had declared a full-fledged trade war on Moscow, putting an end to hopes for improving bilateral relations.
Medvedev also said that US sanctions would be in effect for decades.
In addition, the Prime Minister believes, the American establishment &quot;outright beat&quot; Trump.
Lost in the suburbs of the bodybuilder was found in a strange dacha lost his memory
Bodybuilder Shamil Khanmetov disappeared on the road to Noginsk on July 25 under very piquant circumstances: he left the car to go to the toilet.
For seven days he was unsuccessfully searched for by acquaintances and local residents.
And Shamil was found at someone else&#39;s dacha in Ramenskoye.
He was discovered completely naked in his toilet by the owner.
The Dagestan athlete could not explain how he ended up here and what happened to him.
He could not even remember his name, and his passport was gone.
The announcement of his disappearance helped establish his identity.
The doctors who arrived on the call recorded a partial memory loss and a head injury in Khanmetov, according to the public Mash.
Probably, the athlete is waiting for other surprises.
The attackers who abducted Shamil have probably already visited his apartment, the keys to which were also stolen from him.
Oil and gas revenues in July exceeded the forecast by 7.4 billion rubles
The actual oil and gas revenues received in July 2017 exceeded the estimate by 7.4 billion rubles, according to the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation.
The excess, the agency explains, was mainly due to a higher US dollar/ruble exchange rate compared to the June monthly average used for the estimate, as well as due to the fact that the actual volume of gas production and the volume of exports of petroleum products exceeded forecast levels.
&quot;The deviation of oil and gas revenues of the federal budget from the monthly estimate corresponding to the Federal Law on the federal budget for 2017-2019 is projected in August 2017 in the amount of +40.2 billion rubles,&quot; the Ministry of Finance said in a statement.
Thus, the total amount of funds allocated for the purchase of foreign currency in the domestic foreign exchange market in the period from August 7 to September 6, 2017 is 47.6 billion rubles.
Accordingly, the daily volume of purchases of foreign currency will amount to the equivalent of 2.07 billion rubles.
The Bank of Russia will be involved in the execution of foreign currency purchase transactions by the Ministry of Finance of Russia.
Each working day during the specified period, the Central Bank will conclude transactions for the purchase of foreign currency at the organized auction of the Moscow Exchange evenly throughout the trading day.
The purchased foreign currency will be credited to the accounts of the Federal Treasury in the Central Bank.
The murder of a journalist highlights the growing danger in Mexico.
The staff of the weekly newspaper Ryodose usually meet on Wednesdays to discuss plans to cover the latest violent crime in the state of Sinaloa, linked to organized crime, corrupt officials or the ongoing drug war.
But today, overwhelmed by their own tragedy, they met to talk about safety.
They were told that they should change their habits.
The two senior journalists discussed whether it seemed safer to take the children with them to the office, which had already been hit by a grenade in 2009, or to leave them at home.
Security experts wrote three words on a blackboard hanging in the room: enemies, neutrals, allies.
They asked the journalists to give names for each column - no evidence needed, suspicions and inner feelings would be enough.
These are drug dealers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of being on the payroll of the government or the cartels, a whole list of scoundrels, because of which the work of covering the chaos in Mexico becomes dangerous.
The violence does not give respite, and among the corpses that multiply in the country, more and more journalists: according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, at least 25 since President Enrico Pena Nieto took office in December 2012; 589 people after attacks and threats are under federal protection; and this year, at least seven people have died in seven states.
Among the latter is their publisher and inspirer, Riodose co-founder Javier Valdes Cardenas.
&quot;The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist,&quot; Valdez wrote in one of his many books on violent drug crime.
His absence is felt very acutely, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez showing the middle finger, with the inscription &quot;Justice&quot; hanging on the facade of the Ryodose building; two reporters in their 30s, Aaron Ybarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts that feature his smile, his bespectacled face, or his signature panama hat.
The seminar takes place less than two months after his death; journalists discuss their shared trauma, their nightmares, their insomnia, their paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor&#39;s office was set up in 2010 to investigate journalistic cases, only two cases have been investigated so far, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.
As is the case with most of the thousands of drug- and organized-crime-related murders committed each year, the killers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.
Ryodose journalists insist that they will write about the violence in Sinaloa, although they are heartbroken, although the surroundings are now much more dangerous.
Without information about the killers, without justice, talking about security at meetings is of little use, says Ibarra.
&quot;It&#39;s very stupid to waste time in this seminar,&quot; he says.
&quot;Until we know the cause, we suspect everyone.&quot;
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the Riodose office in Culiacan, the state capital.
He only managed a couple of blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was pulled over by two men; he was pulled out of the car and shot 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which means &quot;Twelfth River&quot;.
The shooter drove off in his car and wrecked it nearby.
Valdes was 50 years old.
He left behind a wife and two adult children.
Rumors usually spread quickly around Culiacan.
But almost everyone is silent about Valdez.
Since Guzman was arrested and extradited to the US last January, Sinaloa has become one of the country&#39;s bloodiest battlefields as rival factions fight to fill the vacuum.
Let&#39;s not talk about the fact that one or more people are killed on the streets of Sinaloa every day, or that the cemetery is filled with the ornate two-story mausoleums of drug kings, which are larger than the homes of many living people.
Let&#39;s forget for a moment that a state of &quot;calm&quot; is simply when one of the cartels takes control of a seaside state with important ports and drug trafficking routes leading to the United States.
Despite this, and despite the fact that Valdez was well aware of the dangers of his job, Ismail Bojorquez, the 60-year-old co-founder and director of Ryodose, is crushed by guilt for failing to protect his friend.
He thinks two mistakes helped the murder.
First, in February, an interview was published with Damaso López, the leader of one of the cartel&#39;s rival factions that is at war with the sons of Guzmán.
The publication might have angered the sons; people believed to be members of the gang bought up all copies of the publication as soon as they were delivered to the newsstands.
The second mistake was that he did not force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after another newspaper that was reporting the same story was seized.
Valdes was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder was seen as another milestone in the development of violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had been away from danger for so long, his friends and colleagues thought he would always be.
He was an experienced reporter at Noroesta and in 2003, along with five colleagues, founded Riodose by selling his $50 shares.
In Sinaloa, &quot;it was impossible to do journalism without talking about drugs,&quot; Bojorquez said.
Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for being bold and honest, and sales and advertising revenue grew.
Journalists liked that they could publish bold reports without fear of censorship, and readers were attracted to the fact that in this publication they could read about what no one else dared to write about.
Eight years after its founding, Ryodose received the prestigious Maria Moores Cabo Award for reporting in Latin America.
That same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award for his courage in investigating Mexico&#39;s drug trade, wherever it may lead.
He frankly admitted that he was scared.
&quot;I want to move on with my life,&quot; he said at the CPJ awards.
Drug dealing in Sinaloa &quot;is a way of life,&quot; he told Rompeviento TV last October.
&quot;You have to accept the tasks that fall on you as a journalist - either that or you&#39;re just fooling around.&quot;
I don&#39;t want to be asked, &quot;What were you doing when there were so many deaths around...why didn&#39;t you tell me what was going on?&quot;
The Riodose staff miss Valdes, the prankster who swore like a porter, a friend generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to keep alive.
They relied on their established order.
He had to always wear his hat.
He had to go to El Guayabo, the bar across from the office, and always sit at the same table there.
Now they ask: was it his love for a once-in-a-lifetime routine that ruined him?
His death made them question their calculations of how best to do their job and stay alive.
&quot;They don&#39;t like it when you look into their wives, their children, their legal businesses, and their illegal drug airfields.
&quot;Those things were off the charts,&quot; Bojorquez said.
The result, even at the best of times, was a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
You have to trust your instincts.
Stay away from things that smell bad.
The problem, says Riodose editor Andrés Villareal, is that &quot;the sense of smell can be tricked...and then what happened to Javier happens.&quot;
The old rules, he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa - as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where there is a poisonous mixture of lucrative smuggling routes, weak state institutions and corrupt officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
Cell phones were suddenly banned from entering the room where Riodose employees had gathered for security training, days before it became known that spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, is being used in Mexico to spy on journalists and social activists.
Outside, two policemen take shelter in the shade of a tree from the 104-degree heat (40 degrees Celsius).
They were tasked by the state government to guard the Ryodose office, which is located in a four-story building in the bourgeois quarter of Culiacan.
Some journalists half-jokingly asked if these police officers were among the 50 percent of law enforcement officers about whom the governor himself said that they could not be trusted.
A few months ago, journalists traveled to the mountainous area, which is de facto controlled by drug gangs.
In the next issue of &quot;Riodose&quot; counted on three main themes.
This is the murder in Sinaloa of the brother of former boxing champion Julio Cesar Chavez.
They also had exposure of government spending concentrated in the governor&#39;s hometown.
And there was a group kidnapping in one of Culiacan&#39;s most expensive restaurants, a block from the prosecutor&#39;s office.
It has not been officially announced who was kidnapped or how it happened, so care had to be taken when it came time to write about what everyone in the city knew: that it was the favorite restaurant of both drug dealers and the authorities.
One of the journalists learned from open databases that the restaurant was registered in the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which has dominated all levels of government for almost the past century.
Recently, high-profile allegations of corruption have been leveled against several PRI governors.
Villareal asked journalists to write about previous incidents at the restaurant, including one when &quot;El Chapo&quot; Guzmán&#39;s son eluded a military raid.
A few months ago, readers would have been looking for Valdez&#39;s column with the most reliable information about the kidnapping.
&quot;Earlier we would have known what happened,&quot; says Villarreal, 46, nicknamed &quot;El Flaco&quot; for his lean physique.
&quot;Today all channels of communication with our sources have been severed.&quot;
Valdez&#39;s office is now being used as a warehouse for posters and stickers protesting the killings of journalists, because the staff have become what they never thought they would be: press activists.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez took some posters and went the next morning to a demonstration outside the local prosecutor&#39;s office dedicated to another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the state of Michoacán in the west of the country three days after Valdes was killed.
A burnt body was found and authorities said it was him based on DNA tests.
Across the country, journalists began to speak out louder, organize protests and write &quot;SOS Press&quot; on sidewalks and walls.
Director Bojorquez was in Washington that day, trying to garner international support for justice in the Valdez case.
In a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez&#39;s assassination, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and ordering their assassinations for telling the truth.
After that, she asked not to be given more assignments to cover the activities of the government, fearing that anger would damage her objectivity.
Valdez has said many times that journalists in Mexico are &quot;surrounded&quot; by organized crime, its accomplices in the government, and an indifferent society.
In his latest book, Drug Journalism, he wrote that it&#39;s not just drug gangs that kill reporters; they do so at the behest of politicians and security forces in collusion with organized crime.
The press protection committee Articulo 19 believes that half of the attacks on journalists last year were ordered by police and government officials.
&quot;In Mexico, you die because they want to shut you up,&quot; Ramirez says.
Of course, killings intimidate people.
Everyone remembers the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias six years ago in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
A note was found on her body, believed to be from the Zetas cartel: &quot;I&#39;m here for my articles.&quot;
A computer keyboard and headphones lay next to her severed head.
Some publications chose to close down, like El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after its correspondent Miroslava Brich was killed in March.
Others continue to hang on, like &quot;El Mañana&quot; from Nuevo Laredo after the assassination of its leader in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with a front-page editorial titled &quot;What do you want from us?&quot;
Some journalists have left their home states or even the country.
It&#39;s a painful decision.
It&#39;s hard to find work in exile, and they&#39;re still on the lookout for danger on the streets.
And sometimes they are killed, as apparently was the case with photographer Rubén Espinoza, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico three months after fleeing Veracruz.
Those who stay and continue to work balance risky decisions daily.
Ybarra - who once dreamed of being a poet - admits he&#39;s terrified of writing about the drug trade.
&quot;Mexico is going to hell and that&#39;s why I became a journalist,&quot; he says.
Last Friday at midnight, when the last issue was ready for print, the publishers of Ryodose were sitting on the sidewalk outside the office drinking beer when all of a sudden their phones rang at the same time.
A series of shootings between rival gangs and security forces near the resort town of Mazatlán left behind a confirmed 19 dead.
The war continued to escalate, as promised in a series of messages from the cartels found in the area.
Sitting on the sidewalk, they posted the news on the Ryodose website via their mobile phones.
The first page had to be redone the next day.
Sirens wailed nearby, another firefight in the vicinity.
The Bohorques looked to see if the police guarding them were ready for defense.
If they were scared, they didn&#39;t show it.
Sitting under a huge portrait of the deceased founder of their newspaper, whose middle finger was exposed to all of Sinaloa, the Ryodose staff continued his work.
&quot;How can you think about shutting down,&quot; said Bojorquez, &quot;if on the very day that Javier was killed, an intern asked me to send her outside to report?&quot;
Dinosaur used camouflage to avoid enemies
At first glance, it seems like a statue, albeit a terrifying one.
The first found remains of the incredible rhinoceros-sized creature discovered by a Canadian miner are so well-preserved that experts have dubbed it the &quot;Mona Lisa of dinosaurs,&quot; researchers say.
It was so well-preserved that they were even able to determine that its scaly skin color was reddish-brown - and to say that it had, in some ways, a &quot;dark past.&quot;
In a report published in the journal Modern Biology, it was described as &quot;the best-preserved Thyreophora ever found and one of the finest dinosaur specimens in the world.&quot;
This fossil is a recently found specimen of a nodosaurus that lived during the mid-Cretaceous period, between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
Its incredible good condition has stunned researchers, who call it &quot;really remarkable.&quot;
This herbivorous thyreophore is the best-preserved fossil of its kind ever found, according to articles in National Geographic magazine.
It was found by Sean Funk while working at the Suncore Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada on March 21, 2011.
He came across something that seemed to be different from the surrounding rock and decided to take a closer look.
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Paleontological Museum.
For the next six years, work was underway to find the animal inside a 2,500-foot (1,100 kilogram) block of earth.
Now that all this hard work is done, the finished result can be shown.
&quot;You just squint a little and you can almost believe it&#39;s asleep,&quot; said lead author Caleb Brown, a research fellow at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology, where the creature is on display.
&quot;It will go down in the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa among dinosaurs.&quot;
By examining its skin, the researchers found that this herbivore, despite being armored and resembling a walking tank, appeared to be in considerable danger from carnivorous dinosaurs.
This powerfully armored dinosaur used red and white camouflage to hide from predators and employed a defensive technique known as camouflage coloration, which is also used by many animals today.
This would allow it to blend in more quickly and avoid enemies, experts say, suggesting it was preyed upon by larger dinosaurs.
This 110-million-year-old nodosaur creature was widely publicized in May and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
Scientists have already studied the animal and have given it the name Borealopelta markmitchelli, after museum lab assistant Mark Mitchell, one of the team members who spent more than 7,000 hours on its painstaking excavation.
The amazing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of the scales and armor plates on his body.
They found camouflage coloration, a common method of defense in the animal kingdom, meaning that the creature&#39;s top was darker than its underside.
While camouflage coloration is well-established, the discovery came as a surprise because the Borealopelta dinosaur is much larger than living camouflage animals.
It can be assumed that this dinosaur was so actively hunted by carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution preferred camouflage to confrontation as a way of survival.
But most modern animals with camouflage coloration—such as deer, zebras, or armadillos—are much smaller and more accessible prey, suggesting that nodosaurus had to struggle to survive.
&quot;The massive predatory threat to the massive, heavily armored dinosaur shows just how dangerous the carnivorous dinosaurs of the Cretaceous were,&quot; Brown said.
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in dinosaur scales also suggests that its skin must have been reddish brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal, looking for information about its life, including the preserved contents of its digestive tract, to find out what it ate during its last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, it fell into the river and was swept out to sea, where it sank and lay back down on the ocean floor.
In those days, Alberta was as warm as southern Florida is now, and the rivers and oceans likely extended much further inland than they do now.
“This nodosaurus is truly remarkable in that it is completely covered in preserved scaly skin, and at the same time completely preserved in three dimensions, retaining the original shape of the animal,” Brown said.
“As a result, the animal now looks almost the same as it did then, in the Early Cretaceous.
You don&#39;t have to use your imagination much to recreate it, you just have to squint a little and you can almost believe that he is sleeping.
The Cretaceous Period is an era when giant theropods, bipedal carnivorous dinosaurs, roamed the Earth.
Although the most remarkable of them, the Tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years later than Borealopelta, one of its formidable ancestors may have hunted the thyreophora.
They include the Acrocanthosaurus, a monster 38 feet (11.5 meters) long and weighing six tons.
The scientists, whose latest discoveries are being published in the journal Modern Biology, believe that Borealopelta was swept out to sea after death and mummified in mud.
The creature was found by Sean Funk while working at the Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada on March 21, 2011.
According to museum staff, it is the best-preserved thyreophore in the world, complete with skin and shell, and is intact from muzzle to thighbones.
On average, these creatures were about 18 feet (five meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kilograms).
Their characteristic feature was two twenty-inch spikes protruding from their shoulders.
Researchers believe this herbivorous thyreophore was plodding heavily through what is now Canada until a flooded river swept it out to sea.
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur preserved its shell to the smallest detail.
The fossil remains of this particular specimen are so well-preserved that remnants of the skin still cover the bumpy carapace plates along the dinosaur&#39;s skull.
As Michael Greshko wrote in an article for National Geographic magazine, this degree of preservation is &quot;as rare as winning the lottery.&quot;
The longer I look at it, the more amazing it seems.
The fossilized remnants of the skin still cover the bumpy armored plates that dot the animal&#39;s skull.

Mikheil Saakashvili managed to enter Poland without documents
Mikheil Saakashvili, who previously headed Georgia and then the Odessa region in Ukraine, flew to Poland.
At the same time, he did this without having documents confirming his identity and citizenship.
The arrival of Saakashvili is reported by the Polish publication Telewizja Republika, which posted a video of his speech on its YouTube channel.
Saakashvili spoke at an event marking the anniversary of the Warsaw uprising against Nazi troops in 1944.
Since the politician does not know Polish, although he tried to start his speech in this language, he had to speak in English through a Polish translator.
During his speech, the politician touched upon the topic of cooperation between Georgia and Poland, and also spoke about Ukraine.
The fact that the migration service of Ukraine deprived him of citizenship, the disgraced politician found out while in the United States.
How exactly he managed to make a transatlantic flight without documents is still unknown.
Earlier, the former governor of the Odessa region, Mikheil Saakashvili, said that his signature on the application form for obtaining Ukrainian citizenship was forged.
The politician emphasized that he did not fill out any questionnaires.
Investigation term in Vainzikher and Olkhovik case extended until January
The term of the preliminary investigation in the case of the co-owner of the Renova group of companies, Yevgeny Olkhovik, and the head of the T Plus energy holding, Boris Vainzikher, has been extended until January 2, 2018.
On Thursday, August 3, the Basmanny Court is considering the extension of house arrest for the accused.
The representative of the Investigative Committee at the meeting announced the decision to extend the period of the preliminary investigation for the last time.
&quot;The special complexity and duration of the investigation is due to the need to seize and conduct an examination of a large number of documents, as well as to conduct investigative actions on the territory of several subjects of the Russian Federation,&quot; the investigator said.
He added that the suspects regularly paid bribes to the Komi leadership.
Their total size is estimated at at least a billion rubles.
According to the investigation, Vainzikher, Olkhovik, as well as the former head of CJSC Integrated Energy Systems Mikhail Slobodin, who until September 5 headed Vimpelcom, transferred bribes to top officials of the Komi Republic for setting the most favorable tariffs for heat and electricity, as well as for creating favorable conditions for business.
Vainzikher and Olkhovik were detained, transferred to Syktyvkar and arrested for two months, Slobodin fled from the investigation and was put on the federal wanted list.
How one activist learned the answer to the question “Whose streets?”
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shocked to the core.
Barely a day after arriving in New York on a tourist trip, the St. Louis native was sitting on a bed in an Airbnb apartment, scrolling through her Facebook feed on her phone.
She came across the post of someone from high school.
It said: &quot;The police have just killed an eighteen-year-old child, and he is still lying in the middle of the street.&quot;
Noticing that no one else in her feed had posted this information, puzzled, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
In her feed, there were many reposts by a user with the nickname @TheePharoah.
The Greater St. Louis rapper tweeted real-time coverage of the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a photograph of Brown&#39;s lifeless body, sprawled across the street, where it would lie for four hours.
This is crazy, Ferrel thought.
But death was nothing new to her and her circle.
She put her phone down and later in the evening returned to tweeting that people were gathering on Canfield Drive.
There were pictures of signal tape and people screaming and a man claiming to be Brown&#39;s father holding a sign that said, &quot;A Ferguson cop just killed my unarmed son!&quot;
She watched a live broadcast of a police officer standing in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, another police officer, she said, cocked his rifle and yelled, &quot;I&#39;m going to kill you all... animals!&quot;
“This is not a standard situation,” according to her own recollections, Ferrel said then.
“This is not a murder that we are used to and which we can call typical.
At that moment, I felt chills.
I got angry and cried.&quot;
She took a return ticket and flew home the next day.
Landing at 11pm, she picked up her six-year-old daughter from her father&#39;s house and decided that they would both leave for Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next almost three years is the subject of a new documentary, Whose Streets?, which will be released on August 11.
It is a tale of survival and rebellion, love and loss, strength and resilience from the point of view of the people who live in the community and fill the streets demanding answers.
As Ferrell drove to Ferguson with her daughter, dressed in a floral dress and matching wreath, they reminisced about the conversation they&#39;d had countless times before that morning &quot;about the black experience and their condition.&quot;
She recalls saying, “Remember how I told you about how black people had to fight for what they believed in?
We&#39;re on our way to Ferguson now because a police officer killed an eighteen-year-old boy and it wasn&#39;t right.&quot;
&quot;I couldn&#39;t help but take it,&quot; Ferrell later said.
“What is happening today is the culmination of ... what happened before.
She should know about it, see it and be brought up on it.
She must not only be well versed in activism and organization, but also understand the different levels of experience of black people and their situation and what we must do to become free, to be free.
Even if I manage to provide her with an environment where she herself does not personally experience obvious racism, she is no different from any other black girl.
I feel like I would be doing her a disservice if I shielded her from this.”
When they arrived in Ferguson, they made their first stop on South Florissant Road, a site across the street from the police station that became a sort of campground while activists waited for reports of Officer Darren Wilson&#39;s eventual non-indictment.
There, Ferrell and her daughter joined a local entrepreneur who prepared lunch bags.
They collected packages and helped distribute them to the protesters.
Little by little, a new type of activism took shape in Ferrell&#39;s mind.
“My activism completely changed after August 9,” she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. .
“I had no experience as an organizer.
It just came.&quot;
A few weeks later, at an evening demonstration, Ferrel met Sabaa Folayan, one of her co-directors.
Folayan said that she and her chief cameraman, Lucas Alvarado-Ferrar, &quot;just wanted to document&quot; the events.
Ferrel came up with a question: &quot;Are you looking to document, or are you trying to find a story to play with?&quot;
This skepticism was inspired by numerous people, often whites, who came to the community to capitalize on its pain and resilience.
As Folayan explained in a recent interview, &quot;We heard that the voices of people who were born and raised in Ferguson weren&#39;t getting into the limelight, and we wanted to do it differently.&quot;
Folayan had already teamed up with her co-director Damon Davis, a local artist known for his death row activism.
His participation evoked sympathy for the project among Ferrel and six other local residents with whom the project team Whose Streets? kept in touch during the years since Brown&#39;s assassination.
“In this documentary, no one is speaking for us or to us, it is we who are speaking,” said Davis.
&quot;That was the most important thing for me, how these people would be presented, because that&#39;s how I would be presented myself.&quot;
While the project&#39;s intent was not to focus on Ferrel&#39;s experience at all - in an effort to show that the movement &quot;isn&#39;t about a savior leader, it&#39;s about bringing the community together,&quot; Folayan said - she was the most open of the film&#39;s participants.
As a result, in &quot;Whose streets?&quot; shows unexpectedly personal aspects of Ferrel&#39;s life, such as how she fell in love and married her wife.
“I felt naked,” Ferrel said, laughing about the first time she saw the finished product.
“But I understood that when you do this kind of work and humanize black people, there must be some level of vulnerability.”
In addition, Ferrell&#39;s story again discusses and highlights the role of the black gay woman within the larger context of the Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement — those who created the #BlackLivesMatter social media tag after the murder of black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 — identify themselves as gay.
“Black gay women in leadership positions support this whole movement,” says Ferrel. “That’s because we are constantly fighting on multiple fronts.
Black homosexual women have to bear all this burden.”
Folayan agreed with this statement, noting that &quot;the movement is, in fact, supported by black women and a lot of homosexual black women.&quot;
However, she insists that &quot;this is not a case of affirmative action&quot; and that Ferrell was not chosen as the film&#39;s central character due to her distinctive features.
&quot;She was the person who evoked that energy,&quot; she said.
“On the other hand, it’s not a coincidence that she was in the forefront, because when”
You can feel her energy through the screen.”
Meanwhile, Ferguson is long gone from movie cameras, but complex racial ties remain between the community and the police.
Ferrell will be on probation for another two and a half years for blocking a highway during a demonstration.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the place she calls home simply: &quot;A mess.&quot;
She&#39;s still holding on to the slogan she learned when she took to the streets of Ferguson a full three years ago.
We must fight for our freedom.
We must win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains.&quot;
Two Salvadoran footballers suspended for biting US players
El Salvador internationals Henry Romero and Darvin Seren have been suspended for unsportsmanlike conduct.
During the quarterfinal match of the Golden Cup of the Confederations of Football of North and Central America and the Caribbean (CONCACAF), Salvadorans bit American players.
Defenseman Henry Romero scored first.
The Salvadoran bit striker Josie Altidore, after which he pinched his chest.
Then midfielder Seren bit US defender Omar Gonzalez while taking a corner in his penalty area.
As a result, Romero was suspended for three matches and Seren for six.
The meeting itself ended with the victory of the Americans with a score of 2:0, reports Goal.com.
The emergence of similarity: the artist creates portraits with the DNA of Chelsea Manning
In the center of the room at the Friedman Gallery in New York, people&#39;s faces hang from the ceiling on a wire - white, black and brown, all subtly similar to each other.
These 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Harborg from cheek swabs and hair clippings sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the clippings from Fort Leavenworth Prison, where the former intelligence analyst is serving a 35-year sentence for the famous WikiLeaks transmission of confidential diplomatic cables.
The new exhibition, which opened on August 2, is called &quot;The Emergence of Similarities.&quot;
It is the result of a two-year correspondence between Dewey-Harborg, whose art combines technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transgender woman and prominent dissident whose sentence was commuted by Barack Obama just three days before the end of his presidency.
By analyzing the DNA obtained from Manning with a computer program and using it to create three-dimensional portraits of faces that people with such a genome could have, Dewey-Harborg created a profound, albeit difficult to understand, manifesto about not only the plasticity of DNA data - different ways of interpreting them and the inherent determinism of these interpretations, but also the notion of identity.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward but has been open about identifying as a woman since adolescence, was sentenced in 2013 to 20 counts, including six violations of the Espionage Act, computer fraud and theft.
Photos of her in prison were not available, so only one photograph of her was known: a grainy black-and-white selfie of Manning, in a platinum-hued wig, clearly uncomfortable driving a car; it was with this photograph that she became associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Harborg completed her 2012 project Visions of Strangers with great success.
In it, the artist created portraits of unknown people using forensic evidence such as cigarette butts and chewing gum, isolating DNA from this garbage and creating images of what these people might look like.
And then she got an email from Paper Magazine.
&quot;They interviewed Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted a portrait to illustrate the article,&quot; Dewey-Hagborg explained at a preview of the new press exhibition.
At the time, Chelsea could not be visited or photographed, so they contacted her and asked if she would like a portrait created from her DNA.
In an unusual way, the artist and her imprisoned muse became pen pals and exchanged several letters over the course of two years.
They even wrote a comic book, Repressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which depicted how in the future the President would tame Chelsea&#39;s punishment so that Chelsea could visit the exhibition in person.
That Obama actually decided to release Manning just days after the book was published came as a pleasant surprise after seven difficult years in a Kansas military prison.
There&#39;s something deep and powerful about the fact that the exhibition is opening right now, as Donald Trump is declaring war on people who give away classified information in the government and devising new ways to stir up the animosity on Twitter that he&#39;s supposed to moderate.
When Dewey-Harborg was asked about the coincidence of all this in time, she said that &quot;nothing happens by chance.&quot;
In the artist&#39;s statement written on the gallery wall, Manning&#39;s huge caption at the bottom (with a heart instead of the dot over the &quot;i&quot; in her last name) calls for an end to &quot;automatic segregation based on gender, race, sexual orientation and culture.&quot;
On the opposite side is her mitochondrial DNA, a long caterpillar of penciled C, G, and A.
By including 200 letters (or nucleotides, as the artist sophistically puts it), Dewey-Harborg hoped to show how remarkably similar we all are, at least in our biological structure.
&quot;I hope to explain to people that our genome does not define what we are, how open the genetic data is to interpretation and how subjective it is,&quot; said Dewey-Harborg; her 2007 video work &quot;False Memories&quot; is also featured here.
&quot;DNA data can tell us so many different stories, and 30 of those stories are here.&quot;
The last part of the exposition, which fit into one room, is the novel in comics mentioned above.
It shows Manning, in the style of King Kong, appearing above the US Penitentiary Barracks building with a loudspeaker in his hand.
&quot;If they kill your speech, they will win,&quot; it says.
&quot;So never shut up.&quot;
&quot;This is a direct quote from a letter she wrote to me,&quot; says the artist, greeting us from Philadelphia.
&quot;I still get goosebumps when I talk about it.&quot;
Manning has not yet seen the exhibit in person - as the comics have presciently portrayed - but when she arrives, she will be greeted by masks in the center of the room, her own genomic simulacra gathered like crowds of protesters.
This is also done on purpose, like everything else in the exhibition, up to the height (5&quot;2, Manning&#39;s height), on which the genetic haplogroups were drawn with a pencil.
&quot;I used to hang them on the walls, but now I wanted them to look like a crowd of people,&quot; Dewey-Harborg says of the portraits.
&quot;I wanted them to be like the grassroots movement that formed around Chelsea, the movement that was behind her liberation as well.&quot;
Northwestern University professor and Oxford University staff wanted by police on murder charges
A Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University staff member are being sought as suspects after a man was found stabbed to death in a luxurious Chicago suite, according to police.
Arrest warrants were issued Monday for premeditated murder without bail for 42-year-old Wyndham Latham and 56-year-old Andrew Warren in connection with their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton G. James Cornell-Duranlo, according to Cook County court records.
The 26-year-old Cornell-Duranlo died after being stabbed multiple times, according to documents.
An alert issued by the Chicago Police Department states that the body was found on July 27.
The police received a call, they arrived at the Grand Plaza apartment complex and found the victim with several wounds on his body.
Cornell-Duranlo was pronounced dead at the scene of the crime, officials say, and detectives are now investigating the stabbing death as a homicide, while police are on the hunt for two suspects.
Latham has been an Associate Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan C. Cabbage, the university&#39;s vice president of communications, said in an emailed statement that Latham is on administrative leave and is barred from entering Northwestern&#39;s campuses.
“Now this is a criminal case that is being investigated by authorized persons, and Northwestern University is cooperating with the investigation,” Kabbaj said.
Warren is a Senior Financial Officer at the University of Oxford.
A spokesperson for the university and Somerville College said in an emailed statement: &quot;We have been in contact with UK police and stand ready to provide any assistance necessary to US investigators.&quot;
The statement also said that Warren&#39;s colleagues were shocked and wanted him to turn himself in.
Chicago Police Department communications chief Anthony Guglielmi said he strongly advises suspects to turn themselves in to authorities.
&quot;The police have a hunch about their whereabouts, but our efforts to find them are intensifying,&quot; Guglielmi said.
According to Guglielmi, local, regional and federal authorities are assisting in the search for suspects.
According to Guglielmi, the cops received a call from the administrator of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a cryptic message that something had happened in room 1008.
The police called the crime scene gruesome.
Guglielmi said it was not clear if the incident itself took place on 27 July.
According to him, the data from the video cameras confirm that Latham and Warren were in the building.
&quot;We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship,&quot; Guglielmi said.
Grand Plaza management issued a letter to residents stating: &quot;Police are currently working on the chronology of the incident, gathering information about the victim and considering a number of motives, including a possible domestic incident.&quot;
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko: &quot;We will fulfill the requirements of the WADA roadmap in the near future&quot;
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that the conditions set by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for the resumption of the work of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) would be met in the near future.
&quot;A certain stage in fulfilling the requirements has been passed, RUSADA has received the right to plan and conduct tests together with UKAD (the UK Anti-Doping Agency).
The WADA roadmap has been updated accordingly,&quot; Mutko said on Thursday.
The Prime Minister commented on the second part of the WADA Roadmap for Restoring Code Compliance status, which lists the conditions for the resumption of RUSADA operations and was recently published on the organization&#39;s website.
According to Mutko, it does not contain anything that could present difficulties for Russia.
&quot;Everything has been announced, everything will be done.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future,&quot; he added.
However, one of the requirements included in the list implies that Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly acknowledge the results of a WADA-commissioned investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, which alleged that doping in Russian sports is controlled by the state.
Referring to the issue, Mutko said: &quot;We are investigating because our anti-doping system has failed.
All measures have been taken.
But there were no state programs, and we will not recognize what was not.&quot;
Mutko echoed the words of Vitaly Smirnov, head of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
On the morning of the same day, in an interview with the Russian edition of Rsport, Smirnov acknowledged the problems that had previously occurred in the Russian anti-doping structures, but added: “We have repeatedly said that the report contains certain controversial positions and provisions.
No one is going to accept this report unconditionally,&quot; Smirnov added.
WADA suspended RUSADA from doping control in November 2015 following a doping scandal.
However, in June of this year, he was allowed to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
After visiting the organization&#39;s Moscow office in July, WADA Director General Olivier Niggli said RUSADA was &quot;moving in the right direction&quot; towards reopening its operations.
Fire extinguished in 79-story tower in Dubai
A major fire that broke out in one of the world&#39;s tallest residential buildings, The Torch Tower, has been extinguished, Reuters reports.
It is noted that firefighters managed to cope with all the fires by 4.00 local time (3.00 Moscow time).
Local authorities said no one was hurt in the incident.
At the time of extinguishing the fire, the streets adjacent to the skyscraper were blocked.
The reasons for the incident are still unknown.
Earlier it was reported that the 79-storey residential skyscraper The Torch, which is one of the tallest buildings in the world, is on fire in Dubai.
All residents were evacuated on time.
Unimaginable outfit Buzova shocked fans: pants that do not cover panties
The scandalous host of the reality show &quot;Dom-2&quot; Olga Buzova impressed the audience of the Europa Plus Live festival with dancing in shorts.
In front of thousands of fans, the newly-minted singer performed the song &quot;We will be hot&quot; in a duet with Nastya Kudri.
Both girls took the stage in provocative &quot;trousers&quot; sewn in such a way that the underwear of the singers turned out to be visible.
The trousers were inscribed with Buzova and Kudry.
Earlier it was reported that a specialist from one of the Moscow clinics of plastic surgery commented on changes in Buzova&#39;s appearance.
Stoltenberg acknowledged the deterioration of relations between NATO and Russia
This was reported on Friday, August 4, by the news service &quot;Radio 4&quot; with reference to foreign media.
According to him, it is the Russian authorities who are responsible for the deterioration of relations between the West and Russia.
In an interview with CNN, the NATO Secretary General also criticized Russia for the situation with Crimea and &quot;destabilization in eastern Ukraine.&quot;
At the same time, Stoltenberg assured that a dialogue with Russia is nevertheless possible, and a further escalation of the situation will not benefit any of its participants.
Earlier Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump said U.S.-Russia relations were at dangerously low levels and blamed the U.S. Congress.
Yekaterinburg metro is developing a new payment method
In October, travel in the Yekaterinburg metro can be paid by bank card, Pavel Vedernikov, general director of I-Set OJSC, said in an interview with Regional Newspaper.
Our goal is to introduce by the 2018 FIFA World Cup the same metro fare system as in other major cities: Moscow, St. Petersburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Novosibirsk.
&quot;We want fans from other countries, guests of the World Cup, to be able to use the metro with their bank cards, without purchasing tokens and without standing in line,&quot; he said.
Startups That Can Help Your Company Stop Being Another Uber
Aimee Errett wanted to measure employee satisfaction at her e-commerce startup, but the surveys didn&#39;t work.
The answers were often vague, unhelpful, or worse, insincere.
And even though she promised anonymity, some employees did not trust the process.
&quot;He was never consistent and objective,&quot; said Errett, who runs Madison Reed, a 75-person San Francisco-based hair care e-commerce company.
So she turned to third parties for help.
There is now a new breed of HR startups that are helping companies figure out how their employees feel.
By developing and licensing software designed to measure employee engagement, they allow companies to conduct rapid surveys, reach out to specific teams and demographics, offer anonymity and complaint hotlines to employees, and in some cases, allow whistleblowers to bypass top management and contact directly to the directorate.
“Now we have tools like Strava and Fitbit for health monitoring, where is Fitbit for your company?” says Jim Barnett, co-founder and president of Redwood City-based startup Glint, whose analytics software is used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett said she gained a greater understanding of how her employees think and feel in her three years of using Glint.
In addition to quick surveys and questionnaires for specific teams, the product offers a heat map of the company and visualizes which departments have the most complaints and which managers have low approval ratings, allowing it to understand why.
Companies are slowly realizing that they need to control the workplace environment or they will become another Uber caught up in a scandal when a former employee published a blog post describing a violent environment in which those who expressed dissatisfaction were punished .
For startups like Glint, this desire to be in control is a profitable business opportunity.
The fintech portal Let&#39;s Talk Pay estimates that the global governance, regulation and compliance industry could be worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020.
Denver, Colorado-based startup Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw a slight uptick in interest and activity earlier this year as Uber&#39;s reputation plummeted.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft, and Tesla.
Recently, Uber has appeared among the customers.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send custom employee opinion polls, collect sensitive real-time responses, and view heat maps of problem areas.
It also provides an anonymous text message hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.
And if a top manager is affected, complaints go straight to the management.
&quot;The Court of Public Opinion has taken over from the inspectors,&quot; said Patrick Quinlan, founder and president of Convercent.
If a company is found to mistreat employees or behave unethically, even if inspectors don&#39;t intervene, the company could face costly repercussions in the form of customer boycotts, employee churn and lawsuits, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees across 500 locations, has been using Convercent for over a year to make sure employees are up to date with policies and procedures and offer an easy way to contact the company&#39;s headquarters.
Previously, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to look up the phone number or email address of the head office, file a formal complaint, and hope it was taken seriously.
It was often a frightening and embarrassing experience, said James Vitrano, head of legal for Ruby Tuesday, who said there was no normal way to track employee complaints.
Now that the company is using the Convercent service, problems that were previously hidden from managers sitting in offices in other cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment and unfair pay - can be more quickly identified and addressed.
&quot;I can get closer to a holistic, comprehensive understanding of the employee situation,&quot; said Vitrano, who leads the Ruby Tuesday network&#39;s risk management team.
“And we protect our shareholders from employee litigation.”
According to Quinland, companies began to take ethics, values, and employee engagement more seriously in 2002, after Arthur Andersen&#39;s accounting firm collapsed due to ethical violations in the Enron case.
But it wasn&#39;t until &quot;social media went mainstream&quot; that companies realized they couldn&#39;t keep their dirty laundry from going viral online.
“Before they started using technology to control ethics, people used hope as a strategy,” he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, charging companies a regular fee for using their products.
This is a business model and opportunity that has received the backing of venture capitalists who have backed both startups.
In February, Convertent received $10 million in funding from firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing the company&#39;s total capital to $47 million.
Glint received $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing the company&#39;s total capital to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising given the interconnected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
A growing body of research shows that today&#39;s employees expect more from their jobs than ever before.
In highly competitive markets like Silicon Valley, high salaries and exciting projects are just the bare minimum.
Employees want to feel accepted and appreciated, and that they are dedicating their time to the company with a positive mission.
“When people are happy to work for a company, feel they are being heard and that the work they are doing is paying off, they are more willing to make that company successful,” said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Satisfaction at the company. &quot;LinkedIn&quot; where both &quot;Convercent&quot; and &quot;Glint&quot; are used.
Investors receive income when the companies in their portfolio are doing well; Companies do well when employees are committed and engaged.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee loyalty and engagement, it&#39;s no wonder they&#39;re finding support.
Workplace culture experts say it&#39;s important to have employee engagement data.
But the data is useless until the company&#39;s trustees take action.
In fact, if a company asks employees for feedback, it can give the impression that change is coming.
And if change doesn&#39;t come quickly enough, or not at all, frustration can set in and employees lose interest.
“If you&#39;re going to ask for 4,000 offers, you have to be prepared to have 4,000 conversations,” says Russell Rath, president of consulting at management firm Kotter International, who has seen companies make the mistake of relying too much on data collection.
“Because if you don’t go all the way, the staff will be wondering, ‘Did you really hear me?
Do you care?
And if you don&#39;t care, why shouldn&#39;t I care?&quot;
Errett says Madison Reed, which now conducts monthly employee surveys, is able to take action the same day someone reports a problem using Glint.
And, after collecting feedback from employees dissatisfied with the speed of decision making and the quality of communication, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and introduce communication training to solve the problems.
Ruby Tuesday is gaining new knowledge about its employees and hopes that in the long run this knowledge will help it retain employees more effectively in an industry known for high employee turnover.
&quot;If you don&#39;t try to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people,&quot; Vitrano said.
If you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose companies.
In Barnaul, new asphalt is being opened on Krasnoarmeisky Avenue
In Barnaul, drastic measures were taken to eliminate the cause of asphalt failures on Krasnoarmeisky Avenue.
It was decided to &quot;open up&quot; the place where pits appeared twice on the recently asphalted roadway (the intersection with Molodezhnaya Street).
Recall that the collapse of a small section of the road near the tram tracks was due to the fact that the land subsided in the area of the ownerless unexploited network.
According to Ivan Garmat, deputy chairman of the city committee for road facilities, landscaping, transport and communications, a detailed survey will be carried out for a detailed examination and elimination of the prerequisites for the collapse.
Depending on its results, the necessary measures will be taken.
It is assumed that it will be necessary to restore the formwork of ownerless communications and their concreting.
This was reported on the official website of the regional capital.
The Bruins have to work out longer because the National Collegiate Athletic Association canceled twice-a-day practice
The time is approaching eleven at night; a crowd of UCLA football players linger to chat on one side of the team&#39;s new on-campus practice fields.
Some of them had pulled off their T-shirts, revealing backs that were glistening with sweat after an intense first day of sports camp.
For many team members, these moments of idleness amount to a break in the middle of the day.
Players signed up for summer classes will head back to their dorms after a three-hour practice session to prepare for their final exams, returning to the Wasserman Football Center the following morning for meetings at 6:30.
Just before Monday turned into Tuesday, Bruins coach Jim Mora said, &quot;These guys are going to be in a meat grinder for the next three days.&quot;
The fact that the National Collegiate Athletic Association canceled twice-a-day practice, which was invented to reduce the workload for the players, actually lengthened their working hours - at least until the end of exams on Friday.
Therefore, the start of the first three practices of the UCLA team was scheduled for 7:15 p.m. to fit into the already packed schedule of players.
A side effect of not having two practices a day is more single practice days, and the Bruins are pushing the start of camp almost a week from last year and training during summer school for the first time in Maura&#39;s six seasons at Westwood.
According to the schedule, they have 18 practices through August 20 before officially starting their first game of the season against Texas A&amp;M University in September.
Mora said he supported the NCAA rule change, even though it added another item to the players&#39; busy schedule.
“For three or four days, we give them this huge load, this is a serious test,” Mora said.
“And they just got over it, they work, they are great guys.
I think when we get to Saturday and we have more time, it will be really great.”
When camp is over, UCLA will make practices closed; this is not an easy task, since its fields are in direct line of sight from the adjacent parking lot and from the nearby Laskin Center, an expensive hotel that has already been bombarded with soccer balls that have passed the protective net behind the goal.
The Bruins players are due to occupy the hotel starting this weekend, but Mora admits there could be a problem when rooms become available during the season.
&quot;We&#39;ll have security,&quot; Mora said.
“This is a serious problem, and I am not exaggerating the danger by assuming that someone can rent a room, sit there and record a workout on video.
If you have a video of a workout, this is very serious.
But we&#39;ll have security there and we&#39;ll have security in parking lot 8.
We will do our best with what we have.
I won&#39;t worry too much about it.
We have a plan.&quot;
All victims of the terrorist attack in St. Petersburg were discharged from hospitals
All victims of the terrorist attack on the St. Petersburg metro in April were discharged from hospitals.
This was reported in the press service of the Vice-Governor Anna Mityanina.
As of the end of July, three people remained in hospitals, TV Center reports.
Recall that the explosion in the metro of St. Petersburg thundered on April 3 this year.
The bomb was detonated by suicide bomber Akbarjon Jalilov.
As a result of the attack, 15 people were killed, as well as the performer himself.
In the criminal case, 11 people, including the alleged organizer Abror Azimov, were arrested.
Recall that on the eve of Rospotrebnadzor recommended the St. Petersburg metro to revise the action plan to ensure transport security, in particular, by increasing the number of metal detector frames.
Facebook steps up fact-checking in fight against fake news
Facebook will more often send texts suspicious of hoaxes to independent experts and show their findings under the original posts, the world&#39;s largest social network, which is trying to fight so-called fake news, said on Thursday.
In a statement on its website, the company said it is starting to use improved machine learning algorithms to recognize potential hoaxes, submit them for review, and possibly display fact-checking results under the original post.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main avenues for spreading the so-called fake news that many believe influenced the 2016 US presidential election.
The issue is also being actively debated in Europe after French voters were misled by false reports before the presidential election in May, and in Germany before the September elections they declared support for a plan to penalize social networks if they do not promptly remove posts that incite hatred.
On Thursday, in a separate statement in German, Facebook announced that it is testing a new fact-checking algorithm that has been launched in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
&quot;In addition to seeing which posts are being challenged by independent reviewers, people want more context to make informed judgments about what they&#39;re reading and sharing,&quot; Sarah Sue, Facebook News Feed Manager, wrote in her block.
She added that Facebook will continue to test the &quot;related articles&quot; feature and work on other changes to the news feed to address the fake news issue.
Create a Comic Novel: One Castle in English History
In the recent past, the tiny Scotney Castle was featured in the &quot;Squeeze&quot; music video, and in the 70s and 80s served as a haunt for Margaret Thatcher.
But 700 years from his cozy spot in the Beulah Valley of Kent, he has watched the turbulent history around him, and now he has inspired Jamie Rhodes, a Yorkshireman with a mop of hair and a penchant for historical documents, to a comic book novel.
&quot;I think it&#39;s so beautiful to look at the handwriting of a man who died 300 years ago,&quot; he says enthusiastically.
&quot;You feel so personal when you hold this letter in your hand.&quot;
&quot;Castle in England&quot; covers the period from the Middle Ages to the Edwardian era and tells about the families who lived in Scotney; each story was illustrated by one of the young British artists - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony Mae Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabelle Greenberg.
This is not Rhodes&#39; first book to be based on archival evidence: in 2014, he wrote Dead Man&#39;s Teeth and Other Stories, a collection based on British Library documents; this project unexpectedly touched him to the core.
&quot;I could have been touched by just the fingerprint on the edge of a letter written in the 1700s by a Jacobite double agent,&quot; he says.
&quot;It&#39;s his fingerprint&quot;
And the letters always smell of smoke, because in those days a fire was lit for illumination.
And after 300 years, in the future, it seems to you that you are there too.
Oh, how I love archives!
For someone so obsessed with old papers, getting support from the National Trust and the English Council of Arts and living in a castle for four months (&quot;Honestly, I spent a little time there&quot;) seems too good to be true.
Rhodes spent days studying the &quot;new&quot; Victorian castle, walking through the archives and examining the estate&#39;s many treasures and antiques - for example, hyena heads on the walls or bottles that had lain in the moat for centuries.
He walked through the park and through the ruins of the old castle, talking with the foresters, gardeners and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations for his book.
Then at night he &quot;drank whiskey and sat down to write.&quot;
The history of Scotney Castle is not well understood because the National Trust only gained full access to it in 2006 when the last heiress, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the staff were just beginning to sort through the archive, which he describes as &quot;what the aristocrats have dumped in the attic for centuries.&quot;
Diaries, letters from the British Empire, maps showing who owned what: “You think land disputes are boring,” says Rhodes, “but two families fought over this birch tree.
It happens, guys!&quot;
In some of the stories in the collection, the castle becomes the starting point for a wider exploration of English history: for example, in &quot;The Worker&quot;, the hero leaves the newly built castle to join the Peasants&#39; Revolution of 1381.
&quot;There is a riot that took place at the castle in 1380 in a book called The Knights of Kent and Sussex,&quot; says Rhodes.
&quot;A peasant uprising has started in these parts, and I thought a riot would be a good start.
Maybe they were related?
Other plots are strongly connected to the history of the castle - for example, &quot;The Priest&quot;, which tells about the Jesuit priest, whom the Durrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or The Smuggler, about 18th-century smuggler Arthur Durrell, who is believed to have faked his own funeral by stuffing the coffin with stones (this was discovered a few years later when the coffin was dug up).
The Darrels are the favorite Rhodes family of all that inhabited the Scotneys: &quot;The gentlemen seem to have been complete crooks, forever getting into debt and spending money on things they could not afford.
Through the generations, male Durrells have solved their debt problems by marrying wealthy older women - I imagine them as a bunch of pretty guys who know how to look after heiresses of great fortunes.
After finishing work at the castle, Rhodes is looking for other opportunities to get a unique writing experience.
He lived for two weeks in the Finnish wilderness, where he wrote a graphic novel about Elyamänmäki, a place where there was a sanatorium at the beginning of the 20th century, and then it was again overgrown with forest.
But Scotney remains a special place for him.
&quot;I was sad to leave,&quot; he says.
&quot;I felt something like this: damn it, I have to return to real life again.&quot;
Fifteen largest banks choose &quot;Russia&quot;
The conflict in the Association of Russian Banks (ARB) is developing: following Sberbank, VTB, VTB-24, Alfa-Bank, Gazprombank, Rosselkhozbank, Binbank and FC Otkritie, seven more credit institutions are going to leave this public organization.
Thus, the share of organizations that left the ARB will account for at least 80 percent of the market.
But this is not just a way out - all the banks that have announced a break with the ARB are negotiating with another public organization that unites credit institutions - the Association of Regional Banks &quot;Russia&quot;, which is headed by well-known politician Anatoly Aksakov, chairman of the State Duma Committee on the financial market, recognized as By the way, according to the results of the last session, he was also the most effective head of the Duma committee and deputy in terms of the number of bills prepared.
The conflict within the ARB was initiated during a discussion in the Federation Council, when the Interregional Banking Council considered new bills, in particular, involving a new classification of banks depending on the size of the authorized capital.
Then Garegin Tosunyan, president of the ARB, said that, in the opinion of the association, this bill was adopted in the interests of the largest banks, which in this way are trying to limit the opportunities of small and medium-sized banks in the regions, intercepting their clientele.
Among other claims, there was also criticism of the Central Bank, which, according to Tosunyan, does not always justifiably revoke licenses from some banks, which, however, was followed by an objection from the representative of the Central Bank: many heads of banks that went wrong, in particular, Vneshprombank, were members of governing bodies of the ARB.
Apparently, this exchange of mutually exclusive views in the banking environment, which is very sensitive to relations with the main regulator, became a visible reason for the fifteen largest banks, declaring disagreement with the policy of the ARB, to begin preparing for entry into the Rossiya association, noting that &quot;the efficiency of the ARB&#39;s work is at a low level, and there is virtually no constructive dialogue within the banking community.&quot;
Investors will be better
How will the matter end?
We will immediately answer the main question that arises at the slightest failure or conflict in the banking sector or near it: nothing threatens depositors, rather, on the contrary, the reliability of the banking system will increase.
&quot;Russia&quot; is headed by Anatoly Aksakov, known for his scrupulousness in everything that concerns the interests of banks and their clients, a high-level professional who is highly valued in the Central Bank: almost all the leadership of the Central Bank is present at the annual events of the association, and all significant legislative initiatives of the regulator go through expert assessments of &quot;regionals&quot;.
In personnel and organizational terms, obviously, no special shocks are foreseen either.
Undoubtedly, the ARB finds itself in a difficult financial and managerial situation after it loses such powerful and influential participants with their contributions and lobbying opportunities.
However, this oldest organization, founded in 1991, which defends the interests of the banking community, has considerable potential to continue improving banking legislation and the sphere of monetary circulation in general.
It cannot be said that the association &quot;Russia&quot; is ready to accept new members with open arms on any terms, judging by the reaction of its leader, Anatoly Aksakov (&quot;maybe they want too much&quot;), who was on July 21 at a briefing in the press center of the Parliamentary newspapers, said that &quot;literally the next day, representatives of the banks that left the ARB asked me to consider the possibility of building up the potential of our association&quot; Rossiya &quot;&quot;.
Their proposals are to strengthen the voice of bankers in the Association Council, as well as pay more attention to new banking technologies.
Now the negotiation process is underway, the proposals of both sides are being studied, the agenda of the extraordinary congress of the association is being prepared, which will be held in Sochi in mid-September as part of the international banking forum.
We&#39;ll decide there.
Also, Anatoly Aksakov, emphasizing that &quot;he does not hold on to a chair,&quot; called Georgy Luntovsky, a possible new head of the renewed Rossiya association, who leaves the post of Deputy Chairman of the Central Bank in September, highly characterizing his business and human qualities.
On August 18, Anatoly Aksakov, who is now resting in the Crimea, plans to interrupt his vacation for one day and arrive in Moscow for an extraordinary meeting of the Council of the Rossiya Association, where it is scheduled to consider the issue of the agenda of the extraordinary congress of Rossiya.
The entry of cars with a gasoline engine into major cities of Russia will not be limited
Deputy head of the Ministry of Transport Nikolai Asaul said that, contrary to media reports, the entry of cars with a gasoline engine into major cities of Russia will not be limited yet.
This is a more radical form of our concept.
Our concept is that it is necessary to gradually increase the ecological class.
And there the concept is to immediately switch to zero emissions.
I think technically we are not ready for this.
The question is, since what year?
This is such a phrase at the level of slogans - let&#39;s ban it.
Where and when?
Tomorrow?
Should we shut down the whole city?
&quot;In 20 years - I don&#39;t know, maybe this will happen,&quot; Prime quoted the minister as saying.
Earlier, the Izvestia newspaper reported that by August 17, Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich was instructed to study proposals on possible options for state support for electric transport, submitted to the government by KamAZ PJSC CEO Sergey Kogogin.
Among the proposals, according to the newspaper, is the use of cars with internal combustion engines in large cities and resorts.
Washington changes the rules for obtaining a green card.
According to media reports, President Donald Trump said that a new US immigration plan will be adopted, according to which the rules for obtaining a green card will change.
The plan includes a reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 a year, stricter rules for obtaining temporary work visas and restrictions on obtaining family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republican Party and supported by the president.
The bill will be debated in two houses of Congress.
“This legislation will reduce poverty, raise wages, and save taxpayers billions of dollars, and will do so by changing how the US issues green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the existing scheme.
The new application process will benefit candidates who speak English, have the financial resources to support themselves, and have skills that will benefit our economy,” Trump said, according to US media.
The emergence of sex robots is real, and this should worry us
Before we thought 2017 could get any worse, a new report on technological advances in sex robot manufacturing came out.
Hmm.
Sex robots are in the spotlight right now.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently released a report on the development of sex robots in the next 5-10 years.
According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we should take them seriously.
Users will be able to choose the color of the eyes of the robots, the shape of the nipples and the type of nails.
&quot;People are giggling about it, but firms are already sending them to consumers in large numbers, and we&#39;ll see a lot more of them soon,&quot; Sharkey said at the launch of the new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable counterparts to robots with silicone skin that is warm to the touch and almost human cues controlled by artificial intelligence.
Users can also &quot;customize&quot; their robots to their liking, choosing everything from the color of the eyes and the shape of the robot&#39;s nipples to the shape and color of the nails.
But the fact that many robots have a &quot;personality&quot; that would make the Stepford Wife seem very progressive is even more disturbing.
Modern sex dolls have turned into robots with silicone skin.
For example, RealBotix robot allows users to customize the qualities they find attractive in robots, such as shyness.
There are also Roxxxy Gold sex robots designed by &quot;True Companion&quot; that come with a pre-programmed personality - for example &quot;Cold Pharah&quot; comes across as shy, while &quot;Wild Wendy&quot; has a &quot;daring&quot; personality.
&quot;Roxxxy Gold has a personality that suits yours perfectly,&quot; True Companion raves.
Therefore, she loves what you love, does not like what you do not like, and so on.
Her mood changes during the day, like a real person!
She may want to sleep or chat, or she may be &quot;in the mood&quot;!&quot;
There&#39;s a lot about the rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but what&#39;s most disturbing is the subservient image of a woman, the association with rape that cold (read: resisting) Farah&#39;s possession evokes.
The &quot;True Companion&quot; site compares Roxxxy to a male-only vibrator.
&quot;If a woman (sic!) can have a vibrator, why can&#39;t men have Roxxxy?&quot; - says the site.
But these sex robots aren&#39;t just fetishes or just new sex toys.
Their emergence and increasing complexity points to something darker and deeper in our culture, a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional extra.
Most men certainly won&#39;t buy sex robots, and although FRR notes their growing popularity, they remain on the fringes of the consumer culture.
But what reaches us from the periphery can be very instructive regarding the meanings of the era in which we live.
And many people are not bad and aggressive until the free market gives them the opportunity to do so.
It&#39;s no coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots came into existence at a time when women&#39;s rights around the world were under threat, with a president in the White House boasting of molesting women.
The scariest thing about The Handmaid&#39;s Tale TV series isn&#39;t the graphics, twisted bodies, and gouged out eyes, but how realistic the vision seems.
The Republic of Gilead is an exaggeration, but it doesn&#39;t seem so big now.
The goal of the sex robot industry is to achieve as much physical resemblance to real women (only with porn star proportions) as technology allows.
Their creators want them to feel human to the touch, to copy the movements of the human body.
But it is precisely with their &quot;characters&quot; that robots do not look like real women.
They cannot break up with their partners or leave them.
They have no life of their own, no biography - nothing that could indicate independence or anything else that could destroy the illusion of complete dependence.
In other words, they are beautiful slaves.
Or, as they say in 2017, maids.
A native of Los Angeles, Eugene (Pooh) Jeter, who has been playing for the Ukrainian national team since 2013, will not help our national team at the European Basketball Championship, the final part of which starts on August 31.
Andrey Lebedev, general manager of the Blue-and-Yellows, said this in an interview with the BeBasket portal.
We tried to negotiate with Jeter, but, unfortunately, he will not come due to family reasons.
We will go to EuroBasket without a naturalized player because we don&#39;t want to take on someone we don&#39;t know.
&quot;This situation will provide opportunities for the development of our young players,&quot; he said.
Let me remind you: with the direct participation of Jeter, the Ukrainian national team took a record sixth place at EuroBasket 2013 and for the first time got to the World Basketball Championship, where the Yellow-Blues could not overcome the group stage, and the US native scored an average of 15 per game, 4 points, 3 rebounds and 5 assists.
Jeter stopped playing for the Ukrainian national team since the departure of the head coach of our national team, American Mike Fratello, who left this position in 2015.
Men&#39;s EuroBasket 2017 will be held simultaneously in four countries: Turkey, Romania, Israel and Finland.
The Ukrainian team will play their group stage matches in the Promised Land.
Yevgeny Murzin&#39;s wards will have five matches in group B: with Germany (August 31), Italy (September 2), Georgia (3rd), Lithuania (5th) and Israel (6th).
As part of the preparation for the tournament, our men&#39;s team had two control matches, in which they lost to the Dutch and Belarusians.
Trump&#39;s great feat?
Posing like Mita Romney seems very reasonable.
It has become commonplace in the Trump era that the political disputes that have polarized the American electorate have micro-destroyed some families.
Between Thanksgiving and Christmas, American newspapers were full of columns about how to deal with terrible relatives who vote for Trump.
It seems that we are all so tense that we will burst soon.
Less is said about Trump&#39;s ability to bring families together.
I am writing this because my cousin, a left-leaning poet from Chicago who has long been at odds with the Republicans in her family, visited me in New York this week.
She reminded me that uniting against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including her Republican brother with whom she&#39;s been debating politics with for decades, is suddenly and strangely on the same side.
At dinner this is no doubt good; but I can&#39;t help but think that in a wider context it can be quite dangerous.
Trump has energized the left, but the warping effect of his rule could push us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and &quot;normalization&quot; we are referring to the unlikely possibility that one day we will no longer be amazed by his antics.
There is, however, an even more dubious scenario in which Trump &quot;normalizes&quot; the most right-wing Republicans, who, against the background of his standards, will suddenly appear as a model of common sense.
I found myself missing Mitt Romney&#39;s old-fashioned madness today - with a dog on the roof of a car and a 14 percent income tax (but we at least knew what his tax return looked like) - compared to Trump, both the other seems to be a very small evil.
When Trump leaves, the next Republican nominee will only need to be sane to be seen as a huge step forward.
When my cousin drove downtown, we took our kids to the Central Park carousel, the largest carousel in the New York City Parks department and the best way to spend three dollars in town if you don&#39;t need caffeine.
The horses are formidable and huge, the fiberglass images on the central drum - grimacing clowns and animals that are twisted and staring at their backs in horror - are extremely ominous, and the ringing music, oddly enough, delights.
So many famous things about this city are disappointing: the views from the skyscrapers are outdated, the silhouettes of the buildings are too tired to inspire awe, and the reality of the city does not keep up with the dream.
Thirty-five years have passed and I&#39;m still reliving the day I found out that the Swiss Cottage area is not really a Swiss chalet (the &quot;Ye Olde Swiss Cottage&quot; themed pub doesn&#39;t count), but a large roundabout in the North London.
And the carousel in Central Park is still an unusual, magical place where a two-year-old child, an eleven-year-old child, and two women over forty can have a great time.
If I could rate the carousel, I would give it a five, but, fortunately, no one asked me about it.
And at a department store this week, I was asked to rate my &quot;experience&quot; of shopping on a scale of one to five stars before swiping my card across the terminal.
At the coffee shop on the corner of my street, it&#39;s the same plus the option to accompany the estimate with a tip of 15 percent - that&#39;s for ordering at the counter.
As a result, not only interaction that is neutral in theory slows down, but also it is necessary to introduce a personal attitude into a situation that does not involve it.
The poor department store clerk smiled sheepishly as I wearily rated my five-star credit card experience.
Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital due to chest pains
Pistorius leaves prison because of a visit to the doctor for the second time.
Last year, he was transferred to the hospital to be treated for cuts on his wrists that the prison authorities say he sustained as a result of a fall in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of voluntary manslaughter after prosecutors appealed the original conviction for manslaughter.
He killed Steenkamp in the early morning of Valentine&#39;s Day in 2013 by shooting her multiple times through the bathroom door of his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius stated that he mistook his girlfriend for a night thief who hid in his toilet.
Prosecutors have said they intend to file another protest, this time against Pretorius&#39; six-year term, which they say is too lenient.
The Attorney General&#39;s office said it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal would be heard this year.
Pretorius&#39; term could be extended by 15 years if prosecutors are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
Suspect in beating NTV journalist ordered not to leave
The capital&#39;s law enforcement officers chose a measure of restraint in the form of a written undertaking not to leave the place for a man who attacked NTV journalist Nikita Razvozzhaev during a live broadcast from Gorky Park on August 2.
This was reported by TASS with reference to the official representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation Irina Volk.
“As part of the investigation of a criminal case initiated under Article 116 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (“Beatings”) against a 32-year-old man who hit a correspondent of one of the TV channels in the Gorky Central Park of Culture and Recreation in the face, the suspect was given a preventive measure in the form of a signature on on his own recognizance and proper behavior,&quot; Volk specified.
The representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs added that an administrative protocol was drawn up against the suspect for disobedience to the police.
On Wednesday, August 2, during a live broadcast for the Day of the Airborne Forces, a drunk man approached the correspondent and hit him in the face.
As it turned out later, the bully has nothing to do with the Airborne Forces.
According to Razvozzhaev himself, the paratroopers, on the contrary, tried to detain the Muscovite.
Two Bulgarian citizens were detained in Greece for illegal camping
According to the BBC channel, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, two Bulgarian citizens were detained in Greece for illegal camping.
On the morning of August 1, a group of people were detained in Sithonia, who had set up tents in the wrong place, including two citizens of Bulgaria.
They were released the same day, while the investigation is still ongoing.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the BBC that the Bulgarian citizens were later released.
Greek authorities have tightened controls on free camping and are already issuing heavy fines to anyone caught while camping in an unintended area.
Checks will be carried out throughout the season.
According to the ministry, the court may impose a fine.
Russian Foreign Ministry accuses US Vice President of Cold War rhetoric
Statements made during the European tour of US Vice President Michael Pence were criticized by the Russian Foreign Ministry.
“We have to state with regret that Washington is slipping deeper and deeper into the primitive ideological clichés of the Cold War era, which are completely out of touch with reality,” the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
This is how the Foreign Ministry reacted to Pence&#39;s words about the &quot;Russian threat&quot; and attempts to forcibly redraw the borders, which he said in Podgorica.
The Russian Foreign Ministry pointed to the destructiveness of the choice &quot;either with the West or with Russia&quot; and the non-obviousness of the thesis about the supposedly uncontested entry of all of Southeast Europe into NATO.
Russian diplomats also recalled that it was the United States that violated international law by using force to seize Kosovo from Serbia and thus created another hotbed of tension.
&quot;We call on our American colleagues to stop defamation of Russia and its foreign policy line, which is invariably based on respect for partners and readiness for joint constructive work, on mutual consideration of interests,&quot; the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
The paramedic was injured in an accident with an ambulance in the suburbs
The accident occurred in Stupino near Moscow, as a result of a collision of a foreign car with an ambulance, a paramedic was injured.
Today, at about 08:10 Moscow time, a Mitsubishi car collided with an ambulance in the city of Stupino, Moscow Region.
&quot;As a result of the collision, the ambulance overturned,&quot; the press service of the Main Directorate of the Ministry of Internal Affairs for the Moscow Region told TASS.
Law enforcement officers are at the scene of the accident, the circumstances of the incident are being investigated.
In the Odessa region, a woman threw her newborn son at a construction site, wrapping her in a plastic bag.
On the evening of August 3, the Razdelnyansky police department received a message from a local resident that he had found a package with a baby in an unfinished private house.
&quot;Law enforcement officers and doctors left for the scene and promptly delivered the child to a medical facility,&quot; the Odessa National Police Headquarters said.
Doctors determined that the boy was born a few hours before his discovery, as evidenced by the presence of an umbilical cord.
In the course of priority operational and investigative measures, the identity of the woman in labor was established - a 36-year-old local resident.
It was also established that the woman has three more young children.
As noted in the central office, the family had not previously been in the field of view of law enforcement officers and was not on special records.
Currently, the police are establishing the circumstances and reasons that forced the woman to this act, after which a procedural decision will be made.
Now the baby is under the supervision of doctors.
As previously reported, in Nikolaev, a 21-year-old woman threw her premature baby into a garbage chute.
Grigory Leps: &quot;I&#39;m eager to fight, although 55 is not 30&quot;
One of the most successful Russian pop artists Grigory Leps will celebrate his 55th birthday next Sunday.
Before the celebration, the singer spoke with an Izvestia columnist.
I remember how your &quot;fifty dollars&quot; was celebrated.
A special tent at Luzhniki, Gloria Gaynor sang for the birthday boy, a powerful salute over the Moscow River.
You must have been wondering how you would like to spend your next five years.
Did the plans come true?
If we talk about the profession, it was a good period.
I worked hard, went on tour all over the country three times, gave 120-130 concerts a year.
Released two good albums.
Of course, now I am not the same as, say, 20 years ago.
The biological clock cannot be fooled.
It&#39;s getting harder and harder to sing the way I sang in my 30s.
Nevertheless, I am eager to fight, I do not want to stop.
And I, with new people, I think, go to a different level.
With them you are recording a new album, the first in three years.
Yes, it&#39;s being worked on right now.
Actually, we have already recorded everything in my studio and now we will send it to Los Angeles for mixing.
It&#39;s called &quot;Why are you so serious?&quot; based on the song of the same name, which was written jointly with Timati.
It&#39;s not quite ready yet, so we haven&#39;t posted it anywhere yet.
We&#39;ll do it later, when we shoot a video for it.
And the album will be presented in November - for a series of my anniversary concerts in Moscow&#39;s Crocus City Hall.
Cool American drummer Chris Coleman has a hand in your new record.
You, it seems, wanted to attract him to your tour team?
In my opinion, Coleman is one of the most outstanding drummers in the world today.
He came to my studio, recorded his parts.
I suggested that he join my group, and Jeremy Colson (a well-known drummer participating in various projects. - Izvestia) offered.
But for long-term work in Russia, they put forward, to put it mildly, excessive conditions.
It was about fees from €35,000 to €45,000 per month.
Then I thought that I would also find worthy musicians in the post-Soviet space.
And I found an excellent drummer Max Malyshev.
In general, it is better to feed your own (smiles).
At times I want to find fault with one of them, but not for anything.
For example, guitarist Fedor Dosumov is highly rated internationally.
Western music magazines write about him, he is invited to various guitar festivals.
Steve Vai, after listening to him play, said that &quot;a new generation of guitarists has come, with a different playing technique.&quot;
Your album is mixed in Los Angeles, American musicians cooperate with you, but you yourself still cannot come to the USA?
Are you trying to lift this ban?
Now, to be honest, I do nothing.
There are a number of lawyers who deal with this issue.
As a musician, I really sincerely regret that I can&#39;t get to America.
I have said many times that I study there.
The more you communicate with real professionals, the more useful.
We are not dumber than them, but we do not have such experience, school.
For 70 years, our popular music performers have not been given the tasks that American musicians have always solved.
They strived for the highest quality sound.
And I&#39;m trying to follow the same principles.
Now, for some reason, the UK refused me entry for ten years.
But anyway, every year I will apply for a visa to the British embassy so that I can again go there and, most importantly, work there.
The rest of Europe treats me favorably.
And already in August you are planning a concert in Monaco, not custom-made, but advertised, right?
Yes, there is a good Sporting hall in Monte Carlo, I have already performed there once.
Now they invited again, and, as far as I know, all tickets for the concert have already been sold out.
Will you go to the &quot;Rendezvous of Laima Vaikule&quot;, which will begin on July 20 in Jurmala?
She invited me, and I, of course, responded.
Laima is a wonderful singer and a great woman who knows how to present herself with beautiful vocals, and even in a whisper.
After touring and anniversary concerts, as far as I know, you once again want to turn to the work of Vladimir Vysotsky.
You already have two albums with his songs in your discography.
When will the third one come out?
Probably next year.
But it will be completely different.
I want to record about 80-90 songs of Vysotsky in approximately the same pitch as he did himself.
Only voice and guitar.
No other arrangement.
Our famous musician Timur Vedernikov will accompany me.
I will try to involve Alexander Yakovlevich Rosenbaum in the album as well.
I discussed this topic with him, we have a good relationship, but he is a busy man, so let&#39;s see how it goes.
You gradually introduced the songs of Boris Grebenshchikov into your repertoire.
Maybe then you will record an album of his things?
Boris Borisovich is a wonderful person and a great musician.
I crossed paths with him several times and asked: can I sing one or another of his songs?
He answered: &quot;Grigory, I write songs to be performed.&quot;
Please try and sing.
Probably interesting to record such an album.
So far, I have no such task, but in the future, in a year or two, if Boris Borisovich does not object, I may make such a project.
If you don&#39;t focus entirely on your production house.
I guess you haven&#39;t realized his potential yet, signed contracts with all the artists that you are interested in?
There are a number of performers whom I would dream of having under my wing, but they are independent, accomplished people.
You mean Sergey Lazarev?
Serezha is a brilliant singer, I invited him.
I can disagree with his repertoire, but he is a professional and he has his own development strategy.
And in my center now there is Alexander Panayotov, whom I led in the &quot;Voice&quot;.
We signed a contract with him and are working.
In our pop music, such singers are rare.
It will be sincerely a pity if he does not reach the heights that he deserves.
I&#39;m trying to pick up a repertoire for him, I shoot clips.
I hope for a good result.
I also try to promote other artists of my center: I buy songs for them, I pay poets, sometimes their tracks get into the rotation of television and radio channels.
If they do not reach great heights, I will still bring our cooperation to its logical conclusion.
As a result, they will receive a recorded album, several clips.
And then, if they want, they can go their own way, and I will not insist that they return the money invested in them.
Although I will be pleased if one of them achieves commercial success and pays me the interest that we agreed on in the contract.
But if this does not happen, I am not going to shut off oxygen to anyone.
Let everyone work, make their way, prove, as I once argued.
If tomorrow you are offered to make a tour of Ukraine and are guaranteed entry into the country, will you go?
I am still invited there.
Mostly it is about closed events.
As for the big tour...
I am a person of my country, a Russian, by my own conviction, I flew to Syria on the same plane, which then crashed.
If tomorrow they say that I need to fly to some other point in the interests of the state, I will fly.
And I don&#39;t care what bloggers and other critics think of me.
I sincerely regret that we have such a situation with Ukraine.
Because I think: we are one people and should be together.
I regret that this is unlikely to happen, at least in the near future.
And before, I gave 40-50 concerts a year in Ukraine.
Met like nowhere else.
A very grateful audience.
And he collaborated with several Ukrainian artists: Ani Lorak, Sveta Loboda, Artem Loik...
There are a lot of gifted people in Ukraine, and it is sincerely a pity that now they cannot fully throw out their talent to a wide Russian audience.
Music should unite and entertain people.
I would love to invite some cool Ukrainian performer to Russia, for example, Slava Vakarchuk, and do a joint concert with him.
But I think it&#39;s unlikely at the moment...
Andrei Okhlopkov was transferred from the cosmodrome
As it became known to Kommersant, Andrey Okhlopkov, technical director of the Vostochny cosmodrome, began work at the Khrunichev State Space Research and Production Center (GKNPTs).
Previously, he was de facto engaged in the construction of the Vostochny cosmodrome, but due to disagreements with the leadership of the Center for the Operation of Ground and Space Infrastructure (TsENKI), he was transferred to an enterprise in Moscow Fili, where he will coordinate production.
Mr. Okhlopkov will not have a substitute: the post of technical director will most likely be abolished, and the functionality will be scattered over the divisions of TsENKI.
The fact that the technical director of Vostochny and deputy general director of TsENKI for technological development, Andrey Okhlopkov, went to work at the Khrunichev State Research and Production Space Center, Kommersant was told by top managers of several space industry enterprises, as well as an employee of the government apparatus.
&quot;He has been working in a new post for several weeks,&quot; Kommersant&#39;s interlocutors in the industry clarified.
It was not possible to get an operational comment from TsENKI on Thursday, and Mr. Okhlopkov himself was unavailable for comment.
However, Kommersant&#39;s information was officially confirmed by the GKNPTs.
He made a decision to move to the position of director for coordination of production, the company said. - Andrey Okhlopkov has fully fulfilled the task assigned to him to ensure the launch minimum for the first launch at the Vostochny cosmodrome.
Mr. Okhlopkov moved to work at TsENKI in 2013, having served in the space forces, in particular at Baikonur, and in Plesetsk - at the &quot;northern&quot; cosmodrome, he served as first deputy commander with the rank of colonel.
In 2009, Andrei Okhlopkov became a defendant in a criminal case.
The investigation accused him of bribery: allegedly, at his suggestion, regional businessmen received state orders for kickbacks, but did not fulfill their obligations to clean up the detachable parts of launch vehicles in the Arkhangelsk region and the Komi Republic.
In 2012, a jury found him not guilty.
The responsibilities for technological development assigned to him at TsENKI extended to various projects, but the main one was the construction of a cosmodrome in the Far East.
Oleg Ostapenko, then head of the Federal Space Agency, said in an interview with Kommersant that the state of affairs on Vostochny &quot;was critical as early as October 2013.&quot;
The fact is that a strategic mistake was made during planning: the completion of construction and the first launch of the Soyuz-2.1 launch vehicle were scheduled for the same time - the end of 2015.
In order to launch before the end of the year, it was decided to complete the construction six months earlier and the deadlines were shifted from December to July 2015.
To speed up the process, I had to go for a trick: TsENKI specialists began to conduct parallel installation of process equipment at unfinished facilities.
Andrey Okhlopkov was the main supporter of this idea.
Despite the risks that existed and the postponement that happened (instead of December 2015, the Soyuz flew away only on April 28, 2016), this idea justified itself, says a Kommersant source at the cosmodrome: “Otherwise we would not have implemented any one launch from Vostochny, but they would be engaged in construction.&quot;
Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, who oversees the creation of the cosmodrome, jokingly called Andrey Okhlopkov his &quot;space Susanin&quot;, but it was from him that he almost always asked for information about the progress of construction.
Mr. Okhlopkov was also remembered for his frankness: for example, in an interview with Kommersant, he proposed depriving the Federal Agency for Special Construction (Spetsstroy) of the status of the sole contractor for Vostochny and working directly with subcontractors: &quot;Why should we put all our eggs in one basket of Spetsstroy?&quot;
This idea has found support in the government.
Since 2017, TsENKI has assumed the duties of a general contractor in order to complete construction and installation work at the launch and technical complex by the launches scheduled for the fourth quarter.
According to Kommersant, the reason for Mr. Okhlopkov&#39;s transfer to a new place of work was disagreements with the leadership of TsENKI regarding how to complete the construction of structures and complexes of the cosmodrome, as well as methods of working with subcontractors.
&quot;It was decided that it would be better for everyone,&quot; says one of the top managers involved in the construction of Vostochny.
An employee of the government apparatus, in turn, calls the decision strange: &quot;He was one of the best specialists, it will not be easy to find an equivalent replacement for him.&quot;
According to Kommersant&#39;s information, this will not be required: the post of technical director of the cosmodrome will be abolished, and its functions will be scattered among the subdivisions of TsENKI.
Music schools will have a training program for two specialties
In the future, students of children&#39;s music schools will be able to receive two specialties at the same time.
According to the Deputy Director of the Department of Science and Education of the Ministry of Culture Svyatoslav Golubenko, for this purpose, repeating disciplines can be re-read to students, and the issue of paying for the remaining classes in the second specialty can be resolved with the help of special grants, RIA Novosti reports.
&quot;The Ministry of Culture took this issue under control, and together with the expert community we will develop a mechanism that will allow mastering two specialties, but at the same time will not contradict the current legislation in the field of education,&quot; Golubenko said.
Last Friday, during Vladimir Putin&#39;s &quot;Non-Childish Conversation&quot; with the pupils of the Sirius Children&#39;s Center, student Maria Andreeva said that she was forced to pay for recurring subjects in her second specialty at the Central Music School at the Moscow Conservatory.
The girl said that she was studying violin and piano and had awards at competitions in both areas.
The head of state recognized her issue as very topical and promised to help.
In Mexico, a 17-year-old Russian who climbed a wall on a skyscraper was detained
In Mexico, 17-year-old Russian Kirill N. was detained, who climbed the wall onto the roof of a high-rise building, according to the portal El Universal.
The incident took place in Mexico City, the capital.
The young man, with the help of two unidentified men, climbed over a three-meter fence into the territory of the Nestle office complex and independently climbed one of its towers.
However, he did not use any special equipment, insurance and ropes.
The young man was detained already on the roof.
Officials from the Ministry of Public Security lowered him to the ground in a helicopter.
After that, he was sent to the National Institute of Migration.
They find out whether the young man is legally in the country.
Meanwhile, a video of a young man climbing a skyscraper has gone viral online.
Users called the young man &quot;spider-man&quot;.
According to the media, such experiments are a hobby for him.
Red meat, dairy, and chocolate may help relieve IBD.
Red meat and chocolate are considered to be a nightmare for your digestive tract.
But recent research suggests otherwise: A diet rich in meat proteins and dairy products may help relieve symptoms in those suffering from inflammatory bowel disease.
This incurable disease, which affects approximately 1.3 million people in the US and 300,000 in the UK, leads to colic and bloating, chronic or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Usually, patients are advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate symptoms, but researchers from the University of Washington found that the protein&#39;s main amino acid, tryptophan, promotes the production of immune cells that increase gut tolerance.
Lead researcher Dr. Marco Colonna explained that immune cells in the gut ensure that harmful microbes from food do not enter the body.
Cells capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that increase tolerance, protecting the body without harming sensitive tissues.
If the balance is too far off in the direction of inflammation, it can lead to inflammatory bowel disease.
Experiments have shown that mice that have a particular bacterium in their gut develop tolerance-enhancing cells.
And this bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of protein - to trigger the appearance of these cells.
Professor Colonna said: &quot;We have established a link between one species of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is part of the normal gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that increase tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their diet, the more of these immune cells they had.&quot;
He suggested that the same would work in humans: Combining L. reuteri and a tryptophan-rich diet could promote a more tolerant and less inflammatory environment in the gut.
Postdoc Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraganvas, studying a variety of tolerance-enhancing immune cells, found that one group of experimental mice had these cells, while another group, which belonged to the same strain but were kept separately, did not.
She suggested that the difference could be caused by the mice&#39;s gut microbiomes - communities of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
DNA from mouse intestinal cells was sequenced and six species of bacteria were found, present in mice with immune cells but absent in mice without them.
Mice raised in a sterile environment that did not have a good microbiome and did not develop this type of immune cell received L. reuteri and developed immune cells.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, the researchers grew L. reuteri in a liquid medium and then transferred small portions of the liquid - free of bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated from mice.
Immune cells have evolved into tolerance-enhancing cells.
When the active ingredient was separated from the liquid, it turned out to be a by-product of tryptophan processing known as indole-3-lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice&#39;s diet, the number of these cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan level was halved, the number of cells also dropped by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explains that humans have the same tolerance-enhancing cells that mice do, and most of us have L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri promote cell development in humans in the same way as in mice, but defects in tryptophan-related genes have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
She says: “Perhaps we need to strengthen the development of these cells, since inflammatory processes on the inner surface of the intestines depend on these cells.
High levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri could potentially lead to an expansion of their population.&quot;
Jose Mourinho says Manchester United have hired a &#39;genius&#39; in Nemanja Matic
Manchester United have hired a &#39;genius&#39; in Nemanja Matic, according to José Mourinho after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
The £40m signing from Chelsea started with a 2-1 win in Dublin in United&#39;s last pre-season game ahead of the UEFA Super Cup clash against Real Madrid on Thursday and impressed as a midfielder while how players like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira blasted ahead at will.
However, as he did not take part in Chelsea&#39;s pre-season tour of Asia, Matic was severely lacking in preparation for the game and only lasted 45 minutes, which Mourinho says needs to be worked out before the start of the Premier League season.
&quot;He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, genius in the way he thinks - he thinks in football,&quot; said Mourinho.
&quot;We&#39;ll get him ready sooner rather than later.&quot;
Just like Matic, fellow new players Victor Lindelöf and Romelu Lukaku started at the Aviva Stadium as Mourinho began to build his first team for the start of next season.
The Independent reported this week that Mourinho wanted to sign three more players, but stressed that the club had already achieved fantastic results by signing three of the four players he would like to sign first.
&quot;I am grateful to the club for getting three out of four,&quot; he added.
&quot;I&#39;ll be even happier if they get me four out of four, but they&#39;ve already worked hard for me.&quot;
Former leaders of the Lithuanian Social Democrats persuade them to stay in the ruling coalition
Former chairmen of the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania, ex-premiers Algirdas Butkevičius and Gediminas Kirkilas, as well as former speaker of the Seimas from the Social Democrats Cheslovas Juršėnas appealed to fellow party members to remain in the ruling coalition.
As Parlamentskaya Gazeta reported, due to friction with partners - the Union of Peasants and the Greens - a discussion was initiated in the Social Democratic Party whether to remain in the ruling coalition.
And so three senior experienced comrades turned to their fellow party members with an open letter, which, in particular, says: “It is understandable that the party comrades are disappointed with the results of the elections, but the coalition with the ‘peasants’ has created for us, albeit not very easy, but still conditions for the further implementation of the goals of social justice, which, at our initiative, are envisaged in the program of the government, and to maintain the political dominance of the left center over the right parties.
According to the former leaders of the party, the discussion so far &quot;has been dominated by an expression of opinion based on emotions without concrete arguments.&quot;
The authors of the letter fear that their party&#39;s rash actions could lead Lithuania to political, economic and social instability.
Disabled Anton Mamaev was fined
The Moscow City Court mitigated the punishment of wheelchair disabled Anton Mamaev from four and a half years in prison to a fine of 200 thousand rubles.
Earlier, by decision of the Timiryazevsky court, the convict was released from the pre-trial detention center.
At the same time, the Moscow City Court confirmed that the accused is a criminal, since he organized the robbery and theft of a scooter from a former special forces soldier.
The Moscow City Court, by its decision, reduced the punishment for Anton Mamaev to 200 thousand rubles. fine.
&quot;Mamaev is the organizer of the robbery, which also constitutes a crime, and, accordingly, such a person should be held criminally liable,&quot; Ulyana Solopova, spokeswoman for the Moscow City Court, explained to Kommersant.
In this case, the court took into account Mamaev&#39;s state of health, the actual circumstances of the case, and the absence of aggravating circumstances.
In addition, the court applied Art. 64 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, according to which it is possible to impose a punishment below the lower limit.
As for Mamaev&#39;s assistant Vasily Seroshtanov, the court did not establish circumstances that would have become the basis for changing the category of gravity of the deed and changing the sentence.
Anton Mamaev himself said that he was dissatisfied with the decision of the Moscow City Court.
I am disappointed with the court&#39;s decision.
The only legal solution would be an acquittal, intends to continue to fight for justice.
His lawyer Andrei Orlov did not rule out an appeal against the verdict in the cassation instance of the Moscow City Court and the Supreme Court.
&quot;We will use all levers up to the European Court of Human Rights,&quot; he told RIA Novosti.
Recall that 28-year-old Muscovite Anton Mamaev, who suffers from spinal muscular atrophy, became a defendant in a criminal case last fall.
The disabled person claims that he bought a scooter from friends for 160 thousand rubles, in order to sell it later.
However, the owners of the motor scooter, including a former special forces fighter, said that the disabled person and his assistant Vasily Seroshtanov took away their property, threatening to use violence.
On June 30, the Timiryazevsky District Court of Moscow sentenced Vasily Seroshtanov to three years in prison, and Anton Mamaev to four and a half years in prison to be served in a penal colony (under part 2 of article 162 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation).
After the immobilized disabled person was placed in a pre-trial detention center, the Public Chamber, the Prosecutor General&#39;s Office, and the Commissioner for Human Rights under the President Tatyana Moskalkova joined the case.
As a result, in mid-July, Anton Mamaev was released from the pre-trial detention center by the decision of the same Timiryazevsky court.
The defense, in turn, appealed the decision of the first instance to the Moscow City Court.
ONF to prepare a report on ecology for the President
The final &quot;Forum of Action&quot; of the All-Russian Popular Front (ONF) in 2017 will be devoted to environmental issues, a source in the ONF told Izvestia and confirmed by the head of the executive committee of the movement, Alexei Anisimov.
According to him, following the results of the forum, &quot;front-line soldiers&quot; plan to prepare a report to the president on the problems of domestic ecology, as well as to propose a strategy for their solution.
Izvestia&#39;s interlocutors in the ONF note that the report to the head of state will contain &quot;deep analytics&quot; on the situation in all federal districts of the country.
According to Izvestia, the final forum of the ONF will take place in the fall.
The exact date of its holding has not yet been determined - as a rule, it adjusts to the schedule of the president, who is the leader of the movement and traditionally attends key events of the ONF.
The Front held several inter-regional environmental conferences, one for two federal districts - in Rostov-on-Don, Kaliningrad and Kirov.
The final conference will be held in the capital of the Republic of Buryatia, Ulan-Ude.
On the basis of the proposals that have been and will be made at these events, we will form systemic proposals for solving environmental problems, - a source in the ONF told Izvestia.
Olga Timofeeva, co-chair of the Central Headquarters of the movement, who heads the State Duma Committee on Ecology and Environmental Protection, said that the front-line soldiers will report to the head of state on the work carried out as part of the Year of Ecology in Russia.
The final ecological forum and the &quot;Forum of Action&quot; of the ONF will most likely be combined.
Over the course of the year, we acquired a powerful team of experts in the field of environmental issues, saw gaps in the legislation, and stopped dozens of violations of the law.
All this will be included in the report that we are preparing for the president as the leader of our movement.
In addition to this document, &quot;front-line soldiers&quot; will also report on work on priority projects of the ONF, Olga Timofeeva told Izvestia.
According to her, the special representative of the head of state on environmental issues, ecology and transport Sergei Ivanov will also be invited to the forum.
Previously, he had already taken part in the ONF Media Forum, which was held in St. Petersburg in April.
In a few months, the Year of Ecology will go down in history, and the most important thing to do today is to launch environmental protection mechanisms so that they work for many years.
So that these issues do not fall out of the agenda, - Olga Timofeeva added.
Andrey Kolyadin, head of the regional policy laboratory of the Expert Institute for Social Research (EISI), noted that by raising environmental issues, the ONF is acting in line with the presidential agenda.
As experts, they proposed many things at various forums, and these initiatives received the support of the president, Andrei Kolyadin told Izvestia.
He stressed that today it is impossible to exclude the economic potential of the environmental agenda, which can give the regions an additional impetus for development.
In the future, with the help of the ONF, the regions will be able to lobby not only for the solution of their environmental problems, but also for the development of ecotourism, the expert added.
The relevance of environmental issues was demonstrated by the &quot;straight line&quot; with Vladimir Putin in June.
In particular, the president was asked questions about the garbage dump in Balashikha (already closed) and about coal dust in the port of Nakhodka (a bill has already been developed to ban open transshipment of coal in settlements, one of the authors is Olga Timofeeva).
Experts in the field of ecology believe that the legal basis for solving environmental problems in Russia as a whole has been created, the issue is further law enforcement practice, as well as the position of civil society.
We need a clear implementation of the decisions taken by the state, - says the head of the charitable foundation &quot;Ecology for All&quot; Leonid Bochin.
Sergei Tsyplenkov, a member of the Human Rights Council and the head of the non-governmental organization Greenpeace Russia, in a conversation with Izvestia stressed that a responsible approach by society and business is needed to successfully solve environmental problems, and legislative efforts alone are not enough.
As soon as society and business realize that the solution of environmental problems is a much more profitable step in the strategic perspective, the situation will change, - Sergey Tsyplenkov noted.
The expert stressed that it is necessary to reverse the trend that violation of environmental legislation is an economically beneficial solution for business.
British inventor implanted himself with a microchip to get into the house and car with a wave of his hand
A British inventor has become the first person in the country to have a microchip installed so that he can open the door of his house, enter his office and even start his car with a simple wave of his hand.
Thirty-three-year-old Stephen Northam implanted a tiny chip between his thumb and forefinger and now, through his firm BioTech, offers the service to businesses and individuals who want to make their lives easier with technology.
He teamed up with Dr. Jeff Watson, Consultant Anesthesiologist at the Royal Winchester, to ensure that the implantation procedure was carried out according to medical standards.
The technology is similar to a microchip that is implanted in cats and dogs, and the procedure takes only 30 seconds.
Northam&#39;s company also replaces locks in homes and cars with chip-compatible locks at a cost of £300 per lock.
The married father of one has already installed the technology in his home and in his BMW Z4, which starts when his hand is on the steering wheel.
Props for the White House cost taxpayers thousands of dollars
According to military records released to TIME magazine, the White House&#39;s decision last month to fly a Marine Corps helicopter to the South Lawn for an event celebrating American industrial production cost taxpayers as much as $24,000.
A green and white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as &quot;Marine One&quot; when the president is on board, was the centerpiece of a July 17 event at the White House that showcased US construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and top White House officials toured technology products from all fifty states.
The Connecticut-built helicopter was displayed next to a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin fire truck, and a Mississippi forklift.
According to records from Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the department responsible for helicopter operations, the White House Military Department ordered the helicopter&#39;s presence in a private order, or &quot;FRAGO&quot;, just 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn. on the occasion of an &quot;unusual&quot; event.
&quot;I just wanted you to make sure you&#39;re in the know because this is an unusual high-profile event,&quot; the HMX-1 commander wrote in an email to his superior, the Marine Corps Air Force First Deputy Chief, on the eve of the event.
The letter indicated that the helicopter would arrive on the South Lawn at approximately 7 a.m. on July 17 for a 3 p.m. event and remain there until the lawn was vacated between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. that day.
The letter adds that if the departure from the White House is delayed, a second crew will be required for the return flight, subject to business hours restrictions.
The first crew escorted the helicopter throughout the event, and the unit&#39;s security guards remained close to the aircraft while it was on the ground.
From records obtained by TIME magazine, it remains unclear whether a second crew was eventually required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using public property for political purposes.
According to the records, HMX-1 clarified whether the event was in violation of this ruling.
“Among other things, we asked if this was a violation of the Hatch Law, and we were told that it was not,” the commander wrote.
“It looks like you have nowhere to go,” the deputy chief replied.
The &quot;Made in America&quot; event was declared an official event by the White House and was not covered by the Hatch Act.
But even official events have political overtones.
During the event, the President made efforts to advance health care reform, which was then in the process of being drafted in the Senate, and touted attempts to regulate government regulations.
The use of aircraft known as &quot;Marine One&quot; and &quot;Air Force One&quot; for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are instructed to use them for travel.
But requesting them solely for the sake of a photo opportunity is unusual.
Trump had already been the subject of controversy in February, when a presidential jet passed in the background during his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account was inundated with messages complaining about his predecessor&#39;s use of the presidential jet.
&quot;The White House is thrilled with the Made in America display, which featured products from 50 states made by American workers from American materials,&quot; said Lindsey Walters, Deputy White House Press Secretary.
HMX-1 crews often fly around the Washington metropolitan area and on the South Lawn to practice transporting the President of the United States to the White House to the nearest inch.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 practice landings at the White House.
According to one of the officials, the flight performed for the &quot;Made in America&quot; event was credited to the crew towards the required training flights for the month.
The unit&#39;s helicopters also flew 11 additional hours that day as part of &quot;non-presidential support missions.&quot;
According to the White House, taxpayers were not charged for any of the other exhibits presented at the event.
A Sikorsky spokesperson said the company was not involved in organizing the helicopter demonstration on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not keep track of the budget for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact amount spent on the event.
But, according to the DoD hourly rates for Fiscal Year 2017, the DoD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
Unit records recorded the aircraft&#39;s time in the air as 30 minutes each way from its home base at Marine Corps Air Station Quantico in Virginia.
The White House claims that the real cost of using a helicopter is much lower than this rate.
“Calculating the cost to taxpayers based on an estimated refund rate is completely wrong,” Walters says.
&quot;These approximate rates include personnel, maintenance and many other sunk costs that are included in the annual appropriations.&quot;
According to a 2015 study by the RAND Corporation, reimbursement rates do not include the cost of personnel, but do include the cost of fuel, maintenance, and contracted expenses.
At the time, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer spoke out in defense of using a helicopter for the event.
&quot;The idea is to showcase American made stuff this week,&quot; Spicer said.
“And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they are contributing to national security, and that there are, I guess, hundreds if not thousands of people whose jobs depend on it.
And I think, like most Americans, that we are all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly to create.
So, of course, it is perfectly appropriate to pay attention to it.”
It was unclear if Trump was interacting with the helicopter as he surveyed the South Lawn during the event, but he certainly sat in the driver&#39;s seat of a fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump addressed Sikorsky representatives, joking with the press about his own fleet of the company&#39;s products.
“I know Sikorsky very well,” the president said. “I have three of them.”
Moscow will allocate grants for intensive care units of city hospitals
Every year, Saving Lives grants will be allocated to intensive care units and intensive care units of the capital&#39;s medical clinics.
The funds will be used to encourage doctors and nurses.
Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin visited the Yudin City Clinical Hospital.
During the inspection of the clinic, he presented a letter of thanks to the traumatologist-orthopedist Viktor Protsko, under whose leadership the most difficult operation to reconstruct the teenager&#39;s foot was performed.
Sergei Sobyanin also spoke about the decision to annually allocate grants to intensive care units and intensive care units of city clinics.
Funds will be used to encourage doctors and nurses.
According to the capital&#39;s mayor, the Yudin Clinical Hospital is by far one of the largest in Moscow.
In recent years, the clinic has received new modern equipment that allows its doctors to perform unique operations.
The clinic was opened in 1961 on the basis of the Kolomna rural hospital.
Currently, the departments of the medical institution are designed to receive more than a thousand patients.
In addition to resuscitation and a hospital, there are day departments here.
The staff of the hospital has 2800 people.
The total area occupied by the medical clinic is 23.7 hectares.
In February of this year, the medical institution became a participant in a pilot project for the organization of short-stay hospitals (SSTs).
They are designed for relatively small operations.
In the process of surgical interventions, advanced medical equipment is used, which can significantly reduce the rehabilitation time for patients.
After the operation, they spend only a few hours in the hospital.
In the first half of this year alone, the Yudin Clinical Hospital provided inpatient medical care to 36,000 patients.
The medical staff of the clinic performed 15,800 operations of varying degrees of complexity.
NBU announced the absence of buyers of the Ukrainian &quot;daughter&quot; of Sberbank
The National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) reported that there were no applications for the purchase of the Ukrainian &quot;daughter&quot; of Sberbank.
On Friday, August 4, TASS reports with reference to a representative of the press service of the NBU.
The NBU confirms that on August 3, 2017, a package of documents from a citizen of Belarus and Cyprus, Viktor Prokopenya, to agree on an indirect (through Paritetbank) acquisition of 100 percent of Sberbank shares was withdrawn.
&quot;Documents from other potential investors for the purchase of Sberbank shares have not been received by the NBU,&quot; the report says.
On August 3, Belarusian businessman Viktor Prokopenya withdrew his application for the purchase of a subsidiary of Sberbank.
On July 28, it became known that the National Bank of Ukraine refused to Russian businessmen Said Gutseriev and Grigory Guselnikov to acquire the Ukrainian &quot;daughter&quot; of Sberbank.
The regulator justified its decision by the fact that the businessmen did not provide the necessary documents for verification of their compliance with the requirements of Ukrainian legislation.
Sberbank announced the sale of its Ukrainian subsidiary to a consortium of Norvik Banka and a private Belarusian company in March of this year.
The majority shareholder of the consortium was Said Gutseriev, the son of Russian businessman Mikhail Gutseriev.
Sanctions against the subsidiaries of five Russian banks in Ukraine, among which was Sberbank, were introduced in mid-March.
During the year, they are prohibited from withdrawing capital from the country in favor of parent organizations.

Democracy in Afghanistan depends on the role of women in politics, the UN said.
Elections can only be representative when all members of society, including women, participate in them, the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
Hundreds of women are running for provincial council elections, three women are vying for the vice presidency, and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women, according to Nicholas Haysom, the current head of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan.

Venice tightens fines for tourists for inappropriate behavior
The Venetian authorities have tightened the fines for swimming in canals from 50 euros to 500 euros.
For walks around the city in a bathing suit or bare-chested will now be fined 200 euros.
100 euros will be required from those who have a picnic in a public place or ride a bicycle through pedestrian areas, TASS reports with reference to the Association of Tour Operators of Russia.
In addition, it is mentioned that the authorities provide for a fine of 400 euros for inscriptions on monuments and 25 euros for garbage.
Tourists will be informed about the need to comply with the rules of conduct in Venice with the help of a special campaign &quot;Enjoy, respect Venice&quot; (#EnjoyRespectVenezia) on social networks, as well as through announcements and posters on the website of the city council, on billboards and in places of the greatest concentration of tourists .
The campaign will be conducted in 10 languages.
According to Venice tourism adviser Paola Mar, information about the fines will be passed on to the embassies of the violators&#39; home countries in order to warn their compatriots against such mistakes.
&quot;The problem is that Venice is perceived as a beach,&quot; she said.
In April, the administration of the Italian city announced plans to limit the flow of tourists.
Venice has already successfully implemented a limit on the number of tourists visiting the city center.
Instead of 100,000 people wishing to watch the Festa del Redentore, only 60,000 guests were allowed to enter the venue.
In addition, a moratorium has been introduced on the creation of new hotels and fast food restaurants in the historical part of Venice.

The Federation Council dismissed Ozerov from the post of head of the committee
On Wednesday, the Federation Council supported the statement of Viktor Ozerov, Chairman of the Committee on Defense and Security, and dismissed him from this post.
He remains a senator from the Khabarovsk Territory.
Ozerov wrote a statement asking him to be relieved of his post last week.
He explained his decision by the need for rotation and his desire to &quot;change the rhythm of life.&quot;
The senator also noted that the decision to leave was not momentary.
Since 1996, Viktor Ozerov has been representing the legislative assembly of the Khabarovsk Territory in the Federation Council of the Russian Federation.
The senator has been in charge of the Defense and Security Committee since 2001.
Electricity is getting cheaper for both residents and producers of Buryatia
The decades-long efforts of the Soviet and post-Soviet authorities of the Republic of Buryatia (Eastern Siberia) to establish fair tariffs for electricity consumers are beginning to bear fruit.
From September 1, the cost of low-voltage electricity for industrial consumers will be reduced by 25%.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service of the country in accordance with the Decree of the Government of the Russian Federation &quot;On Amendments to the Rules of the Wholesale Electricity and Capacity Market and to the Consolidated Forecast Balance of Production and Supply of Electricity (Capacity) within the Unified Energy System of Russia for the Subjects of the Russian Federation&quot; (dated 17.07. 2017 No. 842) set indicative prices for electricity and capacity for industrial consumers in the Republic of Buryatia.
As a result, the cost of electricity for Buryat producers is reduced by a quarter, which will greatly facilitate the life of small and medium enterprises and individual entrepreneurs.
For many decades, the leaders of the republic have been knocking on the thresholds of Moscow offices in vain attempts to equalize the region in tariffs with the neighboring Irkutsk region with a cascade of hydroelectric power plants on the Angara, flowing from Baikal, the main catchment area for which is Buryatia.
And it&#39;s only this year that things are moving forward.
In March, electricity tariffs for the population of the republic were reduced from 4.24 rubles/kWh to 3.93 rubles/kWh, or by 7.3%.
With the inclusion of Buryatia, by decision of the federal government, in the List of territories of price zones of the wholesale market, for which the features of the functioning of the wholesale and retail markets are established, the turn of industrial consumers has come.
According to analysts, this is only the beginning, since the population of the Irkutsk region pays 1.01 rubles per kilowatt / hour.
But no one dares to name at least an approximate date for new downward tariff shifts for Buryatia.
Scooter was not afraid of the Prosecutor General&#39;s Office of Ukraine and flew to Crimea
The legend of electronic dance music, the Scooter group flew to the Crimea, not being afraid of threats from the General Prosecutor&#39;s Office of Ukraine.
&quot;The flight went well, and tomorrow I will have a concert,&quot; RIA Novosti quotes the words of H. P. Baxter, the band&#39;s frontman.
Earlier, the German publication Bild, citing Deputy Prosecutor General of Ukraine Yevgeny Enin, reported that musicians could face up to eight years in prison for coming to Crimea, which Kiev considers temporarily occupied territory of Ukraine.
Scooter&#39;s performance at the festival in Balaklava, called #ZBFest, is scheduled for August 4th.
#ZBFest is held by Zolotaya Balka in honor of International Champagne Day.
Scooter, one of the most famous bands in Germany, was founded in 1993.
Ace&#39;s last album was released in 2016.
In addition to Scooter, Sergey Galanin and his group &quot;SerGa&quot;, as well as Garik Sukachev with &quot;Brigade S&quot; will perform as guests of the festival.
The premiere of the new season of &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; will take place in the Moscow metro
The Russian premiere of the seventh season of &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; will be held in the capital&#39;s subway.
The Komsomolskaya Pravda website writes about this.
It is known that the first episode will be shown on the night of July 18 at one of the stations as part of the &quot;Night in the Metro&quot; campaign.
In the lobby, under the soundtrack of the series, visitors will be met by actors dressed as white walkers.
Also, everyone will be able to take a picture with a copy of the iron throne, which will be installed on the platform.
According to Roman Latypov, First Deputy Head of the Moscow Metro, showing the series underground, which will be the first in history, will help viewers better feel what is happening on the screen.
National Union of Unskilled, Municipal and Boiler Workers (GMB) concerned about capital investment at McVitie&#39;s factory in Glasgow
The union is seeking guarantees from managers at biscuit maker McVitie&#39;s over its long-term commitment to production at the Glasgow plant.
GMB Scotland says the company has been silent on the future of investment at the Tolcross site.
The factory, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea among other products, employs over 500 people.
Pladis, owner of McVitie&#39;s, says it has invested more than £5m in the facility over the past few years.
The company adds that if there are any changes to the operation of the facility, employees and union representatives will “be the first to know.”
In a letter to the manager of a company-owned facility, GMB Scotland demanded that McVitie&#39;s respond to concerns that funding would not be released to modernize production lines.
Senior organizer Drew Duffy said: &quot;Our union members are deeply concerned that we cannot get clarity from the site&#39;s general manager on the business needs and investment plan for the future of Tolcross.&quot;
Families have worked here for generations and the concentration of workers is high in the local community and in the Greater Glasgow area; it is an essential pillar of decent work in an area of high unemployment and social deprivation.
So in terms of jobs, wages and prosperity, and against the backdrop of Brexit, a rising cost of living and a chronic decline in manufacturing, Glasgow&#39;s East End desperately needs McVitie&#39;s factory to thrive.
According to a Pladis spokesperson, &quot;The Tolcross Site Manager just received a letter yesterday from GMB Scotland and the company will respond immediately as we value our continued cooperation with staff and union representatives.&quot;
Two months ago we held a regular meeting in Talcross with GMB staff and representatives where we openly discussed a number of issues.
We spoke with staff about how, like all companies operating in the most competitive and volatile economic environments, we are constantly rethinking how we operate – and this applies to all of our facilities and activities – to stay competitive.
“Over the past years we have invested over £5 million in our Tolcross facility, especially in production lines and performance improvements.”
We are fully aware of the value of Tolcross as a manufacturing facility and should there be any change to operations at this facility, employees and union representatives will be the first to know.”
Putin said that the authorities will not give instructions to Rosneft and Gazprom
Vladimir Putin said that the Kremlin and the Cabinet of Ministers should get involved in the issue of gas supplies to the Eastern Petrochemical Company (VNKhK), but no one would give instructions to Gazprom or Rosneft.
So Russian President Vladimir Putin responded to the request of Igor Sechin to assist in resolving the contradictions that have arisen.
The head of state drew attention to the fact that relations between Rosneft and Gazprom should be decided solely on the basis of market principles.
Earlier, the head of Rosneft, Igor Sechin, at a meeting on the implementation of large investment projects in the Far Eastern Federal District, said that the lack of an agreement with Gazprom on gas for the VNKhK jeopardizes the project&#39;s implementation period.
Sechin noted that the dialogue with Gazprom on this issue continues.
Gazprom proposes to find gas resources from the perimeter of Rosneft, but we do not have such resources,&quot; Sechin added.
Recall that Rosneft asked to be allowed to use gas from Gazprom&#39;s Kirinskoye field, located on the Sakhalin shelf, for Eastern Petrochemical Company.
In June, Gazprom stated that negotiations on this issue were ongoing and &quot;there are no sharp corners there.&quot;
Did PSG warn Barcelona of Neymar&#39;s move three years ago?
La Liga star may regret his interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain won&#39;t stop chasing Neymar after the club offered £189m to buy him out, but did they warn Barcelona of the world record-setting raid three years ago?
The sensational offer revitalized the summer transfer window as the Ligue 1 club were poised to break the world record for transfer costs, more than double the previous mark associated with Paul Pogba&#39;s return to Manchester United last season for £89m.
When the transition is complete, Neymar will be the most expensive player in the world, as well as the highest paid professional athlete in the world, as PSG offer him a salary of over £500,000 a week net.
Barcelona are known to be furious at how the offer was made and how Neymar terminated the contract, despite the fact that, according to a source close to the management of the Catalan club, the club has always done everything possible for the player since his transfer from Santos in 2013.
But wasn&#39;t the football world warned of this possibility three years ago by the president of PSG?
When Manchester City expressed interest in hiring Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi issued a stern warning to any club looking to poach one of PSG&#39;s best players.
&quot;I&#39;m not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will turn against them, we will make offers to their players,&quot; Al-Khelaifi said.
“We respect all clubs.
But if they try to recruit one of our players, there will be consequences.&quot;
By all accounts, Barcelona crossed that line when the Spanish club expressed an interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG have made it clear they will not let go of the Italian international on any terms, and now it is likely that Barcelona are feeling the consequences of their offer in the form of the loss of one of their most valuable players, Neymar.
Putin instructed to deal with payments to victims of forest fires.
Russian President Vladimir Putin instructed to sort out the financial assistance that is allocated to residents affected by forest fires and for the construction of new housing.
Today I would like to hear how the work is going.
In particular, I ask you to report on the state of affairs with payments and compensations to affected citizens.
I have some variation.
&quot;On this occasion, I would also like to ask the relevant colleagues questions about how much money has been allocated,&quot; Putin said at a meeting with the leaders of the regions located on Lake Baikal.
On August 4, Vladimir Putin visited the Baikal State Natural Biosphere Reserve.
Putin was accompanied by Sergei Menyailo, Plenipotentiary Envoy of the President of the Russian Federation in the Siberian Federal District, and Leonid Mikhailik, head of the Baikal branch of Glavrybvod.
They talked about the work on cleaning the lake.
Then they showed the fry in an open container next to the container, which were prepared for breeding.
First, Putin released a few fry from the net.
Then he pulled a special lever on the lid of the container and released the others.
Also during the trip, the leader instructed to deal with the ecological situation on Lake Baikal and build a road on Olkhon Island.
According to the Ministry of Construction, one volume is needed, but supposedly another volume is provided.
&quot;I want to sort this out, what, in fact, is going on with our funding,&quot; the Russian leader emphasized.
Recall that during the forest fires of 2017, the fire covered the settlements of Buryatia, the Irkutsk region, residential buildings and outbuildings were destroyed.
In Ukraine, they proposed sending Russians to prison for illegally crossing the border
A draft law has been registered in the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, according to which criminal punishment for Russians for illegally crossing the Ukrainian border may appear in the republic.
According to the RT channel, a document registered in the electronic database of the Ukrainian parliament provides for a three-year prison sentence for Russian citizens trying to illegally enter the country.
It is noted that for a repeated offense or an act committed by a group of persons, the term of imprisonment can be increased up to five years.
If the offender was detained at the border with a weapon, then the time of detention for him will increase to eight years.
Earlier it was reported that Ukrainian border guards detained Ukrainians who were trying to get into Russia outside the established checkpoints.
&quot;Magnet&quot; went into wholesale
Magnit, the second largest food retailer in terms of revenue, announced the opening of three test stores of the new Magnit-Opt format, which are designed for the purchase of products in small wholesale.
At the same time, the possibility of purchasing goods at retail remains, according to a press release from the company.
Stores of the new format have been launched in Krasnodar, Saratov and Ulyanovsk.
Their range includes about 1.5 thousand items of food and non-food products.
&quot;The new service will allow companies and entrepreneurs to make purchases with financial gain, and residents to purchase food in reserve: for a week or a month,&quot; Magnit is sure.
Metro Cash &amp; Carry and Selgros Cash &amp; Carry are already operating in the small wholesale segment.
In 2017, Lenta launched a special Lenta Pro program: it offered legal entities and private entrepreneurs to make purchases at special hypermarket checkouts, receive invoices for cost accounting and VAT refunds.
The project is focused on the HoReCa segment, small retail and offices.
Two new territories of priority social and economic development will appear in Russia - &quot;Abaza&quot; and &quot;Novotroitsk&quot;.
The corresponding decrees of the Government of the Russian Federation will come into force today, August 4.
The boundaries and types of economic activity of the ASEZ on the territory of the city of Abaza in the Republic of Khakassia are determined.
In a city with a population of 15 thousand people, a special legal regime for entrepreneurial activity will operate, as well as a minimum amount of capital investments of residents, a minimum number of new permanent jobs.
It is assumed that this will attract about 2.5 billion rubles of investments to the city, and more than 600 new jobs will be created.
The list of economic activities under which a special legal regime of entrepreneurial activity will operate in the Abaza ASEZ, for example, includes crop production, animal husbandry, the production of food products, soft drinks and clothing.
The Government of the Republic has already signed framework agreements on the implementation of 8 investment projects.
It is also planned to reduce the dependence of the territory on the city-forming enterprise Abakansky Rudnik LLC.
In January 2017, the regional authorities reported that Khakassia had fulfilled all the conditions of the Ministry of Economic Development for the creation of the ASEZ.
The authorities of the Orenburg region did the same.
There, in the city of Novotroitsk, a territory of advanced social and economic development will also be created.
This will allow diversifying the economy of the single-industry town, reducing its dependence on the city-forming enterprise JSC Ural Steel, as well as creating more than 2.3 thousand jobs and attracting investments in the amount of more than 8 billion rubles.
The list of economic activities under which the new ASEZ will have a special legal regime for entrepreneurs includes, in particular, freshwater fish farming, the production of feed, medicines and medical materials.
Novotroitsk became the first of the single-industry towns of the Orenburg region to receive the status of a TOP.
Recall that the priority development area is an economic zone with preferential tax conditions, simplified administrative procedures and other privileges, which is being created to attract investment and improve the life of the population.
Among the benefits for residents of the ASEZ, the following can be distinguished: income tax in the amount of not more than 5% during the first five years, and not less than 10% over the next 5 years, social contributions in the amount of 7.6% for 10 years, use free customs zone regime, preferential connection to various infrastructure facilities, as well as preferential rental rates.
Vine called Manson a &quot;rabble&quot; and threatened to &quot;slap in the face&quot;
Yuri Loza expressed his indignation at the statement of the American rock musician Marilyn Manson, who insulted Moscow.
In an interview with Komsomolskaya Pravda, the Russian singer called Manson a &quot;scoundrel&quot; and &quot;rabble.&quot;
According to Loza, foreign artists who allow themselves such statements should not be invited to Russia.
In addition, Loza believes that Manson should be &quot;punched in the face&quot; for his words.
Recall that the American artist, known for his outrageous acts, spoke rudely about the Russian capital at a concert in Kyiv.
Earlier Thursday, Argumenty Nedeli wrote that domestic producer Iosif Prigozhin commented on Manson&#39;s statement.
In Moscow, a police officer wounded a man in the leg, defending himself from an attack
A police officer shot a participant in a fight in Moscow in the leg after he attacked him with a piece of glass in his hand.
On August 3, in the evening, the police department of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs for the Yakimanka district received a message about a fight on Mytnaya Street, 46.
&quot;The arriving police squad stopped the offense and separated the participants in the conflict,&quot; RIA Novosti reported with reference to the press service of the capital&#39;s main department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
According to police, when one of the participants in the conflict attacked an employee of the Ministry of Internal Affairs with a piece of glass, the policeman warned the man several times about the use of weapons and fired a warning shot.
This did not stop the bully, after which a law enforcement officer shot the man in the leg.
The injured man needed hospitalization.
