Germany is the first in Europe to introduce an "indefinite gender" when registering children
Germany will be the first country in Europe to allow the registration of children born hermaphrodites, instead of male or female to indicate "indefinite".
The child's parents will have the right to leave the "gender" column on the birth certificate blank for a while.
Instead of "F" (female) or "M" (male), parents can temporarily write down "X" (indefinite).
This decision is aimed at not pushing parents to rush to the operation to "clarify" gender.
According to statistics, one in 2 thousand newborns in the world is born with a hermaphrodite.
Anger over the verdict of the organizers of the terrorist attack in Bali
Survivors and relatives of the 202 victims of a 2002 Bali bombing reacted angrily to the sentence handed down to the last of the conspirators, who was brought to trial, and said that Umar Patek should be shot.
Patek, who spent nearly 10 years on the run as one of Southeast Asia's most wanted men, was sentenced yesterday to 20 years in prison for his role in building explosive devices used in the attack.
He can be released for 15 years if he receives parole.
The 45-year-old defendant was found guilty of mass murder in an attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, during which 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and injured dozens more.
He was also found guilty on a number of other terrorism-related charges, including a wave of church bombings across Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
Prosecutors have demanded a life sentence, although they could have insisted that the man, nicknamed the "subversive" for his reputation as an explosive device maker, should be sentenced to death.
The decision exacerbated the painful memories of Perth mother June Cortin, who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in a terrorist attack carried out by Patek and his accomplices nearly a decade ago.
Barely holding back tears, she said that Patek should have been sentenced to death.
"I really believe he should follow in the footsteps of other guys.
He must appear before the firing squad," Ms Cortin told the AAP.
"I have to live every day knowing that I will no longer have grandchildren and I will not see my daughters."
Club Sari was destroyed when a massive explosive device planted in a van parked outside was detonated just after 11 p.m. on 12 October 2002.
Peter Hughes had been at paddy's bar, where a suicide bomber had detonated a backpack packed with explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
After this terrorist attack, he fell into a coma for a month and "died" three times, being connected to the life support system.
Mr Hughes said Patek should share the fate of three other members of the Jemaah Islamiyah terrorist cell responsible for the carnage , Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samoudra, who were executed four years ago.
Indeed, this guy deserves the death penalty the most.
Save his life, well, there's no reason to save his life.
Getting 20 years after killing 202 people and injuring hundreds is not that much.
Patek is the latest participant in the Bali attack to stand trial.
He went into hiding for nearly a decade but was eventually detained in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where U.S. troops killed former al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, the FBI agent testified that intelligence evidence showed That Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an attempt to re-establish ties between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.
"He didn't give up," Ms Cortin said.
Until recently, he didn't regret how much grief he caused to other people.
The verdict comes ahead of the 10th anniversary of the attack, which will be celebrated later this year in Bali and Australia.
"There will be a lot of tears this year," says Ms. Cortin.
Patek can still appeal his verdict.
Medvedev expects that the SSJ-100 aircraft will be delivered to Europe
Russia expects that after gaining a foothold in the markets of Latin America and Asia, the Superjet 100 aircraft will be delivered to Europe.
"We expect that in total we will receive such agreements for more than 170 copies of aircraft of this type," Interfax quoted Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev as saying at a press conference with French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault.
The head of the Russian government noted that serious cooperation has been established with French colleagues, since this is a joint project.
Today we discussed some financial issues related to insurance, but we hope that after this aircraft is strengthened in the markets of Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region, it will also be delivered to our partners in Europe.
"I hope that it will someday be delivered to France," the Russian prime minister stressed.
The SSJ-100 is an aircraft built by Sukhoi Civil Aircraft in partnership with Alenia Aermacchi.
The liner is designed on the basis of modern technologies and offers high standards of quality and comfort in the segment for 100 passenger seats.
Chicago goaltender Nikolai Khabibulin stressed that he understands that he must play better.
According to the 40-year-old Russian, he will continue to work hard in training.
In the Hawks' last two meetings, Khabibulin first conceded six goals against Tampa Bay and then four against Ottawa, and in the second game he was replaced after the fourth goal conceded.
We have to play well, and in the last two games I didn't succeed," CSNChicago quoted Khabibulin as saying.
- I need to find confidence in training, perhaps we should approach them as games, and try to achieve the best result.
You have to study your past games and work on the flaws that were.
There are a few small components that I need to improve, but in training I feel quite decent.
But for some reason, after a few goals, everything turns into some kind of snowball.
Maybe I need to relax a bit.
Goalkeepers - I don't think I'm the only one - always try to play the perfect game.
If I miss four, five, six, I'm not thrilled.
It doesn't matter what's going on in front of my gate.
I'm still working on myself to keep from missing as many pucks.
It's great that my teammates support, but in principle everything is simple: I have to play better.
Two games isn't the whole season, but I wanted to do a lot better.
But what happened, what happened.
I have to put that aside.
I'll just try to play the next match better.
Power engineers of Dnipropetrovsk region have launched a unique program to save... stork nests
In the old days, in order to bring storks to the yard, villagers on a high pole installed a wheel from a cart, and a heavy nest was well held on it.
Such special supports have not been installed for a long time, so storks have chosen the poles of power lines - intertwined branches rely on wires, so that the stork house stands reliably.
Grandmother Anya, near whose house in the village of Ivanovka, Petrikovsky district, a stork family has been living for twenty years, began to notice how the nest settles, despite all the efforts of its inhabitants.
Birds put new twigs on top, and the bottom layer has already sagged between the wires, about to collapse.
Of course, I feel sorry for the family of storks who nested every year at the farmstead, bred and fed three or four chicks during the summer, but they do not want to remain without light.
As soon as the birds flew to warm lands, Grandmother Anya called the Tsarichansky RES, which owns the support.
And I did not even expect that they would react so quickly.
When our specialists arrived in Ivanovka, they were surprised that the nest was still holding at all," said Sergey Berezovsky, Technical Director of DTEK Dniprooblenergo.
On the wires, which were, in fact, already inside the socket, weighing 150 - 200 kilograms, corrosion began.
At any time, birds could die from an electric discharge.
And the locals risked being left without light due to damage to the wires.
Therefore, linear fitters have launched an operation to save the nest, and not for the first time in our practice.
Ornithologists from Dnipropetrovsk National University helped, who developed a scheme for transferring the nest.
They also conducted trainings for employees of district networks.
Well-known Dnepropetrovsk ornithologist Alexander Ponomarenko advised power engineers at all stages of nest reconstruction.
To begin with, it was estimated that more than 50 stork "apartments" are in disrepair in the region.
For their reconstruction, special metal platforms resembling a funnel were welded.
The base was braided with willow branches, and then the old nest was moved there.
According to experts, it is enough to lay old branches as a basis so that the birds recognize the nest and return to it.
Only then will the storks finish their own home.
A month ago, in the village of Peschanka, Novomoskovsk District, the first nest was reconstructed.
A new reinforced concrete pole was placed next to the electric pole and a platform with an old, already inhabited nest was placed on it.
The whole operation cost the power engineers nine thousand hryvnias.
And the other day the same housewarming party took place in the village of Ivanovka, Petrikovsky district, on the farmstead of Ani's grandmother.
Here, the platform was fixed in the same place, only raised above the wires.
Ornithologists are sure that cautious, conservative birds will not even notice in the spring that their "apartment" has undergone major repairs.
By the end of the year, the same reconstruction awaits four more nests in the Pokrovsky and Tsarichansky districts of the Dnipropetrovsk region.
By the way, while some save rare birds, others ruthlessly kill them.
The other day, sad news flew around the whole region - in the village of Ust-Kamenka of the Apostolovsky district, on the day of the opening of the pheasant hunt, poachers for the sake of entertainment shot a swan family that lived on a local pond.
Noble birds were not afraid of people at all - the locals fed them and did not offend them.
When the villagers, hearing the shots, ran to the pond, four handsome swans were already lying on the water dead.
Now employees of the Apostolovsky district police department are finding out who shot at the birds listed in the Red Book.
Stuck in Chita American Boeing is preparing for departure
Conducting observation flights over the territory of Russia within the framework of the Treaty on Open Skies and making an unscheduled landing in Chita on Wednesday, an American plane will leave the city's air harbor on Friday, November 1, at 8:30 Moscow time.
The airport management allowed the departure of the board, having received money for fuel.
As reported at the airport, the plane will fly to Ulan-Ude.
According to other sources, he will go to the United States.
As reported, the plane flying to Ulan-Ude landed in the Trans-Baikal Territory due to fog.
Due to unpaid bills, he was not allowed out of the Chita airport.
On board the plane are 30 people, including the crew, they spent two nights on the territory of the airport, reports ITAR-TASS.
According to the Russian Foreign Ministry, according to the terms of the Treaty on Open Skies, people on board the aircraft do not have the right to leave the Chita airport, they can pass border control only at two Russian airports - in Kubinka and in Ulan-Ude.
The Treaty on Open Skies was signed in 1992, it involves 34 states.
Observation flights are made over the territories of Russia, the USA, Canada, and European countries.
The main objectives of the Treaty are to develop transparency, promote the monitoring of the implementation of agreements in the field of arms control, expand opportunities for crisis prevention and crisis management within the framework of the OSCE and other international organizations.
Vitaly Mutko: Water cannons?
I think we're 15 years back.
Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko expressed his opinion on the riots in the stands during the match of the Russian Cup "Shinnik" - "Spartak".
I am in favor of the organizers of sporting events being responsible for all this: clubs, the league, the RFU.
But we see that they have taken a different position.
They are waiting for someone from the outside to come and restore order.
This is a very good position, but not quite the right one.
It is necessary to organize fans, clubs should invite their stewards, and not let things take their course.
We have just drafted a special government resolution on the rules of conduct at stadiums.
After it is adopted, we will come to grips with this problem.
But I will definitely invite all the organizers of the football process to join me.
I read Leonid Fedun's interview.
The state, they say, let's get the law done quickly.
It seems that it was bayern fans who came to Yaroslavl and arranged all this.
And we are bystanders.
And in general, it's terrible to see how the tribune is poured from the hose.
And this is in a country that is preparing for the World Cup.
"I have a feeling that we are 10-15 years back," Mutko said.
Cocaine-addicted lawyer who warned the ringleader of a criminal gang about a police investigation has been jailed
42-year-old Basharat Ditta passed information to crime boss Neil Scarborough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction would be revealed.
He was sentenced to three years' imprisonment by the Royal Court of Liverpool.
A prestigious lawyer who told a drug lord about a major police investigation because he feared exposing his secret drug addiction was jailed for three years.
Basharat Dittah, 42, gave crime boss Neil Scarborough classified information about his drug trafficking investigation after being threatened by his cocaine addiction.
The lawyer, nicknamed Bash and nicknamed the "tough lawyer" among criminals, was arrested at his home in 2011 after a police operation to spy on Scarborough, whom he had previously represented at a drug-related trial.
Officers noticed Scarborough, 32, leaving three bags of cocaine outside a lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was at a bar association dinner with colleagues.
Investigators revealed that Ditta "regularly used" a Class A drug after tests showed traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and on credit cards.
For eight months from January to August 2011, he tried to illegally obtain information about the arrests of two people on behalf of Scarborough, as well as one of his accomplices.
All four suspects were under police surveillance at the time as part of a major investigation into a criminal heroin and cocaine trafficking organization in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
They and 32 others were later jailed after police seized £1.5 million worth of heroin and cocaine in a series of raids, as well as more than £200,000 in cash.
Ditta, 42, passed on information to criminals out of fear that his cocaine addiction would be exposed.
At Liverpool Royal Court, Ditt, who works for Blackburn-based Forbes Solicitors, was now in shambles after being found guilty of two counts of intentional obstruction of justice following a three-week trial at Liverpool Crown Court.
He confessed to possession of cocaine at a previous court hearing.
The lawyer's exposure came after police investigating Scarborough found out that he had been talking to Ditt on the phone regularly since February 2011.
Two detectives followed the suspect and discovered how he approached Ditt's home in Blackburn and placed 60 per cent clean drugs in a black golf glove under the lawyer's trash cans.
Shortly after the pass, Scarborough repeatedly called Ditt, who was at dinner at Blackburn Rovers' Ewood Park football stadium.
The lawyer returned home for drugs; nine conversations took place between them.
The court learned that Ditt had "regularly used" cocaine after tests found traces of the Class A drug in his hair, wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested but denied using cocaine, said he had spoken to the suspect dealer because he was his client, and insisted that their communication constituted "attorney-client privilege."
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to take out several credit cards, but all of them were confiscated, and a hair sample was also taken from him.
When questioned by police, he said that along with his workplace, he had a home office and clients came to his house on legal matters.
However, the court learned that after important arrests, he called the largest participants in drug trafficking, a number of whom he had previously represented in court, to tell what detectives knew about them.
In an accusatory speech, Anne White said, "If anyone knows not to break the law, it's a criminal defense attorney."
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal lawyer because he has entered into too close a relationship with certain clients.
The contact we are talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer supplying drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his conversations will certainly prove legitimate, as he was their lawyer.
However, this has largely crossed the boundaries of the normal attorney-client relationship.
He obstructed the police investigation as much as possible to allow these individuals to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not honor his profession, but disgraced it.
He became too close to certain clients, particularly Scarborough, and allowed his disinterest to be questioned.
Ditta pleaded not guilty and said: "If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and I wanted to pass on the information to Mr Scarborough, I would not have waited 15 hours, I would have done so immediately."
But after the hearing, Senior Officer Lee Halstead of Lancashire Police said: "Mr. Ditta went from a criminal lawyer to a felon as soon as he started buying drugs from organized crime."
His addiction to cocaine had made him hopelessly compromised and vulnerable to the targeting of key members of criminal gangs, who had tasked him with obtaining valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers must follow the highest standards of professional ethics and instill trust and confidence in the public.
Mr. Ditta betrayed that trust and tried to hide behind his profession.
Mr. Ditt was investigated by the Lancashire Unit for Particularly Dangerous Organized Crime, which had already secured his conviction in three cases of cocaine possession and now in obstruction of justice, demonstrating our desire to obtain fair punishment for the perpetrators.
Let this case serve as a warning to criminals that no one is beyond the reach of the law.
We will find you and bring you to justice.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years after pleading guilty to conspiring to supply heroin, cocaine and marijuana.
Another 35 people involved in the fraud were sentenced to a total of 153 years for drug-related crimes.
On his website, Ditt organized a Q&A talk in which he says his dream job is a lawyer representing death sentence clients in America, the perfect companion for him over dinner is Muhammad Ali, and the motivation to work is inequality.
Jet manufacturers feud over seat width when big orders are at stake
A bitter dispute has erupted between leading aircraft manufacturers over the width of tourist class seats on long-haul flights, setting the tone for a fierce confrontation at this month's Dubai Aviation Expo.
The dispute revolves around the width of seats provided on long-haul flights to economy class passengers, whose interests are not always at the forefront of the attention of airlines, while the amount of space allocated to them plays a key role in the statements about the effectiveness of the latest aircraft offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
Airbus this week called for an industry standard that would provide for a seat width of at least 18 inches (46 cm) in economy class cabins, but its main U.S. rival Boeing says it's up to airlines to decide.
The dispute comes at a time when aircraft manufacturers are competing in sales of increasingly large versions of their twin-engine long-haul aircraft, and potentially record orders are expected at the Nov. 17-21 event.
The rear layout of the aircraft — especially whether 9 or 10 people are sitting in a row — is central to statements about the cost-effectiveness of new "mini-Airbus" projects.
Boeing claims that its updated 777X will seat 406 people, based on seats in the economy class more than 17 inches wide, placed 10 in each row.
Airbus says a rival version of its A350 will carry 350 people in economy class in 18-inch-wide seats arranged 9 in a row.
The giants of the aircraft industry often exchange blows on technical issues with the help of advertising in the professional press.
And now Airbus is speaking directly to the public ahead of the Dubai Air Show, where the 777X is expected to be the leader with more than 100 orders.
She recently demonstrated what the start of a new advertising war might be like by showing financiers a slide depicting three people in a restaurant snuggled up against each other, titled "Would you agree to this?"
"Boeing offers long-haul flights on seats narrower than those of regional turboprop aircraft," said Airbus sales manager John Leahy.
With the change in diet, people gain weight, but airplane seats have not changed dramatically.
Between the early 1970s, when the wide-body Boeing 747 set the standard for modern long-distance travel, and the turn of the century, the weight of the average American man between the ages of 40 and 49 increased by 10 percent, according to the U.S. Department of Health.
The waist circumference of the average 21st-century American man is 39.7 inches, according to statistics from the U.S. Health Service.
Airbus claims that its competitor adheres to the concept of seating in the 1950s, when the average waist circumference of those recently dubbed the "jet public" was narrower.
Airbus says it has commissioned a study showing that an extra inch in seat width improves sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing disputes Airbus' seat size figures and says manufacturers shouldn't interfere with decisions about how airlines find a balance between fares and amenities.
According to her, studies show that the convenience of the cabin depends not only on the width of the seat.
"It really comes down to giving airlines the choice and opportunity to do what they think they need to do to succeed," said Boeing cabin specialist Kent Craver.
They don't want us to decide for them what will make a profit for them.
They know their stuff better than anyone else.
For passengers, the issue is to increase the space on the sides, but for suppliers, this is increasingly becoming a factor that can affect profits.
Behind this dispute is a race for aircraft orders valued at at least $700 billion at catalog prices in the coming decades — enough to change the balance between U.S. and European exports.
As Reuters first reported in July, the seating arrangement is exactly what fuels the rivalry in the battle between the newest jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim a 20 percent increase in profitability by one seat in their latest twin-engine long-haul models compared to the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.
Boeing's claimed performance is based in part on a comparison of the 10-seater 777X rows with the original 9-seater layout of the 777 series.
The gain in unit cost is reduced when compared to the 10-seat layout currently in use.
"The reason Boeing is doing this is to squeeze in more seats and make its aircraft more competitive compared to our designs," said Kevin Keniston, Airbus' head of passenger comfort in Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say saloons with full 10-seater rows for the existing 777s indicate that many passengers prefer a tight seating arrangement that can go hand-in-hand with lower fares.
"Eighteen-inch-wide seats would be ideal for passengers, but the reality is that from a commercial point of view, Airbus' offering is driven by the threat from the 777 model," said interior specialist Mary Kirby, founder and editor of the Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats, but offer a catalog of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
Traveling around the world, jet sellers even carry tape measures with them to check on competing layouts.
Touting comfort, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with a very dense cabin layout for low-cost airlines and regional flights.
Airbus is offering the A350 with 10-seater rows, but says it hasn't sold it yet.
Until recently, Airbus stressed the need for additional cabin modifications, offering wider aisle seats on some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern aircraft, experts say, its call for a new industry standard is unlikely to "take off", but may distract attention from the wave of sales of the 777X model.
Oleynikov: a third of rural settlements in the Moscow region are fully subsidized
Vice-Governor of the Moscow region Yuri Oleynikov said that almost a third of the rural settlements of the Moscow region are completely subsidized
In total, 187 settlements out of 288 receive subsidies from the regional budget.
In 2013, 187 settlements out of 288 receive subsidies from the regional budget.
The share of subsidies in the budget revenues of 122 rural settlements exceeds 50%, and 83 - one hundred percent subsidized.
Within the framework of budget provision, about 25 billion rubles are allocated from the regional budget," Oleynikov said.
The vice-governor also noted that only three urban settlements - Mytishchi, Odintsovo and Pushkino - have more than 1 billion rubles in 2013.
The income of rural settlements in many areas is less than 3 million rubles, "this is not enough at all."
The cost of maintaining the local administrative apparatus in 88 settlements of the Moscow region is over 70%, "while there is a decrease in the quality of services," Oleynikov said.
Earlier, he instructed the heads of municipalities of the Moscow region to think over by the end of November which settlements need to be enlarged, merged into urban districts or changed the administrative management system.
These proposals will be finalized by the end of January.
Prior to this, the governor of the Moscow region said that as part of the administrative reform in the Moscow region, it is planned to reduce the number of subsidized rural settlements.
Also in Mozhaisk, Kashirsky, Solnechnogorsk, Kolomensky districts, Lyubertsy and Kotelniki there is a request for consolidation of municipalities.
Discussion of this issue in the cities and districts of the region will begin in November.
Chairman of the Moscow City Duma Igor Bryntsalov also said that about 30 rural settlements in 12 districts of the Moscow region plan to unite in total within the framework of the upcoming administrative reform.
This is due to the fact that of the 178 rural settlements in the Moscow region, less than a third have an "acceptable" financial base, and 100 are subsidized.
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing as a result of a conflict of powerful people
Under a top-down statue of Zamora Machel, Mozambique's founding president, thousands of people gathered in central Maputo to chant peace slogans at one of the rare demonstrations here.
"We want peace back; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, chief executive of the investment firm.
Fearing for the future of her country, she changed her business suit to a T-shirt emblazoned with the inscription "We demand security" in Portuguese, and joined the crowd on Thursday in the capital's Independence Square.
For two weeks, there have been near-daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, one of the most violent clashes since the truce more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a prominent insurgency that was supported first by the white authorities of Rhodesia and then by the apartheid-era government of South Africa as part of efforts to destabilize the country's independent government.
After the 1992 armistice, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country is unlikely to slide back into a full-scale conflict, but recent events have made foreign investors and local residents nervous.
The stakes are high for a fast-growing economy, as the discovery of huge offshore gas reserves and coal deposits in the Northwest could raise more than $50 billion in investment over the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale of Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko of the United States.
Frelimo's ruling party, the leading political force since 1975, and Renamo's party blame each other for the tensions.
Renamo's party claims the government was the instigator of the latest clashes by attacking its members in Sofala province, a traditional stronghold of Renamo, on Oct. 17.
Attacks on former rebels then escalated when government forces attacked Renamo bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group's leader, Fernando Mazanga, a renamo spokesman, told the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for initiating the clashes, accusing the party of attacking soldiers.
President Armandou Guebuza has tried to allay fears of instability.
Guebuza told AFP, a French news agency, on Wednesday that Mr Dhlakama felt like a "failure" who wanted to use "whatever was left of his strength to try to prove that he could impose his own solutions on the government".
Both Frelimo and Renamo insist they want to avoid war.
However, fears grew after it was reported that Mazanga announced Renamo's rejection of the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the Financial Times that he was referring to Frelimo's failure to comply with the agreement.
"Our goal is to return to negotiations, but with all seriousness," Mazanga said.
Previous talks between the parties have done little to ease tensions, which have been exacerbated by a series of clashes this year.
"These are two influential people (Gebuza and Dhlakama) facing foreheads," said Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and an expert on Mozambique.
None of them is a good negotiator and none of them is ready to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo's party, which is trying to push for electoral reforms, has already said it will boycott municipal elections scheduled for November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted this pressure as an attempt by a weakened movement to extract concessions and financial bonuses from the government.
The share of votes for Renamo has been declining since 1992, while a new party, the Mozambican Democratic Movement (MDM), which was founded by a former member of Renamo, is expected to improve its performance in these elections.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Guebuza, who was due to step down next year when his second term ended, wanted to destroy democracy in the country.
"He doesn't want multiparty democracy, he doesn't want transparent elections, he doesn't want peace because he doesn't want to leave the presidency," Mazanga said.
It is unclear what capabilities Renamo has, but it has already carried out devastating and swift attacks on police stations and cars on a key highway leading from north to south.
Most of the skirmishes took place in Sofala province, which is a few hundred kilometers north of Maputo but includes Beira, a port that mining companies including Rio Tinto and Vale use to export coal.
In June, Rio suspended the use of railway tracks for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the railway.
Mazanga was evasive when asked if Renamo would repeat the threat.
Renamo's party wanted to "warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique," Mazanga said.
Instability has heightened discontent with the government, and many people are also concerned about corruption, the slow pace of development and recent increased kidnappings, said Fernando Lima, head of the independent media company Mediacoop.
"People think that the responsibility for the future of the country lies with the government and the president, who must find a solution to these problems," he says.
Omar Sultuan, a participant in the demonstration, said people just want stability.
"Nobody cares about renamo or Frelimo, they just want the resumption of peace, they want free access to the roads," he said.
Rules for the use of electronic devices on aircraft in Australia will remain in force for the time being
Passengers of Australian airlines will need to continue to turn off their tablets and smartphones during takeoff and landing, despite measures in the United States to relax the rules regarding these devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has allowed U.S. carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read e-books, watch videos, or play games on their devices during takeoff and landing, provided they remain in "Airplane Mode."
Passengers can already do this during the main part of the flight, but many are annoyed that they do not have access to their e-books during takeoff and landing.
Australian carriers are considering the decision, which required U.S. airlines to do a huge amount of work to meet the new requirements, but have indicated that they have no plans to change their procedures in the near future.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also noted that they are considering this application, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical phases of flight are still in force in Australia.
"The Civil Aviation Safety Authority currently has no special rules governing the use of electronic devices in aircraft," it said.
This issue is governed by regulations that require air carriers to maintain security at all times, and passengers to comply with safety rules reported to them by crew members.
Virgin, which has already discussed with the Civil Aviation Aviation Safety Authority the expansion of the use of its entertainment system with Wi-Fi on board, was not against the changes, but said that it would follow the instructions of the regulator.
"We would welcome consideration by the Civil Aviation Aviation Safety Authority of allowing the use of electronic devices because we really think it will improve the customer experience now that it (the on-board wireless entertainment system) is on our aircraft," the spokesperson said.
Qantas said it would adhere to the current rules.
"Our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during takeoff and landing, and we do not plan to change it in the near future," she said.
The FAA ruling applies to U.S. airlines.
Nevertheless, we are always interested in regulatory changes that could benefit passengers, and we will certainly carefully study the DECISION OF THE FAA and the reasons that caused it.
For U.S. carriers, the impact of the ruling will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will have to prove that their aircraft are resistant to radio interference from mobile devices, as well as revise manuals, training materials, norms for carrying hand luggage and instructions for passengers.
"Once the airline has verified and confirmed the immunity of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable, lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, e-books and smartphones at any altitude," the FAA said.
In rare cases of poor visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to turn off their devices during boarding.
In addition, according to the group's recommendation, heavier devices should be located under the seats or in the upper luggage compartments during take-off and landing.
Obama retracts his words about health care
Amid a storm of criticism, President Obama backtracked yesterday on his oft-repeated, unequivocal promise that "if you like your health insurance plan, you can keep it."
Seeing hundreds of thousands of people receive service termination notices from their providers, Republicans have criticized the president in recent days for misleading the American public.
Yesterday, Obama slightly tweaked his initial public promise.
"Most people who have health insurance that works can keep it," he said in a speech in Boston.
Referring to what he called a "buzz in the news" about the suspension of services, Obama urged Americans receiving these notifications to look for other options in the market.
Most people will be able to get better, comprehensive health insurance plans at the same price or even cheaper than predicted.
"You're going to get better terms," he said.
The administration said it should come as no surprise that the 5 percent of the population who buy insurance on their own could be forced to change plans because their coverage doesn't meet the new standards needed under the Affordable Care Act.
"Let me say straight to these Americans: You deserve better," Sibelius said in a speech before the House Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington.
Sibelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the online sales platform has been "appallingly bad" since October.
"I'm as upset and angry as everyone else," she said.
"I really want to regain your trust."
An exasperated Sibelius dropped that phrase, which was picked up by the microphone on, to an assistant sitting behind her at yesterday's House hearing after a heated debate with Rep. Billy Long, a Republican from Missouri, about whether she herself was required to join Obama's health care program.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long once again urged Sibelius to say why the "architect" of the Affordable Care Act hadn't voluntarily given up government-sponsored insurance to purchase the plan through HealthCare.gov, which she now imposes on millions of Americans.
Dmitry Medvedev: Greenpeace case will be considered fairly
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev on Friday said that the case of Greenpeace activists will be considered in strict accordance with Russian law.
France can be sure that the case will be conducted in compliance with the law, we hear all the concerns.
"We can guarantee compliance with the laws," Dmitry Medvedev said at a meeting with French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault.
Among the detained Greenpeace activists is a French citizen.
Pierre Pisang, like other activists, has been charged with hooliganism.
"I asked if we can expect a humanitarian gesture against the detained citizen," RIA Novosti quoted Mr. Ero as saying.
"Our country cannot support activities that can damage the environment, no one has the right to violate the laws," Dmitry Medvedev said in turn.
According to him, the activities of any structures that try to influence technologically complex and unsafe processes, including energy production, are dangerous.
He stressed that these objects are "like a powder keg", and recalled what was happening in the Gulf of Mexico, RIA Novosti reports.
A friend of Semyon Varlamov said that the hockey player suffers from alcoholism
A friend of hockey player Semyon Varlamov Evgeniya Vavrinyuk said that he suffers from alcoholism, reports the Russian News Service.
"He has no idea how to stop drinking," the woman said.
Recall that Vavrinyuk filed a lawsuit for beating the goalkeeper of the Russian national team Semyon Varlamov, who is also a member of the Colorado club.
According to her, the hockey player dragged her by the hair, and also beat her - after the attack, her arms, chest, stomach and neck were damaged.
Varlamov himself came to the Denver police with a guilty plea and confessed to the beating, describing in detail what happened.
He was arrested but later released on $5,000 bail.
The court did not restrict the athlete from moving around the country, but forbade him to approach Wawrinyuk.
He also faces up to 6 years in prison for domestic violence.
Blizzard has released a 19-year-old platformer for free
Blizzard has released its 1994 platformer Blackthorne for free on PC.
It is reported by WoW Insider.
According to him, the game became available in the Battle.net in the section of classic games Blizzard.
However, some gamers note that currently only those users whose accounts belong to the American part of the service can download it.
For Russian users, the game is also not yet available.
According to media reports, the version that Blizzard has now released on the PC does not look different from the original version of the game.
The soundtrack to Blackthorne also remained unchanged.
The Blackthorne platformer, which Blizzard released 19 years ago, was originally released on SNES consoles.
Its events unfolded on the planet Tuul, whose inhabitants were divided into dark and light kingdoms.
One day, the dark ruler Sarlak decided to kill the light king Vlaros and become the sole ruler of the planet.
The protagonist of the game is Vlaros' son Kyle, who was saved from death by being sent to Earth.
Twenty years later, he returned to Tuul to fight Sarlak's henchmen and protect the inhabitants of the planet from them.
The original Blackthorne was the first game the studio released after its renaming to Blizzard Entertainment.
Before that, it was called Silicon & Synapse.
Blackthorne was published by Interplay.
Coulson resorted to hacking the phone to verify a confidential message
The former editor of the News of the World, Andy Coulson, allegedly used "phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation" in an attempt to confirm false information about the novel of Charles Clarke, who was then the Minister of the Interior.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis, QC, told the Old Bailey court that in May 2005, the News of the World had received false news that Clark was dating his "attractive special adviser" Hannah Polby.
The newspaper instructed private investigator Glenn Mulkair to hack into Polby's voicemail and waited for her outside the house to interview her, but Coulson also called her and left voice messages, the court heard.
"The prosecution believes that Mr Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not the kind of person who will stand outside someone's house hoping to catch someone by surprise, he is a man who likes to offer history to people to see what they have to say," Mr. Edis said.
He said the News of the World used three ways to investigate the stories: hacking phones, surveillance and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third.
Obviously he knows about the second, the surveillance, he just has to.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone hacking?
He says no, we say, "Oh yeah!"
Rumors of Clarke's affair first came to the attention of the News of the World when a source sexually interested in Ms. Polby was told, "Don't waste time, she's with Charles."
A cassette of voice messages received from her phone at least three times was seized from Mulkeir's home in August 2006.
Investigators also found recordings on the private investigator's computer in which Miss Polby and her sister appeared as "Projects".
During the period she was under surveillance, Ms. Polby's grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about her, Mr Edis said.
At the time, former chief reporter Neville Turlbeck and former reporter James Weatherrap oversaw surveillance of Ms. Polby's movements.
Leaving her a voicemail on June 18, 2005, Coulson said, "I have a story that we plan to publish tomorrow that I would very much like to discuss with Charles."
Mr. Edis said Coulson's involvement in the story followed the same pattern as with other influential people, such as former Home Secretary David Blankett.
The jury heard Thursday that Coulson had confronted Mr. Blankett over an affair with a married woman while he himself was dating co-defendant Rebecca Brooks, who was married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks deny conspiring with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulkair, Turlbeck and Wezerap confessed to hacking the phones.
In the bases of the Ministry of Internal Affairs there is no group "Brotherly Circle", to which Leps was ranked in the United States
In the databases of Russian security forces, the Bratsk Circle group, to which Washington ranked the singer Grigory Leps, is not listed.
As noted to Interfax in the law enforcement agencies of the Russian Federation, after reports appeared in the media about the inclusion of Grigory Leps by the US Treasury Department in the control lists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian criminal syndicate "Bratsk Circle", all databases were checked, but no such group was found.
The dissemination of this information contributes to the maintenance of the myth of the so-called "Russian mafia", which allegedly operates abroad, according to law enforcement agencies.
"Even in the very title - 'Brotherly Circle', there is a certain element of mystery, there is a hint of a secret lodge.
"All this is very similar to a PR action," the source said.
On October 31, the US Treasury Department announced the inclusion in its control lists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian criminal syndicate "Brotherly Circle" artur Badalyan, Grigory Lepsveridze, Vadim Lyalin, Sergey Moskalenko, Yakov Rybalsky and Igor Shlykov.
The individuals on this list are suspected of having links with some Vladislav Leontiev and Gafur Rakhimov, who are considered influential members of criminal groups and have been on the US sanctions lists since February 2012.
According to the American authorities, Grigory Leps "serves as a courier for the delivery of money on behalf of Vladislav Leontiev."
The production center of Grigory Leps refused to comment on the US accusations against the singer, calling them "nonsense".
In 2011, U.S. President Barack Obama classified the Brotherhood Circle syndicate as "significant transnational organized crime groups" and instructed the Treasury Department to "undermine and prohibit their global criminal operations."
The blacklisting of a person by the US Treasury entails the blocking of his assets in the United States and a ban on business contacts with him of persons living in the States.
Scientists have shed light on how the movements of a dog's tail are related to its mood.
Earlier studies have shown that satisfied dogs wag their tail to the right side (from the dog's point of view), while anxious dogs wave their tail predominantly to the left.
But now scientists say that other members of the canine family can notice these subtle differences in tail wagging and respond to them.
Professor Giorgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at Trent University, says: "It is well known that in humans the left and right sides of the brain are involved differently in the formation of motivators that cause positive or negative emotions."
Here we tried to look at this in other species as well.
He added that just like in humans, in dogs, the right side of the brain controls the left side of the body and vice versa, and the two hemispheres play different roles in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs respond to the versatile wagging of other dogs' tails, the researchers observed the animals as they watched movies about other dogs.
They measured the animals' heart rate and analyzed their behavior.
We will probably soon understand why their tails sometimes point in one direction and sometimes in the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: "We showed the dogs videos of the dogs – either naturalistic versions or a silhouette – to get rid of any other distorting factors – and we could manipulate the movement of the tail and direct the tail more to the left or right. "
When the animals saw that the otherwise expressionless dog was moving its tail to the right (from the point of view of the wagging tail of the dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But when they noticed that the tail was leaning predominantly to the left (again from the point of view of the dog wagging its tail), their heartbeat quickened and they looked anxious.
Professor Vallortigara said he didn't think the dogs intentionally communicated with each other through these movements.
In fact, he believes that dogs have learned from their experiences which movements they should worry about and which they should not.
He observes, "If there are multiple encounters with other dogs and often the wagging of their tail in one direction is associated with more friendly behavior, and the right side gives less friendly behavior, then the dog reacts based on this experience."
The researchers say these findings could give owners, veterinarians and trainers a deeper understanding of their animal's emotions.
Dog behaviour expert John Bradshaw, a visiting research fellow at the University of Bristol's Veterinary School, said this was not the first study to test whether the left and right sides matter to dogs.
Last year, a team of scientists from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their heads to the left when looking at an aggressive dog, and to the right if they look at a satisfied dog.
And in another study at the University of Victoria in Canada, he reported: "Dogs were more likely to approach a robot dog when the wagging of its tail was directed to the left, rather than to the right, instead of becoming alarmed – the opposite behavior to the Italian study."
He said the differences could be due to the fact that dogs in various studies did not fully perceive animals in movies or robot dogs as dogs.
It could be useful to study how dogs react to real dogs, he explained.
"While there is ample evidence for different mammals that the two hemispheres of the brain are used for different purposes, many details have yet to be clarified, and dogs are no exception," he said.
However, given the ease with which their behavior can be recorded, it is likely that we will soon understand why their tails sometimes point in one direction and sometimes in the other.
Are Europe's elite ready to do business with England?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with a commitment to bring together business representatives and determine what changes the creators of wealth and jobs in the UK want to see in relations with the EU.
To this end, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of British business leaders, asking them to express their thoughts on the UK, business and the EU.
YouGov surveyed more than 1,000 business leaders representing a broad cross-section of uk businesses by size, sector and region.
The findings of the survey will come as a surprise to many.
We found that the vast majority of businesses are now looking for export opportunities outside of Europe, with a particular focus on countries that are modernizing and growing while EU countries are stagnant.
They want the government to prioritize new trade ties with countries like China, India and Brazil, rather than wasting time on the long and arduous process of reforming the EU's intricate institutions.
When asked about their views on specific policy issues, from antitrust to product laws, most business leaders believed that control of these key areas of competence should be returned to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the single market, with business representatives saying that the costs of regulation from Brussels now outweigh the benefits of being in Europe's trading zone, even 40 percent of large enterprises, traditionally the most pro-European of all companies, agreed.
Last and most revealing, our survey of business leaders found that a clear majority want the UK to pursue a policy of amending the treaty and a relationship with the EU based on trade rather than politics.
This result, which has been seen among businesses of all sizes and the largest business groups, shows that businesses are pushing for a "meaningful change" that will bring powers back to the UK.
The stakes are high – achieving changes to the treaty and better terms for the UK would ensure a 16 per cent shift in the vote to remain in the EU.
The prime minister should have no doubt: this poll shows that British business supports his plan to renegotiate the terms of britain's membership in the EU.
It also shows that business expects the revision to lead to a significant shift in the current balance of power back towards the UK.
Better conditions for British business are possible and are becoming increasingly necessary as the eurozone embarks on a path of closer economic and financial unification.
Priority must be given to jobs and economic growth in the UK, and as our survey shows, for businesses this means an increased focus on trade and fundamental changes in Brussels' regulatory activities.
Politician in Turkey declares hunger strike against wall on border with Syria
In mid-October, authorities began construction of a separation wall near the city of Nusaybin in southeastern Turkey.
Local residents and representatives of the pro-Kurdish PMD party strongly opposed the construction.
The mayor of the Turkish city of Nusaybin, located on the border with Syria, Ayşe Gökhan, went on a hunger strike protesting against the construction of a separation wall on the Turkish-Syrian border, the press service of the Peace and Democracy Party (PMD) told RIA Novosti on Friday.
Police repeatedly dispersed protest demonstrations.
Turkish Foreign Minister Muammer Guler first denied the fact of construction, then said that the wall is being built to ensure border security.
"The mayor of Nusaybin, Aishe Gökhan, a member of the PMD, went on a hunger strike, thus turning her protest against the construction of the wall into a deadly struggle," the party's press service said.
The mayor of the city believes that the construction of the wall is designed to isolate the Kurdish population of the two countries from each other, the Kurds crossed this border freely for half a century.
"This is an inhumane situation that the Kurds will never accept," Ayşe Gökhan was quoted as saying by the party.
According to the press service, on November 7 in Nusaybin it is planned to hold a rally against the construction of the separation wall.
This morning in the Sarat district, the driver of the Peugeot car drove into the oncoming lane at 115 km of the Odessa-Reni highway, and collided with a bus in which there were six people.
This was reported by the press service of the State Emergency Service in the Odessa region.
As a result of the accident, the 31-year-old driver of the Peugeot car died.
A 55-year-old passenger and a 44-year-old bus driver were injured, who had his leg pinched.
Doctors provided the woman with first aid on the spot, she refused to be hospitalized.
Also, ambulance staff examined all other passengers.
Rescuers with the help of a crane picked up the bus and freed the bus driver, whose leg was clamped in the door of the bus.
In Siberia, you should not be a vegan: greenhouse tomato will not replace soup
Why vegetarianism is not suitable for life in Siberia, found out the correspondent of RIA Novosti.
People who have completely abandoned animal products should not live in Siberia.
Here they can not endure the winter without losses to health, and no greenhouse tomatoes compensate them, according to Novosibirsk nutritionists and doctors interviewed on the eve of Vegan Day.
Drink oil in liters
Strict vegetarianism, when they refuse not only meat and fish, but also milk, honey, eggs, becomes a fashionable way of life.
However, nutritionists are sure that in Novosibirsk and other cities of Siberia to adhere to such strict standards in nutrition, at least, is not useful for health.
Complete rejection of animal products is harmful.
Animal proteins contain essential amino acids, which are very difficult to compensate for with vegetable ones.
It is necessary to include at least milk or eggs in the diet, "says nutritionist Marina Bogai.
She cites the example of fish containing the essential fatty acid Omega-3.
The richest vegetable oil is linseed oil.
"To consume it in the quantities necessary for a person, you need to drink liters!" says a nutritionist.
Doctors are sure that the inhabitants of Siberia should pay special attention to the diet in winter.
This season, vegetarianism is especially questioned.
In the conditions of our realities, high demands are placed on food.
In order not to freeze, you need an increased calorie content.
"If a person limits himself to animal products, respectively, he does not get enough of this caloric content," the specialist says.
Nutritionist Olga Poznyak agrees with this.
She adds that imported vegetables and fruits are not an option.
It is better for a person to eat mainly products that are grown in the region of residence or where he was born.
The genetic code is set to better absorb and digest these foods.
And in winter, people do not want to nibble on a cucumber, but a hot soup or something more satisfying, "the doctor explains his position.
According to her, of what vegans can eat, various cereals, cereals, legumes, local vegetables, apples remaining in the winter, frozen berries are really useful.
But this, of course, is not enough for proper nutrition.
According to gastroenterologist Claudia Arifulina, Siberians have a sufficient level of vitamins in their bodies only from mid-August to mid-September.
A complete transition to vegetarianism in our harsh natural conditions, when the temperature can change by 30 degrees per day and snow lies in May, is impractical.
The body needs energy for life, and this is, first of all, fat, "the doctor states.
Doctors note that veganism is especially harmful to children and pregnant women.
Children grow up, they need building material, including in the form of amino acids.
And adhering to vegetarianism, we give them inferior.
Pregnant women also need a high content of protein, vitamins and trace elements in the menu.
"Vegans don't get enough of them," Bogai said.
Arifulina says that an adult is free to choose whatever he wants, "to play with the toys he wants."
He already has a formed body, skeleton, organs.
And children still need to eat fully.
If parents deprive him of some trace elements or amino acids, choosing for him what he will eat, this is simply a violation of the rights of the child.
"The lack of certain substances for the development of the brain, vision, bones will not be restored tomorrow," she says.
All surveyed medical specialists agree on the low quality of vegetables and fruits grown in winter in greenhouses.
What is brought to us and grown in greenhouses contains a smaller amount of the trace elements we need than (grown) in the open ground.
"The quality of the products is not the same," says Bogai.
Arifulina also notes that imported and greenhouse vegetables and fruits are far from ideal standards.
Sometimes the desire of producers to harvest a larger crop is detrimental to quality.
"Apples do not turn brown on the cut, cucumbers quickly turn yellow and moldy, tomatoes are tasteless and unflavored," the doctor gives examples, adding that they are most likely stuffed with excessive amounts of fertilizer.
And they become suppliers not of vitamins, but of fiber.
The head of the laboratory of the Siberian Institute of Physical and Technical Problems, Candidate of Agricultural Sciences Vera Petruk does not agree with this.
She says that with the right approach and compliance with all norms and requirements in greenhouses, it is possible to grow full-fledged vegetables.
If they try to drive more from a square meter, then, of course, they will water more often, and overfeed the plants with mineral fertilizers.
For example, when there are too many nitrogen fertilizers, tomatoes grow quickly, they are large, but watery and unsweetened," she explains, adding that the issue of quality, first of all, depends on the conscience of the manufacturer.
Russia beyond the fight for pollution of cities by cars
Attempts to solve the transport problems of large cities have been observed in most megacities of the world since the second half of the twentieth century.
As a rule, it was either about their reconstruction and expansion of highways, or about attempts to reduce the demand for car trips, the number of cars and the time of their use.
The example of Singapore is widely known, where strict quotas for the growth of the number of private cars have been introduced, and the right to purchase them is bought at auctions.
Its price can be two to three times higher than the price of the car itself.
European cities, including London, have introduced a fee for entering the city center.
In Germany, for example, in Hamburg and Stuttgart, so-called green zones are being introduced, where only cars with a certain eco-class that also use high-quality fuels (including biofuels or electric cars) are allowed to enter.
Beijing's Environmental Protection Agency, for example, approved in 2012 a "five-year clean air plan" worth about 250 billion yuan (about $40 billion).
As Li Kunsheng, director of the transport pollution control department of the municipal environmental protection bureau of Beijing, told Kommersant, the main goal of the five-year plan is to reduce the leading air pollutants by 20-35% by 2017, increase the number of private cars to a level not exceeding 6 million (now 5.2 million), as well as increase fuel use per vehicle by no more than 5%.
According to the agency, now motor transport in Beijing is responsible for 22.5% of total air pollution.
Among the main measures of the program are the restriction of the use of road transport, as well as the introduction of additional taxes for car owners.
Among other things, urban measures of the "green five-year plan" include an accelerated transition to European fuel standards compared to the rest of the country, the introduction of a local system of eco-standards and labeling of cars and fuel, restrictions on the entry of cars into the central part of the city, a ban on the use of obsolete vehicles (in addition, the creation of incentive financial programs for the replacement of old cars with hybrid or electric vehicles), the development of electric transport (including  public and service), the development of public transport (including high-speed).
Beijing's automotive innovations also include a ban on all private cars from driving within the fifth ring road (there are six of them in the Capital of the People's Republic of China) one day a week (the relevant information is contained in the license plate of the vehicle), as well as the issuance of registration plates for cars based on the lottery (for example, in 2011, the first year of the lottery, the total number of permits for registration of private cars in Beijing was only a third of the number of  2010).
According to the current state program "Environmental Protection for 2012-2020", the number of cities with high and very high air pollution should be reduced to 128 (in 2012 there were 138).
According to the Ministry of Natural Resources, in 2011, "mobile sources" accounted for 41% of all pollutant emissions into the atmosphere of cities.
In Moscow, for example, emissions from cars are ten times higher than industrial, and in St. Petersburg - nine times.
In the Russian Federation, they are only beginning to think about the possibilities of restrictive regulation of cars on the streets of cities.
Mikhail Blinkin, Director of the HSE Institute of Transport Economics and Transport Policy, believes that administrative and fiscal measures aimed at suppressing the demand for road trips are obviously unpopular, they can be adopted by society only if they are completely universal.
In the case of Moscow, a unique problem arises related to the structure of its fleet, where there are two clusters of weakly sensitive to any regulatory influences - official and personal cars, as well as cars of "privileged" users, the total number of which is at least 200 thousand (about 5% of the total number of the Moscow fleet).
Recently, urbanists from the ECOM center in St. Petersburg prepared a study that analyzes the balance of urban areas between residential development, the area of the road surface and the number of vehicles.
The main conclusions of the researchers: the city center is provided with roads two times less than required, and most motorists living in the center do not use cars every day, leaving them for a long time in parking lots or just on the streets.
As a result, it is proposed to build not parking lots, but car storage, not to expand, but to reduce the roadway (so that the streets become more pedestrian-friendly), as well as to limit the use and placement of personal vehicles within the boundaries of the territory of the protection zone of the historical center (a total area of about 3212 hectares covering a number of central districts of the city).
A tax maneuver will lead to a rise in the price of fuel, which provides for an increase in the mineral extraction tax (MET) on oil simultaneously with a reduction in export duties and an increase in excise taxes.
According to experts, these measures can bring an additional 619.3 billion rubles to the budget.
Drive through mud, rivers and jungles for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical care in rural Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend seeing hundreds of patients.
In this West African country, there are not so many doctors – only one in 5,000 people.
Vote here or via your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwellet is one of cnn's 10 main characters in 2013.
You can vote for him or any of the other 10 main characters to make him CNN Hero of the Year.
This man will receive $250,000 to continue his outstanding work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his father come back to life and again fall into unconsciousness, wandering around hospitals that were not properly equipped to help him.
Djamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he only had a broken arm, but the resulting infection spread to the brain and caused a hematoma that reminded of itself for the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," Georges Bwelle said.
If we had the money, we would have taken him out of Cameroon.
Instead, Bwelle accompanied his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals for years, receiving any treatment they could receive.
"It's not easy," Bwelle said.
You can leave the house at 5 a.m., run to the hospital to be the first, but you're not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
Some may die because they have to wait.
The situation hasn't changed much since Bwelle's father passed away in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, Cameroon has only one doctor per 5,000 people.
By comparison, the ratio in the United States is one doctor per 413 people.
And even if Cameroonians could see a doctor, many of them would not be able to afford it.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of its health spending is private.
"Their only problem is poverty," Bwelle said.
"And because of poverty, they can't enjoy their lives."
Seeing the suffering of his father and so many of his compatriots, Bwelle was determined to do something about it.
Last year, Dr. Georges Bwellet and his team of volunteers performed 700 free surgeries.
He himself became a doctor and works as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital of Yaoundé.
He also founded the non-profit organization ASCOVIME, which organizes trips to the countryside on weekends to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have assisted nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 other people are crammed into vans, tied to rooftops with medical supplies and drive across rough terrain to visit villages in need of help.
They are not always accompanied by luck.
More than once they had to push cars through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they are greeted like true heroes: it's a celebration with songs and dances and the best facilities the locals can offer.
The free medical care in these villages is indeed a cause for celebration, and Bwelle, with his big smile and boundless energy, is more than happy to join in the fun.
The next morning, the team begins to receive hundreds of patients.
"We take 500 people on every trip," Bwelle said.
They come from all over the neighborhood within a 60 kilometer radius of the village, and they come on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics provides a variety of medical services.
Many people receive treatment for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may receive crutches, donated glasses, or free birth certificates — documents needed for school that many poor families simply can't afford.
In the evenings, the team performs simple operations under local anesthesia.
Operations are usually carried out in the school building, municipality or in the house; After the procedure, patients get up and go to the recovery area to make room for the next person.
Using a generator to illuminate the operating room and sanitize the equipment, Bwelle and his volunteers work until early Sunday morning.
It's an unsustainable pace, but the dedication of the brigade is usually helped by the village musicians.
"They beat drums all night to keep us awake and keep working," Bwelle said.
On Sunday, the crew members head back to town, tired but proud of their work.
This group, made up of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students, has performed 700 free surgeries over the past year, and they know that their help can make a huge difference to those they help.
One person explained that the free hernia surgery he received would allow him to work again.
"It will change the future for me and my family," the man said.
In addition to these clinical appointments on weekends and working in the hospital as a surgeon, Bwelle also works nights in private medical clinics around Yaoundé.
It is this second job, he said, that provides 60% of his nonprofit funding; the remaining funds are covered by private donations.
"I don't even know when he sleeps," said Katie O'Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia who volunteered in Bwelle's group.
He's always either in the hospital or trying to make money for the organization so that these campaigns can continue.
For future doctors and nurses like O'Malley coming from the U.S. and Europe to join Bwell in carrying out his tasks, it's an opportunity to practice that they would never get at home.
"We were able to assist in surgeries where we helped remove blood stains or hold instruments for Dr. Bwelle," O'Malley said.
As a sophomore, you would never have gotten that opportunity in America.
Student volunteers usually pay for their own travel to Cameroon, often arriving with donated medicines.
But upon arrival in Yaoundé, their food, transport and tuition pays for Bwelle.
"He's a hero, no doubt," O'Malley said.
He gives his life to this organization, and his desire to help the people of Cameroon is endless.
For Bwelle, the almost constant workload is not an ordeal.
To help others live a happy life, to fulfill the promise made to his father - this is what brings him great joy.
"I'm so happy when I do this work," Bwelle said.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I do this to make people laugh, to reduce their pain.
Go to the ASCOVIME website and see how you can help.
For the "Russian mafia" in the United States, a new name was finally fixed - "Brotherly Circle"
This week, the blacklist of the "Russian mafia" in America was replenished with new names and four companies.
The US Treasury Department has introduced three representatives of Russia, two citizens of Uzbekistan and an Israeli to the "Brotherhood Circle".
One of the Russians was the famous singer Grigory Leps, whom the United States suspects of transporting money for members of the group.
In total, the US blacklist includes 22 people involved in the "Brotherhood Circle", and six affiliated organizations.
Nevertheless, many experts express doubts that such an organization really exists.
"The statement about the 'Brotherly Circle' is more like an attempt to unite disparate criminal groups," organized crime expert and New York University professor Mark Galeotti said earlier.
In his opinion, the "Brotherhood Circle" reflects the popular perception of the "Russian mafia".
"I have not met anyone in The Russian law enforcement agencies or anywhere else who would confirm the existence of such a criminal organization," Mr. Galeotti was quoted as saying by the American Center for the Study of Corruption and Organized Crime.
George Mason University professor Liz Shelley agrees with Mr. Galeotti.
"If they act together, it is more like a criminal network, but not an organization," the Center for the Study of Corruption and Organized Crime quoted her as saying.
In the middle of last year, Mark Galeotti suggested that the "Brotherly Circle" unites to a greater extent close associates of the Russian thief in law Aslan Usoyan, known as Ded Hasan.
The crime boss was killed in January of this year.
Thus, the activities of Lasha Shushanashvili and Zakhary Kalashov, who joined the list in 2012, were closely related to Ded Khasan, and another member of the list, Temuri Mirzoyev, was Grandfather Hasan's nephew.
Nevertheless, Mr. Galeotti notes that some personalities are not related to Usoyan.
In his opinion, all of them were united rather by common financial and criminal interests, for example, the supply of drugs from Afghanistan.
Meanwhile, the scandal surrounding the inclusion of Grigory Leps, Russian President Vladimir Putin's favorite singer, in the Brotherhood Circle has caught the Kremlin's attention.
Naturally, we expect that we will receive more detailed information from our American colleagues-partners, in connection with which such a decision was made why it was added to such lists," said Dmitry Peskov, press secretary of the head of state.
In any case, he (Leps) is a citizen of the Russian Federation.
Just like the interests of all citizens of the Russian Federation, his interests will be protected.
Tony Blair said he would take the chance to return as Britain's prime minister, but acknowledged a return was unlikely.
The night before, in an interview marking the fifth anniversary of his retirement, the 59-year-old outlined his views on various aspects of domestic politics.
Since resigning in June 2007, after a decade as leader, Blair has largely avoided discussing British politics, limiting most of his comments to foreign affairs and his role as ambassador to the Quartet of Middle Eastern peacekeepers.
Asked if he would return to the post of prime minister, Blair, according to the London Evening Standard, said: "Yes, of course, but it is unlikely to happen, so ..."
Milan head coach Massimiliano Allegri expressed regret over the draw in the match of the 10th round of the Italian championship with Lazio.
The specialist also noted that the failures at the start are due to a series of injuries to leading players.
I am very sorry that we did not manage to win," Tmw quoted Allegri as saying.
The team played a good match, creating 3-4 good opportunities.
In the first half, we didn't allow Anything to Lazio.
In the second, the Romans improved, but overall I can't say that we lost concentration.
We had to win.
Last season we completed the task of getting into the Champions League.
Now we are behind schedule, but this is due to a whole series of injuries to key players.
Rami and Honda?
They are very good players, with character.
However, our squad is still good.
Take a look at Kaka, who held a high-level meeting.
British police hand Assange a notice of extradition
British police today handed over a notice of extradition to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who took refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and asked for asylum.
Scotland Yard said it had handed the 40-year-old Australian a "formal demand to surrender" to appear at the police station, adding that if that requirement was not met, he would continue to be subject to arrest.
Assange faces extradition to Sweden on sexual offence charges after he exhausted his options under British law when the Supreme Court rejected his extradition appeal earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would hand him over to the United States, on June 19 he took refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, asking the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard "handed the 40-year-old a formal demand to surrender, which obliges him to arrive at the police station on the day and time of our choice," the spokesman said.
He continues to violate bail conditions.
The embassy declined to comment on the delivery of the notice to police.
Assange fears he will be extradited from Sweden to the U.S. to face possible espionage charges after publishing more than 250,000 U.S. diplomatic cables on the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks.
Now Roman Senchin is in Paris at the presentation of his novel "Yeltyshevs", translated into French.
Recall that it was his novel that became a finalist of four awards: "Yasnaya Polyana", "Russian Booker", "National Bestseller" and "Big Book".
And last year, the writer for this book was awarded the prize of the Government of the Russian Federation in the field of culture.
Roman Senchin is an undoubted leader in the generation of today's thirty-year-old and forty-year-old prose writers.
Almost every publication of his tough, built on modern life material stories and novels causes heated debates among critics of various directions.
It can be argued that the articles on Senchin's prose and journalism, reviews of his books and journal publications create a curious and unexpected landscape of Russian literature from the late 1990s to the early 2010s.
In discussions about the works of "one of the most controversial contemporary writers", according to critic Sergei Chuprinin, we are mostly talking about what its participants understand by the word "literature", as they see the present and future not only of our literature, but also of life.
Unfortunately, the volume of the book did not allow to include in it most of the articles and reviews from the regional media and the blogosphere.
Analytical and review articles are given, as a rule, in abbreviation in the sections "Paragraphs ..."
Snowden may be interrogated in Russia
Former us intelligence officer Edward Snowden, most likely, will not travel outside russia to testify in cases of wiretapping of telephone conversations of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
As a source familiar with the situation told Interfax on Friday, the American can answer questions from representatives of the German Prosecutor General's Office in writing or in person in Russia.
Edward Snowden's departure from Russia is practically excluded.
"In this case, he will lose his refugee status and can be extradited to Washington by countries - allies of the United States," the agency's interlocutor said.
"At the same time, in principle, the German Prosecutor General's Office could send its representatives to the Russian Federation or transfer written questions to Snowden," the source added, adding that this issue should be worked out at the interstate level.
Earlier, a deputy of the German Bundestag Hans-Christian Strebele said that Edward Snowden is ready to testify in the case of wiretapping by American special services of the negotiations of the German Chancellor.
Snowden is ready to testify to German law enforcement agencies either in Moscow or in Germany.
The ex-employee of the CIA made it clear that he knows a lot.
Despite the fact that the US NSA has blocked all his movements, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
However, for this it is necessary to clearly define all the conditions for his arrival," Strebele told Euronews.
Snowden's lawyer Anatoly Kucherena, commenting on the statement of the Interfax source, said that his client can cooperate with German investigators, but when and how he will decide for himself.
U.S. citizen Edward Snowden, who worked for the US National Security Agency (NSA) and the CIA, fled to Hong Kong in May 2013, after which he published information about secret operations of US intelligence agencies on surveillance on the Internet.
Snowden flew through Moscow in transit, but could not leave the airport due to the fact that his passport was canceled by the US authorities, who in absentia presented him with serious charges, and until the beginning of August remained in the transit zone of Sheremetyevo Airport.
On the first of August, Snowden received a document granting him temporary asylum in Russia for a period of one year and left Sheremetyevo on the same day.
Yesterday, the lawyer of the American Anatoly Kucherena said that his client got a job in a "large Russian company."
The NSA's surveillance of Angela Merkel was reported by German media last week.
According to journalists, americans began to listen to the chancellor's telephone conversations in 2002.
The tracking station was allegedly located in the US Embassy in Berlin.
The German authorities after the publication of this information said that the surveillance of Merkel violates the laws and sovereignty of Germany.
Land Rover Racing Series Announced
Inside are racing seats and six-point seat belts, as well as an intercom system.
Additionally, you can get upgraded brakes, a package of services that provides access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistics support and storage of the car between events.
Drew Bowler, managing director of Bowler Motorsport, said: "Rally participants turning to Bowler have changed. "
Some of them are not experienced racers, but people looking for excitement, adventure and access to world-class events.
We are pleased to offer such a path in partnership with Land Rover and MSA and believe that this format offers a new way to try out different disciplines of rallying in the UK and abroad, as well as to prepare participants for the difficult conditions and realities of the rally raid.
It was with great pleasure that we developed the Defender Challenge car – it will be a really exciting championship.
In addition, the Defender Challenge provides one day in February for training and testing, as well as the opportunity to take part in desert activities in North Africa and the Middle East.
Children should learn myths and legends as "lifestyle models," the author says.
Tales of the Thor could show that "brute force cannot defeat sophisticated cunning," and the legends of King Arthur show how important it is to have a dream.
Saying that many myths will prove to be "too wild, too scandalous and in some cases too obscene for teaching in schools," Crossley-Holland advocates "careful selection" of age-appropriate texts.
"I think it's wonderful that in America, myth and folklore are already part of education," he said.
I've been advocating for putting them in the curriculum for twenty years.
He added that the "excessive moralizing" of authors and teachers "discourages interest" from children, and the main ideas are "sublimated" into fascinating stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and also wrote a Collection of Norwegian Myths for Penguin and British Folk Tales, said: "You may certainly have intentions, but you'd better keep them to yourself."
Perhaps the big difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need to feel some kind of hope.
Not that everything should be simplified or lead to a happy ending, but it is necessary that there be an innate understanding of good and evil.
And it has to be sublimated; revealed through history, not clearly articulated.
The old principle is to show, not tell.
Goldman Sachs warned of risks for the Russian economy
Goldman Sachs has warned of growing risks to the main driver of Russia's fragile economic growth: consumption.
First of all, this is the crisis of non-payments on unsecured consumer loans and mass layoffs of workers.
Our main concern now is not that growth has slowed, but rather the structure of that growth.
Recently, it is completely due to consumption, which almost does not slow down, "said Clemens Grafe, chief economist at Goldman Sachs for Russia, presenting yesterday the quarterly report of the investment bank on the Russian economy.
Now the nominal growth of wages in Russia is about 10%.
With inflation of 6%, it will be able to provide future consumer demand at about the current level, Goldman Sachs expects.
But the profitability of Russian companies is falling, therefore, most likely, they will be engaged in optimizing personnel costs.
Today we see a significant increase in the share of wages in GDP: if wages grow by 10%, then GDP - only by 2%, - explained Mr. Grafe.
Companies faced a reduction in profitability.
If it does not grow, it can lead to layoffs and an increase in unemployment.
Russian business cannot not raise salaries, comments Vladimir Pantyushin, chief economist at Barclays Capital for Russia and the CIS.
Unemployment is near historic lows, competition for workers is high.
To lure employees from the outside or keep the current ones, employers have to raise salaries.
Consumption in Russia is also supported by a very rapid growth in consumer lending.
According to Mr. Grafe, due to extremely high rates on consumer loans, this type of lending does not have a multiplicative effect on the country's economy.
"We did not see any benefit for the economy from the growth of consumer lending, the money does not disperse throughout the economy, but returns to the same banks in the form of interest payments," the economist said.
But the problem is different - Goldman Sachs expects an increase in delinquencies on unsecured loans.
They are taken mainly by poor people who have nothing to provide as collateral.
Interest on such loans is high.
As a result, they are more often not returned," said Mr. Grafe.
Therefore, the second threat to economic growth in Russia is a possible crisis of non-payments on unsecured loans.
Vasily Solodkov, Director of the HSE Banking Institute, is already seeing signs of a brewing banking crisis.
Small credit organizations, not having access to cheap resources, which state-owned banks have, were forced to attract funds from the population at high interest rates.
In response, state-owned banks went on the warpath and began to reduce loan rates, the economist continues.
Small credit institutions cannot issue loans at the same interest rates, otherwise they will have a negative interest margin.
If state-owned banks do not abandon dumping, Russia faces a full-fledged banking crisis, Vasily Solodkov believes.
The economist considers the deprivation of licenses of a number of banks in recent weeks a harbinger of a massive collapse.
"State-owned banks themselves will not cope with this situation: the deposit insurance system was not originally designed for a systemic crisis," the head of the institute warns.
But the growth of consumption will slow down even without a crisis of non-payments, the investment bank believes, due to the refusal to index the salaries of civil servants and the military, laid down in the current version of the draft budget.
Part of the blow to consumption will be mitigated by freezing the tariffs of natural monopolies (and, as a consequence, lower inflation).
But only partially: if investments do not grow (and there are no prerequisites for this yet - see the reference), consumption growth will still slow down, Goldman Sachs is sure.
Vladimir Pantyushin of Barclays Capital does not yet see the prerequisites for the implementation of pessimistic scenarios.
"The main risk is still the fall in the price of oil," he says.
According to him, the Russian economy will begin to decline with the cost of oil below $ 90 per barrel.
Goldman Sachs also noted that the Central Bank is not yet able to reduce interest rates in the economy.
There is a paradoxical picture: inflation has decreased, and banks have begun to raise rates.
This may mean that they did not believe the Central Bank, which announced the transition to inflation targeting," said Clemens Grafe.
The interest rate policy of the Central Bank does not affect market rates, it affects only interbank lending rates.
"For the Central Bank, this is the collapse of all hopes," Clemens Grafe said.
The money received at the auctions of the Central Bank, banks use not to lend to the economy, but to manage their liquidity
As soon as the rate is reduced, the exchange rate immediately changes, which means that the funds are trying to go to speculation against the ruble.
"Sooner or later, the Central Bank will understand that this strategy does not work," said Mr. Grafe and recalled that the state plans to let the ruble float "freely" by the end of 2015.
But it will be necessary either to do this earlier, or to raise the key rate of the Central Bank (5.5%), he said.
According to him, the ruble exchange rate is now artificially inflated by 10%.
The ruble has only one way - to weaken, - the expert concludes.
But if the Central Bank casts even a shadow of doubt in financiers that the elimination of the currency corridor is not part of the policy to weaken the ruble, it can bring down the ruble much more.
Snowden agrees to testify about Trump's wiretapping
Bundestag deputy Hans-Christian Strebele met with Edward Snowden.
During the conversation, the question was discussed whether Snowden could be questioned as a witness by the Prosecutor General's Office of Germany in the case of a possible wiretapping of the phone of the German Chancellor by US special services.
Snowden expressed his willingness to give the necessary testimony.
The meeting could take place either in Moscow or in Germany.
He made it clear," said Hans-Christian Strebele, "that he knows a lot.
And despite the fact that the National Security Agency, led by Keith Alexander, blocked all his movements, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
However, first it is necessary to clearly define all the conditions of his arrival. .
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers are beginning to take action in response to the U.S. spyware scandal.
The Senate Intelligence Committee yesterday approved a bill imposing additional restrictions on the activities of the US electronic intelligence agency.
FAA: "Air passengers can now use gadgets on airplanes (but not call from a mobile phone)"
Air passengers will be able to use their electronic devices throughout the flight to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music, but not talk on mobile phones, according to long-awaited new guidelines released Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.
But passengers shouldn't expect the changes to happen immediately.
How quickly such a change is implemented will vary depending on the airline, FAA administrator Michael Wortha said at a news conference.
Airlines will have to show the FAA how their aircraft meet the new guidelines and that they are updating their flight crew training manuals and stowage rules to comply with the new guidelines.
The FAA said it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices on aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue were among the airlines that had already submitted plans.
"Depending on the state of the plan, we could approve the expansion of the use of electronic devices very soon," the FAA said.
Currently, passengers are required to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the plane door closes.
They shouldn't restart them until the plane has reached an altitude of 10,000 feet and the captain has given the go-ahead.
Passengers must turn off their devices again when the plane descends for landing, and do not turn them on until the plane is on the ground.
Under the new guidelines, airlines whose planes are adequately protected from electronic interference could allow passengers to use these devices during takeoff, landing and taxiing, the FAA said.
Most new airliners and other aircraft modified so that passengers can use Wi-Fi at high altitudes are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, welcomed the changes.
"Once the new policy is safely implemented (and we are going to work closely with the carrier to achieve this), it will be a win-win," Glading said.
We are frankly tired of feeling "on duty at school" when it comes to this issue.
But internet connections for surfing, exchanging emails, texting or downloading data would still be banned at less than 10,000 feet, the agency said.
Passengers will be asked to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices to airplane mode.
Thus, there is still no "Words with Friends" – an intelligent Internet game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011, when a sensational incident occurred: the actor was removed from an American Airlines plane for refusing to turn off the device while the plane was at the landing gate.
And heavier devices, such as laptops, will still need to be stowed in the luggage compartment, as they can injure someone if they fly throughout the cabin.
Calls from a mobile phone in flight will also continue to be prohibited.
Regulatory authority over phone calls is vested in the Federal Communications Commission, not the FAA.
FAA may lift ban on certain electronic devices during takeoff and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, a national transportation safety expert at CBS News, said cell phones are still considered a risk.
"Cell phones are really a problem, not just because they could potentially interfere with navigation devices, but we know from the FCC that they can interfere with cell towers when an airplane is in the air," Rosenker said.
An industry advisory committee set up by the FAA to look into the issue recommended last month that the government allow greater use of personal electronic devices.
Pressure has been mounting on the FAA in recent years to ease restrictions on their use.
Critics, such as Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri, argue that there are no good security reasons for the bans.
Compliance with restrictions is also becoming increasingly difficult to enforce as the use of devices has become ubiquitous.
Some studies show that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore instructions to turn off their devices.
The FAA began restricting passengers' use of electronic devices in 1966 in response to reports of interference with navigation and communication equipment when passengers began carrying FM radios, the high-tech gadgets of the time.
New airliners are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also being developed and approved by the FAA as resistant to electronic interference.
Airlines have been offering passengers the use of Wi-Fi at cruising altitude for several years.
Aircraft modified for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of liners are geared toward the wider use of electronic devices under the new guidelines, Huerta said.
Today's electronic devices typically emit radio signals of much lower power than previous generations of devices.
E-book readers, for example, emit only minimal signals when turning pages.
But signals become more powerful when devices load or send data.
Among those who sought to ease restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers was the company Amazon.com.
In 2011, the company loaded an entire airliner with its Kindle e-book readers and flew it to check for problems, but never found them.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about whether the use of the devices poses any risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Air Passengers said he believes interference from devices is real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other committee members said there are only isolated pilot reports confirming that the devices can interfere with aircraft systems, and most of those reports are very old.
However, the committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to require passengers to turn off devices during instrument landings in reduced visibility.
A group of representatives of the tourism industry welcomed these changes, calling them a sensible step towards passengers, who now use a variety of technological devices.
"We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that passenger comfort is not incompatible with safety and security," said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Vilnius suspects Moscow of trying to slander the Lithuanian president
Russia intends to carry out information provocations against high-ranking officials of Lithuania and the Eastern Partnership countries - such a statement was made to the BNS agency in the State Security Department of the Republic (DSB).
Information about this is published on the PORTAL DELFI.
According to the report, in particular, Moscow is going to "convict" Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite and publish falsified documents allegedly found in the Russian State Archives, which relate to facts from the biography of the Lithuanian leader.
According to the special service, the preparation of the information attack is carried out by the Department for the Analysis of Social Processes of the Administration of the President of Russia for Interregional and Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries.
The structure is headed by Yevgeny Umerenkov, who has repeatedly visited Lithuania and took part in the congress of the Lithuanian People's Party.
Also, an employee of the department V. Smirnov is allegedly a participant in the operation.
According to the special service, Smirnov, under the guise of scientific work, regularly visited Lithuania until the end of 2012 and contacted local politicians, political scientists and media representatives.
Now Smirnov is banned from entering the country.
On the eve of the President of Lithuania Grybauskaite said that she knew about the information attack being prepared for her.
In her opinion, the main reason is lithuania's successful presidency of the Council of the European Union and the country's "desire for energy independence."
The Lithuanian leader has repeatedly criticized the actions of the Russian authorities.
So she said that the Kremlin treats Lithuania "not enough respectfully."
In addition, Grybauskaite accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of putting forward "only demands" to Lithuania.
Recall that in September, Rospotrebnadzor suspended the import of Lithuanian "milk" to Russia.
It was reported that the quality of products does not meet sanitary and epidemiological standards.
Then the leader of Lithuania said that if Russia does not lift the ban, the government of the country should prepare an appeal to the WTO.
New anti-nicotine vaccine may deprive the process of smoking pleasure
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could deprive the process of smoking cigarettes of pleasure.
One dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice from nicotine addiction for life.
Further tests are needed before human trials begin, which will take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell College of Medicine in New York said the early results are encouraging.
"We very much hope that this vaccine strategy can finally help the millions of smokers who have tried to quit by trying all the methods available on the market today, but have found that their nicotine addiction is strong enough to overcome it with these modern means," said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that was designed to carry genetic information for the production of anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begin to produce a steady stream of antibodies.
Antibodies track down any nicotine molecules in the blood, neutralizing them before they reach the brain, preventing the smoker from getting a nicotine punch.
In the tests, the vaccinated mice, which were subsequently given nicotine, continued their normal activities.
And mice that weren't given the vaccine were "relaxing," a sign that nicotine was reaching their brains, the researchers said.
These experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
To keep antibody levels high, the injections had to be done so often that they proved expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be much lower because it turns liver cells into antibody factories.
Professor Crystal said that if the future human vaccine were completely safe, it could be given to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, preventing nicotine addiction.
But it is more likely that it will be used by smokers to quit smoking.
"They'll know that if they start smoking again, they won't enjoy it because of the nicotine vaccine, and it could help them kick that habit," he said.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but cautioned that more research was needed.

Frontier Airlines will charge for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge passengers up to $100 for carrying hand luggage on board their flight.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $100 for carry-on luggage and $2 for coffee or soda, though their announcement on Wednesday said passengers would be able to keep the entire can.
The new hand luggage fee applies to bags in the upper luggage compartments, so small bags placed under the seat will remain free.
Frontier said it will charge $25 if the fee is paid in advance, and $100 if travelers pay only when they are at the gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the $100 fee should force passengers to take care of paying in advance.
"We don't want to charge for it," she said.
Airlines began charging for the first and second bags checked in in 2008.
Passengers trying to avoid these fees stuff as much as they can into hand luggage placed in the upper luggage compartments, which is why there is often not enough space in these compartments.
Fees are one way to get passengers to carry less on board.
O'Malley said this new levy isn't really for making money.
The fact is that the most loyal customers of Frontier claim that finding a place in the upper luggage compartments is becoming increasingly difficult.
Passengers who buy tickets on the airline's website will not have to pay.
This means that one passenger in the queue at the frontier flight exit can get the opportunity to carry a bag for free, while the next passenger in the queue can pay $ 100 for the same bag.
O'Malley said the change in procedures on frontier's website and at check-in counters is designed to ensure passengers are aware of the fee before they reach the boarding gate.
Frontier's new hand luggage fee won't start charging until the summer, though a date hasn't been set yet.
Passengers often complain about luggage fees and other fees, but airlines adore them.
They argue that handling luggage costs money, and passengers who need the service have to pay for it.
Many on Wall Street see the addition of baggage fees as a sign that airlines are charging enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
However, most of them did not concern fees for hand luggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. introduced the first hand luggage levy three years ago, and another discounter, Allegiant Air, later followed suit.
The only other airline with such a levy is Hungary's Wizz Air, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors the surcharges.
He estimated in a December 2011 report that the levy on hand luggage brings Spirit $50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines executive, recently flew on a Spirit flight, and he was wondering what he would find at the gate when passengers faced Spirit's unusual hand luggage fee.
"The landing process was the smoothest I've seen in my airline career," he said.
I expected to see gnashing of teeth and a fight at the gate.
The plane was full, he said, "and the landing was swift."
Frontier also follows Spirit for a $2 fee for coffee, tea, soda or juice.
Frontier said passengers who receive soda or juice can keep the entire can and that topping up the coffee will be provided free of charge.
It will continue to distribute water for free.
US Airways briefly tried to charge for drinks in 2008, but abandoned it seven months later, after passengers began complaining and no other major airline followed suit.
Frontier's initiative to charge for hand luggage when passengers do not buy tickets directly from the airline is its latest measure to attract customers to its website.
Airlines pay online ticket sellers such as Orbitz between $10 and $25 for each ticket sold.
This gave all airlines an incentive to encourage passengers to buy tickets directly from them, rather than contacting an online travel agency.
However, Frontier has gone furthest in this area.
In September, it began giving half as many frequent flyer bonus miles to customers who bought tickets through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, she cut the premium number of miles to 25 percent of the trip's miles.
So, a trip of 1,000 miles with Frontier, purchased from an online travel agency, would allow you to get 250 miles.
In addition, passengers can only choose a seat in advance if they buy tickets directly from the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in her hometown of Denver, but its business is shrinking and becoming unprofitable.
Revenue was down 9 percent and flying capabilities were down nearly 13 percent in the first quarter, according to financial results released Wednesday by parent company Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic is trying to improve Frontier's finances through the sale of the airline.
Putin has achieved impunity for his friend Assad
And now - news from across the ocean, namely from Syria, where, as we learned today, Israel struck at Russian-made missiles that were reportedly intended for Hezbollah.
Today, Syria has fulfilled an important condition - to destroy its chemical weapons production by November 1.
This was done as part of a Russian-brokered agreement that allowed the U.S. not to conduct the military operation it came close to this summer.
More information about weapons and what all this means for the Syrian president will be told by our chief international correspondent Richard Engel.
Washington has said the Assad regime will be punished for it.
More than 1400 civilians, including hundreds of children, were killed in August by poison gas.
And the punishment came.
But not in the form of American bombing, but in the form of a deal arranged by Assad's friend Vladimir Putin.
Syria will give up its chemical weapons by the middle of next year.
And today is an important milestone.
A group of international experts reported that Syria has disabled the declared factories for the production of chemical weapons.
The longer-term and more difficult task is the destruction of tons of chemical weapons and their components.
As we understand, this is about a thousand tons.
Washington used to say that Assad's days were numbered.
I think Assad should go.
The question is not whether it will happen, but when it will happen.
He is no longer legitimate and must go.
But Assad remains.
And he feels even more confident.
His troops still use artillery, rockets and napalm.
His opponents are divided and poorly armed.
His people are forced to leave their homes, many starving.
Some have to feed on leaves and cats.
Many believe that Bashar al-Assad escaped punishment for mass murder.
The chemical weapons agreement has been called a diplomatic success, inspectors have been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and Assad himself has given the impression of a man willing to cooperate.
Today in Washington, the US ambassador to Syria had to answer difficult questions.
When a child dies of starvation, his mother is hardly relieved by the fact that he was not killed with chemical weapons.
Assad is holding on for now.
And he changes weapons to power.
Tomich will work 240 hours for an extremist video in the social network
The Leninsky District Court of Tomsk sentenced to 240 hours of compulsory labor a resident of the city who posted an extremist video on the social network, a representative of the press service of the regional court told RIA Novosti on Friday.
According to the court, in March 2013, the man posted a video on his page on a popular social network, which is included in the federal list of extremist materials.
A criminal case was initiated against him under the article of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation "Actions aimed at inciting hatred and enmity, as well as humiliating human dignity committed in public".
"The Leninsky District Court considered this case in a special order and found the man guilty of committing the above crime, sentencing him to 240 hours of compulsory labor," the agency's interlocutor said.
She added that the man fully admitted his guilt.
Parents of intersex children can choose "uncertain gender"
Germany became the first European country to recognize the third sex in children born with external genitalia of an intermediate type.
Newborns will no longer necessarily be assigned male or female sex.
The new law does not require parents to name any gender of such children, allowing parents to indicate gender as "uncertain" or "unidentified" on their birth certificates.
The purpose of the law was to remove pressure from parents who could make hasty decisions about sex-assigning operations for newborns, and to counteract discrimination against intersex people.
One intersex person, according to the BBC, said many years later, "I'm neither a man nor a woman."
I will remain a patchwork created by doctors with bruises and scars.
About one in two thousand children born each year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They have intersexuality, one of about 60 pathological conditions that fall under the diagnosis of "disorders of sexual development" – a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovaries or testes) or unusually developed external genitalia.
Wallis Simpson may have been an intersex.
Gender identity is still not well understood, but most experts in the U.S. say that if gender cannot be determined, it is better to use all available information and appropriate it than to wait and track the psychological and physical development of the child before the operation, if it happens at all.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender identity issues, said the new German law "sounds like a good idea."
Intersex children create an ethical dilemma.
"Some people have life-threatening disorders that require surgery, but most children don't," he said.
You can assign gender without surgery and then see how personality develops.
The science of how a child will develop any gender identity is not very precise.
No one can answer questions about why this is happening.
It's like a mystery about why people are homosexual.
A report sent to the European Commission in 2011 describes intersex people as different from transsexual or transgender people because their condition is not related to gender, but to their biological makeup, which does not correspond exclusively to either male or female sex, but is typical of both at the same time or is not characteristic of either of them.
These characteristics can manifest themselves in secondary sexual characteristics, such as muscle mass, hair distribution, breast and physique; primary sexual characteristics, such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in employment, as well as the level of harassment, cruelty and prejudice crimes.
Boys with gender disabilities now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to put male, female or "third gender" in their official documents.
In June, 52-year-old Australian resident Norrie May-Welby became the world's first person to be recognized as "asexual", defending in court the right to maintain an "uncertain" sexual status for life.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, German passports will use a third designation in addition to M and F - X, that is, intersex.
In neighboring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news release on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of lawmakers from France, a prominently Catholic country, signed a petition to remove "gender theory" from school textbooks.
The American website Catholic Online also expressed disagreement with German law, writing that "in a situation where the world is drawn into a new state, where gender is the subject of choice, and sexual activity is not, we turn over two more pillars of civilization."
One mother of a newborn baby from Maryland also told the Baby Zone website that she would prefer that babies be sex-adjusted at birth.
"Raising a child is hard enough and without additional restrictions, especially if you don't know the sex of your child," she told the parent website.
Children need stability and confidence.
Historically, children born with male and female genitalia were called hermaphrodites , after a beautiful Greek god who possessed features of both sexes.
And just a decade ago, the medical community saw gender as a leaf on which to erase everything and then draw it again.
But now many dispute the ethical grounds for surgery, knowing that gender identity is complex, and doctors sometimes make the wrong choices, not knowing how the child will perceive the sex assigned to him when he grows up.
"In the mid-twentieth century, it was called a 'psychiatric emergency,'" Drescher said.
When these children were born, you didn't call a psychiatrist — you called a surgeon.
The dominant theory on how to treat children with intermediate-type genitalia was proposed by Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who believed that gender is easily changeable.
He coined the term "gender identity" and argued that environmental cues, including social ones — the way parents raise a child — interact with a child's genes and hormones to determine whether a person will consider themselves a man or a woman.
But in one 1966 case known as "John/Joan," his theories were called into question.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been damaged during a careless circumcision to castrate the child completely, removing his testicles as well, and raise him as a girl.
"Mani presented the case as a successful example of the transition, but it wasn't," Drescher said.
When the boy was about 15 years old, he became a boy again and married a woman.
But at the age of 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher said that now some doctors are still "applying this model."
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, people who survived these sex reassignment surgeries declared themselves "dissatisfied with the result."
Such was the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana who was born with male XY chromosomes but intermediate-type genitalia.
Doctors could not determine for sure whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis, and were convinced that he could never live a "full life" of a man.
Therefore, shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce's external penis and testicles were surgically removed and he was raised as a girl.
He was given female hormones at the age of 12.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he was prescribed a vaginoplasty.
But being depressed and realizing that something was wrong, he demanded medical documentation.
What he learned was terrible.
I was sterilized at birth and no one ever told me about it.
Bruce was born with a disorder of sexual development that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone for normal genital development.
After learning the truth, he became a man again, receiving testosterone injections and removing his breasts.
The surgery made him infertile.
Today, he advocates for others in an organization called the Interface Project, trying to normalize the perception of people with intersexism.
But Anne Taemar-Mattis, executive director of the California-based legal association Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that the German law "encourages labeling and stigma."
"Many activists are concerned that German law will encourage parents to make a hasty decision and give the child an 'uncertain gender,'" she said.
We fear that it will facilitate intervention.
We believe that it is better to assign male or female gender and then wait.
But we haven't yet seen how this law manifests itself, so all we can do is speculate.
Taemar-Mattis said her organization supports Australian law because "it allows adults to make a choice in favor of the third sex."
"Adults need to be able to make their own decisions about formal gender," she says.
German law implies its appropriation at birth.
It's a battle that young children shouldn't engage in at this stage.
When they grow up, then they will be able to make decisions about their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a pittsburgh-based mammologist radiologist who has a daughter with a sexually impaired developmental disability and who helps hundreds of other people in the support group, said the German law would "support" both parents and children.
Barats' daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but she has a sexual development disorder called "complete androgen insensitivity syndrome."
Because her androgen receptors don't work properly, Katie has developed female traits.
She has a vagina but no uterus and no ovaries.
Now, at 29, Katie is married and pursuing residency in child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Despite being infertile, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or gestational surrogacy.
"The law gives parents time not to make hasty decisions themselves," Barats said.
He gives them time to do some tests and understand the situation, as well as a period of time before they write "male" or "female".
In this case, you are fine - raise a child, love the child.
You have a wonderful baby and you feel joy.
We don't need to hastily do an operation that is irreversible.
"It allows children to participate in the decision and eliminates the excitement that drives parents because they don't feel like they're doing the right thing," she said.
Eventually, the child will decide which gender he or she is more comfortable with — and that's great.
This gives children the opportunity to make a decision on their own.
US Secretary of State: Intelligence Agencies Sometimes "Went Too Far" in Collecting Data
US Secretary of State John Kerry admitted that when collecting data and wiretaps, US intelligence agencies sometimes "went too far", however, the politician noted that the information that appeared in the media about the wiretapping of 70 million people is not true.
I assure you that innocent people were not harmed during this process, but there was an attempt to collect information.
Yes, in some cases it went too far and was unlawful.
I recognize that, as the president admits... and we will make sure that this does not happen in the future," the secretary of state was quoted as saying by AFP.
Equestrian experts traveling to Cardiff to compete for the Horse of the Year award knew the competition would be very high.
But no one was prepared for the arrival of three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Not even a schoolboy who had just taken his first steps just a few months earlier, this kid with his pet Shetland pony Toffey trotted through three rounds to easily take the top prize, leaving 30 adult rivals far behind.
This inseparable couple – of the same height – received high marks for their appearance, demeanor and style at the annual competition, which is held by the Sunnybenk equestrian centre in the town of Radri near Cardiff.
Coming out on public display against the background of men and women in elegant bowler hats, he slid his cap around and proudly walked around the circle of two-year-old Toffey.
The judges praised Fenton for his over-the-top innate ability to handle horses.
And Toffee received the highest rating for appearance and character.
Fenton was gifted to Toffey for his third birthday last March, and since then he has practiced with a Shetland pony every day.
His 30-year-old mother Donna said: "Fenton and Toffee make a wonderful duo. "
They had many rivals, but these two left with a gold cup and a rose.
It was only his second performance with Toffee and we were all thrilled when he won.
Complete strangers in the arena thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to take a picture with him.
This boy, from the village of Nantiglo, near Ebb Vale in South Wales, is following in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been exhibiting horses for more than 10 years.
Ms Howells said: "The whole audience was amazed and everyone shouted cheers and clapped."
He ran on the sand along the entire length of the arena and, although he looked so tiny, did his job perfectly.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and farms, and he has two chickens that he takes care of.
Judging by the way he started, he'll be in Horse of the Year soon — and I'm sure he'll perform well.
A spokesperson for this annual equestrian show said: "Fenton is only three years old, but he knows how to handle his pony."
Together they are a great team.
The judges praised Fenton and Toffee for their appearance and for the way they presented themselves in the show ring.
They appreciate the coherence of the performance of the pony and the breeder - Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.
I'm sure Fenton was helped by his attractive outfit, he really looked good in his role.
In Altai, a regular bus overturned.
In the Rubtsovsky district of the Altai Territory, a PAZ regular bus overturned.
As a result of the accident, according to updated data, 13 people were injured, the regional department of the Ministry of Emergency Situations reported.
Earlier, law enforcement agencies of the region reported 10 victims.
According to the agency, the accident occurred at about 9 a.m. local time on the Highway Novonikolayevka - Vishnevka, 1 kilometer from Novonikolayevka.
In the bus traveling from Rubtsovsk to Vyshnevka, there were 12 passengers and the driver, all received injuries of varying severity and were hospitalized.
Eleven victims were taken to the City Hospital No. 1 of Rubtsovsk, two people were hospitalized in the CrH of Rubtsovsk.
The court suspended the execution of the decision on the practice of "stop-and-search" in the New York Police Department
On Thursday, the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals suspended the execution of a court order requiring changes to the New York Police Department's stop-and-search program and removed the judge from the case.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit said enforcement of Judge Shira Shandlin's decisions would be suspended pending the outcome of an appeal filed by the city.
In August, a judge ruled that the city violated the constitution in the way it carried out a program of street detentions and interrogations.
The city appealed against its decision and orders for corrective measures, including an order to appoint a comptroller to help the police department change its work practices and related training program.
On Thursday, the Court of Appeal heard arguments by the parties on the motion to suspend the case.
The Appeals Court said the judge should be challenged because she violated the U.S. code of conduct for judges and failed to avoid showing bias, in part because of a series of media interviews and official statements publicly responding to the court's criticism.
The judge ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by unjustifiably addressing blacks and Hispanics on a "stop-and-search" program.
She appointed an external controller to oversee the sweeping changes, which include reforms in policies, training and monitoring, and ordered the launch of a pilot program to test body-mounted video cameras in police stations where most arrests occur.
In August, New York decided to stop the practice of keeping the names and addresses of people whose cases were dismissed after a police check.
A debate on the city's appeal is scheduled to take place after March 14, 2014.
The "stop and search" tactic has been criticized by many civil rights lawyers.
"Stop-search" has been practiced for decades in one form or another, but the number of documented stops increased dramatically under the administration of independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg, reaching an absolute record of 684,330 people in 2011, most of them black and Latino.
In 2004, four people, all members of national minorities, filed a class action lawsuit.
Proponents of the stop-and-search changes at the New York Police Department say the changes will put an end to unfair practices, form a more robust and effective police service and could affect how other police departments implement the practice.
Opponents argue that the changes will reduce the morale of police officers, not the crime rate, lead to unnecessary spending of money and will not solve the more global problem of difficult conditions in the police due to a decrease in the number of officers by several thousand over the past decade.
The judge noted that she does not stop the practice of "stop-and-search", which is consistent with the Constitution, but changes the way the New York police stop people.
Azarov promised Ukrainians a collapse in prices for goods after signing an association with the European Union
Prime Minister of Ukraine Mykola Azarov is convinced that prices in the country will drop significantly after the country signs an association agreement with the European Union.
He stated this in the course of communication with readers of his page on Facebook.
I can definitely say that prices are determined by a large number of factors, among which there are, among other things, customs payments.
So, after the signing of the agreement and the entry into force of the provision on the Free Trade Zone, the level of customs duties on imports of goods from the EU will be significantly reduced.
And this will mean that prices should also decrease.
"This applies to goods that come from EU countries," Azarov wrote.
As for other goods, the impact of the agreement on prices will not be so direct, it will be indirect.
But, nevertheless, there should also be no price increases.
Therefore, the messages on billboards, which have recently appeared quite a lot in our country, that the association with the EU is an increase in prices, this is not entirely true, or to be more precise- not at all," Azarov summed up.
$325 million rescue package for Tasmania's health care
The federal government is insisting that a $325 million rescue package for Tasmania's weakened health care system will be supplemented by tough conditions that ensure the state government doesn't waste money.
Federal Health Secretary Tanja Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth is taking "urgent action" to avert a crisis caused by the island's aging population, higher rates of chronic disease and system constraints.
The decision to fund for four years was made after the government's consultations with Tasmanian independent MP Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has proposed an emergency rescue package that we believe will address the specific challenges facing the state," Ms. Plibersek said today.
The $325 million package includes $31 million for a blitz campaign for planned operations.
Another 2600 operations, including orthopedic and cataract surgeries, will help to overcome the backlog.
There is also money for clinics accepting patients without an appointment, in Hobart and Launceston, to improve the quality of post-hospital care, train medical professionals, mental health services and implement personal electronic health record systems in local hospitals.
"This investment will go towards the ideas expressed by leading physicians on how best to help Tasmania's health system," Ms Plibersek said.
The Minister insisted that the Tasmanian government would operate in a regime of strict accountability and responsibility.
The state will need to maintain current funding levels in order to receive Commonwealth funds and report monthly on where it spends that additional funds.
A three-member commission will be set up to make sure the staff provides services as efficiently and efficiently as possible.
Mr Wilkie said today that $325 million will not solve anything "unless it is followed by genuine reform that puts Tasmania's health system on a more sustainable footing".
Nevertheless, he praised the Government for responding to its urgent assistance request, which he first addressed to the Prime Minister in early May.
"I hope the federal aid package will significantly help bring this state's health care system out of critical condition," Mr. Wilkie said.
According to the state government, these additional selective procedures largely offset recent cuts.
But federal opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton believes today's statement is "a decision similar to a Band-Aid."
"The reason we're here is because the Labour state government has snatched $430 million from the health care system," he told ABC TV.
When a state government rips off nearly half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth invests $300 million, you can't pretend that's good news.
Mr Dutton asked Ms. Plibersek to ensure that not a single dollar from the rescue package would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
Obama voter's cry of despair
I voted for President Obama twice, sharing hope for change.
He says Obama allowed Republican obstructionism to negate laudable efforts.
Obstructionism cannot be an excuse for problems with the website of the Obama-reformed health care system, the drone attack.
The memoir of Obama's 2008 campaign is a sad reminder of what could have been.
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year medical student at Harvard University.
I'm reading a terribly sad book these days.
I thought this book would inspire me in times of despondency in my second year of medical school and revive my sense of hope.
It's called "Audacity to Win," and it's a memoir about Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finish writing reports on my patients in the evening and go to bed, this book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions of people and speeches could take my breath away.
The election victory was impressive, and news anchors paused to reflect on this historic moment.
My classmates cried with joy, and my parents cherished all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of strategists was to come to the White House, and the people were ready for change.
When Obama took office in 2008, his level of support was 82%.
Then I close the book.
Returning to the present is a rough awakening, like pulling out of a dream.
It's hard to remember those days of optimism — they seem like a distant memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I dropped my first ballot, changes have indeed taken place.
It was something I couldn't even imagine.
I commend Obama for his great and varied achievements, from passing the Affordable Care Act to withdrawing our military from Iraq, repealing the "Don't Ask, Don't Tell," killing Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that partisan obstructionism has blocked too many attempts to move our country forward: immigration reform, the choice of public health care, and the closure of the Guantanamo Bay base, among others.
But after countless times I've been on the side of the Obama administration, defending it in front of colleagues and peers, I've run out of explanations I can provide.
I have reached a point of political despair.
Republican obstructionism cannot explain allowing foreign leaders to be wiretapped or drone strikes on innocent children in other countries.
It cannot explain the collection of data on the private lives of Americans by the National Security Agency or the persecution of whistleblowers who reveal government misconduct.
He cannot explain the murder of American citizen Anwar al-Awlaki without trial or the failure to meet public funding and spending limits during presidential campaigns.
He cannot live up to the report's findings, which said the White House's efforts to silence the media were "the most aggressive ... since the Nixon administration."
And lately, it hasn't been able to justify failing to develop a simple website for more than three years after signing the Affordable Care Act.
I don't know if that's what I was going to expect.
Should I have realized at the age of 18 that leadership might contradict the political campaigns that preceded it?
Clearly, serving in elected office is not a predictable agenda, as our public dialogue will be shaped by an opposition political party and random events such as the Newtown massacre.
Nevertheless, it is clear from all the examples I have listed above that they were largely the administration's own choice.
And that's what bothers me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was an incomprehensible and crude alternative, seemingly unable to make a decision on his own policies or views.
I believed that in his second term, Obama, freed from the pressures of future elections, would live up to the hopes we had heard about for so long.
However, when Obama's approval rating dropped below 45% this week, it became much harder to return to 2008 through this book.
It makes me yearn for the many promises that have gone away.
This week, I read the part of the book that describes how Clinton defeated Obama in the Pennsylvania primary.
At a meeting to analyze the reasons for the failure, he told his employees that they should return to normal and stay true to their goal.
"I want us to bring back our appeal," he said.
"We have to remember who we are."
Five years have passed, Mr. President, and I completely agree with you.
The opinions expressed in this comment belong exclusively to Nathaniel Morris.
In Egypt, the first freely elected president takes the oath of office
Mohammed Morsi takes the oath of office, but the day of his celebration is unlikely to mark the end of the political struggle in Egypt.
ISLAMIST Mohammed Morsi promised a "new Egypt" when he took the oath of office, becoming the country's first freely elected president, succeeding Hosni Mubarak, who was overthrown 16 months ago.
At his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and the fifth head of state in Egypt since the overthrow of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He took the oath of office before 18 judges in black robes at a courthouse on the banks of the Nile, built in the style of an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are striving for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic," Morsi said during the ceremony, which aired live on state television.
"Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundations for a new life — absolute freedom, genuine democracy and stability," said Morsi, a 60-year-old American-educated engineer from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that for most of its 84 years of existence has been a banned organization that has been the target of harsh action by successive governments.
The building was guarded by hundreds of soldiers and police when Morsi arrived with a small motorcade shortly after 11 a.m. local time.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered outside the courthouse to welcome the new president, and unlike the Mubarak-era presidential pomp, traffic was stopped only briefly to let his convoy pass along the usually busy road connecting the city center to the southern suburbs.
Although Morsi has been derided as the Brotherhood's uncharismatic "spare tire," his personal prestige has grown dramatically since his victory and Friday's speech, in which he tried to present himself as a candidate not only for Islamists, but for all those who want to finish the cause of the 2011 uprising against authoritarian Mubarak.
"Today, Egypt is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," Morsi, dressed in a blue business suit with a red tie, told judges in the wood-paneled room where he took the oath of office.
Morsi later went to Cairo University, where he was to deliver his inaugural address.
He was given an official reception with the army band, which performed the national anthem, during which he stood on the counter "peacefully".
Military leader Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi was present.
His arrival was greeted by the slogan "Army and people are one hand", which was chanted by hundreds of people gathered in the main lecture hall of the university.
Founded in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, Cairo University became a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
Morsi took the symbolic oath of office Friday in Tahrir Square, where the uprising that ended Mubarak's authoritarian rule last year was born, and vowed to regain the powers of the president, which his position had been stripped of by a military council that took over from the ousted leader.
But by agreeing to take an official oath before the court, and not before parliament, as is customary, he is carrying out the will of the military, and this is a sign that the struggle for power will continue.
Morsi's speech in Tahrir Square was filled with theatrical populist gestures.
Schools urged to pay more attention to mathematics, spelling and grammar
School English literature courses will require pupils to study at least one Shakespeare play, a nineteenth-century novel, romantic poetry, and modern British fiction dating back to 1914.
The exam will also feature "extracurricular texts" to encourage more extensive reading.
The combined English Literature and Language Course will be cancelled.
From 2015, students will be required to take a separate final language exam, with strong recommendations to choose English literature as a separate exam.
The Department of Education is due to release new curricula in English and mathematics tomorrow, the first subjects to undergo a radical overhaul.
It will make changes to other core subjects next year.
Separately, the regulatory body in the field of OFQUAL examinations will present a revised structure of secondary school final examinations, with a new grading system and a smaller amount of coursework.
Speaking in the summer, Education Secretary Michael Gove said there had been "a broad consensus that we need to reform our exam system to regain public trust", insisting that school final exams would be "more challenging, more ambitious and more rigorous".
Studies show that English schools devote less time to mathematics (116 hours a year, or three hours a week for a quarter) than in most countries.
For comparison, Australian schools give an average of 143 hours a year, and in Singapore, students study about 138 hours.
While there will be no formal requirement to devote more time in the math schedule, coalition sources said large-scale school final exams in mathematics, combined with an increased coefficient in the ranking table, would likely serve as an incentive for schools to provide additional instruction in the subject.
The curriculum will focus more on "real-life problems," including financial math.
Is football the cause of discord?
In the State Duma, within the framework of the "Open Tribune", politicians and experts talked about how to preserve national peace in Russia.
Among the proposals was the following: to ban football in the North Caucasus, because from this game there are only scandals and discord.
Speaker Sergei Naryshkin recalled the recent events in Biryulev and said that in order to reduce the "degree of tension in society", politicians and the media should be correct in their statements.
Probably, he was referring to the recent scandal with Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who in one of the TV shows threatened to surround the Caucasus with barbed wire if they did not want to limit the birth rate ...
All speakers spoke about measures to regulate migration from the CIS countries, and measures to harmonize relations between the peoples inhabiting Russia, which gave the discussion confusion.
Maxim Grigoriev said that the events in Biryulev are "a model conflict that could be predicted," but "too many people and authorities are responsible for these questions," and seven nannies have a child without an eye.
The concept of multiculturalism, which Europe has long practiced in relation to migrants, according to the public figure, has failed, and we must look for our own way.
Historian Yuri Petrov had high hopes for a new unified history textbook.
"It is also necessary to create a manual on the cultural history of the peoples of the country, so that schoolchildren in Tatarstan know what kind of people live in Dagestan, and vice versa," he said.
Gennady Zyuganov proposed to introduce criminal liability for "calls for the dismemberment of Russia": "If you say on the radio in the United States that you need to give Alaska to Russia, then you will be arrested and given 20 years in prison!"
Vladimir Zhirinovsky tried very hard not to "inflame".
As usual, he blamed journalists who bring sick and acute national problems to a public discussion: "In the heat of the controversy, there is little that can be said!"
The leader of the United Russia faction, Vladimir Vasilyev, immediately advised journalists to conclude a "charter" and agree to conduct conversations on this topic carefully, and then politicians can take on the same obligations.
We have adopted about 30 laws that regulate migration, and the order as a whole has been established, Mr. Vasilyev said.
As an example, he cited a law that makes regional and municipal authorities responsible for interethnic peace in their territory.
But Lyudmila Andrichenko did not share the enthusiasm for this law: it does not contain "clear ideas about what the adaptation of migrants is, about its mechanisms and limits.
This means that the regions will interpret the scope of these powers in different ways.
In addition, municipalities do not have the personnel necessary to solve such complex issues, there are no funds, and the center does not give them methodological recommendations that they could use...
The head of the Duma Committee for Nationalities Affairs, Gadzhimet Safaraliyev, proposed to create a special department with the formidable name "Ministry of National Security", which would deal with issues of national policy.
But Valery Tishkov, who in the 90s headed a similar department, which was later abolished, opposed it.
It is enough to have a special person at the federal level, a "minister without portfolio", to whom you could turn, if anything.
"We are walking along the edge, shells are exploding nearby, it is very important for representatives of different ethnic groups and religions to speak together against provocations, and this work should receive decent information support," said Vsevolod Chaplin, a representative of the Russian Orthodox Church for Relations with Society.
In his opinion, there should be no neutrality of the state in relation to dangerous ideologies, including religious ones.
Here Oleg Nilov took the discussion in an unexpected direction: "More talented people than in Chechnya or Dagestan still need to be searched, but they are pushed to the wrong path, to the wrong road," he said.
"The wrong road" is the development of football: "Sometimes a football player is beaten by the whole crowd, then flags are burned, then comrades throw stones at each other ...
Maybe we don't need this kind of football?
There is another sport - rugby is called...
"There will be no equal in the world in this sport!" the right-winger said passionately.
No one will play rugby in the Caucasus! Mr. Zhirinovsky immediately intervened.
You'll still offer curling to them!
It is necessary to know the national characteristics, it is like offering a Georgian "Zaporozhets" "...
In Yaroslavl, representatives of the Moscow club distinguished themselves by wild behavior in the stands - during the game with the local club.
Football will have to be banned across the country...
National Security Agency admissions heighten corporate paranoia about government surveillance
On a warm afternoon in late August, a German police helicopter flew low over the U.S. consulate in Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital.
According to instructions from the Federal Constitutional Protection Service (BfV), Germany's domestic intelligence service, his task was to photograph the roof of the US mission building, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media say the BfV hoped to detect the antennas of eavesdropping devices, and the actions led to talks between the U.S. and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, the U.S. director of national intelligence, reiterated in September that the U.S. is not using foreign intelligence capabilities "to steal trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of U.S. companies in order to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits."
But ever since Edward Snowden — a contract employee turned whistleblower — began publishing his treasure trove of U.S. intelligence secrets, European governments and company executives are no longer sure whether the director can be taken at his word.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency was spying on Brazilian oil company Petrobras and gaining access to data held by U.S. cloud service providers including Google and Yahoo have taken corporate paranoia caused by state surveillance to new heights.
The last straw was the news that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone had been bugged for perhaps about a decade.
If Europe's most powerful person can be targeted, then of course business leaders are potential targets.
Snowden made clear the intense cooperation between U.S. intelligence agencies and companies.
I think it's likely that this data is being used for mutual benefit.
"Germany must wake up," says Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, which represents Germany's small and medium-sized IT companies.
German companies are convinced that the U.S. now poses almost the same risk as China in the areas of industrial espionage and data theft, according to a study published in July by the consulting agency EY.
In all the documents disclosed by Mr. Snowden, however, there has been no evidence so far that the U.S. has transferred trade secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians expressed concern that the EU lacks certain capabilities in the field of information technology and the Internet, and expressed the opinion that it should try to reduce its dependence on the United States.
Businessmen are skeptical about this.
Someone in the German parliament says we should create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
"It's not an option," says Gasso Plattner, president of German business software company SAP.
If there is a need for a powerful European IT industry, it should not have been allowed to die more than 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany, from coal to cars to farmers.
Everything except the IT industry.
Yet the reach and technical sophistication of U.S. spying agencies, made famous by The Snowden revelations, came as a shock to some companies that previously thought China posed the biggest surveillance risk.
A big shift is taking place in cloud technology, where European ceos have become more aware that data stored in the U.S. is in the same jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a study conducted by the trade association Cloud Security Alliance, about 10 percent of its non-US participants abandoned plans to use the services of a US-based cloud provider after the exposure of the American program for data mining Prism.
Jim Sneijb, one of SAP's chief executives, said: "We see consumers asking a new question that didn't arise a year ago, namely where is my data stored and can you guarantee that it will physically remain in this jurisdiction."
Many German leaders argue that the latest reports are just confirmation of what they already knew: powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets, and therefore this data must be protected at all costs.
That economic espionage is taking place is not surprising.
It always happened.
"This has been the subject of discussion for many years and has not changed significantly in the current controversy," says Kurt Bock, chief executive officer of chemical company BASF.
Americans spy on us at the commercial and industrial level, and we spy on them too, because it is in our national interest to protect our commercial enterprises.
Corporate leaders usually do not like to brag about the retaliatory measures they have taken, as this can provide an advantage to the enemy.
In large companies, the idea has long been internalized that taking a free flash drive at an exhibition or leaving a laptop unattended in a hotel room is, to say the least, imprudent.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the board of directors of the automaker Audi, says that for many years it has been standard practice to collect mobile phones before board meetings so that they cannot be used as listening devices.
Germany's Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution recommends company executives to consider using simple prepaid mobile phones when traveling abroad due to the vulnerability of smartphones.
Prepaid mobile phones are subsequently discarded.
However, there are concerns that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many such companies are leaders in the global market in their specific niche.
"Small and medium-sized companies often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets from unauthorized access," the BfV report warns.
The U.S. is warning its own companies about economic espionage by other countries.
The U.S. National Intelligence Report in February placed France, along with Russia and Israel, in the second row of violators who engage in hacking for economic intelligence, after China, according to The Washington Post.
A member of the board of directors of the prestigious German company confirmed that when it comes to economic espionage, "the French are the worst of all."
Bernard Scarsini, the former head of France's domestic intelligence agency DCRI, reportedly said in an interview this month: "The services are well aware that all countries, even when they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, spy on their allies."
Los Angeles International Airport was evacuated due to shooting in one of the terminals.
An unknown man opened fire in the third terminal at 09.30 local time on Friday, November 1 (20.30 Moscow time).
Security evacuated employees and passengers of the second and third terminals.
According to preliminary data, the man was shooting from a high-power rifle.
Several people, including an employee of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration, were injured.
The police returned fire and detained the attacker.
He was slightly wounded.
Tripody denies being influenced by Obeid
Former New South Wales Labour Minister Joe Tripody will be the subject of an investigation by the state's anti-corruption watchdog.
Former New South Wales Minister Joe Tripody denies changes to the lease of seaside properties at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who secretly owned shares in three properties on state land.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) on Friday expanded its investigation into whether Mr. Obeid lobbied several state ministers to extend leases to The Circular Key, where the Obeid family owns two restaurants and cafes, without going through a tender after they expired in August 2005.
It is now investigating allegations that Mr Tripody was aware of Mr Obeid's secret involvement in the properties, following testimony given by Mr Tripodi's former deputy chief of staff, Mr. Lynn Ashpole, on Thursday.
During several years of discussions that began in 2005, the government insisted that the lease be put up for open competition.
Tenants were opposed to this and also wanted longer lease terms.
In 2009, the lease agreements for The Circular Key, which brought the Obaid family about $ 2.5 million a year, were extended without being put up for public competition.
Mr. Tripodi, who was Minister of Infrastructure and Transport from February 2006 to November 2009, initially advocated for open competitions.
But he denied that the changes had been made at the request of Mr Obaid, who Mr Tripody had acknowledged had urged changes to the government's lease policy.
A transcript of telephone conversations provided by ICAC included conversations in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obaid, Mr. Tripody and Steve Dunn, a senior official who joined the Ministry of Ports after working under Mr. Obeid in the Fisheries Division.
"Was the issue discussed during these telephone conversations a question of the development of commercial lease policies?" asked Assistant Commissioner Anthony Wiley to Mr. Tripodi.
"No," Mr. Tripodi replied. —
I can't remember what was discussed, but it definitely wasn't.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obeid.
UN announces new poverty alleviation targets
The United Nations must immediately begin work on a new set of targets to replace the Millennium Development Goals that were formulated 12 years ago to overcome poverty throughout the world.
Australian diplomats have played a key role in promoting the "Sustainable Development Goals" to replace the MDGs, which expire in 2015, before the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, which began in Rio de Janeiro the night before.
They were included in the final version of the document, which will be signed by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit.
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told summit attendees the night before that now is the time to "rise above the national interest."
"I am pleased that UN member states have agreed to launch and take control of the process of creating universal sustainable development goals – the SDGs," he said.
These SDGs will build on our progress towards the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 vision.
I will make every effort to use the authority given to me by Member States to realize our vision of the Sustainable Development Goals, which are based on the successful implementation of the MDGs.
In the utility payments of Voronezh residents there will be a new line of expenses - deductions for major repairs of the house.
According to the most approximate calculations for a standard two-room apartment from the new year you will have to pay from 100 to 400 rubles per month.
The exact standard will be determined by the regional government.
But when to paint the entrance, put in order the stairwells or even replace the elevator - the tenants themselves will decide.
Such a law was approved by deputies of the regional Duma.
Vladimir Klyuchnikov, Chairman of the Voronezh Regional Duma, noted: "In this case, too, it is necessary to restore order - to establish the order of overhaul of houses, to accumulate funds not in management companies - which we often register in Moscow, then in Orenburg, or somewhere else, this will be the establishment of state control over the spending of funds that residents collect for the repair of apartment buildings."
Under the control of the state is now shared construction.
The law protecting against fraudsters was approved by the regional Duma in the final reading.
The document was not born out of nowhere.
In our region, 4.5 thousand people suffered from dishonest developers.
The problems of the majority were solved.
By the way, the new law prescribes the rights and obligations for all participants in shared construction.
Vladimir Klyuchnikov, chairman of the Voronezh Regional Duma, said: "It is no secret that abuses also began in this area, due to the fact that in the 98th year the shareholders got the same, and in the 2000s the same equity holders."
People began to earn money on this to close the loophole, including the adoption of these two laws.
Near Voronezh, it was decided to build a temporary stay center for foreign citizens subject to deportation.
The regional parliament adopted such a law not only under the pressure of the federation.
There are plenty of problems associated with illegal migrants in the region.
So, last year a little more than 100 thousand foreigners registered with the migration service.
But only every fifth issued an official work permit.
Where the rest work and whether they pay taxes is a big question.
Vladimir Klyuchnikov, chairman of the Voronezh Regional Duma, said: "They violated the law, but they are not criminals."
There is no court, but they need to be deported - they need to be kept somewhere.
The federation made such a decision that such places should be equipped at the expense of regional funds.
In the Voronezh region, such a place is defined - this is Staraya Olshanka of the Semiluksky district.
Well, finally, the regional parliament gave new benefits to parents with many children.
First, families raising 5 or more children are completely exempt from transport tax.
The budget in this case loses 3.5 million - but the same amount is saved by parents with many children.
Secondly, and this is the main thing, those who adopt 3 or more babies will be given housing subsidies from the new year.
For each family member, the new law provides for 18 square meters, at a price of 30 thousand per meter.
A family, for example, of 6 people - father, mother, native child and 3 - adopted.
For them, according to the standards, the state acquires housing with an area of 108 square meters - for 3 million 300 thousand rubles.
For the left bank or the South-Western microdistrict - quite an acceptable option.
Well, in the district center for this amount you can buy a whole cottage.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has released guidelines for schools regarding allergies in children
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a list of guidelines for controlling food allergies in children in schools.
This is the first list of such recommendations that the US government has issued, while the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies is growing.
One in 20 children in the U.S. now have a food allergy.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the prevalence of food allergies among children increased by 18 percent from 1997 to 2007.
The guide provides information for schools on how to raise awareness among teachers and staff about food allergies in children and how to provide assistance in the event of an allergic reaction.
It also recommends that schools keep supplies of epinephrine — the EpiPen automatic medical syringe is most commonly used for injections — to assist with potentially fatal anaphylaxis.
State legislatures recently made changes to regulations to allow schools to make adrenaline rushes with less difficulty.
The notice also contains a list of typical symptoms described by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say, "It feels like something is poking my tongue," "it feels like I have hair on my tongue," or "my tongue is pinching."
Kenyan press outraged by provocative media law
"This is a terrible place, and there are grounds for the question: what can prevent parliament from destroying the independence of the judiciary in the future?" the newspaper said, calling the law unconstitutional.
"This law is very harsh and punitive, and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, managing director of Capital Group, capitalFM's parent company, which includes one of Kenya's most respected independent radio stations and news site.
He said the new media judiciary "will always be biased as it is an extension of the government" and restrictions on content and advertising would hurt Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope that the president will listen to us, and we appeal to him to reject this bill and return it to the deputies," he said.
According to The Star, the new law would essentially allow the government to "take the media with a stranglehold," and The Standard reported that democracy and free speech in Kenya had "taken a serious hit" and criticized the bill as "draconian."
The passage of the bill is part of measures taken to strengthen national security after the September attack by Muslim terrorists at the Westgate shopping center.
Kenyan media drew the ire of authorities by broadcasting surveillance camera footage of troops who were sent to the site of the attack allegedly looting an expensive shopping mall.
Police Chief David Kimayo's reaction was to summon two journalists and a media official for questioning, although the summons was cancelled after mass media protests.
Under the new law, publishers can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings, and individual journalists up to one million with the additional risk of being "off the lists", that is, receiving a ban on obtaining official journalistic accreditation.
The court also has the right to confiscate the infringer's property if the fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, "even one fine is enough to paralyze the work of most FM radio stations."
She also said the measures could have a devastating effect on Kenya's so-called "vibrant blogosphere".
Politicians understand that by silencing the media, they will be able to do whatever they want with impunity.
"No one will ever know," wrote Nation journalist Mutuma Matthew, describing the Kenyan media as a key source of deterrent and balancing forces in public life.
"Left to their own devices, politicians will ravage the country and bring us back to hunting and gathering," he wrote.
Kenyan lawmakers have been the target of public anger in the past.
In May, they voted to roll back cuts imposed by the national wage commission and restore their huge salary of about 532,000 shillings a month, which is tax-free, one of the highest in the world.
Investigators are checking information about child abuse in Biysk
On October 29, the media published a report that a teacher of one of the kindergartens in the city of Biysk locked the child in the basement for educational purposes.
Currently, investigators are clarifying all the circumstances, as well as giving a legal assessment of the actions of the kindergarten staff.
After the accusation of bad taste, Evgeniya Vasilyeva spoke
Evgenia Vasilyeva, whose person has attracted close media attention for almost a year, has never commented on numerous publications in the press both about embezzlement in the Ministry of Defense and about her personally - relations with former Defense Minister Anatoly Serdyukov, her poetry and her addiction to valuable things.
However, on November 1, the defendant in the Oboronservis case broke her silence.
In an interview with Life News, Vasilyeva said: "Initially, of course, the task was exactly the same: to pull out of me any negative information about the former minister of defense."
There was blackmail that I had to testify or I would be put in jail.
To date, these threats have ceased.
Then we go to court, we will prove our innocence.
We are 100 percent sure of victory.
At the same time, from the interview we can conclude that, perhaps, most of all Vasilyev was offended by the words that she did not care with taste.
Probably, this refers to the statement of the official representative of the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation Vladimir Markin that fakes were found in the collection of paintings collected by the defendant in the Oboronservis case.
Among the seized property there are a number of paintings that the hostess, being confident in her deep knowledge of art, acquired as masterpieces of world painting.
However, the art criticism examination appointed by investigators after the arrest of these paintings established that they have no artistic value and, simply put, are cheap fakes," Markin said in early October.
Some paintings stolen from the Ministry of Defense...
Then they admitted that they had not been stolen from the Ministry of Defense, while saying that I was not tasty.
Who has the right to discuss my taste, to discuss some personal issues?
In my opinion, this is just lawlessness," Vasilyeva said.
At the same time, when asked whether she would admit her guilt in at least one of the 12 criminal episodes imputed to her, Vasilyeva said: "Of course, no.
Nothing to recognize at all.
Moreover, there is no damage to the Russian Federation in question.
They just mislead people, that's all.
In addition, in response to today's statement by the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation that Vasilyeva is evading the study of the materials of the criminal case, the defendant's lawyer said that he and his client "are not allowed by the investigator to get acquainted with the case materials."
What was the reason for the revelations of Vasilyeva, who is under house arrest, who has not yet spoken to the press?
Perhaps how could a woman not fail to respond to the accusation of bad taste?
Or are the Komsomolka journalists right when they claimed a couple of days ago that she "fell into an even greater trance under house arrest" because of the news of Anatoly Serdyukov's reconciliation with his wife and his return to the bosom of the family?
The well-known military observer of "KP" Viktor Baranets in his article "Serdyukov returned to his wife?" wrote: "Investigators do not exclude that after such a shock she may become more talkative during interrogations."
Earlier, Vasilyeva took some charges of illegal sale of real estate to the Ministry of Defense.
Juventus defender Leonardo Bonucci will not help the team in the next match of the Italian championship with Parma.
According to Football Italia, the coaching staff decided not to include him in the application for the game in order to save him before the match of the 4th round of the group stage of the Champions League with Real Madrid.
Lichtsteiner, Vucinic and Pepe will also not take part in the match against Parma.
And striker Fabio Quagliarella has recovered from injury and is ready to play.
The UK government has announced a study aimed at boosting the economic impact for Scotland from the HS2 rail project.
The HS2 project involves the opening of high-speed communication with Scotland and the north of England, with the start of the First Phase in 2026
Transport Secretary Baroness Kramer said the project would "bring the UK together".
Scottish Transport Secretary Keith Brown said he was "delighted" with the prospect of working on the plan with the UK government.
The first phase will be the construction of a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.
When the Second Stage is completed, lines will be laid to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government revised the estimated cost of building a high-speed line between London and the north of England from £ 32.7 to £ 42.6 billion.
The UK government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has tasked HS2 Ltd with considering further improvements to the railway's capacity and reducing travel durations for the North of England and Scotland.
This should include being able to travel the journey from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London in three hours or less.
Baroness Kramer said: "Our aim for HS2 is to create a truly national network that brings the UK and its cities closer together. "
We are developing HS2 because the benefits it will bring are enormous.
Without it, we will face a capacity crisis in our rail network.
But it's also about the transport links of cities to each other; across the UK, 18 cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, will get the best connection thanks to HS2.
Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael added: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland. "
On behalf of the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Mr Carmichael to "unequivocally" support Scotland's inclusion in the HS2 network.
Mr Brown said: "High-speed rail has every chance of bringing huge economic benefits to Scotland, but also adds Scotland's economic weight to the overall argument for high-speed rail across the UK. "
We are therefore delighted to be working in partnership with the UK Government to consider options for building high-speed rail in Scotland, creating benefits for all and continuing the Glasgow–Edinburgh railway line, which the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to reviewing the results of the study with British ministers next year and jointly deciding on the next steps.
U.S. cuts food allowance for poor
Food allowance for a family of four is reduced by $ 36 per month
Since Friday, the financial support of food stamps, known as "food stamps", has been reduced in the United States, as the corresponding state program expires.
A family of four will now be allocated $36 a month less for food allowance than before, officials say.
This will affect 47 million of the poorest Americans.
According to Reuters, in fiscal year 2012, the allowance per person averaged $133 a month.
Spending on food aid in the U.S. rose to $80 billion a year due to rising unemployment and food prices.
Roughly 14 percent of Americans rely on free food aid for "food stamps," which have been dubbed since the old days, when they took the form of paper coupons.
When the current economic crisis hit, the program was expanded to boost growth and help the poorest Americans.
But Republicans in Congress are demanding further cuts to the program, saying it should be aimed at helping those who need it most.
Grocery store owners across America worry that the cuts will lead to lower consumer spending.
U.S. congressmen continue to debate how to cut funding for the government even further.
Because of the new rules introduced by the Russian customs, hundreds of trucks have been standing in line at the border with Russia for almost a week.
Today, Donetsk officials promised to provide drivers with drinking water and install composting toilets.
Hundreds of trucks have accumulated at border points at the entrance to Russia.
This situation arose due to a change in the rules of customs clearance of goods.
Ukrainian border guards and customs officers confirm: the queue is created by the Russian side, which did not warn in advance about the innovations.
Since October 28, the customs authorities of Russia have begun to apply additional measures to guarantee the delivery of goods, - said Vladimir Denisov, Deputy Head of the Eastern Customs.
The document of the new sample is applied in countries that have acceded to the convention on international transport.
Checkpoints are working in an enhanced mode.
The correspondent of "FACTS" visited the border and talked with truckers who were hostages of the situation.
Prices in the roadside shop-cafe at the checkpoint "Novoazovsk" are growing every day, as well as the queue of trucks.
Trucks stand in several rows, stretching for about two kilometers.
Customs terminal Novoazovsk - Veselo-Voznesenka provides one of the most important transport routes from the south of Ukraine along the international highway.
From here, cargoes are sent to the Stavropol Territory of Russia, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Armenia.
On Sunday, they were still allowed to go until midnight, and then these rules were introduced, - complains trucker Alexei Golovanev (pictured), who carries cargo from Turkey to Kazakhstan in transit through Russia and has been sleeping in his car for almost a week.
According to the new rules, in order to cross the border, I need an additional package of documents and payment for cargo insurance.
The amount depends on the value of the cargo and the distance to which it is transported.
Minimum insurance - 4.5-5 thousand rubles (about 1100-1300 hryvnia).
Those who travel nearby (say, to Georgia, Armenia) with a cargo worth up to 50 thousand dollars, pay about 15 thousand rubles (3800 hryvnia) and pass.
And the rest are stuck - because no one has such a lot of money with them!
Imagine, if the driver carries a cargo worth only four thousand dollars, but already to Moscow, he needs 90 thousand rubles (almost 23 thousand hryvnias) to pay for transit!
There are no conditions for survival at the border, - complain truckers who have settled down near their cars.
In border shops and cafes it is always expensive, but we have not met such prices as here!
Sellers orientated themselves and quickly inflated them: 15 hryvnia is a loaf, seven hryvnias - a cup of coffee, 25 hryvnia - a bowl of soup.
And there is only one café.
And there is no toilet.
In the steppe we sleep, there we go to the toilet.
No washing, no shaving...
I can not get out of the car for a week, my wife has prepared everything for me on the road.
I will last a week, - another trucker Viktor Skotarenko consoles himself.
But will it be my car's turn in a week?
How much do you have one and a half liters of water? - We are interested in the only border shop.
There are 11 and 15 hryvnias.
Is it a crystal bottle or is the water infused with silver?
We have a café, not a shop.
Take it while there is something else, the saleswoman retorts.
After the situation began to be covered in the media, the authorities of the region drew attention to the plight of Ukrainian drivers.
The leadership of the Amvrosievskaya and Novoazovskaya district state administrations were instructed to provide everyone who is idle in line at the Ukrainian-Russian border with drinking water, - said the acting chairman of the Donetsk regional state administration Sergey Dergunov.
Ambulance crews are now on duty at checkpoints.
Also, for the convenience of people, composting toilets will be installed.
According to the official, the problem associated with queues will be solved in the coming days.
According to the press service of the Donetsk Regional State Administration, as of October 31, 32 and 68 cars were idle at the international checkpoints "Uspenka" and "Novoazovsk", respectively.
"FACTS" will monitor the development of the situation.
Sony expects a lower annual profit
Japanese electronics manufacturer Sony Corporation, ending the past quarter with a net loss of 19.3 billion yen, or $ 197 million, reduced its profit forecast for the current fiscal year.
Sony's results for the period from July to September 2013 were more depressing than expected, which is due to a drop in demand for televisions, video cameras and personal computers manufactured by the Japanese corporation.
Sony's television business, which in the second quarter brought the company its first operating profit in three years in the amount of 5.2 billion yen, in the reporting period fell again to 9.3 billion yen of operating loss.
The Japanese consumer electronics market is going through hard times, especially due to declining demand for TVs.
And while competitors are looking for a way out of a difficult situation, Sony continues to focus on the consumer segment.
For example, one of Sony's main rivals, Panasonic Corporation, has recently shifted its focus to industrial components: here the company's sales are growing rapidly, especially due to automotive systems and environmentally friendly technologies.
As a result, by the end of the fiscal year, which will end in March 2014, Sony expects to receive 179 billion yen of operating profit against the previously expected 230 billion yen.
At the same time, according to Thomson Reuters, analysts assumed that this figure would be much higher and amount to 221 billion yen.
In an effort to get out of the crisis, Sony is expanding its product line.
In the middle of this month, the start of sales of "smart" watches from the Japanese corporation was announced, endowed with a number of fashionable functions that will get rid of the need to take out a smartphone from your pocket 100 times a day.
After Sony lowered its full-year forecast for profit and revenue, the company's shares in the morning at the opening of torogs in Tokyo lost more than 11%, falling to the level of 1668 yen per share.
How much do deceased celebrities earn - MK in the USA MK
The rating of live celebrities with the highest income in 2013 was headed by Madonna, who earned $ 125 million.
But she was "surpassed" by the late Michael Jackson, whose posthumous income from October 2012 to October 2013 was 160 million.
Noticeably behind him are other deceased celebrities who last year "earned" several times less.
The second in the list of the most "wealthy" departed celebrities, compiled by Forbes magazine at the end of the year was Elvis Presley - 55 million for the year, and the line below the author of Peanuts comics Charles Schultz with 37 million.
In addition to them, the top five included Elizabeth Taylor, who was the leader last year (25 million), and musician Bob Marley (18 million).
The list also includes Marilyn Monroe, John Lennon and Albert Einstein.
Eser proposes to equate insulting patriotic feelings with extremism
For the legislative protection of the patriotic feelings of citizens from provocations and insults directed against Russia, "Fair Russia" proposes to equate the insult of patriotic feelings with extremist activity and punish it with five years in prison.
According to the newspaper "Izvestia", such amendments to the legislation, prepared by the Deputy Chairman of the Duma Committee on Energy Oleg Mikheev, have already been sent for an opinion to the Supreme Court and the government.
Under the patriotic feelings of citizens, the author of the amendments proposes to understand the emotional connection of a person with the country of which he is a citizen, characterized by love for this country, a responsible attitude to its fate, respect for its history and culture.
As Mikheev points out, in domestic legislation there are sanctions for desecration of formal signs of state power - the flag and the coat of arms.
At the same time, according to the parliamentarian, the protection of Russians, whose feelings can be hurt by insulting state symbols, and other manifestations of disrespect for our country, is not sufficiently worked out in Russian legislation.
As an example, he cites the discussions that unfold annually on the eve of Victory Day, when some media personalities allow themselves to question the heroic feat of the people of the USSR in the fight against the Nazis.
On the eve of the main national holiday - Victory Day on May 9 - a real bacchanalia unfolds annually.
Practicing wit and an "alternative view" of history, some publicists go so far as to argue that, they say, what a pity that the cultured Germans did not conquer the wild Soviet Union!
I consider this absolutely unacceptable in a country where pride in history remains the main "spiritual bond" of the nation," Oleg Mikheev said.
In addition, according to Mikheev, there are much more patriotic people in Russia than religious ones, but at the same time the law punishes insulting the feelings of believers, and it is possible to insult patriotic feelings with almost impunity.
According to the people's representative, it is necessary to equate the insult of patriotic feelings with extremist activity and prescribe an appropriate punishment in the 282nd article of the Criminal Code.
The bill provides for punishment for insulting patriotic feelings: from a 100,000-ruble fine to a 5-year imprisonment.
In the new composition of public monitoring commissions, the influence of jailers will increase
Today, the Council of the Public Chamber (OP) can approve new compositions of public supervisory commissions (PMC) in 43 regions of Russia.
If the option put to the vote is adopted, the lobbyists of the security forces will increase their influence.
PMCs are public structures that monitor the conditions of detention in places of deprivation of liberty.
The cases of Sergei Magnitsky and Leonid Razvozzhaev, the unrest in the Kopeysk colony - it is through the PMC that most of the resonant incidents behind bars get publicity.
For control over the PMC there is a struggle between human rights activists and lobbyists of the security forces.
At the meeting of the op working group on the formation of the PMC, I proposed to make the experience of human rights activities the selection criterion.
"It was not accepted, and the lists were formed without developing criteria," says Valery Borshchev.
Borshchev is the current chairman of the Moscow Monitoring Commission and the Association of Independent Observers, an all-Russian structure of human rights defenders dealing with prison issues.
When he was a State Duma deputy from Yabloko, he developed a law regulating the activities of the PMC.
The Council of the Civic Chamber should vote for the composition of the PMC in 43 regions of the country.
Less than a thousand applicants apply for 1800 vacant places, and in Ingushetia and Kabardino-Balkaria competitions could not be organized due to the lack of candidates.
The OP promises to organize additional recruitment for vacant seats.
The PMC of Moscow is one of the few commissions with a competition, despite the fact that in the new composition instead of 20 there will be 40 participants.
According to Borshchev, in the current composition of the capital's commission there are 11 human rights defenders and 9 law enforcers, and in the version that is on the vote in the OP, the ratio changes to 17 to 23.
At the same time, 30 human rights defenders wanted to get into the capital's commission.
But the representative of the "Combat Brotherhood" Vyacheslav Kalinin can re-enter the new composition.
He was a member of the PMC for three years, but never visited prisoners.
Borshchev believes that the security forces, by appointing their chairman of the PMC, will be able to make the work of human rights defenders unbearable, so human rights defenders do not exclude a collective withdrawal from the commission.
In their opinion, the promotion of the security forces is coordinated by a member of the PMC Anton Tsvetkov, who heads the "Officers of Russia" - an organization that defends the interests of law enforcement agencies.
"I do not eat babies for breakfast," Anton Tsvetkov told RBC daily.
He denies lobbying for the promotion of any lists and says he has no intention of preventing human rights defenders from visiting arrested opposition figures.
According to Tsvetkov, he was not even interested in which list is now being voted for in the OP.
He considers Borshchev's disclosure of information a form of pressure.
A possible success of human rights activists is the planned change in the leadership of the Chelyabinsk PMC.
Its former leaders will be suspended because of last year's Kopey unrest.
The Civic Chamber came to the conclusion that the leadership of the local commission ignored the problems of prisoners.
But the PMC of Rostov-on-Don can move from human rights defenders to law enforcers.
The human rights activist-chairman of the local commission "disappeared" from the new lists, but one of his opponents turned out to be, despite the fact that in May 2013 the Federal Public Chamber expelled him for unethical behavior.
Borshchev considers the lists of the Moscow and Rostov commissions "revenge for Kopeysk."
The revelations of Nadezhda Tolokonnikova did not affect the PMC of Mordovia, which is considered a "force": only one human rights activist wanted to get into the new composition, and she did not even accept documents for the competition.
Nikolai Svanidze, a member of the OP council, told RBC daily that he voted against the proposed list, as he was outraged by the situation in Moscow and Rostov-on-Don.
He sent his position to other members of the council.
His colleague in the OP, Pavel Gusev, says he voted in favor because he likes the proposed Moscow list.
The compilation of the PMC lists was coordinated by the Deputy Secretary of the Public Prosecutor's Office Vladislav Hryb, who is also an employee of the Research Institute of the Federal Penitentiary Service.
Grib told RBC daily that he does not consider it right to divide candidates into human rights defenders and law enforcers and does not agree that the chairmen of the commissions have enough powers to interfere with the work of its members.
The mushroom does not undertake to predict the outcome of the OP council vote.
If the proposed list is rejected today, an amended version will be put to the vote in the coming days.
Clive Palmer claims that MP Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in the issue of parental leave.
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest over parental leave because his daughters can get pregnant and benefit from it.
The mining tycoon, who has an unresolved dispute over the payment of a $6 million carbon tax, made the announcement at a time when he was trying to brush off questions about whether he had a conflict.
Palmer's unified party can control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be crucial in deciding whether to eliminate taxes on carbon emissions and mining activities.
But Mr Palmer argued that only ministers could have a conflict of interest and said Mr Abbott's daughters would personally benefit from the policy measures.
"He has a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because if any of these daughters get pregnant, then he will have a direct interest in whether they will get leave or not," Mr. Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the Election Commission officially declared Mr. Palmer the winner of the sunshine coast seat in Fairfax County by a margin of 53 votes after a recount.
Mr. Palmer called for a review of the electoral counting procedure to speed up the process.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should a decision on this election be taken two months after we voted?
"We need to have a better system," he said.
Why shouldn't we have such a system so that we can come, enter our data into the computer, vote immediately and get the result at 18:30 the same evening?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of pencils for marks on ballot papers.
Is it because they can erase the result if someone doesn't like it?
Using a pencil nowadays seems strange.
The Electoral Commission is exploring the possibilities for electronic voting and recently published a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.
Mr. Palmer, 59, said his program included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and he would take his new job "very seriously."
Public office involves serving the public.
"We are not seeking any awards other than thanking history for being able to serve this county at a critical moment," he said.
Against Google, Samsung, Huawei filed lawsuits on patents Of Nortel
The group, which owns thousands of former Nortel patents, filed a series of patent lawsuits Thursday against mobile phone makers, including Google, the price of which it beat in Nortel's bankruptcy auction.
The Rockstar consortium, which bought Nortel patents for $ 4.5 billion, filed patent infringement lawsuits in the US district court in Texas against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of infringing seven patents.
These patents cover technologies that help match online search keywords with relevant ads, the lawsuit says, which is the backbone of Google's search business.
Representatives for Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were unavailable and did not comment.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC make phones that run on Google's Android operating system, which fiercely competes with mobile products from Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011, Google offered an initial price of $900 million for Nortel patents.
Google raised the offered price several times, eventually offering as much as $4.4 billion.
After losing the Nortel patent case to the Rockstar consortium, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, in which motorola's patent library was partly the determining factor.
"Despite an unsuccessful attempt to acquire the patents that are the subject of the lawsuit at auction, Google has violated and continues to infringe them," the lawsuit says.
Rockstar is seeking increased damages from Google because it alleges that Google's patent infringement is intentional, according to the lawsuit.
The stadium in Yaroslavl is not ready to receive 22 thousand spectators, noted police officers who attended today at the meeting of the KDK RFU.
The ticket program is inflated, in their opinion, about twice.
During the match 1/16 of the final of the Russian Cup with Spartak, only a thousand stewards were involved with a regulatory norm of nine thousand.
Spartak fans were entitled to 2200 seats, that is, 10 percent of the capacity of the stadium, however, by agreement with the Moscow club, they were sold 5 thousand tickets.
These data were announced by the head of the KDK Artur Grigoryants.
Bird airlifted to safety from a drilling rig in the North Sea released back into the wild
The bird, airlifted ashore after being found in an exhausted state on an oil rig in the North Sea, has been released back into the wild.
This water shepherd was placed in a helicopter bound for Aberdeen last month, and then he was released by the Scottish branch of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) at the rescue center in Alloa.
The centre's manager, Colin Seddon, said: "This water shepherd is most likely a winter migrant from Northern Europe who has fallen into a zone of strong winds over the North Sea. "
It seems that the bird is exhausted and was able to find refuge on the oil rig.
He added: "She wasn't able to take off again, so they asked us for help."
The water shepherd was healthy and in good condition by the time he was released.
Fines for unauthorized street trade in Vologda will increase significantly
According to the city authorities, the increase in the size of fines will help restore order in Vologda and free the streets from spontaneous tents and stalls.
Most street vendors do not pay taxes, the products they sell often do not pass the appropriate sanitary control.
And this means that the health of Vologda residents is endangered.
So, the lower limit of the fine for citizens for unauthorized trade from November will increase six times - from 500 rubles to 3,000 rubles, the press service of the Vologda Administration reports.
In September, 600 people were dismissed from the Ford automobile plant in Vsevolozhsk.
As they say in the trade unions, all those dismissed received compensation.
However, much more acute than the problems of workers, the question of reducing industrial production in the region arises.
Deputy of the regional Legislative Assembly Alexei Etmanov at the meeting said that about 600 people were laid off at the Ford plant in Vsevolozhsk.
According to him, this happened in September: then, according to the voluntary dismissal program, which was developed together with the organization's trade union, about 600 people left the plant.
Workers who decided to resign of their own free will were offered "golden parachutes" in the amount of several salaries.
Because of this, the vast majority left their jobs of their own free will.
However, according to Etmanov, such a number of people is a whole night shift.
I don't think it's going to stop there.
However, the authorities in the next two years do not plan to adopt any programs to support regional enterprises that are in a difficult situation," he explained, adding that when adopting the budget, the government does not take into account the stagnation of production in the region and a large reduction in jobs.
In Ford, this information is not refuted or confirmed.
We are waiting for a response from the company, and as soon as it appears, we will definitely publish it.
Talks about the reduction of workers at the Ford plant in Vsevolozhsk have been going on for a long time.
For example, the company's plans to lay off 600 people became known in September.
Earlier, the plant announced the suspension of car production.
As a reason, the plant called the fall in demand for Ford cars in Russia.
According to Petrostat, in the first nine months of 2013, the volume of industrial production in the Leningrad region decreased by 5.4%.
The production of vehicles and equipment decreased by 11.5%.
Dmitry Medvedev: Russia's GDP growth rate is insufficient for the development of the state
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev considers the growth rate of its GDP insufficient for the Russian Federation and is confident that the situation can be improved by simplifying the conditions for lending to business and changing the structure of the Russian economy, focusing on innovations, Reuters reports.
This year we planned GDP growth in the region of 3%, maybe even a little more.
Realistically, it will be a little less than 2%.
Against the background of a recession in a number of European countries, it seems not very bad, but for us it is not enough, because the economic base is not as powerful as in a number of countries, and in general, in order to develop, there must be higher rates.
Now it is very important that Russian companies, Russian business receive normal loans at a normal price - this is the first thing that must be done," the head of government emphasized.
The director of Ugra, Andriy Belmach, noted that it is still difficult to say how long it will take to find a new head coach.
This post became vacant after the resignation of Sergei Shepelev.
The resignation occurred only a few hours ago, so I am not ready to say how long it will take to find a new coach," ITAR-TASS quoted Belmach as saying.
Maybe a day.
Maybe a month.
We are exploring all possible options.
Priority will be given to the Russian specialist.
I want not just to find some coach, but a person who will work in our club for several years and achieve certain results with him.
Snowboarder for the Olympic bill was specially photographed
The Bank of Russia on Wednesday issued a commemorative banknote dedicated to the city of Sochi, where the Olympic Games will be held this winter.
The denomination of the banknote is 100 rubles.
But on the network, bloggers are already actively ironic about the commemorative banknote.
After the presentation of the Olympic banknote on October 30, they drew attention to the fact that the image of a snowboarder from the banknote can be found in photo banks.
In particular - in the free photo storage StockExchange, where this photo is dated 2005.
The same photo is used in a Photoshop lesson published on the Russian website Megaobzor on January 18, 2011.
In addition, it has already been used in advertising smartphones RugGear.
The Olympic banknote is made in blue and blue.
On one side is a snowboarder flying over Sochi, on the other - a view of the Olympic stadium and the Firebird.
The author of the banknote design is Pavel Bushuev, who won the competition among students of the Repin St. Petersburg Academy of Arts.
At the presentation, it was noted that several sports were considered - alpine skiing, freestyle and ski jumping, but in the end they chose snowboarding, since it is a relatively young sport.
According to a Izvestia source close to the Central Bank, the regulator is not indifferent to the opinion of the public regarding the wide distribution of the image of a snowboarder from the Olympic banknote and is now studying the situation.
But in Goznak, they are not too concerned about the hype around the Olympic banknote.
The head of the press service of the State Sign, Natalia Nikiforova, told Izvestia that all the arguments regarding plagiarism are ridiculous.
The snowboarder on the banknote is turned to the right, in the photos on the network - to the left, - said Nikiforova.
The person at the photo shoot to create the bill was shot from different points, then the final image was chosen, on it - the characteristic pose of a snowboarder.
She also noted that copyright laws do not apply to the Olympic banknote, as the artist received a salary for the work.
According to experts, the discussion around the image on the Olympic banknote is completely positive.
The recognition of the image on the banknote is a plus for its promotion, - says Alexey Popovichev, executive director of NP RusBrand.
It is quite difficult to prove one hundred percent similarity of the images on the banknote and in photo banks, so lawsuits to challenge the intellectual property of this image are unlikely to be received.
For the first time, the Olympic banknote appeared in China - for the Olympic Games in Beijing in 2008, a commemorative banknote of 10 yuan was issued.
Russia decided to support this tradition.
São Paulo Fashion Week.
At home, she is considered not just a model, but a real star.
Despite the fact that Gisele Bündschen left her job for a while, distracted by motherhood, these days and for this week of the defile, she came on purpose.
A months-long absence did not prevent her from maintaining her place on the podium and on the pedestal.
Giselle remains the world's highest-paid supermodel.
This time she participated in the defile of the brand "Colcci".
The finale of fashion week is usually the most interesting shows.
Like what stylist Lino Villaventura organized.
The brand is more than 30 years old, in parallel with the production of ready-to-wear luxury, the fashion designer is actively working in the theater and in the cinema, designing performances and developing costumes for many famous paintings.
In total, more than 30 thousand firms and companies that are related to the textile industry and the fashion world took part in the final fashion week in São Paulo.
This is one of the most dynamically developing areas of production, it employs more than 2 million Brazilians, and the annual turnover reaches 50 billion dollars.
Driver travelling at 130 mph with a hot drink between his legs fined £1,000
A motorist was fined £1,000 for driving at speeds of up to 130 mph (210 km/h) with a hot drink held between his legs.
Andrew Howey, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was spotted driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 in Braintree on May 27.
When the police stopped him, they found a drink to take away from him between his legs.
In Colchester Magistrate's Court, Howie pleaded guilty to driving without due diligence or attention.
Adding seven penalty points to his driver's license resulted in a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also ordered to pay a £90 fee and an additional fee to help victims of crime of £100.
Pensions to be increased in Belarus since November
Pensions have been increasing in Belarus since November of this year, BelTA learned from the main pension department of the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection.
From November 1 of this year, the average salary of employees in the republic, applied during the previous recalculation of pensions, will be adjusted with an increase in its value by 5.4% and the corresponding recalculation of labor pensions will be carried out in accordance with the decree of October 21, 2013 No. 478 "On Increasing Pensions".
As a result of the recalculation from November, labor pensions by age will increase, according to estimates, by an average of 5.3%.
The average old-age pension will be Br2 million 295 thousand.
The increase in pensions will affect 2.4 million residents of the republic.
The expenditures of the Social Protection Fund of the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection of Belarus on the payment of pensions in increased amounts from November this year will increase by Br274.3 billion per month.
Simultaneously with the recalculation of labor pensions in November of this year, minimum and social pensions, allowances, increases and additional payments to pensions will be recalculated in connection with the increase in the subsistence minimum budget on average per capita.
The BPM for the period from November 1, 2013 to January 31, 2014 was approved by the government in the amount of Br1 million 47 thousand 530 - 2.1% higher than the one in force in the period from August 1 to October 31.
Accordingly, the size of minimum labor pensions, social pensions and allowances, increases and supplements to pensions will be increased by 2.1% from November 1.
In Belarus, more than Br53 trillion has been allocated for the payment of pensions taking into account the increases in 2013.
The NSA blames an "internal error" rather than hackers for shutting down the site
Shrouded in secrecy, the National Security Agency said Friday night that shutting down their site for several hours caused a technical glitch, not hackers as claimed on the network.
"NSA.gov was unavailable for several hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during a scheduled update," the intelligence agency said in an official email.
The problem will be solved tonight.
Claims that the outage was caused by a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack are incorrect.
Earlier tonight, online server monitoring systems registered that the NSA site had been down for at least six hours, and the site was still unavailable to some users.
Earlier, an NSA spokesperson told ABC News that the agency's internal secret network was "by no means" hacked.
No classified information is in danger, the spokesman said.
At least one online group of activist hackers said it was responsible for disabling the NSA website with a DDoS attack.
DDoS attacks are designed to overwhelm the target site with traffic until the servers are overwhelmed and the site goes down.
Hacker tactics are relatively simple, and attacks are not designed to infiltrate the target system's internal network.
The previously super-secret NSA, once dubbed "No Such Agency," has been the focus of public attention and fierce criticism in recent months after a string of revelations about its extensive surveillance programs abroad and at home — all a reaction to secret NSA files stolen from the agency and published by a frustrated former NSA employee Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy around the agency has sparked speculation that today's incident was the result of targeted actions by hackers.
Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller says Bulgaria's pipeline marks a new era in the gas sector
The start of construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of the largest energy projects in Europe, said the head of Gazprom.
"Today there was a landmark event: the construction of the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun," Gazprom Chairman Alexei Miller said in a statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream is designed to diversify Russia's export routes through Europe.
A contract dispute between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which hosts most of Russia's gas destined for Europe, raises the level of risk for conventional routes, officials say.
Miller said a direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries have been eliminated "forever."
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from South Stream at a reduced price as soon as the entire project starts operating in 2015.
Gazprom said construction should begin in other countries further along the pipeline route by the end of the year.
The pipeline's annual design capacity is 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
The agency "Rosbalt" was deprived of the status of the media for obscene language
On October 31, the Moscow City Court decided to invalidate the license on the registration of the Rosbalt agency, Lenta writes.
Roskomnadzor insisted on depriving the agency of its media status for systematic and gross violations of the law on the media.
During the trial, an unpleasant precedent was created: the court considered it possible to close the media, actually denying the publication the right to put forward counter-arguments.
What is "Rosbalt"
CJSC "Rosbalt Information Agency" was established in St. Petersburg in 2000.
In the following years, the agency opened a second head office in Moscow and a number of regional divisions.
The agency also has representative offices in the countries of the former USSR.
Since 2001, Rosbalt has developed and functioned as a federal information and analytical agency.
By the mid-2000s, the agency was on the list of the most recognizable private Internet media in Russia.
At the same time, Rosbalt has always occupied a rather specific niche: the core of the agency's exclusive publications was (and still is) notes with reference to sources in law enforcement agencies.
Talks about the proximity of the publication to law enforcement agencies continued throughout the existence of the agency.
Along with the fact that Rosbalt had an extensive database of sources in various departments, the fact that Natalia Chaplina, the wife of Viktor Cherkesov, was at the head of the project, also spoke in favor of such assumptions.
At the same time, Chaplina's role in the leadership of Rosbalt is not completely clear: most often she is called the "project manager".
The general director of the agency is Larisa Afonina, the editor-in-chief is Nikolay Ulyanov.
Recently, Rosbalt has not appeared in the ratings of federal media - neither in terms of citations nor in terms of audience.
In October, the agency took 25th place in the ranking of attendance at Russian media sites according to LiveInternet.
According to the same LiveInternet, the average daily audience of the rosbalt.ru site is about 150 thousand unique visitors (and up to 500 thousand views), monthly - about three million unique visitors.
Among the most popular materials over the past five months are notes about the Helplessness of the Kremlin in relations with Ukraine, the death of the soloist of the group "King and Jester", pogroms in the capital's Biryulev.
Rosbalt's conflict with Roskomnadzor began in July 2013, when amendments to the law on the media came into force, prohibiting journalists from swearing.
The agency found forbidden language in two videos published on the agency's website ("Dzhigit from Krasnodar" and "Pussy Riot desecrated oil rigs").
Further sides are described in different ways.
Roskomnadzor, on the basis of the discovered video materials, accused Rosbalt of gross and systematic violation of the law on the media and appealed to the court with a demand to take away the agency's license.
Rosbalt stated that the department's claims were unlawful: firstly, the videos were not editorial materials, secondly, swear words in them were disguised, and, thirdly, immediately after the warning, the videos were removed from the site.
Representatives of the agency appealed the claims of Roskomnadzor in the magistrate's court - and when on October 22, 2013, the Moscow City Court accepted the claim of Roskomnadzor, the consideration of these complaints was still ongoing.
However, already on the 25th, the magistrate judge ruled not in favor of Rosbalt: the editor-in-chief Nikolai Ulyanov was found guilty of violating the Code of Administrative Offenses and fined 20 thousand rubles - 10 thousand for each video.
Obviously, this predetermined the outcome of the hearing in the Moscow City Court - if you abandon the idea that the outcome could have been predetermined even earlier.
On October 31, the court decided to invalidate rosbalt's registration certificate, effectively depriving the agency of media status.
It cannot be said that Rosbalt remained alone during this confrontation.
The agency was supported by State Duma deputies (a statement addressed to the head of Roskomnadzor Alexander Zharov on October 10 was signed by 26 deputies; the document itself was submitted at the initiative of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation).
The illegality of the closure of the publication was stated by the head of the Union of Journalists of Russia Vsevolod Bogdanov, the chairman of the Moscow Union of Journalists Pavel Gusev and the head of the Presidential Council for Human Rights Mikhail Fedotov.
Moreover, according to Bogdanov, the leadership of Roskomnadzor even provided him with some guarantees that it would not come to revoking the license.
The trial of Rosbalt showed that under whose jurisdiction it is safer for the media to be in Russia today is a big question.
The speech gene turned out to be a stimulator of synapse formation
Scientists from Johns Hopkins University and Mount Sinai School of Medicine have discovered a protein thanks to which the "speech gene" Foxp2 performs its function, stimulating the formation of new connections between neurons.
The study is published in Science, on the journal's website you can read its summary.
The Foxp2 gene is the first known gene whose function is directly related to speech.
It was possible to establish his role in 2001 thanks to the discovery of a family of several people who could not pronounce words correctly and sometimes did not even understand each other themselves.
Scientists have found that family members were impaired in the work of the Foxp2 gene, but how it performs its function remained unknown.
In a new study, biologists have shown that foxp2 performs at least part of its functions as a stimulator of the formation of new synapses in the area of the brain associated with the formation of speech.
He does this thanks to another gene, SRPX2.
The latter was discovered as a result of the search for factors that stimulate the formation of synapses.
SRPX2 turned out to be one of 10 similar genes found by the authors, with Foxp2 only on its activity.
The fact that SRPX2 really affects vocalization, scientists confirmed in an experiment on mice.
When the animals' gene activity was artificially reduced, they screamed less when separated from their mother.
If the activity of the gene was restored, the frequency of the sounds produced was also restored.
Previously, mice also showed a connection with the vocalization of Foxp2 itself.
Animals that were injected with a human copy of the gene squeaked more actively and at a lower frequency than normal mice.
Until now, however, scientists do not know whether the work of Foxp2 and, accordingly, the SRPX2 controlled by it is associated with purely "mechanical" properties of sound formation or more subtle processes.
Ponomarev left "A Just Russia"
Deputy of the State Duma from the party "Fair Russia", a member of its branch in Novosibirsk Ilya Ponomarev filed an application to withdraw from the political organization.
According to the parliamentarian, he submitted an application to the Novosibirsk regional branch of the party.
According to its charter, this automatically means that Ponomarev left the ranks of the "right-wingers".
We sit and drink tea...
"For some reason, many people want to see the painting 'Ilya Ponomarev puts a party card on the table,' but there is nothing so epochal in this," the deputy commented on his decision.
Ponomarev noted that he maintains good relations with the regional branch of the SRs.
Meanwhile, Ilya Ponomarev does not intend to give up the mandate of a State Duma deputy.
He explained that, despite leaving the party, he remains a member of the faction and by law cannot leave it.
Reports about the intention of Ilya Ponomarev to leave the party "Fair Russia" appeared on October 30.
It was reported that Dmitry Gudkov and Valery Zubov would leave the "SR" with him, but the latter soon denied this information.
Want glow-in-the-dark ice cream?
A British entrepreneur has created the world's first glow-in-the-dark ice cream with jellyfish.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescent properties of a marine animal to develop a glowing food.
He came up with this idea after reading a scientific paper on jellyfish and convinced scientists in China to chemically recreate a glowing protein.
Ice cream reacts with the tongue of the one who eats it, raising the pH level in the protein and causing it to glow.
Chris says that because ice cream starts to glow when it reacts to the warmth of your mouth, it means that the more you lick, the brighter it gets.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company Lick Me, I'm Delicious, says: "It's an incredible thing, but still at the very initial stage when it comes to production, so for £200 you get about 2 grams of the substance."
The protein we use in ice cream reacts with your tongue at a neutral pH.
So when your mouth warms up the protein, it will raise the pH level and the ice cream will start to glow.
We've been testing it for the last few months and it seemed like it would be perfect to present it on Halloween because it creates such a wonderful glowing effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made because jellyfish luminescence is four times more expensive than gold.
So each ball costs me about £140.
But it tastes pretty good.
Charlie's Experimental Company, based in Bristol, is famous for its unusual flavours, including beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf taste.
But his next creation should be even more ambitious.
He said, "I really want to develop invisible ice cream."
That's by definition impossible because of the refraction caused by the ice crystals that make up ice cream, but I think we'll find a way to do it.
Ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of jellyfish, synthesized by Chinese scientists
GM recalls a number of new pickups in the US to refine seat backs
General Motors Co is recalling nearly 19,000 brand-new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups to address issues with manual seat backrest adjustment, according to Friday's notice from U.S. auto safety regulators.
On some of the pickups, the front seats may have a defect in the mechanism of inclination of the backrests.
As a result, the seat backs do not meet federal vehicle safety standards for head restraints.
"When a vehicle is struck from behind, the head restraint may not properly protect the driver and passengers, increasing the risk of injury," the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in a notice posted on its website.
The recalled models were made between August 1 and September 10.
Production of GM pickups began in June and represents the most important launch of the car into mass production for the leading American automaker since its restructuring due to bankruptcy in 2009.
GM informed pickup truck owners of the defect in the first half of October.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration could not consider notifying owners due to the 16-day shutdown of the government, which lowered auto sales growth in October.
Sales of the Silverado and Sierra pickups, which have been upgraded for the 2014 lineup, rose about 20 percent during the first 10 months of this year, GM said Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado pickups and 16,503 Sierra pickups.
GM shares on the New York Stock Exchange rose 1.4 percent to $37.47 on Friday afternoon.
In the area of the Tretyakov Gallery opened a pedestrian zone
A new pedestrian zone has appeared in Moscow.
It is located in the area of the Tretyakov Gallery and occupies a plot of two kilometers from the metro station "Novokuznetskaya" to Bolotnaya Square.
Street lamps, flower girls, benches, bins and toilets have been installed all along, blind fences and illegal advertising have been removed.
In addition to Klimentovsky and Lavrushinsky lanes, which were already pedestrian, five streets were closed to cars - Ordynsky Dead End, Bolshoy and Maly Tolmachevsky Lanes, Kadashevskaya Embankment and Bolotnaya Square.
Traffic on the streets of Maroseika and Petrovka is not limited.
On the section of Pyatnitskaya Street from the lobby of the Novokuznetskaya station to Klimentovsky Lane, conditions for pedestrians were created without removing traffic and cutting the roadway, newsmsk.com reports.
Inside the pedestrian zone were the Tretyakov Gallery, the Temple of the Hieromartyr Clement the Pope, museums, libraries, monuments and other attractions.
Previously, Tverskaya Proezd, Stoleshnikov Lane and Kuznetsky Most Street became completely pedestrianized.
Bolshaya Dmitrovka, where the pedestrian zone opened in early September, it was decided to close for cars on weekends and holidays.
Fans of Zenit on the official website of the club recognized the ex-captain of the Russian national team as the best player of the past month.
In October, Arshavin took part in two matches of the group stage of the UEFA Champions League, three meetings of the Russian championship and in a cup match.
He has 2 assists.
The second place at the end of the month went to goalkeeper Yuri Lodygin, who became the best player in August and September.
In third position is striker Hulk.
The Brazilian has two goals and three assists.
Recall that Arshavin returned to Zenit this summer.
A series of premiere film screenings "Art-Mainstream" will be held in Moscow
A series of film screenings "Art-mainstream", where viewers will be able to see one Russian and four foreign films a few days before their release, will be held in the cinema "Roland" from November 1 to 5, RIA "Novosti" reports with reference to the organizers of the project.
The program "Art Mainstream" will be opened by the French comedy of the director and actress Reim Kerichi "Paris at any cost".
This is a story about the model Maya working in the French capital (Kerichi herself), who, due to visa problems, is deported to her homeland - to Morocco.
In addition to Kerichi's film, viewers will also be shown a new picture by the famous South Korean director Kim Ki-duk "Moebius", Oliver Hirschbiegel's melodramatic biopic "Diana: A Love Story" (Diana) with Naomi Watts in the title role and the main film of the Cannes Film Festival "Life of Adele" held in May by Abdelatif Kesheesh.
The only Russian participant of the "Art Mainstream" will be alexander Veledinsky's film "Geographer Globus Propyl" based on the novel of the same name by Alexei Ivanov, which won at the Kinotavr festival.
The main role - the charming loser-teacher Viktor Sluzhkin - in the film was played by Konstantin Khabensky, whose work was also awarded the prize "Kinotavr".
Snowden is ready to "cooperate" with Germany on the issue of US intelligence
Edward Snowden, a U.S. intelligence whistleblower, said he was willing to travel to Berlin to testify before the German parliament if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director, Keith Alexander, failed to answer questions about their activities.
German lawmaker Hans-Christian Ströbele on Thursday met with Mr Snowden in Russia, where he has been granted asylum, to discuss his testimony in Germany.
A letter from Mr Snowden, which the LAWmaker presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, said: "While the outcome of my efforts has been clearly positive, my government continues to treat dissent as treason and seeks to criminalize political speech with criminal charges that offer no protection."
However, telling the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Mr. Snowden said he believed the support of the international community could persuade the U.S. government to drop criminal charges against him.
Charges brought by the U.S. Department of Justice include espionage and theft of government property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, Germany's interior minister, told Zeit Online: "If Mr Snowden is willing to talk to German officials, we will find ways to make it possible."
Relations between the U.S. and Germany have become strained following allegations that the NSA tapped Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone.
Thomas Opperman, the lawmaker who heads the parliamentary group overseeing the intelligence service, said that if there is an opportunity to listen to Mr Snowden as a witness "without endangering him or destroying relations with the U.S. completely", it should be used.
Mr. Ströbele, a member of parliament for Germany's Green Party, posted a photo of himself with Mr Snowden on twitter.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Ströbele said the lawyer for the former NSA contractor said Mr Snowden could not return to Russia if he had left.
If Mr Snowden had testified in Germany, he would have needed assurances that he would be there "safe", the MP said.
Mr Snowden said in his letter that he faced a "harsh and ongoing" campaign of harassment that forced him to flee his home.
However, he said he was encouraged by the global reaction to "his political statements."
Citizens around the world, as well as high-ranking officials — including in the United States — have found exposing an uncontrolled system of pervasive surveillance beneficial to society.
The letter contains a proposal to cooperate with the German authorities "when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved."
Foreign workers on subclass 457 visas can be tested for "authenticity"
A test of "authenticity" for foreign workers on Class 457 visas is under consideration by the government as it outlines an expansion of repressive measures.
The test, if adopted, will be applied against criteria designed to prevent the use of 457 class visas to fill unqualified posts or as a loophole for the movement of family and friends to Australia.
The document, which was submitted by the government for discussion, was published today, while former Labour MP Maxine McCue criticised the government's rhetoric on foreign workers, saying it could offend Australia's neighbours.
"Loud statements like 'foreigners at the end of the line' and 'work first australians' represent a very unpleasant setback to the days when unions demanded a protected labour market," she told the Australia-India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that it was white labor that needed to be protected — and if some in the region saw echoes of this historical artifact, I wouldn't be surprised.
The discussion paper outlines 12 measures that were previously considered by former Immigration Secretary Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday where he meets with officials over people smuggling, has already made five of the recommended changes, with the rest under consideration.
If the criteria for "authenticity" are adopted, the visa applicant can be examined to determine "whether the candidacy is genuine in circumstances where the applicant is a relative or close acquaintance of the owner or a person related to the financing of the enterprise."
Businesses may also be required to report on the number of holders of subclass 457 visas, as businesses that previously intended to sponsor a small number of workers then hired hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker has died allegedly of a heart attack after arriving by boat with refugees on Christmas Island this week.
The man's heartbroken nine-year-old son accompanied him on his way to Australia, and since his father's death on Wednesday he has been supported by a cousin who has also been on board the ship.
Australian authorities hurriedly sent the man to a Christmas Island hospital, where he died.
Colorado head coach Patrick Rua, explaining the decision to release goaltender Semyon Varlamov from the first minutes in Friday's game against Dallas, expressed confidence that the recent night behind bars did not shake his confidence in the Russian, reports from Dallas sobkor "SE" Natalia Shmeleva.
And what can we expect," Rua said after the morning Lavigne rollout.
Of course, what happened worries us all, but we are confident in him and feel that it will be useful for him to go on the ice today.
We want him to go on the ice and show his usual level.
That is, you are completely sure that the situation did not affect the condition of the goalkeeper in any way?
We'll see today.
Undoubtedly, our players will support Varley by helping him to protect the goal, as it was in the previous matches of this season.
The main thing is that no one in the team is going to draw any conclusions until the court understands this situation.
Baumgertner nominated to Uralkali's Board of Directors
The current board of directors of Uralkali has proposed the candidacy of the general director Vladislav Baumgertner, arrested in Minsk, to the new composition of the board, according to the website of the Russian company.
Bamugertner was included in the list of 11 people nominated for the new board of directors.
This list was prepared for an extraordinary meeting of shareholders on November 29, at which the new composition of the board of directors will be determined by voting.
Baumgertner is currently under house arrest in Minsk.
When detained in August this year, he was charged with abuse of office.
However, later the President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko at a press conference said that the charges against Baumgertner were reclassified as "embezzlement".
The EU is preparing measures to support Ukraine in case of economic pressure from Russia
The European Union has a contingency plan to provide Ukraine with gas, as well as to reach an agreement with the IMF on an emergency loan if Russia takes any measures in response to the possible signing of an association agreement between the EU and Ukraine at the Vilnius summit.
A stand-by loan is being negotiated with the IMF, and another EU official directly involved in the talks added that their goal is to conclude an agreement in the near future.
At the same time, in addition to a potential loan from the IMF, Ukraine can receive 610 million euros from the European Union itself.
Analysts polled by Reuters doubt that Ukraine and the IMF can overcome long-standing differences over financing terms.
Does not believe in the possibility of reforms necessary to receive assistance, and the international rating agency S&P, which on Friday lowered The sovereign rating of Ukraine by one notch - to "B-" from "B".
However, EU officials say the IMF may show flexibility in terms of lending, taking into account the circumstances of Ukraine.
In addition to the country's financial support plan, the EU has a backup option to provide Ukraine with gas, the vast majority of which is now supplied from Russia.
Perhaps it will be gas from Nord Stream or reverse from Slovakia.
The latter, according to officials, is the most possible and acceptable way in the event that Russia "isolates" Ukraine.
Analysts believe that this method of reverse supply to Ukraine can only be used for a few weeks, and is likely to lead to a decrease in supplies to other regions.
"Negotiations are underway between EU countries and Ukrainians on how to create favorable conditions so that Ukraine can import gas from sources other than from Russia, or from the same source, but along other routes," the source added to Reuters.

In the US, it will be possible to use mobiles during takeoff and landing of the aircraft
New rules for the safe use of mobile devices during takeoff and landing of an airliner are approved in the United States, according to the BBC television corporation.
U.S. airlines are expected to allow passengers to use smartphones and tablets throughout the flight, with the new rules set to take effect by the end of 2013.
However, internet connectivity to receive and send emails will be prohibited during flights at altitudes below 3 kilometers.
Due to the danger of interference with aircraft radio equipment, cellular voice communication will continue to be banned.
Thus, passengers of flights will be allowed to read e-books, play games on tablets and other gadgets and watch videos during domestic and international flights.
Before the rules are adopted, airlines will be required to check the safety of using electronic devices during the flight.
In addition, airlines will have to convince the US Federal Aviation Administration that they will be able to cope with the alleged impact of mobile vehicles on aircraft and aircraft control devices.
According to the source, following the example of the United States, in Britain it is also possible to revise the current norms for the use of electronic devices in flight.
Shinnik who ran onto the field in the match
Some details have become known about the identity of the fan who ran onto the field during the match 1/16 of the final of the Russian Cup between Shinnik Yaroslavl and Spartak Moscow.
As stated by the head of the KDK RFU Artur Grigoryants, referring to the data of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, this fan is a Muscovite.
He is currently detained.
"In addition, Grigoryants spoke about how the fan managed to break through on the field: "It turned out that this, let's call him a spectator, went to the ambulance accompanied by two spectators, citing heart problems.
He went to the ambulance - this was confirmed to us by the ambulance doctor.
And then he pushed two attendants away and ran to the field.
He ran from the corner of the East and South Stands to the corner of the East and North Stands.
He ran across the field.
Stewards are responsible for this.
Until the law on sports comes into force, this is the area of action of stewards - the police cannot interfere with what is on the field.
He ran to the podium, climbed over the East Stand.
And at this time, riots began on the East Stand and on the treadmills," the head of the KDK said.
recall that by the decision of the KDK, Spartak Moscow will hold the upcoming matches of the 15th round of the Russian championship against Lokomotiv and Zenit without spectators, and will also pay a fine of 600 thousand rubles.

The President of the Russian Federation created a separate Ministry of Construction and Housing and Communal Services
Russian President Vladimir Putin created a new ministry in charge of construction and housing and communal services and offered to head it to the ex-governor of the Ivanovo region Mikhail Menu in the process of a personal meeting.
The President met with Mikhail Menem at the residence in Novo-Ogarevo, and Men did not refuse to head the new department.
Press Secretary of the President of Russia Dmitry Peskov explained that all functions related to construction and housing and communal services are transferred to the new ministry from the Ministry of Regional Development.

Americans eavesdropped on Japanese high-ranking officials
On Friday, November 1, one of the representatives of us intelligence agencies, who preferred not to disclose his name, said that the States eavesdropped on telephone conversations of high-ranking officials of Japan.
This person confirmed that in the land of the rising sun there are several points intended for listening.
At the same time, he noted that the United States, Great Britain, Australia, Canada, New Zealand do not conduct intelligence activities against each other.
According to him, this happened during the Second World War, when these countries were allies.
But Japan, like Germany, despite allied relations with the Americans in the postwar period, are targets for intelligence activities, NHK reported.
Officially, none of the parties has yet commented on this information.
Recall, news about the surveillance of US intelligence agencies for the German Chancellor appeared last week.
According to German journalists, the NSA may have been tapping Merkel's phone for the past ten years.
The Chancellor herself, according to some reports, took the news of her wiretapping very painfully.
She said that the allies, which, in her opinion, are Germany and the United States for decades, such surveillance of the head of government is unacceptable.
Meanwhile, Edward Snowden said he was ready to share details about the wiretapping of Angela Merkel's telephone conversations with employees of the German prosecutor's office.
The German specially flew to Moscow to meet with a former CIA officer.
Scandalous video got to the police
The head of Toronto Rob Ford, known for his scandalous and frankly reckless antics, was caught smoking crack.
Police in the Canadian city said they had video footage and were ready to launch an investigation into the mayor.
He said that he would not leave his post, reports CNN.
Information that the authorities have evidence of drug use by Rob Ford appeared on the website of the Toronto police.
The head of local law enforcement agencies, Bill Blair, held a press conference on this issue.
The sheriff said he was not authorized to share the footage with the public, but he vouched for their existence.
According to Blair, the video compromising Rob Ford was discovered during an anti-drug raid conducted by law enforcement officers in the summer of 2013.
Previously, the existence of this video has already been written by the Canadian press, but until recently there was no confirmation.
The mayor himself does not give any comments on this matter.
He only says that he is not guilty of anything and is not going to resign.
The videotape discovered by police is one of the pieces of evidence in the case of Ford's 35-year-old friend Alexander Lisi, who is accused of drug trafficking, extortion, obtaining illegal proceeds, as well as criminal conspiracy.
At times, Lisi served as Rob Ford's driver.
Residents of the city have long demanded the resignation of their mayor.
He repeatedly fought with journalists, appeared in public drunk, allowed himself racist and sexist statements.
Diana Arbenina celebrated Halloween with her children
Diana Arbenina does not hide what great pleasure she gets from raising her children.
Despite the fact that right now Arbenina especially devotes a lot of time to creativity and social activities, she still finds an opportunity to mess with Marta and Artem, and not only spends time teaching them, but also entertaining as much as she can.
Over the past week, Diana has twice reported to her fans about her teaching talents.
First, she posted a photo on Facebook showing how she teaches children to read.
And yesterday she pampered the fans by showing how she dressed Up Artem and Martha for Halloween.
We are ready for broom racing! our first halloween" - so called Diana a photo of her children dressed in festive costumes.
Which is not surprising, because they, like no other Russian boys and girls, are related to this holiday, because they were born in America.
An earthquake of magnitude 6.6 occurred on Thursday, October 31, near the city of Coquimbo in central Chile, reports Reuters.
The focus of the earthquake was in the ocean at a depth of 10.7 kilometers and at a distance of 54 kilometers southwest of the city, specified on the website of the US Geological Survey (USGS).
Tremors were recorded at 20:03 local time (3:03 November 1 Moscow time).
About the victims or about the destruction caused by tremors has not yet been reported.
Recall that Chile is located in one of the most seismically active areas of the Earth, so earthquakes of varying strength are not uncommon there.
One of the most serious occurred in 2010.
Then the earthquake of magnitude 8.8 and the tsunami caused by it led to the death of more than 550 people in Chile and the destruction of 220 thousand buildings.
In addition, the most powerful earthquake in recent history occurred in Chile: in 1960, a magnitude of 9.5 was recorded there.
As a result of that natural disaster, more than five thousand people died.
OJSC "Rostovaeroinvest" recognized the German company Assmann Beraten + Planen as the winner of the tender for the selection of the general designer of the facility.
The amount of the contract in Rostovaeroinvest is not disclosed.
According to the press service of the JSC, nine Russian and foreign companies participated in the competition, according to the terms of the tender, the project should be prepared and sent for state examination in the spring of 2014.
The winner will have to design a new passenger terminal of the airport, as well as infrastructure facilities, internal roads and elements of the improvement of the airport complex.
At the first stage of construction, the internal area of the terminal will be 50 thousand square meters. m, in the future it is possible to increase it.
According to Rostovaeroinvest, the project documentation will take into account the prospects for the development of the airport complex: by 2025, the terminal will be able to serve about 5 million passengers, and by 2035 - 6 million passengers.
By the time the results of the tender were summed up, the architectural concept of the Yuzhny airport complex was determined, which was developed by the British company Twelve Architects.
The project of the main terminal building embodies the idea of an air bridge between Rostov-on-Don and other cities of the world.
Assmann Beraten + Planen has experience in implementing major projects, the company designed terminals C and E of Sheremetyevo International Airport and a new airport complex at Knevichi International Airport in Vladivostok.
The Yuzhny International Airport Complex will be built in the Aksai district of the Rostov region and will replace the existing Rostov airport, which will be closed and in the future integrated into urban development.
The start of construction of the airport complex is scheduled for 2014, the commissioning of all facilities - for 2017.
Italian workers with experience give way to young people
Italian unemployment is breaking records.
Data released on Wednesday showed that 12.5% of the country's residents are now unemployed.
Things haven't been so bad since World War II.
Among the young, this figure is several times higher.
40.4% of residents between the ages of 15 and 24 are unemployed.
In the opinion of the Italian authorities, one of the solutions to this problem is the early retirement of older workers.
Such an experiment is already being conducted by the country's largest energy company, and the adopted laws allow regional authorities to provide part of the early pension for employees with seniority.
However, on the other hand, Italy is waiting for the common problem of an aging population for Europe.
And economists are not sure that the idea of premature rotation of personnel will justify itself.
Syria destroys chemical weapons equipment
Syria has destroyed all declared chemical weapons production facilities, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons has acknowledged.
Damascus completed this first phase of disarmament one day before the deadline.
Until November 1, Syria had to destroy production and other auxiliary facilities designed to prepare chemical warfare agents for use, reports the BBC.
The destruction of the stockpiles of toxic substances themselves or their chemical components should be completed by mid-2014.
According to the representative of the OPCW, currently toxic substances are in sealed storage facilities.
International inspectors went to Syria after more than 1400 people were killed in a chemical attack on the outskirts of Damascus on August 21, according to the United States.
The main task of the inspectors was not to waste time - to prevent the Syrian authorities from producing more chemical weapons - and to destroy the infrastructure for mixing chemicals and filling ammunition.
These production facilities will now be closely monitored to prevent them from being repaired.
The next milestone is mid-November: by this time, the OPCW and the Syrians must agree on a detailed plan for the destruction of existing stocks of toxic substances.
There are a lot of questions here.
Where will they be destroyed?
Who will provide the equipment for this?
All Syrian statements will be scrutinized by Western intelligence agencies.
They will readily advise inspectors on new sites to inspect if there are grounds to suspect that Damascus is not completely outspoken.
The U.S. believes the attack was carried out by regular troops.
Syria and Russia insist that this is the work of Syrian rebels.
The world community demanded from the Syrian leadership - in accordance with the agreement reached with the mediation of Russia - to destroy or render inoperable all capacities for the production of shells, poisonous gases and liquids and for filling shells with these substances.
Now that this stage has been passed, the next step should be the destruction of the chemical weapons already available to the Syrian army.
It is estimated that this arsenal may contain more than 1,000 tons of nerve agents, blister mustard gas and other banned chemicals stored in several dozen different locations.
To destroy it, it is necessary that the OPCW and the Syrian authorities first agree on a schedule of actions - two weeks are allotted for this.
THE OPCW's head of field operations, Jerry Smith, told the BBC that his inspectors "personally observed the destruction of the equipment".
"They no longer have the ability to further produce or mix chemical weapons," he said.
In a statement, the OPCW said inspectors visited 21 of the 23 sites in Syria and made sure that the factories for the production of shells and toxic substances were either destroyed or rendered unusable.
The remaining two facilities are too dangerous to inspect, the document says, but the equipment from there was transported and inspected by OPCW specialists.
According to Smith, the process of destroying the infrastructure for the production of chemical weapons was "especially difficult", as it had to work in the context of the ongoing conflict.
In early October, the OPCW received the Nobel Peace Prize, however, according to Smith, the inspectors did not yet have time to celebrate this - they were too busy with work.
George Kerevan: Breaking with Europe gives Scots a choice
Another day, another horror story about independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland will have to join the Pan-European Free Movement Area as a condition of EU membership.
It is the turn of stories about passport control in Bervik and the barbed wire border along Adrian's Wall.
True, the Strathclyde newspaper pointed to the possible economic benefits of freer movement in the rest of Europe, although – predictably – it did not make headlines.
Nor has anyone pointed out that EU member states spend a lot of time turning their formal rules in a way that suits them.
Since Scotland is not now part of the Schengen Area, continued non-compliance would be a cheap concession for Brussels to replace what it really wanted from the Scots.
So it's not a noteworthy story.
And so old that it has turned into a fossil: I first heard the "duck" that "independence means passport control" at least 40 years ago.
And yet there is an interesting point lost in the retelling of an old tale.
Why should an independent Scotland follow the orders of Europe at all?
Why swap London's yoke for brussels' yoke, especially now?
Here's the real European news: The great postwar plan to unite Europe has finally stalled.
With the euro crisis, the "Europe" project is officially dead.
Across the European Union, parties opposed to the EU or to abolish the euro as a single currency are gaining ground.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany party – founded only this year – came out of nowhere and won nearly five million votes in September's federal elections, effectively displacing the Free Democrats (the equivalent of our Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been internal opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
Nevertheless, the current economic crisis has become a turning point.
The austerity measures imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, and the shackles imposed on national economies through the preservation of the single currency, have led many people to believe that the "Europe" project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments operating with excessive budget deficits – this was only true for Greece.
In fact, the Eurosystem has locked its members in exchange rates favorable to German exporters , which German politicians want to preserve.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the national currency, southern Europe is at a pre-disadvantage in terms of production capabilities compared to Germany.
The only saving grace is to cut salaries and government spending, which is actively supported by Berlin.
Behind the current budget and currency problems is a deeper problem of Europe's productive capacity.
As a result of a set of green energy measures introduced by Brussels – a cipher meaning subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of the consumer – European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times more for gas than in the United States.
These are paralyzingly unfavorable price conditions, as we have seen in Grangemouth.
No amount of global wage freezes will stop the crushing victory of cheap U.S. shale gas over the European petrochemical industry.
As a result, a revolt is brewing, especially in France, once the EU's most ardent supporter.
After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a way to control Germany and put Paris on a par with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a means of gaining political legitimacy, and has already imposed its own economic policies on Europe, leaving France's shattered economy in distress.
The result is marine Le Pen's right-wing, anti-EU National Front party that has just won a decisive by-election, dropping the ruling Socialist party to third place.
The Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote – a timely warning to British Labour that it cannot be assumed that a split on the right would automatically affect the left.
What is Le Pen doing with his newfound popularity among the French white working class?
She wants to use next year's EU elections to create a bloc in the European Parliament against the EU and against the single currency.
If – and this is very likely – anti-EU parties gain support in these elections, such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament for the first time.
Here's my opinion: soon the growing sentiment against the EU and against the single currency in Europe will merge to destroy the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will once again become something of a vague "Europe of (sovereign) nations" that General de Gaulle liked.
Germany and a few dependent economies may retain the euro, but France and southern Europe will recover their own currencies.
My guess is that the UK is distancing itself from this project, hoping to get closer to the US.
Nevertheless, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific Ocean indicates the likelihood that the UK will be left unattended in the cold Atlantic.
Where does this leave Scotland?
We can choose to become a region of (essentially) Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which means, among other things, sending Berlin and Brussels to hell.
I suspect scotland will be able to succeed under a freer European arrangement, provided we keep our currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries will be easier in a non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider replicating Norway's experience and preserving our economic independence.
The Scottish National Party government in Scotland is – ironically – the most successful anti-austerity political movement in Europe, winning a landslide majority in 2011 thanks to objections to spending cuts proposed (and implemented) by Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling and the subsequent Coalition of the Tories and Liberal Democrats.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland now to vote for independence just to adopt the austerity measures imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Australian woman appeals against prison sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney, sentenced to 15 days in prison on the island of Phuket for falsely claiming that she was attacked by a taxi driver, appealed against the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty on June 15 by the Phuket Provincial Court of filing a false claim following a report by Thai police that a local taxi driver carried out the attack on the night of Sunday, June 10, while two other men held her.
However, CCTV footage later revealed that she had safely returned to her hotel after breaking up with her Australian boyfriend.
Phuket police questioned Bamford for two days before she admitted to fabricating the story.
Prior to her trial, she was held in local police cells.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence at a general-security detention centre on the outskirts of Phuket, not at an adult women's prison.
She is the daughter of former Australian League player Peter Tanks, who approached the Foreign Office in Canberra for help for his daughter.
Tanks told the Sydney Sunday Telegraph that the entire family was "extremely concerned" about their daughter's well-being and looked forward to her return to Australia.
"Obviously it was an anxious time, but we hope she gets home safely as soon as possible," Tanks said.
Bamford appealed her conviction and was released on bail of 50,000 baht.
According to reports in Australia, she is currently spending her holidays in the resort area of Krabi in southern Thailand.
Thailand-based legal sources said Bamford is currently representing a local lawyer in Phuket, but warned that an appeal could lead to a court increase in her sentence by up to two years and force her to serve time in an adult prison.
However, following the recent murder of Australian travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also be looking to restore its shattered tourist image, leading to an acquittal.

Belarus and Turkey are interested in developing and deepening relations in all spheres and areas.
This was stated to journalists by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Belarus Vladimir Makei at a press conference following a meeting with Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, BelTA reports.
We are very pleased that our Turkish colleagues and partners at all levels are interested in developing and deepening Belarusian-Turkish relations in all spheres and regions.
Belarus, for its part, is also interested in this, so we agreed that the state administration bodies of the two countries will provide widespread assistance and support to entrepreneurs who establish direct trade and economic contacts between themselves," Vladimir Makei said.
He stressed that the Government of Belarus will create all the necessary conditions for this and provide maximum assistance.
The minister also said that the 8th regular meeting of the Belarusian-Turkish joint intergovernmental economic commission was held in Ankara, following which a protocol was signed.
The parties have developed a roadmap for Belarusian-Turkish cooperation, which, according to the head of the Belarusian Foreign Ministry, is aimed at deepening bilateral cooperation in trade, economic and investment fields, in the fields of industrial cooperation, transport, agriculture, energy, as well as at finding new forms and directions of interaction.
"The minutes of the last meeting have been fully implemented, and I am convinced that the current protocol will also be implemented, because Belarus and Turkey consider each other as reliable partners," he said.
Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, in turn, said that at the talks, the foreign ministers of the two countries decided to further develop mutually beneficial cooperation and implement various projects.
According to the minister, the trade turnover between Belarus and Turkey should be increased and brought to the figure of $1 billion.
Turkey is also an important partner in the field of investment cooperation, which needs to be developed further, since there is an untapped potential in this area, he said.
There have always been very warm relations between our countries, and we hope that in the future they will be further strengthened and expanded.
And also all the necessary conditions will be created for trade and economic relations and for the successful operation of Turkish companies in Belarus and Belarusian enterprises and organizations in Turkey," Ahmet Davutoglu said.

On October 31, Barnaul policemen revealed two gaming halls.
The first worked in the Industrial District on Vzletnaya Street.
At the time of the inspection, the institution was playing a game.
The club counted 24 assault rifles.
Another gaming club was found in the Leninsky district on Anton Petrov Street.
20 slot machines were used here.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia in Barnaul reports that administrative materials have been compiled under the article "Illegal organization and conduct of gambling".
The equipment was seized.
In the near future, materials on these facts will be sent to the courts of the Industrial and Leninsky districts of the city.
Driving schools will be able to conduct exams for obtaining a driver's license
Exams for a driver's license will be able to take private companies that have their own computerized circuit.
This is written by "Kommersant" with reference to the draft government resolution "On admission to driving vehicles".
According to the newspaper, currently in Russia there are only about 30 such circuits.
It is assumed that students of such "privileged" driving schools will be credited with the results of internal testing.
At the same time, the State Motor Vehicle Inspectorate will monitor the passing of exams every six months.
If it turns out that more than 30% of the theory exams and more than 20% of the site students do not pass the first time, such a school will be deprived of privileges for six months.
The technical requirements for the circuits contained in the draft government resolution come into force on November 5, 2014.
The project also contains requirements for learning to drive two-wheeled vehicles.
From 1 January 2015, motorcycle owners will have to take an examination in urban traffic to obtain a Category A licence.
In addition, from May 5, 2014, companies will not be able to hire foreign drivers with foreign licenses.
Such workers will have to obtain Russian rights after passing the exam.
Early puberty: aging earlier
African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white peers, research shows.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is close.
No Evidence That Hormones or Other Chemicals Are To Blame
Experts believe that the obesity epidemic may be one of the triggers of early puberty
The tendency towards early puberty is not as pronounced in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in children's health and family issues.
Should a mother be frightened if her daughter begins to form the rudiments of the mammary gland and grow pubic hair at the age of 7 or 8?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplovitz explained that these early physical changes are quite common among American girls and represent the new normal.
"I spend a lot of time reassuring parents — that doesn't usually mean the rapid onset of full puberty," Kaplovitz said.
Obvious signs of development, such as growing breasts, pubic and axillary hair, and body odor, appear earlier in girls.
But there has been only a slight shift in the age of menarche (first menstruation) over the past four decades.
In the United States, the median age is 12.5 years, down from 12.75 in 1970.
"Once breasts begin to develop, it takes at least two to three years before menarche," said Kaplowitz, who is also the author of Early Puberty in Girls: How to Deal with This Common Problem.
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty will progress.
There is debate about what constitutes the actual onset of puberty, but is considered "premature" when breast augmentation is accompanied by a sharp increase in growth before age 8.
In most cases, the process will slow down or stop – this is something that the pediatrician can monitor closely.
Faster progression can serve as a basis for tests with an endocrinologist to rule out serious problems, such as tumors or cysts.
There are procedures to delay early menstruation and prevent another consequence: premature aging of bones, which can eventually lead to stunted growth and low growth in adulthood.
Recommendations for drug or hormone therapy are based on the child's age, level of development, growth rate, and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplovitz is cautious about medications, but admits that "suppressing puberty can alleviate behavioral problems and girls' feelings that they are different from their peers."
The other big problem is understandable: parents just don't want their very young daughters to menstruate.
"They worry about the risk of pregnancy or even how they'll deal with hygiene issues," Kaplovitz said.
"It was a shock," recalls one woman whose daughter began menstruating at 10.
Although there were signs and we talked about menstruation, she wasn't emotionally ready.
She came home from school scared and upset that she was the first among her friends.
There are many publicized theories about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no consistent evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or sexual messages in the media are to blame.
In boys – as in girls – puberty occurs earlier.
Kaplovitz argues that the premise that carries the most weight is the obesity epidemic.
In 2001, he helped conduct a study of girls between 6 and 9 years of age that links the amount of body fat to the timing of puberty.
Other evidence supports this finding, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, African-American and Latino girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white peers.
There are various explanations.
Around the world, early puberty appears to be influenced by everything from economic conditions and climate to genes.
Another mystery: although boys have facial and pubic hair at a younger age, the tendency to complete early puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other physicians participating in the AAP conference confirmed the complexity of this topic.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair occurs even in infants and toddlers.
"We have to be careful about how we determine the true onset of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Gorieb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to receive instructions from a pediatrician on how to talk to their child.
"This could mean an earlier-than-expected conversation," Kaplovitz explained.
If you remain calm, your child will usually react well.
Girls who blossom early need confirmation that even when it happens early, the process is a normal part of life.
The head of Dagestan hears notes of extremism in the anthem of Kuban
The football match between Anzhi and Kuban resulted in a political conflict between the authorities of the Krasnodar Territory and Dagestan after fans burned the Dagestan flag, and the anthem of Kuban sounded differently.
The head of Dagestan, Ramazan Abdulatipov, on Thursday invited republican parliamentarians to go to court, because the anthem of the Krasnodar Territory allegedly gives calls for interethnic discord, in particular, calls for war with the "Basurmans".
Take the anthem of the Krasnodar Territory, this anthem was approved in our time in 1995.
It's a shame, and no one is doing it.
"You are remembered here as a native mother, on the enemy, on the Basurmanin we go to the mortal battle" - why write such words in the anthem, poison some believers against other believers, "the chairman of the parliament Khizri Shikhsaidov expressed solidarity with Abdulatipov.
RBS suspends two currency traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders in its foreign exchange division, according to two people familiar with the situation, further confirming that global regulatory scrutiny of alleged manipulation of the foreign exchange market is rapidly gaining momentum.
Some of the world's biggest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with regulators in investigations related to the world's largest financial market, which has a daily turnover of $5.3 trillion.
The two traders will be the first RBS employees to be suspended in the unfolding investigation, which echoes the scandal surrounding the manipulation of the LIBOR interbank rate.
Declining to comment on the suspensions, the bank confirmed that it had received requests for information from regulators this month.
"Our ongoing investigation into this matter is ongoing and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and our other regulators," the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, people familiar with the matter said RBS had handed over email and instant messaging records that his former trader had received and sent to the UK's regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).
This trader, Richard Usher, retired from RBS in 2010 and is known to have been granted a leave of absence in his current position as head of European spot currency trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trading at Citi, went on vacation this week, while Matt Gardiner, a former senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended as Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have been charged with any wrongdoing.
Mr Usher's instant messaging contact group included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, according to those with knowledge.
UBS said this week it had taken action against some of its employees after Swiss regulator Finma said it was investigating alleged manipulation of the foreign exchange market at a number of Swiss banks.
At least six regulators around the world — the European Commission, Finma, Switzerland's antitrust authority Weko, the FCA, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority — are looking into allegations that bankers colluded to influence the foreign exchange market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal reviews or received requests for information from regulators, those familiar with the matter said.
Banks have been looking at instant messages and emails for years in search of cases of wrongdoing.
News of the inspections has roiled traders in what has been one of the largest sources of revenue for investment bank trading units in recent years, but has faced difficulties this year as low currency volatility reduces opportunities for resellers.
Some bankers have tried to downplay the gravity of the situation by saying that a vast and highly liquid currency market is nearly impossible to manipulate, but senior traders say this is not always true.
According to the senior trader, despite the huge volume of daily trading in the foreign exchange market, the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and the increased use by banks of their internal platforms means that "you can start to influence the market for a very small price."
The news came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced that it had fired one of the traders in its stock trading department on the London Stock Exchange this week after he caused a loss of nearly $6 million late last year.
The Bank has immediately notified the relevant authorities and is cooperating with its regulators.
"We are confident that the trader acted alone and that this issue was contained," Credit Suisse said.
Supreme Court Upholds Obama's Health Care Act
The U.S. Supreme Court today ruled that Barack Obama's landmark health care law is constitutional, a major victory for the Obama administration.
Voting 5 to 4, the justices ruled that separate orders under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, requiring citizens to purchase health insurance before 2014 or pay a fine, are constitutional under the government's tax powers.
Chief Justice John Roberts sided with four of the more liberal members of the court, while Justices Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy opposed it.
The court also upheld the remaining sections of this 2700-page law and further ruled that the health law's requirement that states increase compliance with Medicaid requirements or they would lose all federal Medicaid funding was not unconstitutionally coercive.
A lawsuit to block the bill was filed by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law was strongly opposed by each of the major Republican presidential candidates during the 2012 primary season, including presumptive candidate Mitt Romney.

This action of nationalists has been held every year on the Day of National Unity since 2005.
To the question of sociologists "Have you heard that on November 4 in Russia "Russian marches" are held under the slogans of protecting the rights of Russians in Russia?" three-quarters (75%) of citizens answered in the negative.
Now only every fifth Russian (20%) knows about this action.
It is noteworthy that in December 2010, almost a third of citizens (31%) heard about the "Russian Marches".
Recall that three years ago on December 11, a spontaneous rally of nationalists was held on Manege Square, which turned into mass riots.
The Levada Center also asked Russians about what holiday is celebrated on November 4.
In two years, the number of those who know the right answer (National Unity Day) has increased from 41% to 49%.
However, only 15% of citizens are going to celebrate this holiday.

Former CIA officer Edward Snowden expresses his readiness to come to Germany as soon as he has the legal opportunity to do so, and meet with representatives of the German authorities, RIA Novosti reports.
The letter of the former CIA officer to the German authorities at a meeting with journalists in Berlin on Friday was presented by Bundestag deputy Hans-Christian Strebele, through whom Snowden conveyed a message to the German authorities.
Strebele met with Snowden the day before in Moscow.
Today, what is important for the population is not the number of available medical institutions and their status, but the quality of medical care provided.
The implementation of the program "Modernization of health care of the Tula region for 2011 - 2013", the reorganization of medical institutions of our city will create an optimal structure for the provision of medical care to the population, including gynecological patients, pregnant women and women in labor.
So, after the merger with the city hospital, there was an even greater opportunity to attract narrow specialists from the State Budgetary Institution "NGKB" for consultations of pregnant women with various pathologies, to conduct additional examinations on the basis of the hospital.
During the implementation of the modernization program, the material and technical base of the maternity hospital was significantly improved, modern equipment that meets world standards appeared.
Over the years, about 8 million rubles have been allocated for the overhaul of premises, 112 units of equipment worth 42 million rubles have been purchased.
The most modern equipment is equipped with an intensive post for newborns.
In the operating room, during a cesarean section, the Cell-Saver apparatus is used, which allows you to collect blood from the operating wound and, after special treatment, return it to the woman in labor, avoiding transfusion of foreign blood.
The Department of Clinical and Laboratory Diagnostics is also equipped with modern equipment.
In the antenatal clinic there is an electronic registry, in the near future it is planned to introduce electronic records and medical records of patients.
Thanks to the development of telemedicine, it became possible to consult gynecological patients, pregnant women, women in labor and newborns with regional specialists.

The leader of the gang was a 27-year-old previously convicted native of Chechnya.
Venezuela will set the exchange rate for tourists
Venezuela will introduce a special exchange rate of its national currency - the bolivar - against the dollar for tourists.
This was reported on November 1 by Bloomberg, citing a government decree.
Foreign travelers will be allowed to exchange amounts equivalent to ten thousand US dollars per year.
Venezuela will also allow tourists to sell up to 25 percent of the bolivars purchased in the country at the time of departure.
The specific exchange rate of the bolivar against the dollar will be set at a later date.
In February, Caracas was forced to devalue the local currency to 6.3 bolivars per dollar.
However, on the black market, one dollar is valued at 57 bolivars.
Since the beginning of the year, the bolivar has lost almost 70 percent of its value.
In September, inflation in Venezuela was almost 50 percent.
Oil Minister and Vice President for The Economy Rafael Ramirez said on October 18 that Venezuela has no plans to devalue the bolivar.
According to unofficial information cited by the agency, Caracas may still decide to depreciate the national currency after the municipal elections in December.
The policy of restraining prices for products and consumer goods, as well as a high degree of overregulation of the Venezuelan economy, led to a shortage of a number of goods and the functioning of the black foreign exchange market.
In the spring of this year, the media wrote that there was a shortage of toilet paper in Venezuela.
John Kerry says in his unprecedented admission that U.S. espionage has "gone unduely far."
John Kerry has demonstrated a softening of the tactics of protecting U.S. surveillance programs, making an unprecedented admission that in some cases U.S. espionage has "gone unduely far."
The secretary of state also admitted that he was guilty, along with Barack Obama, of being "on autopilot" during the appearance of Edward Snowden's high-profile revelations about NSA espionage activities.
These leaks have put the U.S. government at the center of a diplomatic row with its allies.
Speaking via video link at an open government conference in London, Mr Kerry said: "There is no doubt that the president and I, as well as other members of the government, actually took some of the things happening on autopilot, because such a possibility already existed – both during the Second World War, and in the very difficult years of the Cold War, and, of course, on September 11."
He then became the first senior member of the U.S. government to admit that U.S. espionage had gone too far, but stressed that no one's rights had been violated.
He said: "In some cases it has gone too far.
And the president is determined to shed light on this issue and explain himself to the people, and is now conducting a thorough analysis so that no one has a sense of abuse.
I assure you, there is no abuse of innocent people in this process."
Mr. Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA had acted with good intentions and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He added: "We are working in a new world where people are willing to blow themselves up.
There is radical extremism in the world, reckless and determined to kill people, blow people up and attack governments.
And if you were able to intercept it, stop it before it happens?
We actually prevented plane crashes, building explosions and people being killed because we were able to know about these plans in advance."
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers will head to Europe to help resolve issues related to alleged U.S. espionage abroad and convince Europeans of the need to continue joint counterterrorism activities with the U.S., the chairman of the Senate subcommittee on European affairs said Thursday.
Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy said he spoke to members of the European Parliament and others this week and is concerned about their threats to stop their involvement in anti-terror organizations due to frustration over the National Security Agency's surveillance.
"It's really important to U.S. national security interests that Europeans remain our supporters of our overall counterterrorism efforts," Murphy, a Democrat in office in his first term and chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs, said in an interview from Washington.
"And I'm going to Europe to let them know that we must continue to cooperate on counterterrorism despite their anger at these NSA programs."
News that the NSA had collected millions of phone records in Europe worsened relations with some U.S. allies, though the agency's chief said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected a misunderstanding of the metadata that NATO allies collected and shared with the U.S.
Other revelations cited documents released by Snowden showing that the NSA monitored the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, as well as the phones of some 34 other world leaders.
Director of National Intelligence James Clapper defended espionage against allies as necessary and said it was common on both sides.
Amid the hype, Murphy said his office is organizing a trip by members of Congress, which is expected to take place this year, and that he hopes the delegation will include members of both parties and both chambers.
The names of other participating lawmakers are due to be announced in the coming days.
According to him, the program of the trip is still under development.
While Murphy said the purpose of the trip is to promote better relations, he said some degree of "well-meaning rigidity" would also be shown.
He said European leaders should be honest with their people about what spyware they themselves had used for years.
"While we can change our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, they also have to accept the fact that we are not the only ones engaged in intelligence activities," Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry is due to head to the Middle East and Poland this weekend to address the hostility to U.S. strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as U.S. intelligence activities.
In the U.S., a school principal shot at teenagers.
The directors of one of the American high schools teenagers literally drove to despair.
The man, he said, was forced to take a gun and start shooting.
The incident occurred in Tennessee.
According to the New York Post, juvenile hooligans threw toilet paper at the man's house.
Because of this, the school principal opened fire on the teenagers, as a result of which a 15-year-old boy received several wounds in the leg and arm.
Since the hooligans were not in the territory of the director's property, he was charged with aggravated assault.
The man was released from prison on bail of $ 125 thousand.
Note, shooting at civilians in the United States is becoming a terrible pattern.
Just the day before, a man opened fire in the center of the city of Ridgecrest in the US state of California right on passers-by on the street.
After that, the criminal took hostage two random passers-by, hid them in the trunk of the car and tried to escape.
Earlier, a shooting was opened at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut.
Adam's mother worked at the school, she was an educator.
Shooting in an American school: 14-year-old girl was injured
Another shooting incident occurred on January 31 at an American school, this time in Anlanta (Georgia).
Two people were injured: a 14-year-old student and a teacher.
Chinese newspaper that published the appeal "is subject to reorganization"
A Chinese newspaper that published a front-page call for the release of a reporter accused of defamation should be reorganized, the press regulator said.
The Guangzhou-based New Express newspaper issued a surprise public statement requesting the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he had taken bribes for writing false articles about a company with a state share of ownership.
Now the "New Express" must go through a "process of complete error correction," as reported by the regulator.
The order to "correct mistakes" came from the Guangdong Administration in the field of press and publications, radio, film and television.
A preliminary investigation revealed that the Yangcheng Evening News Group-owned newspaper Novy Express published several false reports about the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
"The leadership of the editorial office of the "New Express" was disoriented," the regulator said in a statement.
He reports that it was decided to "impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou in the form of a revocation of his reporter's license."
He also "instructed Yangcheng Evening News Group to carry out a complete correction of the errors in the New Express and recommended that it investigate the responsible persons of the newspaper related to the situation and immediately make changes to the management of the New Express."
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for the New Express in which he alleged financial irregularities at a construction equipment company called Zoomlion.
After he was detained, his newspaper published two front-page calls for his release, stating that it supported his journalistic activities.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on state television admitting that he had published false articles for money.
"In this case, I hurt Zoomlion, as well as the entire news media industry and its ability to earn the public's trust," he told state broadcaster CCTV.
I did this mainly because I craved money and fame.
I realized my guilt.
Following Mr Chen's confessions, the New Express published an apology on the front page, saying the newspaper had failed to properly verify his reporting.
Recently, several high-ranking suspects made confessions on television.
Experts say the practice of extorting confessions in China is still ubiquitous, despite recently passed amendments to laws prohibiting authorities from forcing anyone to self-incriminate.
Due to the rampage of evil spirits, several schools and a hospital had to be closed.
Four schools in Zimbabwe's South Matabeleland province had to close due to the fact that students were attacked ... Goblins.
According to a local elder, the children panicked and it was impossible to continue classes.
The story of goblins may sound like a child's invention for a European, but in Africa this is quite a serious argument for closing the school.
Adults are also afraid of evil spirits.
In the summer, for example, in Zimbabwe, a hospital was closed due to the fact that medical staff were also attacked by goblins.
Fire crews were called in to rescue a lost puppy that was stuck 50 feet above the ground on a dangerous ledge in a quarry.
Cocker Spaniel Ruby ran away after she got into a small accident
Three days later, she, stuck in a quarry, was noticed by a man walking a dog.
Firefighters descended on a rope along a steep slope to save the dog from imminent death.
The puppy was lucky enough to escape after fire crews were called to pick him up and take him to safety, after he was somehow stuck at 50 feet on a dangerous ledge of a steep slope.
Nine-month-old cocker spaniel Ruby ran away after being involved in a car accident on Sunday afternoon, and spent three days alone before being rescued from a quarry on Wednesday.
Her owners, 25-year-old Scott Alderson and his 20-year-old girlfriend Becky Hall, were at The Gappit Quarry in Denholm, West Yorkshire, to reunite with Ruby, and thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They frantically searched for their missing dog and posted appeals on social media sites after it ran away to the quarry after a small accident.
At about 2:15 p.m. wednesday, a keen dog breeder spotted Ruby stuck at 50 feet on a ledge in a quarry.
A technical rescue squad from the Kleckheton Fire Station hurried to the scene, went down on ropes to rescue Ruby, and used a carrier to lift her up the hill.
Rescue Squad specialist officer Andy Clayton said: "She was in a precarious position. "
She was right in the middle of a steep slope — 50 feet to the top and to the ground.
She didn't move a muscle during the rescue, she froze completely.
But she's fine now.
Then she ate cookies.
It was a very unusual challenge.
The fact that the dog was spotted is incredible.
Rescue Squad specialist officer Peter Lau said: "Ruby was very lucky to have been rescued. "
There was a possibility that she could have suffered a very serious injury or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for an examination and it was determined that she was fine except for exhaustion and dehydration.
Ms Hall, from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "Watching the rescue was terrifying. "
I couldn't believe she was even there.
It was amazing when she was in our hands again.
The vet said that if she had become exhausted and passed out, she would most likely have fallen.
The firefighters were great.
It was very bold — what they did.
We are so grateful and each of them was absolutely amazing.
Mr Alderson from Kitley added: "We were afraid she might fall, but she stayed there. "
The firefighters were amazing.
I just can't believe she was there.
Do you think travel agents are a thing of the past thanks to the Internet?
At Flight Centre, the trend seems to be reversed.
The company has updated its full-year earnings forecast and expects record revenues from holidaymakers in Australia and the UK.
The travel firm now expects its core full annual profit before tax to be between $325 million and $340 million, down from a previous forecast of $305 million to $315 million.
If the current targets are met, this will be a 12-17 percent increase compared to the record profit of $ 290.4 million received in 2011/2012.
Managing Director Graham Turner said the Flight Centre firm made 8 percent of its profit in the first half and started the second half of the year with good performance, particularly for non-business trips in Australia and the UK.
"Since the beginning of the year, we have been operating at a profit for our 10 countries, and for some of them for the full year, record high profits before interest and tax contributions are expected," he said.
"This includes Australia and the UK, which usually bring us the biggest profits."
In Australia, leisure business recovered in the second half of the year, offsetting a slightly weaker domestic market for corporate travel.
Similarly, in the UK, Flight Centre's leisure business was doing well, while corporate clients were spending less.
Its U.S. business offset losses incurred during the seasonally weak first half of the year and is expected to make a profit for the third full year in a row.
Yesterday, Flight Centre shares rose 3 cents to $38.20.
The website of the Ministry of Defense of Estonia was restored after the attack of Ukrainian hackers
The work of the website of the Ministry of Defense of Estonia was restored after the morning cyber attack, the press service of the department reports.
According to the Vice-Chancellor of the Ministry of Defense for Information and Administrative Affairs Taimar Peterkop, it was a primitive attack, the site was simply overloaded with a large number of requests.
Our specialists quickly adjusted everything, by now the work of the site has been restored.
"The damage done to the ministry is minimal," Peterkop told Postimees.
According to Peterkop, it is too early to say who organized the attacks.
"We will definitely analyze the causes of the incident and draw our own conclusions from this, but it is completely impossible to prevent such incidents," he admitted.
On November 1, the Anonymous Ukraine group posted an appeal on the network in which it confirmed the hacker attack on the website of the Ministry of Defense of Estonia and opposed the partnership between Ukraine and NATO.
We want the NATO leadership to hear our voice, the voice of the Ukrainian people.
We should not be servants of NATO.
Ukrainians do not want to die for the interests of NATO member countries.
Ukraine does not need NATO.
Ukraine does not need the European Union.
Neither does Ukraine need Russia.
Ukraine should not be anyone's slave.
We stand for an independent Ukraine.
"Hands off Ukraine," Anonymous said in a statement.
Earlier, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine reported that a company of marines of the Feodosia separate battalion of the Ukrainian marine corps will take part in the command and staff exercises of the NATO response forces Steadfast Jazz-2013.

Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty between the two countries.
"We would like to frankly exchange views on the further development of the political dialogue, discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty," Kishida said at the meeting.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Japan recalled that after Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe visited Russia, relations between the countries became warmer and acquired a bilateral character.
The Russian minister, in turn, noted that the Russian Federation will meet Japan halfway in solving complex political issues, writes RIA Novosti.
The conclusion of a peace treaty between Japan and Russia implies the resolution of the issue of the disputed Northern Territories.
In this regard, protests are taking place in Tokyo today demanding the return of the lands lost after the Second World War to the country.
Cars drive around the Japanese capital, from which the loudspeaker hears: "Return the northern territories!".
The police do not stop the protesters, they make sure that the noise level is not exceeded.
Halloween 2013 in numbers
When I was little, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, stay up late and have a masquerade for our neighborhood.
Now I look more like a miser.
I haven't volunteered in the last two years to hand out candy in my apartment, and I probably won't this year either.
However, statistics show that I am a black sheep when it comes to Halloween.
According to the National Retail Federation, most Americans — namely 158 million — will celebrate Halloween this year and spend a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes and jewelry.
The only thing I look forward to every Halloween is the trends.
The National Retail Federation predicts that the suits will cost $1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion spent.
This year at the peak of fashion are sexy inanimate objects.
Women no longer have to be sexually active; they can also be sexy foods, such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As for men, I think we're going to see a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I'm sure Daft Punk-style astronauts will make it into our Instagram feeds this year.
According to Google, the costumes that are searched for most often are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
Perhaps there is nothing wrong with the traditional approach.
We dressed up our dogs last year and to my surprise, we weren't the only ones.
What's more, according to the National Retail Federation, Americans will spend $330 million on pet suits this year.
That means a lot of funny hotdog dogs.
When it comes to candy, we don't mince words.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion on them this year, according to Nielsen.
That's about 600 million pounds of Hershey chocolates, lollipops, Milk Duds candies, Twizzlers gummies and Clark Bar bars.
According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, this is great news for the 41 million candy-demanding children who are preparing to conquer our neighborhoods.
What's more, we'll buy and — let's not kid ourselves — eat 90 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.
The only thing we don't want to eat is candy in the form of corn grains; and yet, according to the National Confectioners Association, almost £35 million of them are sold on Halloween.
That's about 9 billion individual corn kernels.
It's a mystery I've yet to solve.
Nothing expresses the essence of Halloween like haunted houses.
They have terrific titles, like "The Horror Behind the Walls" (which, by the way, is in a real prison), "Howl and Scream" and "House of Shock."
What's more, according to America Haunts, there are 1200 officially recognized haunted houses in America, generating about $ 500 million in revenue, as well as those stunning photos where you almost described, which your friend posted on Facebook, and you can't clean, and then the guy you like sees this photo and leaves a comment like "cool facial expression".
And finally, let's talk about pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to the Great Pumpkin when we were kids, and carving Jack's lamp is like decorating a Christmas tree, something we've been doing since we were kids.
Luckily for us, the baby pumpkin fashion only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up carving those pumpkins rather than sitting in them.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins this year.
The Jack Lamp slowly drying on your porch likely came from Illinois, which has grown 542 million pounds of pumpkin this year.
If you want more challenging assignments, visit Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and try cutting something out of their 2,032-pound pumpkin.
Bayern Munich defender David Alaba became the best athlete in Austria in 2013, according to the official website of the Bundesliga.
In this dispute, he was ahead of the representatives of winter sports, which traditionally become the best in the country.
The second place was taken by alpine skier Marcel Hirscher, and the third - ski jumper Gregor Schlierenzauer.
Last season, the 21-year-old Austrian of Filipino-Nigerian descent helped his team win the Champions League, championship and German Cup, as well as the UEFA Super Cup.
In Kineshma and the district, two men committed suicide
Earlier, one of the hanged had already made a suicide attempt.
On October 30, at about 1:00 a.m., in the village of Lugovoye at his place of residence, a man born in 1947 committed suicide by hanging.
It is known that he has previously made suicide attempts.
What prompted the man to take such a step is unknown.
On October 31, at 11:50, a 41-year-old man, a resident of Kineshma, committed suicide by hanging at his place of residence.
No signs of violent death were found, the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs "Kineshemsky" reports.
Mick Jagger says he didn't flirt with Katy Perry when she was 18.
During an interview on an Australian radio show this week, the pop star stated that she was the backing vocalist for Jagger's 2004 song "Old habits die hard".
Perry said she had dinner with a veteran rocker and noted, "He flirted with me when I was 18."
She added: "It was a very long time ago and he was very kind."
In a statement Thursday, a spokesman for seventy-year-old Jagger said he "vehemently denies that he ever hit Katy Perry."
The spokesperson added: "Maybe she's confusing him with someone else."
Perry was among the artists who appeared as guests on this year's Rolling Stones tour.
Her new album Prism debuted at number one this week.
A U.S.-Mexico drug smuggling tunnel has been discovered, equipped with its own railroad
One of the most difficult tunnels for drug smuggling between the United States and Mexico has been found, equipped with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail systems.
U.S. authorities have described the four-by-three-foot-wide tunnel as one of the most complex secret passages they have ever discovered.
This tunnel, whose zigzags are the length of almost six football fields, connects warehouses near the city of Tijuana (Mexico) and San Diego (USA).
The area is filled with inconspicuous warehouses, making it easier to stealthily load drugs into trucks.
The tunnel was closed before any drugs were smuggled through unnoticed, authorities said.
According to court documents, law enforcement confiscated eight and a half tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine when the tunnel was discovered.
Three men, who, according to law enforcement, worked as drivers, were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine for the purpose of distribution.
If convicted, they face prison terms ranging from 10 years to life imprisonment.
In the city of Nogales, Arizona, smugglers use extensive underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Several of the largest tunnels were discovered in central Mexico after the marijuana harvest in October, which challenged drug cartels to quickly deliver their product to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a passage roughly 700 yards long, equipped with rail tracks that ran from the kitchen of one of the houses in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Parents of a teenager from Georgia, who died in a "ridiculous accident", believe that their son was killed
Parents of a Georgia teenager whose body was found inside a rolled-up gym in his high school gym believe their son was killed, a family lawyer said Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson of Waldosta, Georgia, was found Jan. 11 in an upright mat leaning behind the stands in his high school's gymnasium.
Investigators at the Lowndes County Sheriff's Office have concluded that Johnson died by tragic accident, but the 17-year-old's family disputes this.
"They are absolutely certain that their son was killed," said FoxNews.com Benjamin Crump, a lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson.
They never believed he died the way the sheriff says.
"They think it's contrary to logic, the laws of physics, as well as common sense," Crump said.
They think it's a cover to protect the person or people responsible for their son's death.
"They sent their son to school with a school bag and he was returned to them in a corpse bag," he said.
U.S. attorney Michael Moore said Thursday that he is conducting a formal investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several key questions remain unanswered.
What caused the death?
Was his death the result of a crime?
Moore made the remarks at a news conference Thursday afternoon.
I will study all the facts wherever they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I am of the opinion that there are sufficient grounds" for a formal investigation, he said.
Moore told reporters that an initial autopsy revealed that Johnson died as a result of "positional asphyxia."
However, a second autopsy, according to Moore, revealed a different cause of death.
"There are several issues that need to be resolved or clarified," he said.
Moore added that if he finds enough evidence to warrant a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson's death, he will ask the FBI to conduct one.
A spokesman for the Loundez County Sheriff's Office was not available for comment when contacted Thursday.
A South Georgia judge on Wednesday ordered authorities to release all ccTV footage reviewed by investigators.
The teen's parents said they hoped the videos held the clue as to how he died.
Pakistani authorities begin talks with local Taliban
The Pakistani authorities have begun negotiations with the Taliban movement.
This was reported by the embassy of this country in the UK, where Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif is on a visit.
The head of the Pakistani government made a statement on negotiations with Islamic extremists during a meeting with British Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, with whom he discussed issues of pakistan-India relations, the global energy market and economic reforms in Pakistan.
"The Prime Minister said that dialogue with the Taliban has begun," the Pakistani Embassy in London said in a statement.
"He said he hopes and prays that the dialogue will work in accordance with the Constitution of Pakistan," the diplomats added.
The Pakistani Taliban (Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan) are allies of the Afghan movement of the same name, but act independently of it in the northwestern regions of the country bordering Afghanistan.
The Pakistani Taliban are seeking the creation of an Islamic state.
Earlier, the Government of Islamabad made attempts to start negotiations with the local Taliban, but the movement refused dialogue.
It said it would negotiate only if the authorities withdrew troops stationed in areas where the Taliban operate, as well as released arrested Islamists from prisons.
Nawaz Sharif arrived in London for the World Islamic Economic Forum.
On Tuesday, October 29, British Prime Minister David Cameron, the head of the Pakistani government and Afghan President Hamid Karzai held a tripartite meeting in London to discuss the prospects for the peace process in Afghanistan.
Neftekhimik goalkeeper Matt Dalton refused to comment on the departure of Vladimir Krikunov from the post of nizhnekamsk coach.
The goalkeeper believes that the acting head coach Dmitry Balmin enjoys great authority among the players and will cope with his duties.
Recall, today "Neftekhimik" dismissed Krikunov.
To be honest, I would not like to comment on the dismissal of Vladimir Krikunov," RIA Novosti quoted Dalton as saying.
I can only say that Dmitry Balmin will cope with the obligations imposed on him - I have no doubt about it.
In the team, he enjoys great authority, this young specialist definitely has a great future.
Pawnshop owners in Singapore are doing well, while the middle class is struggling
At a pawnshop in Singapore's Bendemir Mall, Janani Amirthalinga pawns a gold bracelet, ring and earrings to pay for his daughter's schooling.
"My husband and I just bought a house, so all my money is invested there," says Ms. Amirthalinga.
Although she earns S$3000 ($2400) a month as an administrator and her husband also works, the family's monthly income is not enough, she says.
Indeed, demand in various parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt is rising – is such that ValueMax, where it conducts its transaction, this week became the third pawnshop listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
A jewelry loan is not just a quick way to get money (S$1300 in Ms. Amirthaling's case), but it's almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
Typically, pawnshops in Singapore charge an effective annual interest rate of 17% – just above the 15.4% offered at a branch of United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same mall.
However, pawnshops have the advantage that they do not require credit checks or proof of salary and can issue loans faster than banks.
Therefore, millions of people across the region are turning to pawn shops as families feel pressured by the rising cost of living and the rapid rise in household debt and consumer debt.
After five years of sustained growth in the wake of the global financial crisis and cheap credit fueled by loose monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and middle-income families are turning to pawnshops to compensate for declining incomes as their economies slow.
This week, Standard & Poor's, a rating agency, cited an increase in family leverage, largely due to rising mortgages, as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
It said Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest ratio of household debt to gross domestic product in Asia.
Malaysia topped the list with 80% of GDP, up from 60% in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which this week has barely emerged from the technical recession.
On Thursday, data showed a continued decline in exports and weakening consumer demand.
"The bottom line is that as prices rise, people at the middle and bottom of the [income scale] will look for ways to top up their incomes wherever they can," says Song Seng Woon, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Record high gold prices in the past two years have intensified the rush with which people pawn their personal belongings as they take the opportunity to get paid for their family jewellery.
In Singapore, about 70% of the things laid in the 200 pawnshops of the city-state are gold products.
People say, "The price of gold looks good, let's pawn Grandma's gold chain and get it back next month."
In Thailand, the largest pawnshop operator EasyMoney has seen an increase in the number of customers using its branches in recent months, up to 20%.
The growth in the pawnshop business is such that ValueMax, the operator of the Bendemir branch and 15 other similar ones in Singapore, plans to expand not only in neighboring Malaysia, where it has four stores, but also outside of Asia too, says Yeah Lee Ching, chief executive of ValueMax.
The company will finance the expansion using 60 percent of the S$66 million raised this week through a listing on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some lenders have sparked fire of criticism over high interest rates, Ms. Yeah says the pawnshop not only offers cheaper rates than other lenders, it also doesn't increase the debt directly.
"Customers mortgage items they already own, and monetizing personal assets doesn't increase household debt," she says.
The mortgage is gaining increasing public acceptance as a means to obtain short-term, secured funding.
And at the same time, pawnshops are used not only by those categories of people who are in a difficult financial situation.
Wealthy people in Singapore also use ValueMax branches, pawning gold bars or Rolex watches that can yield up to 60 percent of their purchase value in cash.
We see clients from all walks of life.
"They include high net worth individuals who need to borrow money for a short period of time for commercial projects or investments, or small businesses who need to overcome temporary monetary difficulties," says Ms. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need the money very quickly.
Bashkiria can put grain up for auction no earlier than the beginning of 2014
Bashkiria in the course of state procurement interventions can put grain up for auction no earlier than the beginning of 2014, said the Minister of Agriculture of the Republic Nikolai Kovalenko.
To date, market prices are such that they do not stimulate sales to the intervention fund.
While the price in the market is higher, and there is a demand.
"Perhaps the grain will be put up for auction after the New Year," he said at yesterday's press conference.
The Minister recalled that this year crops for the harvest of 2013 amounted to 3.1 million hectares, including the area of grain crops - 1.7 million hectares, which is 3.3% more than last year.
For the harvest of 2014, 550 thousand hectares were sown (105 thousand hectares more than in 2012).
The area under winter wheat and triticale was increased, rye remained at the same level.
In the Voronezh region detained a football fan who broke a window in the waiting room of the station
At nine o'clock in the evening on October 29, at the Griazi-Voronezh station, transport police officers removed two football fans from a passenger train - natives of the Moscow region.
Going to the game of their favorite team, the guys on the way staged a drunken brawl on the train.
The young people were taken to the duty unit of the line police station at the Griazi station to draw up a protocol on an administrative offense.
There, fans repented of their antisocial behavior.
The police issued administrative material on them and released them.
The young people bought tickets for the next train and at the station station began to wait for its arrival.
At half past one night, fans left the train station building, but one of them, a 22-year-old boy, unexpectedly returned and broke the front door window in the station waiting room with his foot.
A transport police officer and a guard of the Russian Railways private security company rushed to the sound of broken glass.
They managed to detain the attacker, who tried to flee the scene.
Employees of the South-Eastern Lu of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia are conducting an inspection.
The question of initiating a criminal case is pending, said Sergey Olkhovik, senior referent of the information and public relations department of the South-Eastern District of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia on transport.
Russian security forces do not know anything about the group "Bratsk Circle" - Novye Izvestia
This is written by INTERFAX.RU with reference to an informed source in the law enforcement agencies of the Russian Federation.
"After reports appeared in the media about the inclusion of Leps by the US Treasury Department in the control lists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian criminal syndicate "Brotherly Circle", we looked through all the databases, but we did not find such a group," the agency's interlocutor said.
In his opinion, the dissemination of this information contributes to the maintenance of the myth of the so-called Russian mafia, which allegedly operates abroad.
As NI wrote earlier, yesterday the US Treasury Department published on its website a list of alleged members of the Bratsk Circle criminal group.
Among them was the Russian singer Grigory Leps.
He appears on the list as "Grisha", posted the day before.
With the data of the popular Russian performer, they coincide.
The exact name is indicated - Grigory Lepsevridze, creative pseudonym, place and date of birth.
In addition to Leps, five other people are mentioned there.
Two Russians, a citizen of Israel, a citizen of Uzbekistan and another native of the former USSR, whose citizenship is not indicated.
In the United States, they are sure that Grigory Leps, who lives on the island of Phuket, transported money for the bandits on their order.
This message is accompanied by a photo of the singer and all his data that correspond to reality are indicated.
What's more, Leps really recently bought a house in Phuket.
The department noted that they intend to impose sanctions against Leps.
The blacklisting of a person by the US Treasury entails the blocking of his assets in the United States and a ban on business contacts with him of persons living in the United States.
Leps' assistant Maya Serikova said that no notifications had been received to the singer: "It is difficult to answer the question whether this is Grigory, about whom everyone is talking now in connection with the scandal in the United States."
All Leps knows is media reports.
Officially, there were no notifications to him personally, although I do not know if they happen in such cases.
"And, of course, all this, on the one hand, is ridiculous, and on the other - surprising and unexpected," she told RIA Novosti.
According to her, Grigory Leps does not live in Phuket, but, according to the US Treasury, he really has a house on a Thai island.
She said that Now Leps is on a long tour of the Far East and Siberia, and that the news caught him during a flight to the city of Blagoveshchensk.
Do you have a black box in your car?
While American road designers are trying to find money to repair the crumbling highway system, many are beginning to see the solution in a small black box neatly attached to the dashboard of your car.
These devices, which track every mile a motorist travels and relay that information to officials, are at the center of a controversial attempt by Washington and state planners to modernize America's outdated highway funding system.
The usually boring highway planning arena has unexpectedly spawned intense debate and colorful alliances.
Libertarians joined environmental groups in lobbying for the government to use small boxes to track the number of miles you drive and even possibly where you pass them — and then use that information when compiling tax bills.
The tea party movement is in shock.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also deeply concerned and raises a number of questions regarding privacy.
And although Congress cannot yet agree whether to continue or not, several states are not going to wait.
They wonder how, over the next decade, they can move to a system where drivers pay for every mile of road they drive.
Thousands of motorists have already taken these black boxes for testing, some of which have a satellite tracking function.
This is really necessary for our country.
"This is not an issue on which we can have the right to choose," said Hassan Ihrata, executive director of the Southern California Government Association, which is preparing plans to start tracking the miles every California motorist passes by state authorities by 2025.
There will be changes in how we pay those taxes.
The technology for this is already there.
The need for this is exacerbated by the lack of funds from the Government Highway Construction Fund, funded by the taxes that Americans pay at gas stations.
Americans no longer buy as much gasoline as they used to.
Cars travel more miles per gallon.
The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents a gallon, hasn't gone up in 20 years.
Politicians do not want to raise the tax even by one cent at high gasoline prices.
"A gasoline tax just can't be maintained," said Lee Mannich, a transportation policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
In his state, 500 tracking devices were recently installed on cars to test the pay-per-parity system.
"This will be the best alternative in the long run," he said.
Nerds call this the user's payroll.
Not surprisingly, this idea attracts urban liberals, since with the help of taxes it will be possible to change the nature of travel to reduce traffic congestion and greenhouse gas emissions, for example.
Planners in California are looking at the system as they develop strategies to meet targets set by the state's ambitious global warming laws.
But Rep. Bill Shuster (R-Pa), chairman of the House Transportation Committee, said he, too, views the system as the most viable long-term alternative.
Free-market advocates at reason are also thrilled that they will force drivers to pay for every mile.
"It's not just a tax that's going to go into a black hole," said Adrian Moore, vice president of political affairs at Reason.
People directly pay for what they get.
The move is also backed by two former U.S. transportation ministers, who in 2011 urged Congress to move toward a pardon.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year that would have involved about 10,000 vehicles.
However, House leaders rejected the proposal because of concerns from rural lawmakers representing voters who often have to travel miles in their daily lives to get to work or the city.
Several states and cities, however, are following this path on their own.
The greatest enthusiasm is shown in Oregon, where 5,000 drivers are involved in participating in the largest experiment in the country.
These drivers will soon pay the state for miles of mileage instead of gasoline tax.
In Nevada, the pilot project has already been completed.
In New York, it is being considered.
Illinois will try it out on a limited basis involving trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes the transportation departments of 17 East Coast states (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is exploring how they can make those changes.
This concept has not been universally accepted.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer cars were recently equipped with these devices, drivers were concerned that the government could track their every move.
"Concerns about big brother and things like that are big of a concern," said Alauddin Khan, head of strategy and performance management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
It wasn't what people wanted.
As the tests were in full swing, the Nevada chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union warned on its website, "It's not hard to turn these devices into full-scale surveillance devices."
There is no need to create a huge, cumbersome technological infrastructure that will inevitably expand to store records of the daily movements of individual citizens.
Nevada is one of several states where there is a difficult search for low-cost technology that would allow state authorities to keep a record of the miles a car travels, but without information about the place and time.
If you can do that, Khan said, society will feel more relaxed.
The search for this technology has led some state agencies to a small young company in California called True Mileage.
Initially, this company was not engaged in assisting in the collection of taxes of the state.
It sought to enter the emerging market for a type of auto insurance in which drivers pay based on mileage.
But the devices it tests attract road designers because they don't use GPS and provide a limited amount of information that is periodically downloaded via a modem.
"People will be more likely to do this if you don't track their speed and track their location," said Ryan Morrison, chief executive of True Mileage.
There have been a few big bugs in some of these state pilot programs.
There are much less expensive and less intrusive ways to do this.
In Oregon, designers are experimenting with giving drivers different options.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they may ditch the device altogether, opting instead to pay a fixed fee based on the average number of miles that all residents of the state travel.
Elsewhere, they hope to sell the idea to a wary public by forcing devices to do more, not less.
In New York City, transportation officials are seeking to develop a tax device that will also accept parking meter payments, provide "pay as you drive" insurance, and collect a pool of real-time speed data from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffic jams.
"Motorists will be attracted to participate in the benefits that they will be offered," the urban design document says.
Some transport system designers, however, wonder if all the talk of a pay per pay is just a huge distraction.
At the San Francisco Bay Area City Transportation Commission, officials say Congress could very easily overcome the bankruptcy of the Highway Trust Fund by raising taxes on gasoline.
An additional lump sum or annual tax could be levied on hybrid car drivers and others whose vehicles don't use a lot of gasoline to pay their fair share.
"There's no need for radical surgery when all you have to do is take an aspirin," said Randy Rentschler, director of the Law and Public Relations Commission.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about their privacy and a host of other things.
Pope Francis will name the first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will elevate the New Cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time in his term of office on Feb. 22, the Vatican announced Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest clergy in the Catholic Church after the pope, and they are the ones who elect the popes, so Francis will appoint his first group of people who will ultimately participate in the selection of his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, after the cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer take part in the election of the pope - this is the prerogative of a group of 120 "cardinal electors".
Announcing the news, Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said a meeting of all current cardinals, known as the consistory, would be held before the elevation ceremony.
"Pope Francis has decided to announce in advance his decision to convene a consistory in February in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings with cardinals from different parts of the world," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said the number of cardinal electors was likely to decline by February.
He said the pope usually names as many cardinals as necessary to bring the number of cardinal electors back to 120, as well as as as many cardinals over the age of 80 as he wishes.
Next year's consistory will be of great importance because it will be the first since Francis was elected in March this year, according to Valero.
At the moment, there is a kind of bias in favor of Europe and especially in favor of Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new pope appoints cardinals from other regions of the world to restore balance," he said.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they are represented by a tiny number of cardinals.
They will also be the first elected cardinals since Francis formed the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world tasked with finding ways to reform the church.
In the past, Dad decided everything on his own.
"Now Francis has chosen eight cardinals to help him," Valero said.
He said it was "entirely possible" that Francis would turn to the cardinals for advice.
But we hadn't been in that situation before — it's all for us for the first time.
Valero said popes used to elevate bishops from major parishes to the position of cardinal, but Francis is "full of surprises — so we don't know who he will name."
VII Interregional Exhibition "Medicine and Health" opened in Ivanovo
The interregional exhibition "Medicine and Health - 2013" was opened on the basis of the sports and entertainment complex "Olympia".
The grand opening of the event was attended by the First Deputy Chairman of the Government of the Ivanovo Region Olga Khasbulatova.
The exhibition presents the work of regional budgetary healthcare institutions of the Ivanovo region, as well as commercial medical institutions of the regions of Central Russia.
Within the framework of the exhibition, seminars, round tables, presentations will be held.
During the exhibition, the work of a mobile complex (full diagnostics), a mobile fluorograph, a blood transfusion station was organized.
Everyone will be able to receive diagnostic procedures, specialist consultations, take part in a master class on physical therapy, get acquainted with the range of services provided in medical institutions of the Ivanovo region.
In addition, Donor Day is held during the exhibition.
The general concept of the exhibition "Medicine and Health - 2013" is a preventive direction in medicine, promotion of a healthy lifestyle.
The exhibition presents medical goods and services, equipment, pharmaceuticals and medicines that improve the quality of life.
The main directions of the exhibition were: development of cooperation with manufacturers and suppliers of medical equipment of the Ivanovo region and regions of Russia; demonstration of medical goods and services, equipment, pharmaceuticals and medicines that improve the quality of life; establishment of business contacts between medical institutions of the Ivanovo region.
Tax for foreign property owners will lead to the fact that the London bubble will burst
The Treasury has carried out a preliminary assessment of the capital gains tax measure but is awaiting a final decision from Mr Osborne, who in the 2012 budget introduced a 7% government duty rate on homes worth more than £2 million and annual payments for buyers who choose to own homes in a partnership rather than as individuals.
At the moment, the state duty on residential real estate in the areas of Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea, which amounted to 708 million pounds in the 2012/13 financial year, already exceeds the total for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the north-east, north-west, Yorkshire and Humber combined.
Mr Cook said: "Following the increase in the state duty on expensive homes and the introduction of related anti-evasion legislation, it is very difficult to argue that the taxation of high-value real estate is understated regardless of the impact of the outdated municipal tax system."
"But this move could lead some foreign investors to be reluctant to buy property in London or its current owners will not be willing to sell it," he added.
The value of first-class real estate – the top 5–10% of the housing market by price – in London's wealthy south-west belt, which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon, has risen by a record 11.8% over the past year.
According to a study by Savills, prices in central London continued to show steady growth of 5.6% year-on-year, but they were overshadowed by the actively developing "domestic market" with a surge in prices in the south-west, in the north (7.4%) and in the east (6.5%) of the city.
The next meeting of the Association of Machine Builders of the Tyumen Region was held on the basis of the Yalutorov Automobile Plant.
Within the framework of the event, a presentation of a new line for the production of electrically welded steel pipes was held.
According to denis Gribanov, commercial director of the enterprise, in 2011, with the advent of a new owner, a marketing research was conducted to study the market for steel structures in the Tyumen region.
It turned out that the region consumes more than 50 thousand tons of electrically welded pipes per month.
After that, it was decided to change the profile of the plant and install equipment for their production on it.
Already this year, more than 7 thousand tons of manufactured products have been shipped.
Investments in the plant amounted to more than 120 million rubles, - said Denis Gribanov.
In October, a new mill was launched, which allows to increase the range.
The plant produces both a small profile of pipe, which is used for thermal farming, small forms of construction and in the furniture industry, and a large one for the construction industry.
We plan to reach the level of production of 50 thousand tons of products per year, which will be about 10 percent of its consumption in the Tyumen region.
Despite the transition to another type of activity, the number of employees at the enterprise has not decreased - now it is 157 people, in the plans for the purchase of new equipment - an increase in staff by more than 50 employees.
The company is retraining of personnel, and the necessary specialists are selected from those already available.
Next year, it is planned to introduce a new unit for slitting steel with a thickness of up to five millimeters, which will reduce the cost of production, as well as another mill, with a pipe production rate of up to 47 meters per minute.
By the end of 2014, the company is going to master the production of pipes that are used in the housing and communal services.
The management of the enterprise sets the task to cover up to 70 percent of the needs of the Tyumen region in these products.
Deputy Director of the Department of Investment Policy Leonid Ostroumov, addressing the heads of production, advised to pay more attention to the modernization of machine-building enterprises.
This is also the aim of forms of state support for industry, which include reimbursement of interest rates on loans for the purchase of new equipment and the cost of its leasing.
This year, it is planned to allocate 150 million rubles for these purposes, two-thirds of this amount has already been spent.
The last commission, which will consider subsidy agreements, accepts documents from enterprises until November 15.
In addition, the budget reimburses the costs of participation of local producers in international fairs.
For next year, the budget provides for funds in the amount of 150 million rubles, which can be used to compensate for leasing payments and loans for the purchase of new equipment.
5 million will be allocated for participation in fairs, 3 million - for energy saving programs.
Funds for reimbursement of ordered and paid equipment, which is produced in the south of the Tyumen region for the oil and gas complex, are reduced to 72 million rubles.
According to Leonid Ostroumov, in the future this form of support will cease, since the motive for its introduction was to compensate for the mineral extraction tax that oil companies paid to the regional budget.
Currently, they do not do this and subsidies become direct expenditure obligations of the region.
With this in mind, the regional government considers direct support for industrial enterprises to be a priority, and not to finance the oil industry through them.
Budget assistance will be associated with investment projects that will be implemented in production.
Many heads of enterprises expressed concern about the current situation in relations with oil companies.
The subsidy for the equipment they purchase is a competitive advantage of the industry in the south of the Tyumen region, and if it is canceled, it will be difficult to compete on price with the central part of Russia, where labor is cheaper.
In addition, the issue of the succession of the new owner of TNK-BP , Rosneft, which has not yet placed its orders at Tyumen enterprises, is unclear.
The agreement on the implementation of the Uvat project expires in 2013, and no application for its extension has been received.
Currently, enterprises in the south of the region, which specialize in equipment for the oil and gas sector, cannot form a portfolio of orders for the next year.
It remains an open question whether taxes from oil produced in the Uvat district will go to the regional budget or they will be paid at the place of registration of the new owner of the fields.
The II Congress of the Peoples of the Southern Urals was held in Chelyabinsk.
The forum is timed to coincide with the Day of National Unity, the 400th anniversary of the restoration of Russian statehood and the 20th anniversary of the adoption of the Constitution of Russia.
The congress was attended by delegations from all cities and districts of the region, representatives of national and cultural associations, religious denominations, legislative and executive authorities - a total of about 350 people.
The course of the forum is aimed at strengthening interethnic harmony.
Here we can set an example not only for other regions, but also for other countries.
We have no discrepancies or disagreements.
We live in complete mutual understanding," says Feofan, Metropolitan of Chelyabinsk and Zlatoust.
During the meeting, a number of issues were considered, including the education of patriotism, cultural cooperation.
As a result of the congress, a resolution was adopted.
The unofficial part of the forum continued at the Opera and Ballet Theater.
An exhibition of national and cultural associations of the Chelyabinsk region was opened here.
Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons-making equipment, says observation team
Syria has destroyed major chemical weapons and poison gas munitions equipment, an international monitoring group said On Thursday, as violent clashes raged in the north of the country, near one of the sites where toxic substances are believed to be stored.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group said more than 120,000 people had been killed since the country's civil war began nearly three years ago.
The Statement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons was made one day before
The 1 November deadline set by the Hague-based organization for Damascus to destroy or "render inoperable" all chemical weapons production facilities and mechanisms for mixing chemicals with poison gas and filling ammunition with them.
The completion of what is essentially the initial stage of destruction is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable that aims to eliminate all of Damascus' chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of the equipment means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
Nevertheless, Damascus has yet to begin the destruction of existing weapons and stockpiles.
The country is believed to have about 1,000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and sarin nerve gas.
The announcement came during heavy fighting on Thursday in the town of Safira, which experts say is home to a chemical weapons production facility as well as storage sites, according to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
An activist group that tracked casualties through a network of activists in Syria said On Thursday it had killed 120,296 people.
Of this number, 61,067 were said to be civilians, including 6365 children.
On the government side, the group said, 29,954 people are members of President Bashar al-Assad's armed forces, 18,678 are pro-government fighters and 187 are Lebanese Hezbollah fighters.
Also among the dead, as stated in the statement, were 2202 army defectors and about 5375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.
According to a July 25 UN assessment, 100,000 have died in the conflict since March 2011.
Since then, this figure has not been updated.
The conflict has forced about 2 million people to flee the country.
Assad's forces have been fighting rebels in Safir for weeks, many of them linked to al-Qaeda groups.
The center said there were casualties on both sides on Thursday, but did not provide specific details.
The fighting highlighted the dangers faced by chemical weapons inspectors, driven by the tight deadlines of their mission to rid Syria of a toxic arsenal, in the midst of an ongoing civil war.
In a statement, the OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, said its team was "now satisfied that it has inspected and seen all critical production items and mixing/refuelling equipment declared by Syria destroyed."
She added that "no additional inspection activities are currently planned."
Earlier this week, inspectors said they had completed the first round of verification work, visiting 21 of the 23 sites declared by Damascus.
They were unable to visit the two sites for security reasons, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPCW said both sites were, according to Syria's statement, "abandoned and ... the chemical weapons programme items in them have been moved to other declared locations that have been verified."
It was not immediately possible to ascertain whether the Safir facility was one of the two sites that OPCW inspectors were unable to visit.
Syria has submitted a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons, which is due to be approved next month by the OPCW's executive committee.
"I salute the courage and bravery you have all demonstrated in carrying out the most challenging mission ever undertaken by this organization," the monitoring team's director general, Ahmet Üzümcü, said in a commentary published by the OPCW.
In its third year, the civil war has pitted rebels, mostly Sunni Muslims, against Assad's government and its security forces, which consist of members of its Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shiite Islam.
As for other developments, the center's head, Rami Abdurrahman, said there was a massive explosion on Wednesday at an air defense facility in Syria's coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion is unknown, he said.
Message: The Obama campaign considered the exclusion of Biden in favor of Hillary Clinton
According to The New York Times, President Barack Obama's closest advisers secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 electoral roll.
This discovery is the most striking sensation of all the expected book by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann about the 2012 campaign "The Stakes Are Doubled: The Game Has Changed 2012".
The Times obtained a copy of the forthcoming book and reported Thursday night that the president's closest aides conducted "sweeping focus group studies and opinion polls in late 2011" to assess whether Biden's exclusion could help raise fading hopes for Obama's re-election.
According to The Times political commentator Jonathan Martin, the book gives a detailed description of the attempt of senior election and White House officials, namely former White House chief of staff Bill Daly, to assess what effect the appointment of former Secretary of State Clinton as vice president will have on the vote.
A possible replacement was a secret closely guarded in the Chicago Campaign and in the Oval Office.
Only six of the president's closest advisers — including Daley, former Obama campaign chairman Jim Messina and former senior White House advisers David Axelrod and David Plunge — knew a replacement was pending.
The book "Stakes Doubled" claims that Daley was the initiator of the attempt to replace Biden despite their "close personal relationship," but ultimately abandoned the move when their data showed that adding Clinton to the ballot list would not "significantly improve Obama's chances."
In an interview with Martin, Daly confirmed that the administration was indeed considering replacing Biden with Clinton.
"I was actively advocating for looking at a lot of things, and that was one of them," Daly told the newspaper.
You have to remember that the president was in terrible shape at the time, so we were like, "Oh my god, what are we going to do?"
While Daly described the study as a "necessary test," Martin told CNN spokesman Anderson Cooper that the campaign had invested a lot in examining whether the move would pay dividends in the vote.
"Campaigns don't spend that amount of money on polls and focus groups unless they take something seriously," Martin said on AK 360.
It is unclear, however, whether Obama knew that his team was exploring the possibility of a replacement.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if his then-boss knew about the possible shuffle.
While Daly said he didn't think the president was "aware" of a possible replacement, the former chief of staff acknowledged that Obama "may" did.
Martin added that "The Stakes Are Doubled" does not provide a clear answer to the question of whether the results of the political probe reached the Obama table.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama was unaware of the study of the possibility of removing Biden from the electoral roll.
"Maybe," Martin replied.
The head of the control and disciplinary committee of the RFU Artur Grigoryants said that Kuban was fined 500 thousand rubles, reports from the House of Football correspondent "SE" Philip Papenkov.
Such sanctions against the Krasnodar club were applied for setting fire to the flag of Dagestan by fans in the stands during the home match of the 14th round against Anzhi.
At the meeting there were representatives of both clubs, a person from the RFPL.
We researched all the available materials.
For the unlawful behavior of spectators, Kuban was fined 500 thousand rubles.
Legislative bans forced Russians to drink less beer
Russian brewers are in a bad mood.
According to their estimates, beer consumption in the country next year will remain at the same level, and this is at best.
Although businessmen initially counted on growth.
After all, this year is going badly for them: sales fell by 7 percent.
All this was told by the head of one of the largest brewing companies in the country, Chairman of the Council of the Union of Russian Brewers Isaac Sheps at the III annual conference of the Adam Smith Institute "Consumer Goods in Russia", which has just ended in Moscow.
It discussed state regulation of the market.
From 2008 to 2012, the Russian beer market has already declined by 18 percent, as in recent years the country has seen a significant increase in the regulation of the brewing industry in terms of the production and turnover of beer - a drink with a small alcohol content, - Sheps told the audience.
In no country in the world is there such a strict restriction of the beer market, the unpredictable introduction of more and more illogical bans, which are allegedly justified by the fight against alcohol abuse.
The brewer complained that many legislative prohibitions designed to reduce the level of alcohol abuse do not have a special impact, however, new initiatives are constantly emerging.
Beer producers were hit the hardest by the ban imposed this year on the sale of alcohol in kiosks.
"We immediately lost 35,000 consumers," Isaac Sheps said.
Brewers have two predictions for next year.
Optimistic is the one that Sheps was talking about: sales of the foamy drink will remain at the same level.
Pessimistic - will fall by another 2-3 percent.
To preserve their profits, businessmen are forced to move away from varieties designed for the mass consumer to the "premium" class: beer will become less, but it will cost more.
Meanwhile, the radical consequences of falling sales with a small amount of alcohol are not yet visible.
"According to my observations, the level of alcoholism remains approximately at the same level," said narcologist Alexei Sotnikov.
True, the share of patients who use surrogates of strong drinks, as well as those who are "hooked" on alcohol-containing tonic drinks like "Jaguar", has increased, whereas ten years ago it was "beer" alcoholism that prevailed.
What will the construction of TPU in Moscow lead to?
Every year, the city authorities promise to equip more and more transport hubs (TPU).
By 2020, it is planned to put into operation 255 TPU.
What the project actually turns out to be, our correspondent understood.
A couple of months ago, a construction fence appeared near the Smolenskaya metro station of the Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya line.
The inscription stated that the arrangement of a transport and interchange hub was underway.
All this was very strange, because near the "Smolenskaya" no ground transport stops and, therefore, it is impossible to change to it.
To get to the nearest trolleybus stop on the Garden Ring, you need to overcome about 130 meters, including a ground crossing through Karmanitsky Lane.
Now Smolenskaya has almost everything finished.
The flower stall disappeared, the newspaper stand was dismantled, and the asphalt in front of the entrance was replaced by paving stones.
That's the whole transport hub.
Transport and interchange hubs are flat and capital, - the press service of the metropolitan Department of Transport explains.
There are no capital TPU yet.
And flat ones involve the construction of parking lots, the withdrawal of retail facilities that interfere with the movement of passengers, the creation of small architectural forms and landscaping.
Actually, planar TPU is not even engaged in transport workers, but professional landscapers from the Department of Capital Repairs of the City of Moscow.
A transport hub is not necessarily a complex structure," explains Mikhail Blinkin, Director of the Institute of Transport Economics and Transport Policy at the Higher School of Economics.
Sometimes a roof over your head and a scoreboard announcing the time of arrival of transport are enough.
For example, at the Yasenevo metro station, a full-fledged planar interchange hub was recently opened.
Albeit without canopies, but with intercepting parking lots and scoreboards indicating when the bus will arrive.
But in pursuit of quantity, officials write down everything in TPU.
Back in 2011, the mayor's office planned to build 151 nodes for everything, of which 59 with capital construction.
Now the plans until 2020 include as many as 255 TPU.
Of these, half a hundred promise to pass this year.
Although the city has a program for the development of TPU, there are no qualitative criteria, - says Alexander Morozov, co-chairman of the public organization "City and Transport".
They report on the number of objects, but the quality of transplantation at each of them often deteriorates.
According to the expert, there should be two criteria: firstly, a reduction in transplant time, and secondly, convenience.
First of all, the ability to change the mode of transport without going out in the rain.
In Moscow, when arranging TPU, sometimes it turns out exactly the opposite.
A vivid example of the metro "VDNKh".
Previously, suburban buses from the Yaroslavl highway came to the square in front of the main entrance to the All-Russian Exhibition Center.
Now their stops have been moved to the opposite side of Yaroslavka to Kosmonavtov Street.
Farther from the metro, much farther from the monorail, but closer to residential buildings.
It is for nothing that the residents did not want the bus station under the windows and complained to all possible authorities.
With the capital TPU in Moscow, somehow it did not immediately work.
The first of them began to be built about five years ago near the metro station "Planernaya".
The project was intended to be exemplary.
And indeed, it turned out to be an example of how the interchange hub, given to investors, turns into a banal shopping center.
No, there are platforms for buses, a canopy so as not to go from the metro in the rain, and three floors of parking lots.
True, Khimki trolleybuses No. 202 and No. 203 in the Moscow TPU were not given a place in principle.
They were pushed away from the subway like strangers.
But there is more space for trade.
There are 32 stores of clothes alone, and in general there is almost everything - from pet products to a car dealership.
Well, in fact, what if one of the bus passengers needs to buy a new car on the road?
For some reason, when we build a capital TPU, we always get a shopping center.
Recently, the situation reached its logical conclusion, when it was decided to give part of the parking lot to the market.
Now on the third floor of the TPU "Planernaya" among the parking spaces marked on the floor there is a brisk trade.
Vegetables, spices, Chinese jeans, non-Russian speech and security guards looking angrily at our photographer.
The interchange hub finally turned into a bazaar.
The fact is that earlier the metro station "Planernaya" had a market, but it was demolished.
And in the prefecture, the traders were pitied and allowed into the intercepting parking lot of the interchange hub.
Still, due to high prices, it is always empty.
The funny thing is that the market was demolished in order to build it in its place ... new planar TPU.
Such a castling.
At the Kaluzhskaya metro station, the approach distance from the metro lobby to the bus was 50 meters, - says Alexander Morozov.
After the construction of the shopping center, allegedly TPU, the distance increased to 170 meters.
To get on the bus, you need to go through the entire shopping center.
After 10 p.m., when it is closed, you have to go around it in the open air.
However, the structures on the "Planernaya" and "Kaluzhskaya" will soon seem like flowers.
In mid-September, the urban planning and land commission of the mayor's office approved planning decisions for the first eight capital TPU.
Four of them will be 25-storey, not counting two or three underground tiers.
The main monster will grow at the Tushino metro station, it will have 418.7 thousand square meters. meters of area.
Representatives of the Directorate of Railway Stations of Russian Railways, responsible for the construction of TPU near the metro, have already told reporters: shops, hotels and apartments will be located in future high-rise buildings.
At the same time, officials assure that multi-level parking lots will occupy from a third to a half of the area.
Let's take "people's" garages as an example.
For example, a garage for 258 cars, which was recently built on International Street, has an area of 8,015 square meters. meters.
So, for parking for 2.6 thousand cars at Petrovsko-Razumovskaya, you will need about 80 thousand "squares".
This is less than a third of the colossus that they are going to build there.
Let one or two floors go to all sorts of platforms for buses.
At least 150 thousand square meters of commercial real estate remain.
And that, for a moment, is almost two GUMs.
If railway workers build capital TPU near stations and railway stations, then the rest of the sites will be mastered by metro workers.
They, too, promised that there would be many "functional facilities," including hotels, offices and even gyms.
By the way, the Department of Property of the city of Moscow recently told journalists that they are developing a draft resolution according to which investors will be able to apply for a plot for TPU to officials directly.
Without any contests.
Because, they say, transport issues for the city are a priority.
The ideal TPU is, for example, the stations "Harvard" in Boston or "Spadina" in Toronto, - Alexander Morozov is sure.
There, trolleybuses and trams descend underground to the metro level and the approach distance from the metro car to the tram is only 50 meters without going outside.
There is no extra trade around.
But Moscow officials are thrown to extremes.
Either we will not build anything, or we will build 25 floors with offices and apartments.
Oil fell in price to $ 96 per barrel.
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday as worries about the formation of large inventories overshadowed a message showing that China's energy-intensive manufacturing sector was gaining momentum.
The benchmark grade of US oil in december delivery fell by 14 cents, and its price was $ 96.24 per barrel in late morning European time in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
On Thursday, the contract fell by 39 cents, which in total amounted to a drop in the price for October by 5.8 percent.
Rich oil reserves have affected its value in recent weeks.
The Energy Department on Wednesday said U.S. inventories had increased by 4.1 million barrels over the past week.
In five weeks, reserves were replenished by more than 25 million barrels.
But on Friday, there was an indication of a possible increase in demand, judging by two reports about the Chinese industry, which showed a surge in its activity.
This indicates that China's economic recovery may continue to gain strength after the growth rate in the third quarter rose to 7.8 percent after a twenty-year low in the previous quarter.
Brent crude, an international benchmark also used by U.S. refiners, fell 26 cents to $108.58 a barrel on the Intercontinental Exchange in London.
In Yekaterinburg, a criminal killed two sisters and burned their bodies
In Yekaterinburg, the police are searching for a criminal who brutally dealt with two sisters.
After the murder, their bodies were burned.
As the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation in the Sverdlovsk region told Novy Region, the day before in the Kirov district of the Ural capital, after extinguishing a fire in a three-room apartment located in a residential building on Uralskaya Street, the bodies of two women with signs of violent death were found.
Soon the identities of the dead were established.
It turned out that these are sisters, one of them is a resident of Yekaterinburg for 44 years, the second is a 33-year-old resident of the Orenburg region.
They rented the burned apartment a few days ago.
His investigation was taken under personal control by the chief police officer of the region, Mikhail Borodin.
The internal affairs bodies are working on various versions of the murder, checking the alibi of previously convicted citizens and persons prone to such acts.
In addition, it is established for what purpose the women rented an apartment, and where they lived before, what they did, with whom they maintained relations.

Avangard coach Vladimir Chebaturkin, speaking about the preparation of his team for the KHL regular season match against Salavat, noted that Omsk conducted a thorough analysis of the defeat against Metallurg Magnitogorsk.
The specialist stressed that Avangard needs to pay increased attention to the defensive game.
We watched the video of the match against Metallurg Magnitogorsk," Chebaturkin was quoted as saying by Avangard's official website.
- We conceded a lot of goals, not a very pleasant moment.
They missed because of their mistakes, because of the failure to complete the game task.
We knew that the opponent had performers.
According to statistics, they had five attacks on the move - three goals were scored against us.
Very good implementation.
Were these mistakes taken into account in preparation for today's game?
We carefully analyze each match with the guys, talk after the game, prepare for a new opponent.
The main thing is that the installation is performed.
Everyone saw the first period of the match against Metallurg.
The game task was being completed, and the score was 2:0.
We conceded a goal "to the locker room" - and in the third period they began to make mistakes.
Given how hard the game was, I didn't see the point in connecting defenders.
You have to defend with the whole team.
Now Avangard has a long home series, matches are going on every other day - has the team accumulated fatigue?
All teams are in the same conditions.
The main thing now is the realization of their moments and the fulfillment of the game task.
Hockey is an emotional game, if you perform the installation - everything is not so difficult to solve.
Bombardier's profits decline with a drop in deliveries and the number of orders for aircraft
Bombardier Corporation, a Canadian plane and train maker, reported a 15 percent decline in net profit on Thursday, impacted by a reduced number of aircraft orders and deliveries in the third quarter and contract problems at its rail division.
Montreal-based Bombardier also did not release any data on flight tests of its newest CSeries aircraft and did not provide new information on whether ambitious plans to put the aircraft into commercial operation by next September will be fulfilled.
After the first flight of the prototype aircraft, which took place about a month and a half ago, he flew only three more times, which raises questions about whether the test stage is on schedule.
The results fell short of forecasts and led to a drop in stocks of more than 8 per cent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerxen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, lowered his estimate Thursday from "above market average" to "market average" due to the belief that stock growth is limited in the next quarter or two.
"While the decline in aircraft deliveries was generally predictable, we are certainly disappointed with the transportation division's profit figures," Doerxen said in a stock market review.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for CSeries as the flight test program continues.
However, unless new orders are announced in the coming months, we assume the market will become more skeptical about the program.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries family of aircraft will allow it to win a place in the lower price segment of the market, which is now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first prototype of the aircraft was presented in March and flew for the first time in September after several months of delay.
However, there are not too many firm orders for CSeries so far - 177, as potential buyers are waiting for the results of flight tests to check the company's statements about the fuel efficiency and potential efficiency of the new liner.
In total, there are now 403 orders and agreements with 15 customers and operators.
Chief Executive Officer Pierre Baudouin was confident that Bombardier would reach its goal of 300 firm orders by the time the first aircraft was put into commercial operation.
On Thursday, executives also assured analysts and media outlets that the program was moving forward with plan.
"The test model of the aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than expected," Bauduan said during a conference call, adding that ground tests and software updates were scheduled for the aircraft's downtime.
All manufacturers plan the tests differently.
We decided to hold the first flight and take a break for updates, so we did.
This will happen throughout the flight test program.
The second of the five test samples is due to fly in the coming weeks and all the others will soon follow, the company said.
And yet analysts are skeptical of the claim that the first customer will be able to start operating the CSeries aircraft 12 months after its first flight.
Bombardier said it was estimating the commissioning date and would provide new information in the next few months.
"This slow pace of flight testing – while apparently in line with Bombardier's internal schedule – reinforces our view that commissioning will be pushed backed up to the first quarter of 2015," Doerxen said.
In the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier's net income fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share, last year.
Adjusted earnings per share remained the same at 9 cents.
Gross revenue decreased slightly - from $ 4.2 to $ 4.1 billion.
Analysts had expected earnings of 10 cents per share and gross revenue of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world's fourth-largest aircraft maker said it delivered 45 aircraft for the quarter, down from the previous year's 57.
The total number of orders fell from 83 to 26 aircraft.
The Aerospace Division's order book was $32.9 billion as of Sept. 30, unchanged from Dec. 31.
"In the aerospace field, the results were in line with our goals, but the low number of orders received and the overall market conditions were an unpleasant factor," Bauduan said.
Gross revenue for aerospace fell 13 percent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world's largest train manufacturer, said gross revenue in the sector rose nearly 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
The order book in the transportation division was $32.6 billion as of Sept. 30, up slightly from Dec. 31.
The revenues of the transport division were negatively affected by problems with the execution of several large contracts.
Management said a new development plan would be presented in the fourth quarter.
Shares of Bombardier, which also announced that Google Chief Financial Officer Patrick Pichette will join the board of directors, fell 8.5 percent to C$4.83 in mid-Thursday trading.
Brazilian company Embraer SA, the world's third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and closest competitor Bombardier, reported a 10 percent decline in quarterly revenue on Thursday.
The chairman of the Krasnoyarsk court stole his identity card, hitting him on the head
Unknown persons attacked the chairman of the Krasnoyarsk Regional Court Vladimir Dvekonko, stealing his identity card.
According to Interfax, late on Wednesday, the attackers hit the judge on the head, causing him to lose consciousness.
When the 63-year-old chairman of the court regained consciousness, he found that his service certificate had been pulled out of him.
The criminals did not take money and other valuables.
Dvokonko reached the house on his own, and contacted the police only the next day.
The crime is being investigated and the perpetrators are being searched.
According to a senior official, Israeli warplanes are attacking targets inside Syria
A senior administration official confirmed in an interview with Fox News that Israeli warplanes struck a target in the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday evening.
The official did not specify what the target was, but said at least one.
The Associated Press reports that the target was Russian-made SA-125 missiles.
On at least two occasions earlier this year, Israel carried out airstrikes on cargo carrying missiles inside Syria.
Is thorium the new hope of nuclear power?
Governments around the world continue to think about how to meet energy needs.
Burning hydrocarbons (where they exist) negatively affects the climate.
Renewables require large areas to generate.
Nuclear power does without both, but leaves behind a lot of waste that is expensive to recycle.
Recently, scientists have drawn attention to thorium , another radioactive element of the Mendeleev system.
It is found all over the world, and, according to experts, its splitting does not leave waste that must be stored for centuries.
In the Moscow metro there will be new machines.
But they will sell tickets to passengers not for money, but for squats.
One trip worth 30 rubles will cost a potential passenger 30 squats.
The number of squats will be counted by a special device using modern technologies, ITAR-TASS reports with reference to the press service of the Russian Olympic Committee.
The first device will be installed at the station "Vystavochnaya" on November 8, 2013.
The presentation of the new ticket sports machines will be hosted by the President of the Russian Olympic Committee Alexander Zhukov and Olympic champions gymnasts Alexey Nemov and Elena Zamolodchikova.

Two YMCA staff members charged with sexual offences even before charges against Jonathan Lord, royal commission learned
Two YMCA NSW employees were charged with sexual offences against children before charges were filed in 2011 against Jonathan Lord, an employee of a caring facility in Karingbach, the Royal Commission on Child Sexual Abuse said.
But in an opening statement, the commission said it had "never dealt with cases of child sexual abuse within its organization."
Chief Executive Officer Philip Hare was asked about one case in which a YMCA employee was charged with child pornography offences and another case in which a gym instructor at YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted of sexual offences against children under his care in 1991.
Mr Hare told Gail Furness, the lawyer assisting the commission, that he was aware of the first case but was unaware of the second.
He acknowledged that the YMCA also made an inaccuracy in its opening speech to the commission, arguing that "there have been external YMCA reviews that have recognized that the YMCA is at the forefront of child safety."
The evidence presented to the commission suggests that the YMCA has been notified that it has received the second from the end of four possible assessments based on the results of a quality audit performed by the Department of Education and Communities in August this year.
Mr. Hare, who joined the YMCA when he was 21, admitted that he and the lower management had made a mistake by hiring Lord and had failed to ensure that staff were clearly aware of their obligations regarding reporting violations of the child safety policy.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sex crimes against 12 boys during his two years at the YMCA.
He was jailed for at least six years.
But Mr. Hare rejected suggestions that the YMCA's corporate ethics prevented employees from reporting Lorde's child safety violations.
Officers testified that they observed abuses, including that Lord was alone with the children, personally cared for them, put them in his lap, said he loved one of them and allowed them to play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Oakwell, who was under Lorde's direction and asked to be trained in child protection because she was concerned about his behaviour, testified that she found Jackie Barnut, the child custody manager of the YMCA's Karingbach branch who was Lord's supervisor, "very intimidating and often difficult to access".
The executive director said he did not accept employee explanations that they were embarrassed to report the situation to their superiors.
Rather, he said, their friendship with Lord led them away from the idea of having to report him.
Mr Hare said he had presented his views to the YMCA NSW council that the lesson to organise the "Jonathan Lord incident" was not "about the provision of information" by staff, and the board agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said the decision to force employees to sign confidentiality agreements shortly after the allegations surfaced was made by YMCA CEO of child custody Liam Wheatley.
He said it was designed to prevent damage to the evidence, but at the same time they "overdid it" and the decision was poorly implemented.
The YMCA of New South Wales was not a child-safe organisation during Jonathan Lord's work in it between 2009 and 2011, Child Molestation expert Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University told the commission.
He said there were "serious challenges" in recruiting, selecting, instructing, training and supervising staff.
The hearing has been adjourned until Dec. 20.
Guillaume Niklou's film adaptation of Denis Diderot's novel boasts exceptional staging and historical details, but it's also harder to take than it should be.
The film, set in France in the 1760s, tells the dark story of Suzanne, a young aristocrat sent to a convent by her family.
When she begins to rebel, she experiences extreme cruelty at the hands of a sadistic abbess and becomes the object of erotic fantasies for others.
The film never stoops to vulgarity or sensationalism — and that's the problem.
Because of its serious solemnity, the narrative risks becoming a test for the audience as well.
US intelligence agencies wiretap the personal phone of the Pope
The activities of the Vatican are under the vigilant control of American intelligence agencies.
New documents from the edward Snowden collection show that U.S. intelligence conducted wiretaps of all conversations of the previous Pope Benedict, and now closely guards Pope Francis.
His phone began to be tapped even before he became the head of the Vatican.
The process of electing a new pope was also under surveillance.
Which in the United States was given special importance.
The secret service connected to the cell phones of cardinals who had gathered in Rome to choose the next Pope.
The telephones of the residence where the participants of the conclave lived were also tapped.
American spies bugged all the main contenders for the papal throne in order to prevent the appearance of an undesirable figure for Washington.
Panorama magazine writes that the "big ear of the United States" continued to intercept the conversations of the prelates until the end of the conclave on March 12.
It is alleged that in the United States since 2005, the Argentine Archbishop Bergolio was singled out as the future Pope.
U.S. intelligence also tracked negotiations related to the election of a new vatican bank president.
The Italian magazine writes that a secret group of CIA and NSA operatives continues to work in the Rome US Embassy, extracting information about politicians and financial flows.
In turn, the Vatican conciliatorily announced that it does not care about The American "wiretapping", even if it takes place.
From the leadership of the United States, the holy fathers have no secrets.
Ben Greenman: Tenth Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
We can safely say that New York is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: almost a hundred years ago, pop artist Frank Faye, who worked as an entertainer at the Palace Theater on Broadway, began to tell jokes directly to the public in a colloquial manner.
Faye's innovation was eventually picked up by others, most recently the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and curated by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the stand-up club Carolines, the festival is celebrating its tenth anniversary this year with more than sixty shows in small clubs and large theaters.
"Most of these headliners started at Carolines and then got more success, reached a level where they were already too famous to play at the club," Hirsch said.
We created this festival as a way to continue working with them.
This year's event includes performances by Wanda Sykes, Katie Griffin and Bill Mare, as well as Stand-up for Heroes, an annual music and comedy benefit concert for military veterans at Madison Square Garden, featuring Bruce Springsteen, John Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby, among others.
With the expansion of the festival, the world of comedy has also expanded.
Several comedians participating in this year's festival have gained popularity in unconventional ways, such as through shows on smaller TV channels like Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll gained fame thanks to his role in a comedy series on a little-known cable channel (FXX's deliberately scabrous "League" on the theme of fantasy football), and now leads his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was included in the cast in both Saturday Night Live and Parks and Recreation, although she is best known for the series of viral videos "Marseille is a shell in shoes."
Both Kroll and Slate, like other young comedians with distinctive styles (the surreally pessimistic Anthony Jeselnick, the crafty, racially focused Kamau Bell), are the result of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the highlights of the festival will be David Steinberg's interview with Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but later became a successful director in television and film, as well as an unofficial historian of comedy.
From 2005 to 2007, he was the host of a show on TV Land called Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg.
The meeting will take place at Town Hall in midtown Manhattan.
"This city is definitely the centerpiece of all of Larry's work," Steinberg said.
He told me that when he comes here, he sometimes walks along some street between two houses and thinks: "If I am left with no money at all, maybe I will live here."
