Hurricane Hanna alerts in two Mexican states
The Mexican National Civil Defense Administration has issued an &quot;orange&quot; (high) alert level in the two eastern states of Tamaulipas and Nuevo Leon due to the approaching Hurricane Hanna, TASS reports.
The hurricane will bring heavy downpours to Mexico, with 150 to 250 liters of rain per square meter predicted in some areas.
The authorities have prepared about 800 shelters for the population.
10,000 people will provide assistance to people, including rescuers, soldiers of the National Guard and the military.
At the moment, the hurricane has reached the coast of the US state of Texas with a wind speed of 150 km/h.

Semilarski against the prosecutor&#39;s office: the cassation of the former vice-mayor of Tartu will be considered on August 4
This means that a decision on it is likely to be made in early September.
The courts of the two first instances refused to consider Semilarski&#39;s claim, but in April the State Court accepted his cassation appeal.
On December 12, 2019, the Tartu Administrative Court returned the complaint to the applicant, since its resolution is not within the competence of the administrative court.
The court ruling stated that the complaint contained a claim for compensation for damage caused in the course of criminal proceedings.
&quot;Such issues should be regulated by the prosecutor&#39;s office and the county court,&quot; Anette Kreitsmann, spokeswoman for the Tartu courts, told ERR earlier.
According to her, Valvo Semilarski appealed this decision to the district court, which on February 5 did not change the decision of the court of first instance.
Now the State Court will have to say its word.
According to Semilarski&#39;s lawyer, attorney-at-law Oliver Nyaes, his client was unreasonably under suspicion of bribery for about two years.
Now he is demanding that the prosecutor&#39;s office refute the false allegations addressed to him and compensate him for moral damage.
The reason for filing a complaint with the court was the statements of the prosecutor for special cases of the Luna District Prosecutor&#39;s Office Margus Gross, made by him in October 2017, when Semilarski, along with another vice-mayor of Tartu at that time, Artem Suvorov, was detained on suspicion of committing several crimes.
&quot;Let us remind you that when I was detained, the Security Police and the Prosecutor&#39;s Office immediately organized a press conference and informed the entire Republic of Estonia that the leaders of Tartu - one of the most influential local governments - are corrupt.
These public suspicions hung in the air accompanied me for about two years.
And now, when these allegations and suspicions turned out to be false, the prosecutor&#39;s office does not want to say anything about it,&quot; Semilarski commented in early August 2019.
According to Oliver Näes, at the press conference the prosecutor went beyond the legal framework within which the prosecutor&#39;s office should operate.
&quot;The allegation of bribery and venality turned out to be false, but that&#39;s not the only issue here.
The European Court of Human Rights, for example, has repeatedly stressed in its rulings on Russia, as well as on Lithuania, that at the stage of investigation, state representatives should be careful in their choice of words so that suspects are not presented as criminals before sentencing.
The prosecutor&#39;s office is also obliged to do this by the presumption of innocence, which, unfortunately, was not respected in this case against Valvo Semilarski,&quot; Näes said.
&quot;Publicly presenting Semilarski as a serious offender and bribe-taker in circumstances where the facts underlying the suspicion of bribery are still emerging is unacceptable, contrary to the presumption of innocence and unfair to the complainant,&quot; the lawyer added.
As rus.err.ee wrote, Valvo Semilarski, the former deputy mayor of Tartu, will not be prosecuted on charges of bribery - the criminal case against him was partially closed in July.
At the same time, the former official is being tried on charges of deliberately violating anti-corruption laws when conducting transactions on an especially large scale.
According to the indictment, between 2015 and 2017, the former deputy mayor of Tartu participated more than thirty times in the meetings of the city government when making decisions related to companies operating in Tartu, with the owners or managers of which Semilarski actively communicated on a personal level outside of working hours.
According to Gross, in all these cases, Semilarski had personal interests, and therefore he had to step back from participating in decision-making.
Earlier, as rus.err.ee wrote, the prosecutor&#39;s office charged Semilarski with taking a bribe and violating anti-corruption laws when conducting transactions on an especially large scale.
This happened in October 2016, when he was detained along with another deputy mayor, Artem Suvorov (Centre Party).
At that time, the prosecutor&#39;s office and the Security Police stated that there was strong evidence against both vice-mayors.
After that, both officials resigned.
Suvorov&#39;s case later reached the court, which fully acquitted the politician.
The judicial investigation into the case of Valvo Semilarski is still ongoing.

How will the decision of the Central Bank to reduce the key rate affect the economy
The Bank of Russia, as expected, lowered the key rate again.
It fell by another 0.25 percentage points, to 4.25% per annum - formally another historical low.
Judging by the return of the short rate cut step, as well as the tone of the Central Bank&#39;s statements and updated forecasts for the Russian economy, the regulator looks at the economic prospects more optimistic than before.
This means that the current cycle of monetary easing may soon come to a halt.
“We continued to ease monetary policy, primarily considering that there are still risks of inflation deviating downward from 4% in 2021,” said Elvira Nabiullina, head of the Bank of Russia.
They are associated with a significant decline in economic activity, a fall in domestic and external demand.
Economic recovery, according to Nabiullina, will take more than a year and a half.
At the same time, she noted that after the restrictions were lifted due to the pandemic, economic processes revived: energy consumption, consumer and investment demand recovered, construction and production of consumer goods expanded, and the annual rate of decline in transport freight turnover and industrial production slowed down.
According to the revised forecast of the Central Bank, in 2020 the contraction of the economy will be 4.5-5.5% (previously it was expected to be 4-6%), and the recovery growth of the economy in 2021 will be 3.5-4.5%, in 2022 - 2.5-3.5%.
In addition, the Bank of Russia revised its forecast for annual oil prices to $38 and $40 per barrel of Urals in 2020 and 2021, respectively.
Earlier, the Central Bank expected 27 and 35 dollars per barrel.
Finally, the Bank of Russia&#39;s inflation forecast for 2020 was 3.7-4.2% against the previously expected 3.8-4.8%.
The view of the Bank of Russia on the situation in the economy is becoming more optimistic, which brings us closer to the end of the easing cycle, say Sophia Donets and Andrey Melashchenko, economists for Russia and the CIS at Renaissance Capital.
Thus, the Bank of Russia has been consistently reducing the key rate for more than a year, since the beginning of last summer it has already fallen by 3.5 percentage points.
And at the last meeting in June, the Central Bank lowered it immediately by one percentage point due to low inflation due to suppressed demand and the need to stimulate the economy, which has slowed down due to the pandemic and related restrictions.
There are still chances to fine-tune monetary policy (at the next meeting on September 18 and before the end of the year), but the limit is already close, agrees Evgeny Koshelev, chief analyst at Rosbank.
The combination of pro-inflationary risks also points to the nearness of a pause in interest rate easing - disrupted supply chains, possible rising costs due to epidemic prevention measures and a faster (compared to expectations) recovery in demand, he says.
To top it off, the subsequent actions of the Bank of Russia will require more attention to inflationary processes during the harvest season, as well as external volatility, which has increased against the backdrop of geopolitical conflicts, Koshelev points out.
One way or another, the reduction in the key rate will lead to a further reduction in rates for the most reliable borrowers, and possibly also for mortgages, says Maxim Petronevich, senior economist at the analytical department of Otkritie Bank.
The rate correction will be less pronounced than the key rate cut, he said.
Interest rates on consumer loans may fall by another 0.3-0.6 percentage points during the second half of the year, mortgage rates may end the year in the range of 6.2-7%, BCS Premier economist Anton Pokatovich does not exclude.
Average deposit rates, in his opinion, will also fall - in the coming months they may drop to 4.2-4.5% (now barely above 4.5%).
Further, they may drop to 4% if the Central Bank lowers the key rate in the fall, Pokatovich believes.
The Center Party promises to pay off all its debts by the end of the year
Mikhail Korb, general secretary of the Center Party, spoke about this in an interview with ERR.
According to him, the total amount of payments that the party has to make is about 300,000 euros.
&quot;According to today&#39;s financial forecasts, the Center Party will pay off its current debts and obligations by the end of this year,&quot; Korb said.
Earlier it became known that the party of the prime minister returned to the state 110,100 euros, which were recognized as a prohibited donation.

Poll: Ruling Union of Peasants and &quot;Greens&quot; of Lithuania again topped the rating of parties
The Union of Peasants and Greens of Lithuania, which heads the ruling coalition of the Seimas, topped the rating of parties.
This was shown by a poll conducted by the sociological research company Vilmorus on behalf of the newspaper Lietuvos rytas.
After the victory in the 2016 parliamentary elections, the &quot;peasants&quot; lost their first place and for a long time the main critic of Russia in Lithuania, the opposition Fatherland Union - Christian Democrats (conservatives), was in the lead.
However, recently Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda, assessing the electoral possibilities of the parties, said that the Union of Peasants and Greens after this year&#39;s parliamentary elections will probably be able to form a coalition again.
This statement caused outrage among conservatives.
The latest poll showed that if parliamentary elections were held today, 17.6 percent of voters would vote for peasants, and 17.2 percent for conservatives.
According to the director of Vilmorus Vladas Gaydis, the gap is within the margin of error, and nevertheless the ruling ones have ceased to lag behind the conservatives.
According to Gaidis, the sociological success of the &quot;peasants&quot; was facilitated by the news that their electoral list will be headed by Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis.
This politician was first on the list of &quot;peasants&quot; in the 2016 elections as well.
In third place is the Social Democratic Party, for which 7.1 percent of respondents are now ready to vote.
In a month, she unexpectedly lost 2 percent.
The fourth is the Labor Party, headed by Russian-born businessman Viktor Uspaskikh (6.2 percent).
The rest of the political organizations, judging by the poll, will not yet be able to overcome the 5% electoral barrier.

Extra requirements for applications for public procurement will be excluded by law
Legislation may establish exhaustive requirements for tenders.
In the autumn session, at the plenary session of the State Duma, they plan to consider in the second reading a bill that establishes requirements for the content and composition of the application for participation in the procurement, in which only small and medium-sized businesses can participate.
Amendments are being made by the government to the law &quot;On Procurement of Goods, Works, Services by Certain Types of Legal Entities.&quot;
The bill was developed in pursuance of the roadmap for the implementation of the Strategy for the development of small and medium-sized businesses in the Russian Federation until 2030, approved by the government.
It provides for the preparation of a draft law on an exhaustive list of documents that customers have the right to require as part of an application from procurement participants - small and medium-sized businesses.
And also - about the list of requirements to the specified documents.
To date, the law &quot;On Procurement of Goods, Works, Services by Certain Types of Legal Entities&quot; regulates the procurement activities of certain types of legal entities in a framework.
Requirements for the content, form, execution and composition of the application for participation in the procurement are established by the customers independently in the procurement documentation.
&quot;As a result, customers establish excessive requirements for the content, execution of the application, the mandatory presence of references, certificates, extracts in its composition, the deadline for receiving which in the authorized bodies is comparable to the deadline for submitting applications, which leads to the impossibility of participating in such a purchase and reducing the number of procurement participants&quot; , says the explanatory note to the bill.
The new bill provides for the establishment of an exhaustive list of documents that customers have the right to require as part of an application from procurement participants that are small and medium-sized businesses.
&quot;The adoption of the document will make it possible to eliminate the arbitrary establishment by customers of requirements for the composition and content of applications of participants who are small and medium-sized businesses,&quot; the explanatory note says.

The expert assessed the role of vitamins in the formation of immunity
Andrey Tyazhelnikov, chief freelance specialist in primary health care for the adult population of the Moscow Health Department, assessed the role of vitamins in the formation of immunity.

According to him, there are certain rules.
For example, in summer it is better to spend more time outdoors, including under the sun.

&quot;This generally strengthens the immune system, gives a certain supply of vitamins and a certain supply of health,&quot; he added.

The head of the region Igor Kobzev met with the mayors of the Ust-Orda Buryat district
During the workshop, which took place today, July 24, the government of the Irkutsk region discussed the main directions for the development of remote agricultural areas.
During working trips to the districts of the Ust-Orda Buryat district, the head of the region gave a number of instructions.
Today the mayors reported on their performance.
First of all, the construction of the House of Sports in Ust-Orda was resumed.
The order for this facility was given by the President of the Russian Federation fourteen years ago.
But only now the situation managed to get off the ground.
866 million rubles will be spent on construction.
Completion date for the building is 2022.
And already this year a school in the village of Bayandai should be put into operation.
At the moment, the decoration of the premises has been completed.
The rest of the work is landscaping.
In general, the program for the construction of preschool and secondary education facilities is of particular importance for the region.
For your county - in particular.
The demographic situation here is the best in the region.
And we are obliged to create all conditions for the education and leisure of children of all ages, - said the Acting Governor of the Irkutsk Region Igor Kobzev.
At the meeting, the head of the region instructed all mayors to actively engage in the development of master plans for settlements.
This is one of the main conditions for the integrated development of the district.
All settlements must have established boundaries and a master plan.
This is necessary for the development of the territory, for the construction of socially significant facilities, as well as infrastructure and cultural heritage, - the head of the region emphasized.
Also during the conversation, a problematic issue was raised with a reduction in milk intake from cooperatives by 30%.
This happened due to the redistribution of milk purchases by the processing enterprise in favor of peasant farms.
Because of this, the share of acceptance of products from cooperatives has decreased.
The head of the region instructed the acting minister of agriculture to go to the site, study the structure of milk sales, analyze the experience of other territories and determine options for solving the problem.

The authorities of the Moscow region spoke about the fate of closed landfills
In the suburbs continue to close landfills for solid domestic waste.
This year, the authorities promise to liquidate the latter.
Some of the 39 landfills that existed in the region are being modernized into modern waste processing complexes.
But this option is not possible for every landfill - many of them are overgrown with dense residential development.
After the landfill is closed, it gets up for reclamation - the body of the landfill is sprinkled with soil, degassing and infiltration systems are installed.
This allows you to stop the chemical processes inside the landfill so that it does not ignite, does not emit a stench, and does not poison the soil and groundwater.
And then the former landfill is left to rise as a useless heap among the residential buildings surrounding it.
Why not make something useful out of it?
For example, in Ruza, where the reclamation of the Annino landfill was completed just a few days ago, the authorities are considering the option of making a ski slope out of a heap.
This landfill, operated from 1976 to 2016, has grown so much that it went beyond the boundaries of the land allocated for it.
Therefore, during the reclamation, it was necessary to buy out neighboring plots, de facto already clogged with garbage to the eyeballs for a long time.
“Some time will pass, the landfill will settle down, it will gain strength, and we will think about what can be done so that it starts to be useful.
The ski resort catches the eye,&quot; Nikolai Parfyonov, head of the Ruza District, told reporters.
Two landfills will become sites for the extraction of renewable energy sources
The Torbeevo landfills in Lyubertsy and Timokhovo in the Bogorodsky District will become sites for the production of renewable energy sources from landfill and biological gases.
By the end of the year, a gas piston power plant will be launched on the territory of Torbeev, capable of generating up to 8 million kilowatt-hours of electricity and about 0.95 gigacalories of thermal energy per year, which will provide the landfill&#39;s own needs - heat supply to administrative and industrial premises.
Timokhovo will produce 72.5 million kilowatt-hours and will continue to operate as a waste processing complex.
And at the Balashikha training ground &quot;Kuchino&quot;, which was closed after residents complained about the &quot;Direct Line&quot; with the President of the country, a museum can be created.
&quot;There was such an idea - to create a museum for the reclamation of landfills near Moscow,&quot; - said Deputy Prime Minister - Minister of Ecology and Natural Resources Dmitry Kurakin.

Acting Governor of the Khabarovsk Territory, Mikhail Degtyarev, for the first time after his appointment, went out to the participants in the rallies in support of the arrested ex-head of the region Sergei Furgal.
The meeting was broadcast on his Instagram page.
“Moscow hears everyone, so it sent you an interim so that the region does not slip without power ... I repeat once again about Furgal: he is “a” - my comrade, “b” - a member of the same party, “c” - I am very worried about his fate, the party helps him, gives him food, Zhirinovsky knocks on all the offices,&quot; the acting governor said.
According to Degtyarev, now the Khabarovsk Territory cannot remain without a leader, therefore, by decree of President Vladimir Putin, he was appointed to the post of head of the region so that &quot;the wonderful building (the government of the region) would function, everything would work, the budget would be spent on social needs.&quot;
The acting governor explained that he did not go out to the protesters before because he could not communicate with thousands of demonstrators.
Therefore, he broadcasts on social networks and reads all the comments on them.
On July 25, two protests were held in Khabarovsk in a row.
Rallies in support of the former governor have been held in the region since July 11.
On the eve of the next action, Mikhail Degtyarev announced that he would leave the city on the day of the rally.
His motorcade was stopped by protesters and called on to speak out about the fate of the arrested ex-governor Furgal.
Degtyarev previously refused to go out to the participants of the actions.

Beautiful high minarets only decorated Hagia Sophia
Once again about Hagia Sophia - I came across a text by Father Vladimir Zelinsky that, they say, we must protest.
Firstly, there was a free entry - hooray!
I have not been to Istanbul, but free admission is better than paid entry to the House of God.
Secondly, the Muslims conquered this land just as honestly as the Orthodox conquered the Volga-Oka interfluve, the Muslim Caucasus (and set up a church in Grozny) and planted apple trees on Mars.
God help!
The Jews conquered the Holy Land.
The Americans conquered America.
Are we going to return everything to everyone?
Do you think there will be no pagans who will demand the return of their temple, on the site of which is the Church of the Tithes?
Thirdly, the Muslims improved this building and invested in it.
That is, it is theirs, just like the factories and estates that the Leninists took away from the bourgeoisie as their property, belong to the Leninists - Putin and other nomenklatura.
They improved everything - from the Kremlin to the Angara, so it&#39;s all their rightful progressors.
Beautiful high minarets decorated Hagia Sophia very much, very much.
There was a stupid inkwell, now there is a stupid inkwell with beautiful minarets.
Fourthly, there are no &quot;Islamic&quot; and &quot;Orthodox&quot; civilizations.
There are believers, there are hypocrites, there are bigots who unite faith and hypocrisy.
The believer does not think in terms of civilization.
This is the thinking of British Foreign Office official Toynbee, a believer is ashamed to think like that.
For the believer, there is a place for prayer everywhere.
And always.
The believer does not pray only where he is asked to leave - he moves to another place and prays there.
He is a believer, not a defender.
We are koloboks, not gloomy stones.

the decision to expand the RPL would not be supported by either UEFA or FIFA
President of the Russian Football Union (RFU) Alexander Dyukov believes that it is wrong to expand the Russian Premier League (RPL) to 18 teams at the moment.
“Firstly, it was the RPL’s decision, but I agree with it, because it’s wrong to change the rules after the tournament is over.
This violates the integrity of the tournament and the sports principle.
And, of course, this decision would not have been supported by either UEFA or FIFA,&quot; Dyukov said after the Russian Cup final Zenit - Khimki (1:0).
Currently, there are 16 clubs in the RPL, but the option of increasing the number of teams to 18 was considered.

Kirilenko shared his memories of the games with Bryant and Jordan in the NBA
The head of the Russian Basketball Federation (RBF) Andrey Kirilenko shared his memories of his games against the legendary Kobe Bryant and Michael Jordan in the matches of the National Basketball Association (NBA).
I knew that Bryant&#39;s pride should not be hurt by some trash talk, so as not to stimulate his sports anger.
Kobe had a killer instinct, so on the court I tried to talk to him so that he would not perceive the game in an aggressive way.
On the court, I gave him compliments: &quot;Oh!
Kobe, well scored, great pass!
Listening to my enthusiastic responses, he almost forgot that he had to once again pick up the ball and score another 3 - 4 points.
We communicated well with Kobe, &quot;Vechernyaya Moskva quotes Kirilenko as saying.
He also spoke about his first game against Jordan.
&quot;I took care of him.
For the first three minutes of the match, I ran in complete admiration for the fact that next to me was a legend that I had only seen on TV.
While my breath was in my goiter with joy, Michael scored a lot of points.
Soon I moved away from enthusiasm, a couple of times covered his throws ...
In that game, my team won, but Jordan still scored 44 points,” added the head of the RSE.
Kirilenko spent 12 seasons in the NBA.
He was selected 24th overall by the Utah Jazz in the 1999 NBA Draft.
In addition to Utah, for which he spent ten seasons, the Russian striker played for the Minnesota Timberwolves and the Brooklyn Nets.
In total, he played 797 games in which he averaged 11.8 points, 5.5 rebounds, 2.7 assists and 1.8 blocks.

The authors &quot;understood the urgency of the topics raised and did not want to offend anyone,&quot; said American Steven Thomas Oksner in an interview with Rise.

It has nothing to do with LGBT and feminism,&quot; said the actor who played the father of the boy who crossed over into women&#39;s clothing.
He stressed that he was &quot;proud of the work&quot; and did not consider it propaganda.
