Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law on the introduction of administrative responsibility for violation of the period and procedure for payment for goods (works, services) in the implementation of procurement for state and municipal needs.
This law is designed to solve a very acute problem of failure to fulfill their obligations by customers in the implementation of state and municipal procurement.
Two years ago, the situation when entrepreneurs could not receive payment for already executed state and municipal contracts, was ubiquitous.
At the same time, the President of Russia instructed the Prosecutor General's Office of the Russian Federation to take the problem for special control.
Because the businessmen themselves could not cope with unscrupulous customers who concluded contracts not supported by financing, in every possible way tried to evade the accepted obligations on payment and included illegal conditions in the contracts.
The problem was systemic in the country as a whole.
Since 2015, in the interests of protecting the rights of entrepreneurs to receive payment on public orders, the prosecutor's office has made 9.7 thousand. According to the results of their consideration, 4.5 thousand were brought to disciplinary responsibility. officials, administrative - 533, 75 materials were submitted to the investigative bodies for the organization of procedural inspections, 46 of them criminal cases were initiated.
As a result, the debt to entrepreneurs in the amount of more than 66 billion rubles was repaid.
And these huge sums were not accumulated as a result of non-payment of multibillion-dollar contracts.
To fabulous debts led numerous, systematic delays in payment of services to entrepreneurs for much more modest amounts.
This is a characteristic case.
The head of the small company won a competition for the provision of services for social transportation for several million rubles.
The man invested all his working capital, fully fulfilled his obligations, but he did not receive the money in time.
The result is a growing financial lump of wage, taxes, loans, which would lead to bankruptcy if the entrepreneur did not seek help from the prosecutor's office.
Now in a number of regions, the problem has been minimized as much as possible.
Nevertheless, as of the first half of 2017, the total amount of debt under state and municipal contracts identified by prosecutors of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation amounted to about 27.4 billion rubles.
In regions where debt indicators continue to reach critical values, the prosecutor's office operates in the mode of manual anti-crisis management.
The Prosecutor General personally conducts visiting meetings with representatives of the local authorities, which deal with all violations and measures opened by prosecutors to immediately eliminate them.
Such operational meetings have already been held in Yaroslavl and Yekaterinburg this year.
The implementation of the Federal Law No. 189-FZ "On Amendments to the Code of the Russian Federation on Administrative Offences in the Establishment of Administrative Disorders of Public Customers for violation of the term and procedure for payment of goods (works, services) in the implementation of procurement to ensure state and municipal needs," which was signed by the President of Russia last week, will be able to improve the payment discipline of public customers.
The draft law was developed by the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia at the initiative of the Prosecutor General's Office.
The new law will complement the Code of Administrative Offences of the Russian Federation, which provides for a fine of 30 thousand. up to 50,000. for violation by the official of the customer of the term and procedure for payment for goods, works and services in state and municipal procurement.
And if the official has already been subjected to administrative punishment for a similar offense, then he will be disqualified for a period of one to two years.
All prosecutors of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation have already received instructions to ensure the application of these legislative novels in practice.
Civil rights protection team announces warning of movement in Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has issued a warning to colored people traveling to Missouri because of discriminatory state policies and racist attacks.
The Panel's announcement: The National Association's Traveling Association for the Advancement of Colored People's Advancement, valid until August 28, 2017, urges African-American travelers, guests and residents of Missouri to be particularly attentive and to exercise increased caution when traveling around the state in connection with a number of dubious incidents on racist soil that have recently taken place across the state and cited here.
According to the National Association for the Advancement of the Colored People's Network, the group's announcement of a travel warning prompted a recently passed Missouri law that has made it harder for people to win discrimination-related lawsuits, and that state law enforcement agencies are disproportionately chosen by their facilities.
You have people are being violated human rights.
They are stopped on the roads because of the color of the skin, they are beaten and killed, - told the newspaper "Kansas City" old Rod Chapel, president of the National Association for the Advancement of the Colored Population of Missouri.
We hear complaints often like never before.
This is the first such warning announced by the organization in relation to the U.S. state.
The group cited incidents such as the humiliation of black students on racial grounds at the University of Missouri and the death of twenty-eight-year-old Tory Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in suspicious circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of gasoline while he was running out of gas, and Missouri police arrested him without being charged with a crime.
The warning also mentions a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General's Office that is 75 percent higher than whites on the road.
"The purpose of the warning is that people are aware of the situation and warn their relatives and friends and colleagues about what might happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
People should be trained in one way or another, take the money with them for bail or tell relatives that they are traveling through the state.
According to the latest FBI data from hate crimes, there were 100 hate crimes in Missouri in 2015, making the state the sixteenth number of such violations.
Also, the warning for movement is a response to the new Missouri law, after which it will be more difficult to initiate a case against a legal entity in connection with housing or labor discrimination.
Earlier, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued warnings for travelers in Texas and Arizona after these states passed new immigration control laws that required local law enforcement to arrest people for immigration laws, which ACLU believes should have increased the number of racially based checks.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department in relation to other countries, but recently public organizations have resorted to this in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Two people were killed in the shooting of a police patrol in Egypt
Unknown shelled a police patrol in the Egyptian city of Isna, reports Reuters, citing the Ministry of internal Affairs of Egypt.
During the shootout, two people, including one policeman, were killed and three people were injured.
All the wounded were taken to the hospital.
According to the agency, the police stopped the car, after which two armed men in the car opened fire on law enforcement officers.
One of the attackers was detained, the second managed to escape.
Rosturizm supports the law on the abolition of free baggage for non-refundable air tickets
The head of the Federal Tourism Agency Oleg Safonov said in an interview with the RBC TV channel that "positive" refers to the adoption of the law on the abolition of free baggage on non-refundable flights.
"We need to create conditions under which a person who does not have luggage can buy a ticket cheaper than the one who has luggage," he said.
At the same time, Mr. Safonov noted that, despite the fears of citizens, you will not have to pay for the transportation of outerwear and mobile phone in hand luggage.
"It would be right to reassure all our citizens and tourists and say about it, to say that it is for outerwear, to the umbrella, to a mobile phone, to aiped or even some computer that will not have anything to do," - said the head of the Federal Tourism Agency.
Earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law providing for the right of airlines to exclude the norm on free baggage on non-refundable air travel.
We are talking about the fact that airlines can determine the number of seats and the weight of baggage included in the non-refundable fare.
Vladimir Putin instructed to eliminate pollution of Baikal
Russian President Vladimir Putin at a meeting on the protection of Baikal said that in recent years, large areas of the lake have been subjected to extreme pollution.
He instructed to identify the sources of funding, plans and executors for the elimination of pollution.
Mr. Putin also instructed to carry out a full reclamation of contaminated areas.
"It is necessary to deal with the objects that continue to work here, the treatment facilities of most of them are worn out," - quotes "RIA Novosti" the President.
He also added that the General Prosecutor's Office of Russia should conduct an inspection to identify environmentally harmful activities.
According to him, in the area of the lake there are problems associated with the appearance of natural landfills and a number of violations in the field of ecology by the organizers of recreation.
"I want to emphasize this: not everything is checked in a row, here the measure also needs to be known, but it is illegal and environmentally harmful activities and to take appropriate measures," he said.
Earlier, the Prosecutor General's Office reported a reduction in fish stocks in Lake Baikal and proposed to increase the number of objects subject to environmental supervision.
On June 15, Vladimir Putin in the course of a direct line announced the need to change the legislation to ensure the rights of citizens living in the natural areas of a special protection regime.
The problems with the conduct of economic activities were reported to him by the residents of the island of Olkhon, which is part of the Baikal natural territory.
The head of the Ministry of Natural Resources Sergey Donskoy immediately proposed to solve the problem by clarifying the boundaries of the Baikal water protection zone, but the government of Buryatia reminded that such a change is not enough, since the restrictions are associated with a number of regulations.
Earlier, the Ministry of Economy proposed to solve the problem by changing the Land Code and the law on environmental protection.
A new temple will appear in Ugra
In the village of Sosva, members of the community of representatives of the indigenous peoples of the North "Rakhtyny," together with the residents of the Berezovsky district, take part in the construction of an Orthodox church in honor of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker.
Its location is the river bank, the temple will be clearly visible from afar, so it will serve as a traveler's lighthouse for fishermen.
According to representatives of the community, the construction work will be completed this year, now there are domes, there are church bells available.
The Igima EW fleet provided transport escorts.
The temple is named after St. Nicholas the Wonderworker, as it is revered by the Orthodox Church as the patron of travelers, including fishermen.
In Sosveda, fishing gives the settlers a job and feeds them.
Locals are waiting for the temple to open their doors, and children even write in school essays about it as a local attraction.
Disneyland with the death penalty.
Why are the laws in Singapore?
I'm talking to a local businessman Chang sitting in an outdoor diner.
Commenting on the situation in Singapore, Chang smokes one cigarette after another, but the butts carefully store an iron box in an iron box taken with him from the office.
After the conversation, the businessman goes to the nearest urn - up to it a hundred meters - and throws bulls there.
Penalty for garbage in a public place - $500 local, - reports Chang.
You know, since childhood, I have just developed a reflex: you can not throw a fantic from candy on the pavement, instantly fine.
And now, everywhere, video cameras.
And indeed - the sidewalks of Singapore in the center of the city are clean, as if in the museum.
Chang says: three months ago, his neighbor's 18-year-old son painted the graffiti wall of an old colonial building.
The court found the guy guilty of vandalism and sentenced him to flogging.
What?!
Imagine it.
He received ten blows with a wooden stick on the buttocks and spent a week in prison.
We are not uncommon corporal punishment.
How Singapore combines the highest standard of living and incredibly harsh laws, the observer of the "AiF" was compiled on the spot.
No one is thinking of abolishing the death penalty, - explains lawyer Victor Lee Hong.
And the government has long been a direct eye on the opinion of both the European Union and the United States on this.
If a person carries a large batch of drugs or sells them, he is put gallows.
In 2002. A 22-year-old Australian citizen was detained at Changi Airport: he was carrying 400 grams of cocaine.
In his defense were the Australian Prime Minister, threatening sanctions, international human rights defenders and even the Pope of Rome.
However, the guy was still hanged.
After that, the drug couriers of our country diligently bypass the side.
The thing is this: in Singapore, it is necessary that the laws are obliged to observe ALL in a row, and not only modest and poor people.
It doesn't matter who you are - a millionaire, deputy prime minister, famous artist or EU resident.
The option in this case is one: if you find a kilo of cocaine, you'll be hanged.
When you go to Singapore and everywhere you meet signs with a bunch of warnings, you are simply given - how many in this city-state bans!
For example, chewing gum is sold only in pharmacies, and you can buy it strictly according to the recipe (!) The doctor.
The tourist on arrival will not be taken away gum, but it is worth glued the "rubber" in the metro, a fine of 1 thousand. local dollars.
In four days I met two people with white tablets around my neck: "I littered."
For thrown past the urn cigarette butt in addition to the fine is often sentenced to "link to the janitors": a week to clean the parks and beaches.
6 thousand. The rub. pays the "criminal," who forgot to wash away the water in the public toilet, and when trying to cope with the small need in the elevator of the apartment building triggers a special detector - blocked the doors and sends a signal to the police.
Among the very exotic laws are bans on feeding pigeons on the street, public performance of songs and even excessive watering of the house plant (!): it is believed that the abundance of water attracts mosquitoes.
In order to avoid fires, smokers can not carry lighters in the metro, otherwise they will be fined 5 thousand. Singapore bucks.
In general, there is a thought: no matter how you try, you will definitely break something.
This is not the case, - Mohammed Kabir-Qajaria, the owner of a local travel agency, is trying to distrust me.
Particularly fantastic laws exist only on paper, and in the last twenty years I have not seen anyone involved in their violation.
Why are they still there?
So that the citizens do not relax.
Compliance with the basic rules is monitored strictly.
For example, if a minor is sold in a cigarette kiosk, everyone will be punished on the chain: the owner of the store will pay a huge amount, the offender himself will receive blows on the back, and the seller will also be thrown and put in prison.
It is because of such harsh laws that are very rare in Singapore.
Is that justified?
Back in the seventies, we had chaos on the roads - motorists ignored traffic lights, drove like they wanted, sat down drunk behind the wheel.
After the introduction of fines for the year, everything calmed down.
Now the driver, having a portion of whiskey, knows: if they stop, the police will not let go for a bribe, will lay a fine in the amount of the cost of the apartment and for years will be sent to prison.
For many foreigners, the city-state in Southeast Asia seems to be a type of concentration camp.
In 1993. American writer William Gibson called Singapore "Disneyland with the death penalty" - a guest from the United States horrified the general wealth of the inhabitants, "terrifyingly clean airport" and "cultural nature."
It is unnatural to say that such things look artificial, and so in principle it should not be.
The first days in Singapore and you are rightly afraid to throw a piece of paper on the sidewalk, grab you if you go into the subway with ice cream.
But then you come to the area of "Little India," and suddenly - "trip pattern rupture": at the bus stop lying plastic cups.
"What about that?" - you're surprised.
That's right, the Singaporeans laugh.
Everything happens.
Not every such "crime" will be caught on the spot, but you should know that if you are calculated, you will not be waived - because you broke the law.
This is often enough for a person to behave normally.
Of course, the power in Singapore is quite authoritarian.
But you know what?
In the Vietnamese Ho Chi Minh, I moved very carefully - motorcyclists often snatch out of the hands of tourists smartphones and cameras.
In the center of Paris there are dirty homeless and beggars.
On our streets, too, not everyone is trying to throw garbage in the urns.
Singapore, thanks to the set of draconian fines and ruthless (up to the death penalty) laws became the most calm, cleanest and safest city on Earth.
You'll think about it.
This is human nature: remember, and in Russia no one was fastening at the wheel until they were fined.
Although the main thing in Singapore is not fines, but voluntary compliance with the laws.
And we need to think that in Russia people in Russia would also be happy with clean streets, the absence of garbage in the metro and would welcome the arrest of those who confuse the toilet with the public toilet.
That's corporal punishment - thank you, no.
In the rest of Singapore's laws are at least worth looking at them.
Nothing a saint?
Now the Trump White House is targeting the Statue of Liberty.
The most reliable sign of regime change is when it starts to fight the statues.
The Americans understand this no worse than everyone else - hence the deliberately theatrical demolition of the statue of Saddam Hussein in Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump government, no doubt knew what he was doing when he brought a symbolic axe over the Statue of Liberty during a fierce dispute with CNN journalist Jim Akosthet about the president's proposals for a sharp reduction in legal migration.
We'll be honest, Miller didn't attempt the statue itself.
The mattles of owners of pleasure boats and artists depicting the Statue of Liberty would lynched it if he tried it.
But he encroached on its meaning, and especially the meaning that was attributed to her in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, when the pedestal was added poems of Emma Lazarus.
As Miller grumbled on Acostes: "I don't want to go deep in history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem you are talking about was later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
Miller correctly laid out the facts, but as he himself said, it's not really about history.
This is about the current sound of the astounding words of Lazarus, the only ones in which the state invites not any immigrants, but the poorest: "Your tired, your poor, / your crowds dream of a sigh, / Fatty garbage of your abundant shores."
Never before have "accidental garbage" been so visible on our screens.
Miller did not do literary studies - he made it clear that in America Trump these people are not expected.
This dispute about the meaning of the statue is part of a broader political and cultural war: it's really a dispute about the meaning of America.
Lapos, and her friends who fought to put her words on the stock of the statues after her death, knew very well that they were doing a completely political act.
The sculpture was intended to denote the connection between the French and American republics with the help of a banal classical figure - the female image of Freedom.
Lazarus changed her meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract, she has a voice.
And she got a completely different name: Mother Expired.
The combination of the poem and image was a brilliant feminist move and a crushing attack against American nativism.
And as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right, though change it back.
The loudspeaker Rush Limbo, a kind of John the Baptist who announced Trump's coming, in 2010 reasoned that Liberty did not invite anyone, rather she was an early neoconservative carrying the flames of America lying in the world: "Freedom is moving forward.
It carries a torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not needed to illuminate the way to the United States."
Against the custom of Limbo, it really got to the point.
The meaning of the statue depends solely on the angle of view.
Lazarus's great creative achievement was to see her as she would be seen by the exhausted, miserable but hopeful people on the decks of ships after a long and difficult voyage.
It literally means looking at the world through the eyes of people who are looking for shelters and a chance for a better life.
We answer her statue with the words of hope and hospitality that they dream of hearing.
And of course, that's not the prospect that Miller and Trump will ever want to recognize.
Their torch is needed not to illuminate the way, but to incite hatred, which is the only source of their strength.
World Cup 2017: Neil Blake praises the Scottish members of the UK national team.
Eilid Doyle recalls a time when there were only two Scots in the UK team.
Neil Blake, director of the UK Athletics Federation's game, said that the 16-member Scottish national team at the World Cup would make a "significant contribution to the team's game."
The record number of Scottish athletes was selected for the 2017 London Championship.
Blake believes that in Scotland "something special" and the UK Athletics Federation should take this into account.
"We know this and try to understand and will support them as long as they have the potential," Blake said.
"I talked to people at the Scottish Sports Institute and they think it's because of what they did.
The Scottish Athletics Federation thinks that what they did has to work with.
The British Athletics Federation: what they did, you have to work with.
People on the street think the same.
I don't know why the circumstances were so, but it's perfectly brilliant."
Some of the Scottish athletes claim medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Bachert - who will compete with Sir Moe Farah at a distance of 5000 m; and Eilide Doyle the team chose as their captain.
"Aleid is modest.
Her captain's speech was great," Blake said.
"Many athletes, whether they are Scottish or not, and where they live or train, came out of this room, feeling pride and inclined to win.
The passion and sincere feelings that Eilid put in her were wonderful."
The winner of the silver medal of the Commonwealth championship, which at its fifth World Cup will run a distance of 400 m with obstacles, says that 16 Scots in the British team is "incredibly."
The previous record for the number of Scots at the World Cup was seven, in 1983 and 2005.
Ahead is Laura Muer, who specializes in middle-distage running and beat five British and two European records last year.
It will run for 1500 and 5000 meters.
Chris O-Her, who will participate in the 1500 m race, is another Scotsman who is worth paying attention to: behind his back is a successful season, in which there were victories in the qualifiers of the British national team and at the annual competitions.
Doyle recalls his first World Cup, when the only Scotsman on the team was Lee McConnell.
The captain of the team says that she is "incredibly proud" that so many of her compatriots not only entered the national team, but in some cases will claim medals and fight for the final.
"The captain of the national team is chosen by other team members, so it was a huge honor in any case, but to know that your comrades voted for you and you were chosen - for me this is a very special thing," she added.
"Of course, I am very proud of all the Scots who joined the national team.
It shows how much we have achieved.
And they are all the athletes who will seek to get to the pedestal of honor.
What about my portrait?
Yeah, I think she wasn't bad.
I just noticed that we were very lucky to host the World Cup.
So it's just about how important it is to get support from the fans and take advantage of what we're going to be back at the Olympic Stadium.
I got another chance to go to his arena and take part in the competition, and the atmosphere there will be just great."
Blocking critics on Facebook: do not go to public office if you are not ready to listen to criticism from voters
The founder of our country understood what a critical press was.
The Americans loved George Washington, but that didn't stop them from criticizing him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
His criticism, of course, was annoying.
But he didn't shut his mouth to his critics.
Because in 1783 Washington said: "You can take away the freedom of speech and us, the deaf and dumb, will lead as sheep to the slaughter."
Now I'm going to move on to the Governor of Maryland Larry Hogan, who should have tried to be more like Washington.
Hogan's subordinates blocked and erased the posts of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And this week, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit against him for it.
The governor's subordinates called this lawsuit null and void, and the comment on the Internet was written in the spirit of "well and what."
"It's just Facebook," many people will say.
But it's important, too.
And that's especially important when it comes to a guy like Hogan.
He is a remarkably popular Republican governor in a largely democratic state.
He is in second place in the approval rating among the country's 50 governors.
Hogan is not a stubborn reactionary.
He demonstrated a firm hand in managing the state and committed to his principles.
He also cleverly uses Facebook as a primary way of communicating with his voters and with jokes shows on his page his bald head after chemotherapy.
Therefore, blocking people who come to the governor's page - which is declared as an official public forum and conducted by administration officials on taxpayer money - is unnecessary and ultimately harmful.
In an interview with the Washington Post, a spokesman for Amelia Ches defended the governor's actions, arguing that blocking comments is simply their moderation.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolls, spammers and haters who are angry on the Internet.
The post spoke to some of the real people who Hogan had blocked.
And these are real people, not trolls, - a teacher, a businessman, a pastor who turn to their chosen leaders.
They all say their comments were respectful, meaningful, and not rude.
The pastor quoted the Bible, appealing to the fact that Hogan is a Catholic.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramana of Bowie, Maryland, did not express hatred, but asked about hate crimes.
"I wrote a polite comment that I was disappointed by the lack of his response to hate crimes and to other news of recent news," she wrote in the comment section in the Post.
"I also don't like the idea that when a lot of people leave comments on the same topic, some immediately say that this is the so-called cheating, instead of admitting that they are dealing with a large group of disgruntled citizens."
What the governor's subordinates call a "concentrated spam attack" would probably call "active life position."
In the era of Facebook, it's easy to edit your image by simply blocking critics or erasing negative comments.
This is a much less dusty work than before, when it required people to be sent, collected and burned newspapers with critical editors, or to arrest and shut the protesters.
But that's exactly what's happening now, only in the number.
Hogen is not the first official to be criticized for not wanting to listen to Facebook and other social media.
President Trump was sued from Twitter users who were banned on his Twitter account.
One of the first to make sweeping decisions on this topic this week in Virginia.
According to the U.S. District Judge from Alexandria James K. Ascension, chairman of the County's Supervisory Board, Laudon, violated the First Amendment by banning the voter on his Facebook account.
And in Kentucky, Republican Governor Matt Babin has filed claims to the American Union for the protection of civil liberties for his behavior on Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
During Washington's time, the era of available mail costs has made about the same coup as the Internet today.
From 1776 to 1800, the number of newspapers quadrupled, and the authors of anonymous letters greatly reduced his authority.
And even then, Washington dealt with anonymous trolls.
People under the pseudonyms "Yurikola," "Valerius," "Belizarius" and "Porceus" wrote letters to the newspapers mocking the decision of Washington.
According to historical documents collected by the George Washington Documents, his cabinet was overwhelmed by petitions criticizing his position on the Treaty of Friendship, Trade and Navigation.
But he didn't try to silence them.
The freedom of speech, dissent and speeches lies at the very foundation of our state.
True leadership means agreement with that.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for domestic conveniences in the club
Former European champion Ronan Rafferty hopes for domestic amenities for the next three days when the club "Renaissance in East Lotian" will host the twenty-fifth open Scottish golf tournament for senior athletes.
A native of Northern Ireland, who led the neighbourhood at the club "Archerfield Links," and moved in the direction of the final round last year, until he lost to Paul Ilsu, attached to a new place and performs the role of a representative of the tournament on behalf of the founder and director of the club Jerry Sarvadi.
"I've seen a club "Renaissance" being built, and we're watching him come to success with this event," Rafferty said.
The players will see this field at his best moment, it is in great condition.
Jerry did a great job of arranging this place.
He is a ardent adherent of this game and is proud of his achievements here.
This is a great demonstration for this field.
Englishman Ils is looking forward to defending the championship for the first time, despite the fact that in his 32-year career he won both in the European tournament and the European Challenge Tour.
"It's really a special feeling," said a Southport player.
I couldn't try to win the Extremadura Open because it was removed from the schedule a year after I won it.
To go back to this corner of the world is magical.
It's a great place to play golf.
The memories of last year are back, and for me and my wife Sharon was a very special impression of winning last year.
It was really a special time, and we will always remember him.
Returns to the battle in his native land of Gary Orr, who joined the European tournament for elderly athletes after he turned 50 earlier this year.
The event will be his first public appearance in Scotland since the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open.
"When you play at home, it's always a little more important," said Helennsboro Orr.
You want to perform well, but you feel that extra burden.
I enjoyed playing again and I showed good golf.
I'm happy with how everything is going on.
On the field of this trio will be joined by the former winner of the tournament "Masters Ian Wusnham and Major champions for elderly athletes Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNalty."
Orr and former captain of the Rider Cup, Sam Torrance, are two of the six Scots on the field; the rest are Andrew Aldcorn, Steven McAllister, Bill Longmuier and Ross Drummond.
Participation in the tournament is free, and parking costs 5 pounds per hour if there is one person in the car, and 10 pounds, if the person is two or more.
All revenue goes to the British Foam Fund.
British roads will learn to absorb harmful emissions
Unique tunnels above the highways, capable of absorbing carbon dioxide emitted by cars, are already being tested on the roads of the UK.
The transport agency of the country, according to the publication Autocar, reported positive test results of the 100-meter tunnel, installed on one of the highways in the north of the country.
The tunnel with a height of 6 meters is built of some new polymer materials that are able to absorb harmful substances contained in car exhaust.
However, the creation of a whole network of such tunnels is only part of the large-scale measures that the British authorities are going to take to improve the atmosphere.
In addition to the network of tunnels, the British are going to expand the network of charging stations for electric vehicles, implement a number of measures to reduce the flow of road, expand the use of commercial vehicles on electric traction and upgrade the fleet of heavy trucks.
According to official statistics, a quarter of all air pollution is for transport, and unsatisfactory air quality causes up to 40,000 premature deaths per year.
The Moscow City Court changed the punishment of the disabled Mamaev to a fine
The Moscow City Court changed the punishment of the disabled Anton Mamaev, sentenced to four and a half years of the colony, to a fine of 200 thousand. The rub.
This is reported by TASS.
Earlier, the prosecutor's office asked the court to replace the term with a conditional, explaining his request by the fact that Mamaev's disease "prevents his stay in prison conditions."
28-year-old Anton Mamaev was sentenced to four and a half years in prison with serving a sentence in a general regime colony for robbery, the victim of which was a former special forces fighter.
On July 19, the court at a visiting session in the pre-trial detention center released the man from custody.
Poverty and death in the Indonesian - Golden Land
Preparing lunch, Bardina Degeia does not use the stove.
It is rarely used.
In its wooden house in Enarothali, the capital of Paniai County in the rebellious Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually simply places sweet potatoes, which is called "Nota," right in the hearth.
After half an hour, the charred tuber is obtained and eaten with impatient, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the earthen floor - she does not have furniture - and it is here that she performs her work on the house, such as washing clothes with murky water from a nearby swamp.
The well-armored serves as a bucket in a room without a roof.
She is the youngest of her husband's four wives, and so she was not instructed to work in the field.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, it can be dangerous to work until late: many men from this village are unemployed, many drink, and there are soldiers.
"Nobody dares to walk in the village after five o'clock," she says.
It is a rare opportunity to see everyday life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was annexed to Indonesia in 1969 after a dubious referendum, when only 1,026 elders were forced to vote, raising their hands in public in front of the occupying troops.
The existing movement advocating independence from the Netherlands quickly turned its anger against the government of Jakarta, which retains tight control of the region, preventing foreign journalists and human rights defenders.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and Western Papua, and the independent state of Papua New Guinea occupies the eastern part of the island.
The city is as remote as the abandoned; the road here includes an hour and a half flight from Jayapura, the provincial administrative center, Nabir, and then a five-hour shaking on a hired car.
There is no public transport here.
The city with a population of about 19,000 consists of wooden houses covered with bamboo fences; roofs of corrugated steel are painted with rust in a variety of redishishes.
Few of the Indonesians, not to mention journalists, and almost none of the foreigners, have come here.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, the Pope Mayo Pago worshipped a god named Uga Tamei.
There were other changes.
"We were not accustomed to wearing these clothes," says Degeia, pointing out to his bright, hand-woven turban, a dark skirt and a bright shirt.
We used to wear only leaves on the body.
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, 28% of its population lives below the poverty line, and child mortality and literacy rates are among the worst in Asia.
But it's also an Indonesian gold land.
The world's largest and most lucrative gold mine, Grasberg, owned by the Phoenix-based company, is just sixty miles from Paniai, a highland province about the size of New Jersey, home to 153,000 people.
In 2015 alone, the company "Freeport" produced here gold and copper for about $ 3.1 billion.
In addition, Papua boasts reserves of forests, the cost of which is estimated at 78 billion dollars.
These wealth, however, entails one misfortune for the Papuans, ensuring that Indonesia's powerful armed forces retain their suffocating presence here.
According to the 2005 New York Times, between 1998 and 2004, the company paid local servicemen and units nearly $20 million, including up to $150,000 to one officer.
The demands of greater autonomy on the part of the Papuans threaten the existence of this gold vein and ruthlessly suppressed.
According to human rights defenders, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed by Indonesian military forces since 1969, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, the massacres in the indigenous highlands of Papua in the seventies can be considered genocide.
Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region last year alone.
"We will lose everything, the report published in 2016 by the Diocese of Brisbane contains evidence of atrocities committed in the preceding year, such as executions without trial, torture - especially frequent, as stated in another report, rape and electric shock - and brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
"It's hard to count the number of victims because the incidents happen every week," says Andreas Harsono, who is doing research in Indonesia for Human Rights Watch.
The Nuts drag on, as Papua's resources attracted an influx of immigrants from other areas of Indonesia.
The province's 3.5-million population is 83% Christian, but demographics change as Muslim economic migrants arrive from the densely populated Indonesian islands - Java, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javan benches, Yvarungi, sell fried chicken and a mixture of vegetables "gado-gado," served with peanut sauce.
The locals are trying to withstand competition.
Migrants began selling chicken and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the indigenous people of Papua, - explains Abeeth You, a twenty-four-year-old native of Paniai, who moved to Jayapura, the administrative center of the province, because of the work.
Because of this, the indigenous people of Papua - mother-mother (women) Papua - lost their market.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Djokovi, vowed to address inequality and rights violations in Papua during his 2014 presidential campaign.
On his way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta, a former carpenter enlisted the support of 27 of Papua's 29 counties, including Paniai.
But in Papua, almost nothing has changed, and the locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokoki, expecting him to fulfill our hopes of justice," he said.
In fact, just two months after the October inauguration of Jokvi Paniai survived the tragedy.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were on the street and sang Christmas anthems at the campfire in Enarothi when two Indonesian soldiers on a motorcycle broke out of the dark.
The frightened children told them they should include the headlights.
According to local pastor Jawed Tebai, one of the soldiers was offended by their tone and returned with four soldiers.
According to the victims and eyewitnesses, soldiers who were drunk, chased after the children and beat them with rifle butts.
Then one of the soldiers shot at a group of children.
One child, sixteen-year-old Julianus Eimo, was so beaten that he fell into a coma.
A couple of hours later, someone set fire to the nearby government building of the election commission, and the next day the situation worsened.
About a thousand Papuan men, women and children gathered on a football field in front of a local police station and a military command center to demand justice.
They brought with them ritual hunting bows and performed a veit, a dance of the Papuan tribe of Mee Pago: they ran in circles and portrayed bird singing.
Some protesters began throwing stones at the police station and a military base.
When the situation got heated, the soldiers on the inside of the radio was ordered: "If the crowd will resist more than three times, shoot them - so it sounded, as stated in the official document, which was seen by correspondents of the magazine "TIME," but which was not published in the local media.
Fifty-six-year-old Eremiyas Kajame, the head of the district of Who Koto in Enarothi, felt the approach of danger and called for peace, appealing to the crowd with a request to disperse home.
No one wanted to listen to him.
"When I turned, I suddenly got a bullet in my left wrist," he told the magazine, standing on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kayama still does not know who shot, but says that the bullet flew from the side of the soldiers gathered.
"There were a crowd, there were a lot of shots, he adds.
The local resident of Alfius Joow got three times, as his cousin, who witnessed the shooting, tells.
"I ran up to him and examined his body to make sure it was him," Yohanes told the magazine TIME Johannes, who, like many Indonesians, uses only one name.
I saw him dead... I kissed him.
General Yotje Mende, Papua police chief inspector, told reporters that his officers were only protecting their base because she was attacked.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," said Pugjo Sulytilio police spokesman in 2015.
This is a matter of life and death.
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and much more wounded.
News about the murders reached Jakarta only the next day.
Three weeks later, Djokovi gave an ardent speech in Jayakur, in which he expressed condolences to the families of the victims and vowed to address the issue of historical abuses of power in Papua.
"I want this situation to be settled immediately, so that it will never happen again in the future," he said.
In October 2016, the security minister, Viranto, said he would establish a non-judicial organization to end historical human rights violations.
But almost immediately went the excuses.
Most of the violations occurred long ago.
Some of them took place in the nineties or at the beginning of the zero.
The fact is that we certainly want to deal with these violations, but there are procedures that need to be done," he said.
Viranto then turned down his words, speaking with the June 5 magazine in Jakarta, and said he did not plan to establish an organization to deal with complaints in Papua.
Instead, he said, "Everything will be decided through the court."
Viranto, who was accused by the United Nations of "crime against humanity" in connection with the deaths of more than 1,000 people during the bloody vote for East Timor's independence in 1999, said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have already been resolved, including the incident in Poniai.
The families of the victims of Paniai met such statements with grim distrust.
"Over the past three years, I've been asked four times, but there have been absolutely no changes," Johannes said.
I am tired.
He says that years later he still lives in fear.
"I'm scared," he says.
I'm afraid the military will arrest me, I'm afraid I'll be shot dead.
His brother Jacobus also expressed the opinion that the residents of Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after he helped bury the four victims.
"After we buried the bodies, the military came for me, he says.
The shooting did not stop.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police fired at villagers in the neighboring Paniai district of Deiyayi.
During the clash between villagers and the manager of the construction company, who refused to help take the man unconscious to the hospital, one person was killed and 17 others were injured, including children.
A 20-four-year-old Raviana Dove, who drowned while catching fish in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
The angry residents of the village protested in front of the office of the construction site owned by the company.
According to police, the villagers threw stones at the officers, who in response fired warning shots.
But the locals claim that the mobile brigade (Indonesian special forces) began to shoot at the crowd and killed one person.
"We were in such a panic, we are afraid of retaliation," twenty-nine-year-old Domingue Badia, who lives near the hospital and saw the hastily delivering the wounded, told TIME magazine.
I hid in my house for two days.
The Parliament of Deiyai demanded that the officers involved in the incident be called to account, and the mobile police brigade to be recalled from the region.
Paniai has always been a sick place for the Indonesian government.
The lack of significant development causes dissatisfaction of the tribes of the mother, money, tribute and damal, scattered throughout the territory of the greened central highlands of Papua.
Many have joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), an insurgent army that claims to protect the rights of the Papuans by arranging sporadic attacks and raids of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM executives come from Paniai, including Taudius Yoga and Daniel Jodas Kogoya.
As a response in recent years, thousands of people have been arrested and unjustifiably detained by the military under the pretext of "protection of national independence."
Some never came back.
Among the population of Papua Paniai is considered a "sad, forgotten place."
Poverty increases discontent.
A small portion of rice sold in Enarothali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is equally unavailable.
People here grow everything they eat: mostly, a note, as well as some fruits and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the work of women, each of whom can care for four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
They usually keep most of the harvest for the family, and the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten tubers of the note cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities between indigenous Papuans and new migrants who arrived in large numbers since the introduction of new flights to Nabir Airport has increased.
Few existing vacancies usually go to more educated and wealthy migrants.
Papuans rarely have enough money or the skills to run their own competitive business.
Young people don't want to stay in the village. Because there's no job or money here," says John Gobai, chairman of the tribal council of Paniai.
The isolation keeps Papua away from the views of the rest of the world.
In addition, the restrictions on the work of the international media remain severe.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank Escuudi and Basil Longshan were deported from Papua for "inadequate inconsistency with the relevant organizations" despite being given rare permissions to video.
According to Felem Kine, deputy director for Asia for the organization "Human Rights Watch," the promises made during the election campaign of Jokowski, to lift restrictions on the work of the media in order to promote transparency and development, have not been fulfilled.
"Currently, foreign journalists trying to report from the rebellious eastern Indonesian provinces, Papua and West Papua are now facing new dangers: visa denial and blacklisting.
Lack of attention from the press means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely limited by Papua's immediate neighbors.
In March, six Pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands - appealed to the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "disaquaint-profile and widespread violations" in Papua, including the shooting in Paniai.
The same countries supported OPM in the past.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arramanata Nasir brushed aside the group's statement, telling reporters in Jakarta that Indonesia still has a democratic system and a free press, so it would be difficult to hide the evidence of human rights violations.
Locals want more foreign governments to pay attention to the situation.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by Dutch human rights Ambassador Kiys Van Baar, visited Jayapura on 4 May, the locals broke the silence, begging: "We want freedom," as the source, who was also present at the meeting but wished to remain anonymous.
New presidential elections will be held in Indonesia in 2019, but the Papuans say they are unlikely to vote for Jokovi again.
"Jokovi is a man who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by people involved in the shooting in Paniai," says Gobai, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokovi to know that the people of Paniai, other than they live in the shadow of the threat from the greedy army, are mired in poverty, and their education and health care are in a miserable state.
Gobay says the people of Paniai, like other Papuans, consider their vote given to Jokowi, a debt that he must pay.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the shooting in Poniai carried out the last symbolic act of disobedience: the body of one of the victims on the land plot directly opposite the police and military station was buried.
Knowing that justice will probably never prevail, they will at least not allow the guilty to forget their crimes.
"They killed a member of our family," says Jacobus, without raising his head.
What else did we do?
The fire for the second time covers the Dubai skyscraper "Torch"
The fire engulfed one of the world's tallest residential skyscrapers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to hastily leave the seventy-degree floor structure of 337 meters high.
This is the second fire that came from the high-rise building - which coincidentally is called Torch - in two years.
An evacuation was carried out in the building, no casualties were reported, and no operational news was provided about the cause of the fire.
We slept and woke up from the fire alarm and the screams of people.
We ran down the stairs, and it took us about ten minutes to go down the fiftieth floor," a resident of a skyscraper named George told Reuters.
According to the Dubai Civil Defense Authority, fire brigades extinguished the fire at about 4:00 local time (00:00 GMT) and cooled the building.
The Government said it was working to grant asylum to the victims.
The incident could bring back to the agenda the safety of materials used in the exteriors of high-rise buildings around the world.
In the course of the investigation by the administration of Torch, after the fire there in 2015, it was revealed that the plating - external panels used for decoration and isolation - the most affected.
In the United Kingdom, police said they believed that the system of insulation and plating panels of the Grenfell Tower in London could have accelerated the spread of a fire that occurred there in June, which killed about 80 people.
The growth of the tourist flow to Ida-Virumaa in June was minimal
As follows from the data that the correspondent of the portal rus.err.ee received in the Department of Statistics, in June 2017, the services of hotel enterprises of the North-East benefited a total of 20 519 local and foreign tourists, which is 125 people or 0.6% more than in the same period a year earlier.
At the same time, the number of local tourists has decreased, and foreign tourists have increased.
Thus, the foreign tourist flow increased in June by 7.3% (544 people) to 7,794 tourists.
The number of local tourists decreased by 3.2% from 12,944 to 12,525 people.
The number of Russian tourists increased the most noticeably in the region - by 8.9% or 318 people compared to June 2016.
In June 2017, 3,385 guests from the Russian Federation stayed for the night in Ida-Virumaa hotels.
Andrey Malakhov made it clear to fans who are to blame for his departure
Andrei Malakhov hinted to his fans on Instagram, who was to blame for his departure from the "First" channel.
So far, he has not commented on the rumors, but today he posted a fragment of the article of the newspaper "Vedomosti" for August 1.
The photo Malakhov signed the tag "boss milk pump."
Article on how to prevent the "burn out" of the employee and pay attention to his condition.
If you recall the numerous reports that the presenter could not find a common language with the newly arrived producer, who began to reformat "Let them talk," it becomes clear that he so transparently hinted, writes "KP."
As reported, TV presenter Andrey Malakhov is currently on vacation and did not sign an application for dismissal from the First channel.
The situation with the dismissal may clear up in the coming days.
In Afghanistan, the car bomber killed five soldiers
At least five soldiers were killed in an explosion in the Afghan province of Helmand, RIA Novosti reported.
According to police, the night before next to the checkpoint of the military in the county of Girshk exploded a mined car.
We know 20 dead.
On Friday morning in Girishka there was a new emergency.
Armed criminals attacked a currency exchange office.
The shooting between the assailants and the security forces continues.
Diver video filmed a shark that bites his camera
Diver and researcher Greg Skomal captured a video of a shark that bite his action camera GoPro.
The video was posted on Facebook by a division of the U.S. Agency for Marine Fisheries in Massachusetts, whose employee is Skomal.
The incident occurred on August 2 off the coast of the Cape Cod Peninsula in the northeast of the United States, according to the Necn portal.
The man during the snorkeling tried to shoot the shark on the camera, which he held on a special stick.
Noticing a person, the animal with a length of more than three meters swam to him.
The shark began to bite the camera, while not trying to attack the scientist.
Skomal explained that the predator did in a similar way to determine whether the gadget is edible.
The researcher added that the shark could easily destroy the device.
He also noted that such behavior of a sea animal was for scientists in the novelty.
Became known the cause of the mass fight in the Urals military center
A working group of senior officers of the Central Military District arrived at the Yelan Training Center, where a mass fight took place to investigate the circumstances of the incident.
Some details of this beating have already been revealed.
According to the public Mash, which appeared on the page "Vkontakte," the contractors of the Ural military unit number 31612 brutally fought because of the uncorrected bed.
It all began with the fact that an ordinary person named Sayan demonstratively ignored the order of the officer to fill the protruding sheet.
On the side of the officer stood soldiers from the sixth company.
The Sayana supported the first company.
In half an hour, 140 young guys were defeated in the barracks of beds and sinks, knocked out the glass.
More than a dozen people were injured in the mass fight.
The CVO denied the information about the stabbing.
The study found that at least one-fifth of passengers in the United States carry prohibited items on the plane.
The study found that more than 20 percent of air passengers deliberately or accidentally carried on baggage on board the plane through the inspections of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration prohibited items, including at least 6 percent boarded the plane, while not being carried out by being carried by prohibited knives or other sharp objects.
Almost 1 percent reported that they later found that they accidentally had firearms, ammunition or explosives.
Research conducted by charter company Stratos Jet Charters, Inc. and covering more than 1,000 people also showed that young passengers are more likely to break the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they deliberately tried to fly with something that ATB is prohibited, 19.7 percent were millennials compared to less than 15 percent of Generation X members.
Consciously past the employees of ATB most often carry food and water.
More than 3 percent admitted that they specifically carried through the inspection of sharp objects, and 2.2 percent of female respondents and 3.7 percent of male respondents admitted that they deliberately carried prohibited drugs on the plane.
The company said it had studied passengers across the country to find out how many of them were accidentally smuggled through airport inspections, and how much they did it knowingly.
It is expected that most often - consciously or unconsciously - smuggling through the inspection of those who fly the most.
As the company points out, the rules of the ATB are quite complex and confusing.
People often don't know exactly what liquids they can carry and in what amount.
Therefore, it is not surprising that most of what ATB takes is prohibited liquids.
Some time ago, people thought that ATB might consider it forbidden to carry a book.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international ones.
EPA CEO Pruitt refuses to postpone the implementation of the rules adopted under Obama to reduce emissions
The day after the lawsuit by the 15 states, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency canceled his decision to postpone the implementation of the Obama-based rules designed to reduce emissions of substances that pollute the air and lead to the formation of smog.
Pruitt explained his decision by the fact that now his agency is more than under previous administrations, listening to the needs of environmental regulators of individual states.
He did not mention the lawsuit against his previous position filed in the Federal Court of Appeal.
The dispute unfolded around the October 1 term, to which the states are to ensure compliance with the 2015 ozone standards at the ground level.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would postpone their compliance for one year to give his department more time to study the plan and avoid "non-compliance with local decisions or obstacles to economic growth."
Pruitt, who was appointed President Trump to his current position, was Oklahoma's Attorney General, has long been known as a consistent opponent of tightening environmental regulations.
After moving to Washington, Pruitt repeatedly blocked or postponed the introduction of norms that were opposed by the chemical or gas-oil industry.
The unexpected change of course on Wednesday is another legal defeat of the course taken by Puitt to return to the previous standards.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the head of the EPA exceeded its powers, trying to postpone the implementation of the Obama administration's rule requiring oil and gas companies to track and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement released on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that, drastically changing the course on ozone standards, he simply fulfilled the EPA's duty to cooperate with the states in a comprehensive process of timely implementation of the new standards.
"Under previous administrations, the EPA was often unable to meet the deadlines, after which he was waiting for lawsuits from activist groups and other individuals and discussed the timing during the settlement of the case," said Pruitt, who filed more than a dozen lawsuits against the EPA in his previous position.
"We do not believe in the regulation through trials, and we take the deadlines seriously.
We are also serious about our statutes and the power he gives us."
However, the EPA's statement said that Pruitt could at some point again use his "authorities to defer and other powers by law" to make sure that the rules "jcyjdfys on a clear course and on all available information."
Republicans in Congress insist on a broader revision of the rules on ozone.
The bill, approved by the House of Representatives last month, seeks to postpone compliance with the 2015 rules for at least eight years.
The Senate has not yet voted on this issue.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that filed a lawsuit against the EPA this week, said the group intended to continue legal pressure.
"The EPA's change in course - after our lawsuits - is an important victory in the fight for the health and safety of 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog that covers their cities," Schneiderman said.
The lawsuit of New York was joined by California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, as well as the District of Columbia.
Land-level ozone occurs when conventional pollutants from machines, power plants, refineries and other sources enter the atmosphere with sunlight.
The emerging one could cause serious breathing problems in sensitive people, resulting in thousands of premature deaths a year.
Health advocates and environmentalists welcomed the unexpected change in the course of Pruitt.
"It's sad to think about how much pressure it took to get this perfectly logical step from the person who is tasked with protecting the air we breathe," said Lori Anne Bird of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to resist the Trump administration's ideological campaign and protect those who pollute the air and their special interests."
IAAF Congress extends suspension of the All-Russian Athletics Federation
The Congress of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) voted to extend the suspension of the All-Russian Athletics Federation (VFLA).
Thus, the Congress supported the IAAF Council for the Reconstruction of the WFLA, which released a report on Monday, in which it recommended that the suspension be left in force.
For the extension of the suspension voted 166 people, against - 21, reports TASS.
The IAAF Council's report stated that the WFLA had made significant progress in meeting the conditions set by the Membership Reinstatement Council, but these conditions have not yet been fully met.
Due to the disqualification of the WFLA at the World Cup in London, Russian athletes were forced to perform under a neutral flag.
The team included 19 people admitted to the IAAF championship.
The WFLA underwent indefinite disqualification from the IAAF in 2015.
At that time, the report of the independent expert of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) Dick Pound, which spoke about numerous violations of the WADA regulations committed by Russian officials and athletes, was published.

Insulting defeat
As part of the 3rd round of the Fonbet-primacy of Russia among the teams of the PFL, the New Moscow "Chemist" held an away match against Kaluga.
A little more than 10 days ago, the opponents played each other in the Russian Cup, but this time the picture of the game was completely different.
"Chemist" did not give way to the opponent, but a second relaxation at the end of the match led to an insulting goal and a fiasco.
After the recent defeat from Kaluga with a score of 0: 3, many in advance prophesied the easy victory of the owners.
However, since the beginning of the meeting, the New Moscowers forced themselves to reckon and acted from the defense, but from a position of force.
In the 1st half, the Kalugas were more created and had an advantage in possession of the ball.
Another very high-quality match was played by Alexey Sirotin, who several times reflected dangerous blows and gave their partners confidence.
Unfortunately, in the attack, "Chemistry" lacked effort and luck to put the defense of "Kaluga" at a standstill and score the first goal on the road.
After the break, the game began to take place on counter courses.
Novomoskovsk players played more actively in the attack.
Anxious bells for our team were mistakes in the defense, which allowed the Kalugas to create a number of acute moments.
10 minutes before the end of the meeting, "Chemist" intercepted the territorial advantage and carried out several dangerous attacks.
But the Kalugaan experience played a role - they more competently and coldly spent the ending, waiting for their moment to take the gate.
After a dangerous attack, "Chemist" transferred the ball to the corner, the filing of which the owners of the field without resistance was sent to the goal.
The goal was created by Yuri Dubrovin.
In the reporting meeting, "Chemist" demonstrated a good game, but suffered an insulting defeat.
Ahead of our team is waiting for another departure - on August 11 at 19 o'clock in Moscow at the stadium "Torpedo" named after Eduard Streltsov, the New Moscow team will fight with the favorite of the group "Center" FC Ararat, which is composed of Roman Pavlyuchenko, Marat Izmailov, Igor Lebedenko, Alexey Rebko.
Come and support "Chemist!"
The place and time of the meeting of the New Moscowers is 18 h. 30 minutes near the store "Magnolia" (East, d.2, korp.
Composition of "Chemistry": Sirotin, Manokhin (k), Romashchenko, Shayunov, Khomutov, Gogia (Ostrakin), Dudayti, Ryzhov, Belyanin (Adoevtsev), Andreychenko (Lygin)

According to published transcripts of telephone conversations, Trump pressed Mexico about payment for the wall at the border
The Washington Post has published transcripts of telephone conversations between US President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On January 27, during a telephone conversation with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieta, Trump insisted that he stop publicly claiming that he would not pay for the planned wall on the border.
The U.S. president scolded him for publicly speaking out against the wall, and according to leaked information, he said: "You can't tell the press."
Trump began his campaign with a promise to build a wall along the southern U.S. border and vowed to force Mexico to pay for the project.
In the published transcript of his first telephone conversation with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull also found a hot quarrel.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement under which the U.S. should accept refugees heading to Australia, "funny," "bunate," and stupid, and insisted that because of the agreement concluded by the Obama administration, he would look like an idiot, as he intended to stop the resettlement of refugees in the United States.
Trump concluded the conversation by telling Turnbull that it was the most unpleasant conversation in the whole day.
The bodies of the victims in Abkhazia tourist sent by plane from Sochi to St. Petersburg
The plane, owned by the airline "Russia," on board which are the bodies of the dead in Abkhazia, flew at 20:15 Moscow time from Sochi to St. Petersburg, reports TASS.
On the site of the final point of the following, the board will be met by employees of the ritual agency, as well as representatives of the city's mayor's office, Deputy Minister for Resorts and Tourism of Abkhazia Astamyr Ahba told reporters.

64 people, including 35 citizens of the Russian Federation and 29 citizens of Abkhazia, with injuries of varying severity were taken to medical institutions of the Republic.
Currently, seven people remain in the hospital, the rest are discharged.
The study of the Russian influence on the American elections will be dealt with by a grand jury
Special Prosecutor for Russia Robert Mueller convened a grand jury in Washington, which will study the influence of Russia on the US presidential election in 2016, according to the newspaper The Wall Street Journal and Reuters.
A grand jury is a group of ordinary citizens who collect evidence of potential criminal offenses and have the right to interrogate witnesses under oath.
The collected materials will be studied by the special prosecutor and will decide whether they are sufficient to face charges.
The convening of the grand jury gives Mueller additional powers to gather testimony.
One of the topics of the investigation of the jury, which began work a few weeks ago, will be the details of the meeting of the son of then-presidential candidate Donald trump with the Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.
To check the details of this meeting, held in June 2016, previously promised and Mueller.
They've already been studied by the FBI.
At the end of July, it was reported that Donald Trump Jr. expanded the staff of his lawyers.
Trump Jr. previously said that from a meeting with Veselnitskaya, he was waiting for compromising the headquarters of the candidate from the Democratic Party Hillary Clinton, but no exposing documents were presented, and in the end it was about adoption.
In early August, a number of media reported that Trump Jr.'s statement about the meeting with Veselnitskaya was literally dictated by Trump Sr.
The White House clarified that the president did not dictate anything, but simply used his authority, which any father would do.
Deputy Mayor of Penza detained in the workplace
Deputy head of the administration of Penza Irina Shirshina was detained for 48 hours on behalf of the Investigative Committee in his workplace, reports RIA Novosti.
Official reports from law enforcement agencies on this issue have not yet been received, but the press service of the SU SC assured that they will soon follow.
The mayor's office of Penza has not yet commented on what happened.
Irina Shirshina is one of five deputy heads of the Penza administration.
She oversaw urban planning and land relations, holding this position since April 2015.
Prior to that, she worked for a long time as the head of the department of the State Zilzhilstroitekhinekhinspection of the Penza region.
Irina Shirshina raises three minor children, it is noteworthy that once again becoming a mother a year ago, she refused maternity leave and returned to work.
Of course, there are no spaceports or launch vehicles in Mexico.
But there was established in 2010. The space agency and the desire to develop their own space program.
And the installation of the bust of Yuri Gagarin is a tribute to the first person who visited space.
Unlike Soviet-era monuments that are being demolished in some countries, the monuments of Gagarin, on the contrary, "step around the planet."
In 2012. The monument was erected in Houston near the former NASA headquarters.
In London, a monument on the territory of the Royal Observatory was erected in honor of the 50th anniversary of the first flight into space.
There is a monument to Gagarin in Germany in the city of Erfoot, where our cosmonaut visited in 1963.
The monument in Karlovy Vary (Czech Republic) escaped the demolition in 1992. Thanks to the public's protests, it was moved from the city center to the square in front of the local airport.
In the year of Gagarin's 70th anniversary, a monument to Yurius Gagarin appeared in Riga.
This sounds the name and surname of the first cosmonaut in Latvian, and it looks like if he was 70 years old.
Murder of Morse Ford: activists will lose Lynch's courts on stage to call for justice
Ford Mercury in 1948 drove past the spectators in the village of Monroe in Georgia and rushed to the small bridge Morse Ford.
When the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, drove up to the bridge, a group of white men with guns blocked her way.
The main - a middle-aged man in a suit in a thin strip - dragged on with a cigar and looked through the windshield.
Those who sat inside trembled with fear.
"We need that nigger, Roger!" - the man exploded.
"Get him out of the car!"
The piercing screams ripped the silence when a young black man was pulled out of the front seat.
Luckily, this terrible scene, which took place on July 22, is just a staging.
But when a loop was thrown on the rocker's neck, almost all the audience and really held their breath.
Since 2005, activists have been returning to the Morse Ford Bridge to re-defeate the night when the cukluxclan lynched two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mei Murray Dorsey in 1946.
No one was convicted of these murders.
"It's astonishing that no one has been arrested for all these years - although we see them next to ourselves; although we know who they are," says Tyrone Brooks, who helped organize the production.
"It's a stain on our history and it's a stone on our souls."
Brooks, 71, is a former member of the Georgia Congress, who has been fighting for human rights all his life.
For him, the performance is a dramatic call to action and an annual reminder to the people of Monroe that injustice has not been corrected.
"We want investigations, we want to finish, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we have to get justice," he says.
"We cannot move on to healing and reconciliation until we achieve justice."
The coroner covers the body of one of the victims of lynching at Mors Ford on 27 July 1946.
According to FBI materials obtained by EBC News, more than 50 people in Monroe and neighboring counties were suspected of participating in lynching.
No one was charged.
Although the suspects have been free for decades, human rights activists say that the city has always known two related motives of vigilantes: politics and sex.
In April 1946, the Supreme Court's ruling allowed black citizens to vote for the first time in the primaries to be held that summer.
Around the same election, according to the FBI, the black user Roger Malcolm stabbed Barnett Hesterer, a white landowner, a woman in a knife.
Brooks says that rumored to be in the city, Hester slept with Malcolm Dorothy's wife, and that the baby she was supposed to give birth was not from her husband.
According to the FBI, on July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a large white landowner, paid $600 in bail to rescue Malcolm from prison.
He went to prison with Dorothy and their cousins, May Murray and George Dorsey.
But when they were driving from prison and approaching the Mors Ford Bridge, a crowd of vigilantes surrounded the car.
"It turns out that Harrison organized and commanded the murders," the FBI's report said.
"It is also clear that there was a conspiracy between state and city law enforcement agencies, which not only took part in the killings, but also destroyed evidence and hid the identity of witnesses."
Brooks calls it shorter.
"It was an attempt on voting rights," he says.
"They were all killed to send a signal to blacks in the city: if you register and vote, you will be the same with you."
For almost a decade, Cassandra Greene runs an annual performance reproducing that lynching at the Morse Ford Bridge.
Her performance is visual, he captures the viewer and tells the story of the deep racism that many would like to count, no more in America.
It's hard to watch and it's even harder to turn away, but Greene thinks that's the main thing.
"We don't want to talk about Lynch's ships because they are showing us our own ugliness," she says.
"But I can't build a relationship with you unless you hear me or hear me out of it."
Rehearsals of this year's performance began in June, and on the first day of almost 30 actors - a dozen whites, the rest of the blacks - gathered in the room and listened to a polished review of the play over the years.
Wade Marbo was a director with Greene.
He played the role of the main member of the clan for several years, but says that the role has never become easier.
"I think I got dirty because it's not the person I am," Marbo says.
"But I think it's very important to remember this story because we don't want to go back at that time."
In the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascon, who play Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester, repeat their roles.
The spectal begins with Malcolm, enraged that Hester sleeps with his wife Dorothy, screams and pushes him.
"I said, nigg, get out of my house!"
Screaming Rascon in response.
A blow is heard.
And at the same time, all (at least all black actors) are laughter.
Green laughs the loudest.
"What is it," Ascona asks.
He is worried and embarrassed.
Am I a better player?
"No," Green says through laughter.
"I just don't think the whites said 'nigg'."
"Yes," one black performer laughs.
"You must call a firm 'r'."
And also the energy in the room changes: the discomfort is replaced by a feeling of comradeship.
Everyone should do everything right, not only for the sake of the play, but also for the memory of the four killed people.
The scene begins again.
This time, when Rascon says the word on the letter "n," it turns out to be clear and sharp.
No one laughs.
The show ends brutally and quickly.
Screams, shots, and then silence.
A woman in mourning black clothes stands above the bodies of the actors and performs the sad song of Billy Holiday "Strange Fruit."
Her voice is interrupted through the word.
A hundred yards from it, fifty spectators wipe from their eyes tears and sweat.
Among the viewers is almost equal number of black and white.
One couple came from Ithaca, New York to see the show; many live nearby.
They all endured the heavy spirit of Georgia for almost eight hours while Brooks took them on a pilgrimage to Malcolm and Dorsey's graves.
Until this point, the murders remained only history, but now that they are standing in the same place where people were lynched, it seems that their ghosts are in the same air.
When the last note of the song subsides, Green invites people to come closer and examine the bodies.
Children bend their heads, touch the paint that depicts blood, and still bodies and whisper something to each other.
"They are not really dead," one little boy mutters as if to remind myself of this.
After a few minutes, Greene thanks the audience, and all of a sudden it all ends.
The actors drop the ropes off their neck and wipe the tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbo, a man in a suit who played the main dollchukxclan.
Nick Rascon hugs the other two actors and suddenly, crying, falls into their arms: the emotional load of the play finally fell on him.
"It's okay," one woman whispers.
"We know that your heart is good.
You had reasons for that."
Later, the audience sits down to dinner with the actors.
At one table, a white couple from Atlanta are discussing a play with a black couple, with which they just met.
Denise Daplinski barely searches for words to describe what she feels after the performance.
"It's hard to listen to these terrible, creepy words, and the actions... of people who look like you and who do it because they look like you," she says.
"After that, the lynchings are still happening," she adds, "only now it's called what the police are shooting."
In another corner of the room, Tyrone Brooks took general attention, who remembers his work as a human rights defender for food.
He says he's already started planning next year's show.
"The staging inspires us because it not only describes the horror of what we've experienced, but also teaches us," he says.
"Because if you don't learn from this lesson, it can happen again.
Those who do not study their history, who do not know their history, are doomed to repeat it."

The same subpoenas were received by Navalny himself and another associate of the oppositionist - Nikolai Lyskin.

Attack on a convoy in Kabul: Nato soldier killed in suicide bombing
According to official sources, a suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital, Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, according to NATO.
According to unverified data from local sources, as a result of the incident in the city district of Karabakh, three civilians were also killed.
The blast was the last of the bloodshed that struck Afghanistan this month: on Tuesday, an explosion in a mosque in Herat killed more than 30 people.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
According to NATO, the explosion that occurred on Thursday evening, occurred when a joint convoy with the Afghan army was attacked with the help of an improvised explosive device.
According to the report, all the wounded are in stable condition and receive treatment in the American military hospital at the Bagram airfield.
Correspondents report that the growing power of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in Karabakh is a major source of concern for NATO forces deployed in Bagram.
According to the UN, in the first half of 2017, there were at least 1,662 civilian casualties in Afghanistan, and about 20% of them were in the capital.
At the end of July, the suicide bombing of a suicide bomber in a car caused the death of at least 30 people in the Shia area in Kabul.

According to correspondents, the terrorist attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also created a crisis of public confidence in the government, its lines of conduct, and especially the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
Environmental Protection Agency cancels decision to postpone air pollution law after lawsuits
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has overturned the Obama-era law, which states should limit air polluting emissions a day after 15 states sued the agency because of this step.
On the evening of Wednesday, the Environmental Protection Agency announced its decision to implement the so-called ozone measurements of 2015, stressing that this step shows the Agency's willingness to cooperate with the states.
"We believe in dialogue with our partners in the states and responsiveness towards them," said Scott Pruitt, head of the Environmental Protection Agency.
In June, Pruitt announced the intention of the Environmental Protection Agency to postpone ozone measurements in which existing air pollution is measured in different parts of the country to determine where it needs to be reduced so that it meets more stringent air purity standards, by one year, until October 2018.
On Tuesday, a group of 15 states, mostly democratic, along with the Federal District of Columbia filed a lawsuit claiming that it was illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration is trying to roll back a wide range of environmental regulations imposed by previous President Barack Obama as part of a broader program aimed at brilliant economic growth.
But actions in this direction have sparked resistance from Democrats and environmental organizations concerned about the possible impact of large emissions on public health.
The website of the Environmental Protection Agency says that the use of ozone-containing air to breathe can worsen lung function and exacerbate respiratory symptoms, such as asthma.
European Business Association opposes new anti-Russian sanctions
The Association of European Businesses expressed disagreement with the US economic sanctions against the Russian Federation.

The European business brings together more than 500 companies from the EU and the European Free Trade Association.
The Association urges the heads of state and government of the EU, the United States and Russia to develop a new line of conduct that would separate business from politics and find a common, mutually acceptable solution in the spirit of peace and harmony.
Deputies ask the police to limit the movement on the embankment in Pskov
Pskov people's deputies sent an appeal to the head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in the city of Sergei Surin on the problem of movement along the embankment of the Great River.
Deputies of the Gorum Konstantin Bolotin, Grigory Voporenkov and Valery Lesnikov believe that motorists prevent people from walking and resting in this place.
In their opinion, control of drivers will help make this territory more calm and safer.

It turns out that major repairs and beautifications are carried out in vain.
Sports and children's playgrounds because of cars become uncomfortable.
According to the Pskov Information Agency, in the evenings, the central embankment is patrolled by the staff of the motorbike of the PPS and paratroopers.
Thanks to them, the number of cars is getting less, but the movement does not stop completely.

Mikey Garcia and Vasily Lomachenko meet for the first time, there is a conversation about the possibility of a decisive match
Vasily Lomachenko and Mike Garcia, who appear to be steadily moving towards holding the most exciting boxing match in weight up to 147 pounds in the near future, met for the first time on Thursday.
They occupied separate rooms in the office premises of the ESPN Canal in Los Angeles, while Garcia, the undefeated lightweight champion of the World Boxing Council, passed through the corridor to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization's champion in the second half-lightweight.
After Garcia's unanimous victory over the former world champion in four weight categories, Erian Broner on Saturday on the showtime channel are among the top five boxers, regardless of weight categories.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said, "How are you, champion?"
Good luck to you.
Lomachenko defends his belt in a duel with Miguel Marriaga on Saturday at seven o'clock in the evening on the ESPN channel.
When the boxers posed for the photo, Lomachenko's manager Egis Klimas noticed that the potential decisive battle between them would be the right thing.
"I've been in the middle of the weight before," Garcia reminded.
I climbed up to the category for the sake of Broner [up to 140 pounds], but I'm not that big.
I'm not enough for 140.
I want to go down to the little one.
And he needs to go up to a little one [up to 135 pounds], and then we'll get a fight.
That's what the fans want.
Let's get them to do this.
Lomachenko agreed.
Boxa needs this fight.
Klimas asked if the fight should be broadcast through the PPV service as part of the strategy he adheres to that Lomachenko's debut in weight 135 later this year to schedule a meeting with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts) next summer, who is also interested in fighting the winner of the fight between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell in the world's 23rd.
"Fight can be on the PPV, because all the fans asked for it," Garcia said, expressing later readiness to fight on the channel that will offer the best financial conditions.
We are the main names.
No other names will cause such an interest.
Once they're ready...
Garcia said that he considers Lomachenko an amazing boxer and, perhaps, will visit his Saturday match.
But Lomachenko did not immediately shower Garcia with praise and said that, in his opinion, the champion in three scales from Riverside looks very slow, I'm sorry, Mikey... You were asking for a knockout.
Garcia said he focused on showing the impact of the strike and then the box.
They both said they felt the tension growing before their own fight.
This fight should take place.
No other fight is so much of interest and talk.
I'm more than happy to work on him," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: I was waiting for someone from the top boxers, and here he is, Mikey.
It'll be a great fight.

New test results for assessing the age of asylum seekers in Sweden
The latest results of Swedish asylum seekers tested for a new method of medical assessment of age show that more than 80 percent of those tested were evaluated as persons over the age of 18, but not everyone trusts the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish National Forensic Medicine Agency (Rettsmedicinalverket) began to conduct tests earlier this year.
They were designed to make an assessment of the age in the asylum process more accurate, after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticized for failing to determine the real age of some refugees who claimed to be minors.
At the moment, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases for testing, and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of 2,481 tests for the period between mid-March and July 31, 2017.
Eighty percent of the tested (2002) were estimated as 18 or older people, and in another 25 cases, the Forensic Medicine Agency estimated that the test person is 18 years or older.
In the case of 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person is "probably less than 18."
Tests are carried out only in cases where the age of a person is in doubt.
According to Johan Geransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results correspond to the results for the past months.
"We don't see a big difference with statistics in the past months, the numbers are quite appropriate," he told the portal.
The high proportion of cases in which people were assessed as over the age of 18 does not necessarily indicate that asylum seekers have lied about their age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and reported that in 442 cases, the age of 18 years or more.
However, after considering the 581 published results, the newspaper "Svenska Dagbladet" found that in 243 cases people openly stated that 18 he was being executed this year.
The method of conducting a medical assessment of the age, consisting of making x-rays of wisdom and tomography of the knee joints and give them to the analysis of dentists and radiologists, also caused criticism in some instances.
One of the skeptics is the endocrinologist of the Karolinska Institute, Claude Marcus, part of whose work is to assess the biological maturity of people in order to determine whether they have gone through puberty earlier or later than usual.
I had reasons to think about it, and I don't think we should use the measurement methods that are being used now.
The biological age is determined very inaccurately.
"If we can't identify it with certainty, we shouldn't pretend we can," he told the newspaper.
However, Geranssen from the agency of forensic medicine spoke in favor of the accuracy of the tests: in general, we can say that the risk of mistake a child for an adult is small.
With the greatest risk we are faced when a person is soon 18, in this case he is about 10 percent.
I'll know if you can run for president.
During a working trip to Buryatia, Vladimir Putin said that he was ready to think whether he would run for the post of President of Russia in the elections in 2018, Interfax reports.
This statement was a reaction to the request of the residents of the village of Cheremushka, Buryat region.
During a videoconference dedicated to the elimination of the fire in Buryatia and the Irkutsk region, the interlocutor addressed Putin with the words: "Vladimir Vladimirovich, we have a request to you: when the next presidential election is there, we all ask you to run again for this post."
"Okay, I'll think so, thank you," the president said in response.
On July 28, the press Secretary of the President of Russia Dmitry Peskov commented on the statements of some media that the election headquarters of Vladimir Putin will be headed by the head of the presidential administration of the Russian Federation Anton Vaino.
Peskov called these assumptions "on nowhere based, hypothetical reasoning."
"So far, there are no headquarters, the creation of headquarters is far away, the election campaign is far away," Peskov said.
"So far, this is not on the agenda," Peskov said.
West Virginia Governor Says He's Going to Another Party
West Virginia's governor, Democratic Party spokesman Jim Justice, announced Thursday during a rally with President Trump that he was joining another party.
"Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have distanced themselves from me," Governor Justice said.
Today I am telling you with many prayers and many thoughts... Today I tell you, the people of West Virginia, I can no longer be useful to you by remaining a Democratic governor.
The rally exploded with applause.
"So tomorrow I'll change my registration for a Republican," Justice added.
As a coach, I'd tell you that it's time to play differently.
Earlier, Trump promised that an important statement will be made at a rally in West Virginia.
Trump won in West Virginia with a margin of 42 percent, and Justice did not support the Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who, according to Forbes, is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, as he inherited the coal business from his father.
His fortune is estimated at $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee on Thursday night issued a statement that Governor Justice's move to another party is another blow to the Democratic Party, which is more hampering than working to make our country great again.
"Given just 15 governors and the control of the smallest number of state legislatures in history, the statement of the Governor of Justice is only another rejection of the party, which has no leaders from the top to the bottom and is not able to find a positive, unifying reports, - said in a statement CBS News representative of the National Committee of the Republican Party Ronna McDaniel.
Heavyweight cat named Mr. Prettych found the house thanks to social networks
The kennel of the city of Pittsborough (North Carolina, USA) built a cat named Mr. Beauty weighing more than 14 kilograms after it became famous thanks to the Internet.
This is reported by Mashable.
At the end of June, a photo of the cat was published on the Facebook account of the cat with a request to find its owner, because "someone was fed to him before."
In the comments, users noted that the expression of the face of the animal can become a new meme.
The publication received more than 3.2 thousand likes and 15 thousand comments.
In the comments, dozens of people expressed a desire to shelter Mr. Beauty.
As a result, he was handed over to Angela Frazee, who promised to take care of his excess weight.
In an interview on the radio WNCN, the American said that she already had a similar experience: she took home a cat weighing about 10 kilograms, and now it weighs a little more than five.
In July, Reddit users drew attention to a cat from Australia with unusually long paws.
The post with a photo of the animal collected more than 68 thousand views.
Commentators noted that she could have made a career in the modeling business.
Coe praised Russia's sincere apology in connection with the doping scandal
International athletics specialist Sebastian Coe on Thursday praised what he called sincere apologies from Russia in connection with the doping scandal, but reiterated that now is the wrong moment to allow the country to participate in sports competitions again.
Russian Federation of the Federation of Athletics Dmitry Shlyakhtin said at a congress of the International Association of Athletics Federations, which was held on the eve of the World Athletics Championships, that the removal of his country from sports competitions was fair and that he was determined to fight doping.
He apologised to all athletes who had stolen gold and silver medals at the competition.
Despite his comments, the Congress of the International Association of Athletics Federations voted to maintain the suspension imposed in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) published a report on the evidence found for the use of doping, funded by the state.
"It seemed to me that today's answer, today's report was very sincere," the president of the International Association of Athletics Federations Coe told reporters.
All the advice and the whole Congress liked... that the Russian Federation itself recognizes that it has experienced extremely hot times and is now doing everything possible to take care of the restructuring of the federation.
Coe said he also liked that Russia had agreed to the criteria for its recovery.
I believe that this was a very constructive day and that we are moving forward, but Congress supports the recommendations of the special commission, according to which now is not the time to restore Russia in rights," - said Coe.
In the next few months, we have to do everything we can to resolve this situation.
Our leading principle was our desire to separate clean athletes from the tarnished system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes, meeting the strict criteria of the International Association of Athletics Federations, will compete under a neutral flag in the World Championships in Athletics, which will begin on Friday in London.
The head of the special commission of the International Association of Athletics Federations Rune Andersen said on Monday that a number of requirements have yet to be met to restore Russia.
As he told reporters in London after a report made on the board of the International Association of Athletics Federations, drug treatment testing is still not sufficiently carried out, and detached coaches are still doing their job.
The court arrested a Ukrainian journalist suspected of treason
Detained by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) journalist Vasily Muravitsky was arrested for two months, reports the SBU.
An employee of the online publication "Journal of Zhytomyr" is suspected of treason by posting his publications on Russian websites and infringing on the territorial integrity of Ukraine.
At the same time, Russia does not support the measures of the Ukrainian authorities against the journalist, considering this a "barbarous policy" against the media.
Two years after the peak of the migration crisis in Europe, Italy decided on a limited military operation in the Mediterranean.
The patrol ship "Commander Borsini" entered the territorial waters of Libya, then together with the Navy of this country to stop the influx of illegal migrants.
The decision to launch the operation was made by the Italian parliament on Wednesday.
Rome agreed with the internationally recognized Libyan government, which, however, does not control much of the country.
The Libyan parliament, which is based in Tobruca, accused Italy of violating Libya's sovereignty.
And the commander of the Libyan National Army, Field Marshal Haftar, gave his subordinates an order to oppose the Italian ships.
In Rome, however, they said that they do not believe these threats and intend to send another military ship to Libyan territorial waters.
The situation was discussed last week at the talks between Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni and the head of the European-recognized Libyan cabinet Faiz Saraj.
The Italian authorities went to the establishment of a naval mission to combat illegal migration after the statistics on the number of illegal immigrants who came to the country from Libya were published in July: 95,000 people since the beginning of the year.
The government said that the resources for the reception of migrants have been exhausted.

Olga Zemlyak and Olesya Povh, specializing in the short distances, are excluded from the Ukrainian national team for the 2017 World Cup in London.
This is reported on the website of the Federation of Athletics of the country (FLAU).
This decision was made by the Executive Committee of the organization in connection with the initiation of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) of disciplinary proceedings against athletes.
From the composition of the Ukrainian delegation also excluded coach Zemlyak Sergey Basenko.
According to Sportarena, IAAF suspects athletes in the use of doping.

How Football's Financial Rules Will Influence Neymar to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unrestricted spending by European football clubs will not prevent the world record for the transfer of Neymar from Spanish "Barcelona" to the French "Paris Saint-Germain."
Whatever the consequences may come further along the chain, for "Paris Saint-German" by UEFA, the governing body that controls European football, in whose government the teams to forbid participation in the prestigious tournament "League of Champions."
From the financial rules of the financial play introduced by UEFA in 2011, it follows that PSG will eventually have to show that Neymar's transfer was financed without major losses.
Barcelona paid 222 million euros ($262 million) only to release the Brazilian from the contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
PSG can definitely fork out to hire Neymar and add it to the galaxy of other stars, given the funding of the team from the energy-rich ruling family of Qatar.
Clubs have the right to spend large sums on the purchase of players, but they have to balance them at the expense of legitimate sources of income in order to reach the threshold of profitability in their football business.
Michel Platini was elected president of EFFA in 2007.
The former French footballer believed that clubs that went on in huge debts in their quest for success, in fact, cheated and risked ruin if the banks or owners stopped financing.
In 2011, IFF stopped focusing on club debts and instead switched to tracking their losses.
As a result of this business model, which was originally used by Roman Abramovich in Chelsea in 2003 - to buy a club with good potential, and then seriously spent in order to improve the team and create a global brand - has become an ineffalic plan.
During this three-year period of valuation, exciting 2018, clubs can incur losses of 30 million euros.
And despite the shame that Platini was disgraced from the presidency in 2015, his successor to UEFA Alexander Ceferin is still determined to restrain excessive spending.
"Of course, I'm alive, and we're going to push the rules," I'm telling the agency "Associated Press Andrea Traverso," EFFP in UEFA said last week.
Although PSG will pay for the purchase of Neymar's contract at a time, he can distribute this amount for the reporting period of his contract.
Neymar signed a five-year contract, so the transfer cost can be shown in the annual reporting as a cost of 44.4 million euros over the next five years.
During the first wave of the sanctions of the IF's 2014 FFM, as well as Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City, the heaviest sanctions were imposed.
The $60 million fine was fined (at $82 million), which was later reduced to 20 million euros, and was ordered to limit the composition of its team in the Champions League during the 2014-1015 season 21 players instead of the usual 25.
UEFA is tracking clubs that may try to outsmart its financial inspections by inflating their revenues at the expense of companies linked to the club's owners.
Although the Qatari company could sponsor PSG, but if the amount of financing was considered to be higher than standard market prices, UEFA would not have allowed it to be considered a legitimate income.
That's what happened in 2014, when UEFA decided that the amount of funding for PSG from the Qatar Tourism Authority was bloated.
It was reported that part of Neymar's earnings in PSG could come in the form of payments from the organizing committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.
But "PSGs and Qatar-2022 deny that Neymar will become the ambassador of the World Cup, and such a maneuver could easily be detected by UEFA inspectors.
Past sanctions imposed on PSG mean that UEFA will be more attentive to monitor any attempts to circumvent the rules.
As reported on Thursday, persons familiar with the situation, UEFA did not conduct preliminary discussions with PSG about the transfer of Neymar.
They spoke to the agency "Associayed Press" on the condition of anonymity, as they are not authorized to discuss the situation of PSG.
According to the latest published reports, in 2015-1016, PSG received more than 10 million euros of profit at a turnover of 542.4 million euros.
The reporting for the last financial year has not yet been published.
PSG expects that Neymar's arrival will be a favorable ground for sponsorship deals, the sale of paraphernalia and T-shirts with the team's logo.
The club assumes that the turnover will grow by at least 30 percent due to the hiring of a new player.
Undoubtedly angry that one of the best players is leaving, the Spanish league tried to prevent the transfer of Neymar, saying that PSG will violate the financial firm.
"This is an obvious case of "financial doping," La Liga president Javier Tebas told the Spanish newspaper, with the president of La Liga, referring to the ultimate owner of Qatar.
Arsenal coach Arsene Wenger, whose club belongs to the American sports magnate, shares La Liga's doubts about the club's funding by the state.
"This is all the consequences of the equity participation, and it has completely changed the landscape of football over the past fifteen years," Wenger said on Thursday.
When the club belongs to the country, everything is possible.
It becomes very difficult to observe financial fair play, because the country can have many ways and many reasons to be represented by such a serious player.
The order and places of the oath will be determined by the President
Where and how new Russian citizens will swear allegiance to the Russian Federation, the President will determine - such amendments to the second reading in the relevant law were developed by the State Duma Committee on Legislation and State Construction.
A week ago, the deputies planned to directly determine the procedure for taking the oath in the law.
From the ceremonial oath will be released children under the age of 18, as well as incapacitated, follows from the amended text of amendments to the bill "On citizenship of the Russian Federation" (there is "Izvestia"), which the Committee will consider on July 11 before the second reading at its meeting.
The idea of taking an oath when entering Russian citizenship instead of formally signing documents, President Vladimir Putin supported on June 6 during a meeting with the speaker of the state Duma Vyacheslav Volodin.
The deputies formalized this idea in the form of an amendment to the second reading of the bill, providing for the cancellation of the decision to issue citizenship to those who were subsequently convicted of a number of crimes of a terrorist or extremist nature: for example, for public appeals to terrorism or its public justification in the media or on the Internet. 2 st. 205.2 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation), as well as for the theft of an aircraft, train or water transport, but only if this act is related to terrorism. 4 st. 211 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation).
According to the bill, his logic was as follows: by drawing up documents for citizenship, a person is signed under the promise to comply with Russian legislation - getting on the path of extremism, he violates this promise.
The draft law in April was submitted to the State Duma by the leaders of the Duma factions Vladimir Vasilyev ("United Russia"), Gennady Zyuganov (CPRF), Vladimir Zhirinovsky (LDPR), Sergei Mironov ("Fair Russia") and the speaker of the State Duma Vyacheslav Volodin.
On May 19, the deputies adopted it in the first reading.
Last week, the State Duma Committee on State Construction and Legislation approved the text of the bill for the second reading, but now it has been reworked again.
Now it says that the order of taking the oath will be established by the President of the Russian Federation.
Earlier, parliamentarians were going to describe the procedure directly in the law "On citizenship of the Russian Federation," indicating that the ceremony should be held in a solemn atmosphere in front of the state emblem and the flag of Russia in the presence of the representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
However, from the text of the bill it was not clear where such an event should take place - a list of places where it is possible to place the coat of arms of the Russian Federation, is regulated by the relevant federal constitutional law.
These include the courts, the cabinets of heads of state bodies of subjects, municipalities, judges, prosecutors, heads of federal executive bodies, etc.
Most likely, it could be the registry offices.
To declare a solemn oath that those who want to obtain Russian citizenship will be after officials check their documents.
But the Russian passport will be received only after he takes the oath, it follows from the revised text.
A week ago, the draft said that the oath should precede the signing of the decree.
The updated text says that Russia will be swingn from the age of 18, not from the age of 14.
There is a rule that will be released from the oath of incapacitated or limitedly capable, as well as those who cannot pronounce, read or sign the oath.
In addition, the President of the Russian Federation has the right to exempt from this procedure and "other persons,"
Also in the updated bill prescribed a special procedure for admission to Russian citizens of Ukrainians, who are considered native speakers of the Russian language.
They will have to officially renounce Ukrainian citizenship by submitting an application to the authorized body of Ukraine.
A notarized copy of the application will need to be handed over to Russian officials.
Refusal of "other" citizenship, as now, will not be required, if it is provided for by an international treaty or if it is impossible "for reasons not controlled by the person."
The corresponding amendment to the law was proposed by a group of deputies, including the first vice-speaker of the State Duma Ivan Melnikov (CPRF), Natalia Poklonskaya, Pavel Krasheninnikov and Airat Farrahov (all - "United Russia").
I think many of you know that getting a certificate from Ukraine is unrealistic, it is simply impossible.
Accordingly, a lot of people are waiting for the decision of their fate on the citizenship of the Russian Federation, - explained the head of the Duma Committee on state construction and legislation Pavel Krasheninnikov (EP).
In addition, the text clarifies that the restrictions on the occupation of certain positions for foreigners will not apply to those who have refused in writing of "other" citizenship and passed the previous passport in the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia, but "for reasons beyond his control" he did not cease to be considered a citizen of another country.
Now foreigners are forbidden to hold positions in the municipal service, to be hired for facilities and organizations whose activities are related to ensuring the security of Russia.
Also, a person with dual citizenship or a residence permit of another country cannot become a deputy of the State Duma or a member of the Federation Council.
It is planned that the law should enter into force on September 1, 2017, by that time, the necessary by-laws should be ready.
Nostalgia becomes niche in "Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"
The current iteration of the story nostalgically reminds simultaneously of the glorious days of the characters in the 80s; the era of grunge in the 90s (roughly at the time when the outstanding masters David Wayne and Michael Schowlter made the comedy sketch "State of the State" for MTV); and about itself - that is, about 2001, before its stars, as the stars of Elizabeth Banks, and Amy Pole.
As a fact of culture, it is at the same time the elevation and embodiment of our era with its constant reminders of Facebook.
But as a franchise, it seems to be an anachronism.
The "first day of the camp" was surprisingly good, and not only because of absurdist humor (including the original story of the talking pot of vegetables, which was voiced by X. John Benjamin).
The result is doubling the main joke: middle-aged actors play sexually anxious children who have just reached the age of majority; due to this, the inability to return to the joke becomes part of the joke.
"Ten years later," where adults played already adults, has less deep emotional roots, and its parody is more haphazard and includes riffs from stalker films of the 90s "Hands Swinging a Cradle."
In one episode, the character gets the Apple Powerbook, four-wheeled roller skates and "a lot of other things from 1991."
Many story moves are the same.
Good-natured Coop (Showolter), now a writer, has not yet achieved reciprocity from Katie (Margherit Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) has not yet broken up with virginity.
And there is still a crazy and mean conspiracy in which Ronald Reagan (also Shawalter), which is now instigated by George Bush (a tortured parody performed by Michael Jan Blake).
As always, the best part of the franchise is a departure from it.
It's especially funny to see the eternally young Rudd, who sings the song by Matt Dillon from "The One," whose character, whose former big man Andy now looks old.
To bring this franchise success could be random madness in the spirit of the type of recursive series "Seven Up," until it reaches the point that, in my opinion, it would be its logical conclusion: "Hot American summer: twenty years later," where in the last scene the whole company would go to the cinema for the premiere of the film "Hot American summer."
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon appeals to another type of nostalgia: memories of the Cold War from the "Americans," "Explosive Blonde" or even "Blash" with its images of the struggle of the East and the West.
This comedy, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with director Reese Thomas portrays a television film: a Romanian police drama of the 1980s about two police officers in Bucharest fighting for the truth, atheism and the Marxist-Leninist path.
The main roles - the life of Gregor and idealist Joseph - are performed by Florin Piersik Jr. and Cornelio Ulych, and voiced their dialogues in English by Channing Tatum (aka executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levit.
This is a brilliant idea.
But only an idea.
There are several visual jokes (police officers spend time watching a chess match, as Americans could watch football).
The team of famous voices behind the scenes - among them Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny - makes it interesting to play "guess the voice."
But "Comrade Detective" so holds on to the plausibility of the clumsy propaganda drama - there is even a killer in the mask of Ronald Reagan - which often looks like her.
Six long episodes are tightened, and it's not very and funny.
If it were shorter, "Comrade Detective" could have better coped with his satire in the spirit of agitprop; for example, every time Gregor and Josef come to the American Embassy, there are two fat people in the lobby that absorb a heap of hamburgers.
To the imaginary communist viewer, this image says that Western culture is able to make a fat-freezing from anything.
The fictional Romanian writers of the film are not so wrong: We do so even with our own recent history, and with them too.
The prize fund of the match for the Russian Super Cup in football between Spartak and Lokomotiv will be about 30 million rubles.

He also added that to date there are almost no tickets for the match.

Two young Ufa residents cleaned the furniture shop for 200 thousand rubles
The other day, a 37-year-old Ufa man, who has a furniture firm, contacted the police.
The man said about the theft of expensive tools from the shop, which caused serious damage to its production.
The extraction of thieves became tools with a total cost of almost 200 thousand rubles: two welding machines, a puncher, hydraulics, a winch.
The guards of the order began to search for criminals and soon came to the residents of the Blagoveshchensky district of Bashkortostan, friends of 23 and 24 years.
According to the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic, the accomplices entered the territory of the enterprise, broke into the front door and carried out the tools.
Immediately after that, the guys sold the stolen equipment the first car service.
A case of theft has already been opened against them, and law enforcement officers managed to return only a part of the stolen tools to the rightful owner.
The state Department commented on the words of Medvedev about the relations between the Russian Federation and the United States
The United States and Russia must be able to work with each other.
Such a statement was made by the official representative of the State Department Heather Nauert in response to the words of Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev on the relations between the two states.
Earlier, the head of the Russian government said that by adopting new anti-Russian sanctions, the United States put an end to the hope of improving bilateral relations and declared Russia a full-fledged trade war.
Commenting on these words, Nauert admitted that Russian-American relations are at a "low level," but noted that it is necessary to look for "area for interaction."
"Look at the ceasefire in southwest Syria, which has been observed for almost a month."
"And this is an example of good cooperation between the United States and Russia," the diplomat said.
At the same time, the representative of the foreign Ministry refused to comment on the statement of the Russian Prime Minister that the sanctions are tantamount to a trade war.
The bill on new sanctions against Russia, Iran and the DPRK, US President Donald Trump signed on Wednesday.
At the same time, he admitted that the document was unsuccessful and contrary to the American Constitution.
Dior "grows" roses of amethyst and quartz

In the Rose Dior line, two new rings and a puppy of amethysts, rose quartz and diamonds made in the technique of glyptic (manual stone carving) and a paverage and dedicated to the 70th anniversary of the house were released.
The head of Dior Joaillerie, Victoire de Castellan, was inspired by the roses he grew in his estate in Granville, fashion designer Christian Dior, and the Paris Gardens, the Baggant and Pre-Catelan.
Trump found the culprits of the deterioration of relations with Russia
US President Donald Trump has sharply criticized members of Congress.
According to the American leader, their actions led to a deterioration of relations with Russia.
Our relations with Russia are at an unprecedentedly low and dangerous level.
"You can thank Congress, these same people can't even give us medicine," he tweeted.
On the eve of Donald Trump signed a law on new sanctions against Russia, Iran and the DPRK.
They will, in particular, affect Russian banks and energy companies.
Subsequently, the White House circulated a statement by the president, in which he pointed out that the law will not allow the United States to conclude profitable deals and will further bring Russia, China and North Korea closer.
Belarusian entrepreneur refused to buy the Ukrainian daughter of Sberbank
Entrepreneur from Belarus Viktor Prokopennya withdrew from the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) an application for the purchase of a subsidiary of Sberbank.
The businessman explained his decision by RBC's intention to "concentrate on our other planned investments and projects on which we are working on."
According to Mr. Prokopeni, such a step will be "the best investment of time," despite the investment attractiveness of the purchase of Sberbank's daughter.
Mr. Prokopenya became the main contender for the purchase of the Russian bank's subdivision in Ukraine after the NBU rejected the application of the NorvikBank consortium Grigory Guselnikov and the Belarusian company Said Gutseriev in July.
Russian banks began to leave the Ukrainian market after President Petro Poroshenko imposed sanctions on their subsidiaries in March.
One of such financial organizations - in addition to VTB and Vnesheconombank - and Sberbank became.
Novak called the cause of the blackout in the Crimea
The Ministry of Energy of the Russian Federation called the cause of blackout in the Crimea.
The head of the department, Alexander Novak, made an explanation about the incident.
According to him, the peninsula was left without electricity due to a road accident on the territory of the Krasnodar Territory.
The truck hit the power lines in the accident, as a result of the shutdown of the Kuban and related Crimean networks.
Power failures in the power supply of major Crimean cities were recorded last week.
The researchers fixed the malfunctions within a few hours.
Initially, it was reported that the cause of the blackout could be anomalous heat.
Bank of England to keep interest rates at 0.25 percent
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will not change after weak economic growth and weakening inflation forced rumors of a possible rise.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth would remain leisurely, and left interest rates unchanged among the growing pressure on family income.
Experts of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted with a score of 6 against 2 for holding rates of 0.25%, with fewer committee members in favor of an increase in the rate because weak economic growth weakened support for the increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank limited its forecasts to rise 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 and warned that the pressure on family incomes will continue, while inflation is still expected to rise to about 3% in the fall.
However, the bank warned that rate hikes in the next few years would be needed to control Brexit-induced inflation, and said that borrowing costs would likely have to rise more than expected in financial markets.
Members of the committee also voted to abandon part of the huge set of measures for the development of the economy launched a year ago due to Brexit.
Beginning next February, the bank will close the urgent financing plan, under which it provides banks with cheap loans, although he said it will now have to provide another 15 billion pounds of pounds to 115 billion pounds.
According to the MPC's main forecasts, the growth of gross domestic product (GDP) is slow in the near future, while the pressure on real incomes of families continues to affect consumption.
On the issue of rates, he reiterated that in order to suspend inflation, it will take some tightening of financial policy, in a "several size" than the markets expect.
At the moment, the markets are predicting the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020.
But the bank stressed that all the increases will be "gradual" and "limited."
The bank's forecasts for the increase in this year and the next year are lower than the forecasts made in May, which were equal to 1.9% and 1.7%.
The bank left its forecast of 1.8% in 2018 unchanged.
After this news, sterling fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell 0.5% to US$1.31 and 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision not to change the rate was made after recent disappointing growth figures weakened the increased expectation of an increase; GDP then rose 0.3% in the second quarter against 0.2% in the previous three months.
According to the bank's representative, growth appears to remain at the level of 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will begin to increase slightly at the end of the year.
The bank's latest report on inflation gave little reason to joy to households, which was hit by high inflation and very little wage increases: according to the bank, the pressure will increase before falling.
The bank added that the financial policy of the "we can prevent a loan of earnings in the next few years, but expects that the salaries will recover significantly by the end of its three-year forecast.
The economy is also set to grow as a result of the growing demand for British goods, due to the low rate of the pound, which compensates for part of the reduced consumer spending.
The decision came a year after the rates were cut to 0.25 percent last August after the shocking results of the referendum on leaving the European Union, which led to the fall of the pound.
The bank's estimates, it's likely four years to have a full impact on prices and the economy.
Before the bank made its last decision on rates, the noise increased around the expected rate hike, as inflation increasingly pressured and pressured households: three of the committee asked to raise rates to 0.5% in July.
Inflation fell to 2.6% last month from 2.9% in July, although the bank said the bank reported that this fall was expected and reimbursed in the coming months.
According to the bank, a higher figure compared to the planned 2% is entirely a consequence of the low exchange rate of the pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of the company's Mortgage Brokers, said: "If you take into account the recent fall of swap rates, it seems that the mortgage market will again become even more competitive, as lenders require business opportunities and count on a good end of the year.
The market looks particularly favorable for those who are approaching the end of their existing contracts, as the refinancing of loans, often with the possibility of the absence of a commission, as well as with a low rate, becomes popular as ever.
The public health service will prescribe the drug caused by the spores for HIV of 10,000 people
Starting from September, patients will have access to a revolutionary drug for HIV prevention after the battle in the High Court on the issue of financing the drug from the State Health Service.
The National Health Service of England announced that pre-exposure HIV prevention (PrEP), a pill taken before sex that has been proven to reduce the risk of infection in people at risk by an average of 86 percent will now be provided by the health service during the initial three-year probation period of about 10,000 people.
She agreed to fund the test after the Court of Appeal upheld last year's High Court ruling, which claimed that the National Health Service had the opportunity to pay for the PrEP, despite her claims to be funded by local authorities.
The move, announced on Thursday, was named the most important innovation by the President of the National Health Service of England Simon Stevens, and the National AIDS Control Authority (NAT) called it a "turning point."
Before the full launch of the program across England by April 2018, venereal clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to register people, and even more dispensaries will join the program in October.
Pre-exposure prevention is a course of HIV drugs taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Research has shown that PrEP significantly reduces the risk of HIV infection among people at risk.
When taking a PrEP before sex in the human body, a sufficient number of certain drugs to prevent HIV infection.
Such drugs can be taken daily or not later than two hours before sex.
Patients eligible for the drug include homosexual and bisexual men, transgenders and people whose partners are HIV-positive and do not receive successful treatment.
Dispensaries will select suitable participants who agreed to participate in the study, including men, women, transgender and persons whose partners are not aware of whether their HIV status antiretroviral therapy is being held back.
People living and assigned to the general practitioner in England will also be able to apply for potential participation in the nearest venereological dispensary participating in the program.
The program will cost 10 million pounds, and the UK's National Health Service this week, after an international tender for the purchase, signed a contract to provide the drug.
The study is designed to assess all the capabilities of PrEP by collecting clinical data on who is the target audience of the drug, its digestibility and use on a large scale.
This is the most important innovation should complement and strengthen the wide-ranging and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
This is another milestone in more than three decades of success in the fight against one of the biggest health threats facing humanity.
Deborah Gold, president of NAT (National AIDS Control Office), said: "This is a turning point in the fight against HIV."
PrEP, if you correctly target it on people in need of help and at risk, makes it possible to change the situation with the HIV epidemic in England.
Since September, people at risk for HIV, thanks to this study conducted in England at the expense of the National Health Service, will have access to a new means that a person can control by the use of itself without discussing it with a partner, which will lead to an improvement of many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this news.
Ian Green, president of the Terrence Higgins Foundation, said: "Now, you need to make sure that the test quickly unfolds across the country, and that no HIV risk group is forgotten.
Now that we are provided with an experimental PrEP drug, we are going to protect more than 10,000 people at risk for HIV.
Shadow Minister of People's Health Sharon Hodgson said: "We very much welcome the start of the PrEP test, it is very late due to months of delays and delays from the government.
The data demonstrate how revolutionary this drug can become as part of our approach to preventing HIV and ending the transmission of this fatal infection.
This test will bring us one step closer to a complete understanding of the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that the test be deployed as soon as possible across the country to protect people at risk for HIV and to move us one step towards ending HIV spreading in society.
The World Congress of Tatars adopted a resolution on support for the Treaty of Tatarstan and Russia
The Sixth Congress of the World Tatar Congress (VKT) adopted a resolution in which it noted the importance of maintaining the post of President in Tatarstan.
According to the document, the post is "a positive form of organization of the highest state power in the republic and expressing the national interests of the entire Tatar people."
In addition, the congress stressed in the resolution the importance of a treaty on the separation of powers between Russia and Tatarstan.
According to the document, he "played a positive role in the ethnocultural, socio-economic and socio-political development of Tatarstan and the Russian Federation as a whole."
The agreement between Moscow and Kazan, which has been in force since July 24, 2007, was concluded for 10 years.
On July 11, deputies of the State Council of Tatarstan appealed to the President of Russia with a request to extend the agreement and retain the name of the post of head of the region.
Now Tatarstan is the only subject of the federation that has a treaty with Russia.
The head of the region is the only one whose position is called "president."
In Russia, there were difficulties in obtaining an international driver's license
Traffic police units are experiencing a shortage of international driver's licenses (MVU).
To get such rights, you have to wait for the queue for several weeks, which has become a real problem for vacationers who want to go abroad in their car or rent it there.
It is worth noting that the situation with international driving licenses remains controversial.
The IDP was introduced to make it easier for the foreign police to understand what is written in the national certificate, since the information in it is explained in five languages.
The requirements for international rights are recorded in the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic of 1968, but in the countries that have ratified the Vienna Convention, Russian rights are recognized.
However, in fact, it all depends on the specific police or rental office: some require an IDP, and someone has enough national rights.
To be insured, drivers still receive international rights, but it is worth considering that the authorities have not ratified the Convention (for example, the United States, Mexico, Indonesia) the authorities have the right not to recognize either national rights or IDPs.
Now there is a problem with forms in almost all units of the traffic police, reports "Kommersant," conducting a study in a number of regions.
So, in Moscow in the units of the UGIBDD coupons are simply not issued, forms are not enough for four months.
You can make an appointment on the website of public services, but the queue has already stretched until mid-August.
In Krasnoyarsk, the IDP cannot be obtained "for technical reasons," without going into details, in the Samara region honestly say that there are no forms, a similar situation is developing in other cities.
Many Muscovites have already faced the problem, the following messages are increasingly appearing in social networks:
Irina Burmistrova: "Guess why you can't get international rights in Moscow?"
That's right, because in all the offices of the traffic police ended the forms.
Elena Podkolzina: "Question to Knowing People!"
International rights must be very urgent.
In Moscow, it is always sung far ahead, the vocabularies are not issued at all on the spot (there is a button, but the ticket can not give).
It seems that the portal of public services shows that in St. Petersburg time free to shit.
Did you try to get in another city?
It'll work?
As explained in the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation, the requirements for forms of international driver's licenses have changed, so the units of the State Automobile Inspectorate are supplying new forms.
With this and there may be a deficit, however, it is unclear what changes we are talking about, it has not been previously reported.
Blanca is purchased by the Special Purpose Center in the field of road safety (CSN BDD) of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation and then supplies them to the traffic police.
In recent years, all contracts were concluded with Goznak JSC: in 2014-2015, almost 200 thousand were manufactured. IUU forms, in 2016, 15 thousand were purchased. forms, in 2017 - 90 thousand, but the last contract was signed on July 18 with LLC "First Printed yard" for the production of 70 thousand. The forms.
There is a version that the CSN simply did not have time to hold a tender in time, which is why there was a shortage.
However, there are other versions of the shortage of forms: due to the crisis, many people began to independently travel not to Europe, but to cheaper Asian countries - China, Thailand and so on.
What rights are accepted there is unclear, so people are reinsured, so there is a hype demand for international "creas."
Recently it became known that professional drivers will have to pass the exam to confirm their qualifications.
This proposal was made by Mintrans.
The new international driver's license (IWD) has been in effect since May 31, 2011.
Minister of Justice of Ukraine refused to believe in the construction of the Crimean bridge
Minister of justice of Ukraine Pavlo Petrenko said that he does not believe in the ability of Russia to build a bridge to Crimea.
On Friday, August 4, he said in an interview with the portal "Observer."
No self-respecting international company, even a bolt or a wrench, will put there, because it risks losing its business in the EU, the United States, Japan - in countries that have joined the sanctions against Russia against Crimea.
"That is, in my deep conviction, there are virtually no prospects for this project," Petrenko said.
He added that he considers Russia incapable of implementing a major infrastructure project on its own.
Russia cannot normally build less large-scale facilities.
I know that after the Olympics in Sochi, whole stadiums have already begun to collapse.
"Therefore, I believe that the best tool in this situation is sanctions against companies that were so short-sighted as to join this project," the official said.
On July 31, the builders completed the construction of the vault of the automobile arch of the Crimean bridge.
On the Kerch shore, the enlarged assembly of the road arch of the Crimean bridge has been completed: its vault is closed at an altitude of 45 meters from the base of the structure.
"At the same time, bridge builders have prepared a railway arch for installation on the fairway supports," the project information center reported.
In April, the head of the Ministry of transport Maxim Sokolov informed the President of Russia Vladimir Putin that the construction of the object is ahead of schedule.
The Crimean bridge will connect the Crimean Peninsula and the Krasnodar Territory.
In Spain fired an official who for 10 years did not go to work
What angelic patience (or absolute indifference to public service) should the chief of the Spanish official, Carles Recio, should have?
The permanent hiking stretched for 10 long years.
However, Mr. Recio was still fired.
But not his immediate boss.
What only in the world of bureaucrats does not happen.
The inhabitants seem to have long been accustomed to all the pranks of the "servants of the people."
And, nevertheless, officials all the time manage to surprise those on whose taxes they live well.
This time the "sensation" was granted from Spain.
There, an employee of the archive of Valencia, Carles Recio, managed to not go to work for ten years.
He received a regular salary.
And all solid - 50 thousand euros a year.
And here's Mr. Recio's "miracle times" are over.
He was fired by the decision of the Valencia legislature.
During the investigation, it was revealed that the evil walker every working morning came to the office at 07:00 to be noted in the electronic system.
And he immediately went home.
Once again, he appeared in the workplace at 4 p.m. to again mark on the system that he had left.
And so 10 years.
It also became known that all his free time the wanderer devoted to drawing comics at home.
Now the deputies of the legislature of Valencia are thinking how to punish and the immediate chief of Mr. Recio, who could not but know how to "work" in his workplace, his subordinate.
Judges are asked to be protected from the chairpersons.
The Presidential Council on Human Rights (HRC) on behalf of Vladimir Putin has developed proposals to strengthen the independence of the judiciary.
The HRC proposes to limit the powers of the chairpersons of the courts and to introduce their electiveness.
For the courts of appeal and cassation authorities, the HRC wants to introduce special districts that will not be tied to the administrative-territorial division in the Russian Federation.
The Supreme Court must also submit its proposals within the framework of the presidential order.
The HRC has completed the development of proposals that will strengthen the independence of Russian justice.
This work was carried out on behalf of Vladimir Putin on January 3, 2017, which the President gave after a meeting with members of the Council.
At a meeting with the members of the council on December 8, 2016, including some cases of judicial arbitrariness, as well as the problems of public control in places of detention of citizens were discussed. "I" of December 9).
The result of the work of the HRC 25 proposals, which relate to both the issues of ensuring the independence of judges and the identification of judicial errors, and the financing of courts and legal education.
One of the ideas of the Kremlin human rights defenders is to limit the powers of the presidents of the courts to increase the independence of the remaining judges.
If the candidate for the post of judge successfully passed the competition and received the support of the judicial community, the chairman of the court, in the opinion of the HRC, should submit him to the appointment, without the right to refuse, as the law allows now.
It is also proposed that the President be deprived of the right to allocate cases for consideration among judges.
To do this, experts allow, can a specially written computer program.
The HRC also believes that the chairman does not have the right "to determine the results of the qualification certification of a judge, initiate his levies to disciplinary responsibility, make decisions on the establishment of additional material payments."
At the same time, the presidential council considers it necessary to move to the "election of the presidents of the courts themselves by the judges themselves" and "to confuse them with a relatively short term with mandatory rotation."
Now all the presidents of the courts (from the republican to the district) are appointed for six years by the President on the proposal of the Chairman of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation.
To protect judges from the pressure of regional administrations, the HRC proposes to reorganize the appeal and cassation in the courts of general jurisdiction.
Now their structure is tied to the administrative-territorial division in the Russian Federation.
The HRC says that "it is necessary to ensure the organization of individual courts of appeal and cassation instances not at the level of regional judicial bodies in the subjects of the Russian Federation, but in judicial districts."
Experts take as a basis the practice of arbitration courts.
With them, there are "judicial districts" that do not coincide with the administrative division in the Russian Federation, but guaranteeing due this greater independence from regional officials, who are difficult to use "phone law."
The HRC MT World Judges proposes to strengthen the people's ranks in order to consider some "categories of civil and administrative cases" with their participation.
For example, the deprivation of parental rights, on the restoration of work, on the protection of honor and dignity, on deprivation of driver's license, etc. The p.
"These are only our proposals," - explained "Kommersant" member of the HRC, judge of the Constitutional Court in resignation Tamara Morshchakova.
She also recalled that the instructions of the President applied not only to the HRC, but also to the Supreme Court (VS), which has not yet disclosed its proposals.
The time for the execution of the order to the Supreme Court (among the co-executors - the Prosecutor General's Office and the Commissioner for Human Rights in the Russian Federation) still have.
To report to Vladimir Putin on how effectively the independence of justice is ensured in the Russian Federation, the Chairman of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Vyacheslav Lebedev should before September 1.
Live a high life: half-floor and cunning designer techniques turned this little apartment in Earls Court into a spacious dwelling
Joan Lee, a former real estate repair banker, moved from a spacious house in Knightsbridge to an apartment in Earls Court in 2014.
The apartment is located on the ground floor of a cute Queen Anne-style house, and in favor of the new design says what Joan hasn't packed her belongings or moved again.
"I used to live with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger square," says Joan.
I was looking for something comparable for my money.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and there were the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and offered a price on the same day.
Since the first viewing, the apartment of 1,000 square feet has undergone a complete reconstruction.
Initially, it was a one-bedroom apartment of a complex layout - to get into the bedroom, it was necessary to go through the kitchen - and Joanna wanted to add storage space for things and a half-floor to squeeze the most out of the generous ceiling height.
I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.
These were my demands, she says.
To that end, she hired Erphan Azadi from the Notting Hill-based architectural and design studio, Duck & Shed, to use 12.5-foot-height ceilings and create a dwelling that would not only be a successful project, but Joan would be suitable for life.
The ceiling was not high enough to arrange two rooms one over the other, so the architectural task was to create a floor where it could be fully grown.
Erfan had to think creatively to handle the brief.
"Working with steel structures is very difficult," he explains.
We had to arrange the premises so that they were one above the other, and did not have to bend.
It was necessary not only to build a simple platform, but to bend the structures so that they were at the right height and allowed the use of the premises from above and below.
This decision allowed Erfan to arrange two full-size rooms one over the other in the allotted space - and many more interesting.
From the half-floor through the vintage copper light window from the "Retrouvius" overlooks the chic living room at the bottom.
Mirror furniture with golden finish, silver accents and vintage lighting from Serge Muya set the design.
The use of mirrors plays a role in the addition of entertainment, space and light.
The short corridor is framed with mirrors to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, a mirrored protective panel seems like a window to another room.
At the entrance, mirror cabinets serve to store all Joan's dishes.
To create a sense of a more luxurious space, the beauty of the living room can enclose the kitchen when it is not used.
There is nothing new in the folding kitchens.
The uniqueness of this kitchen is that it is a moving door upwards, like in a garage.
Engineering art was involved here, - Erfan tells about reinforced steel wood and fibreboard door.
It is equipped with a counterweight, so when you push the door up, it slides very easily.
With the sensible use of space and storage space, Joan received an additional 16 square meters, an additional bedroom and improved layout.
"After all, the floor area is exactly what you will sell, that is, what your property is valued for," says Erfan.
Roughly speaking, the real estate agent will enter and make calculations based on the floor area.
Here they were able to increase the area of the floors, using high-quality materials that give the space a hue of luxury.
"Materials are what we touch, so they help create an emotional connection to the house," says Erfan.
No one falls in love with electrical wiring in the walls.
It's important, but it doesn't hurt the strings of our hearts.
This is evidence that due to a good design and enlarged meterage, the apartment can turn from something ordinary into something amazing.
In fact, like Joan, you can decide to stay.
The government approved the establishment of a commission on cultural policy

Inflation in G20 countries fell to eight-year low
Consumer prices in the G20 countries have fallen to the lowest in the last eight years, according to The Wall Street Journal, citing data from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
According to OECD estimates, inflation rates in June 2016 amounted to 2% - lower values in October 2009, when the price growth index reached 1.7%.
Earlier, Rosstat reported a decrease in the consumer price index in Russia by 0.1%.
Thus, the agency recorded the first weekly deflation in 2017.
The inflation target in Russia, according to the calculations of the Ministry of Finance, is 4.1%.
The Ministry of Economy, however, believes that the target value has already been achieved - according to this department, the indicator is 4%.
Putin warned against illegal cutting of Baikal taiga
Russian leader Vladimir Putin during a meeting on the environmental development of the natural Baikal territory warned against the illegal destruction of forests.
During the event, Minister of Natural Resources Sergey Donskoy noted that a bill had previously been prepared.
It allows deforestation during the fires, and the government plans to accept it in the fall.
In turn, the president said that this project should be monitored so that in the process of cutting "not cut down everything in a row."
Donskoy noted that this bill involves control by the Ministry of Emergency Situations and supervisory authorities.
Media: fighters of the Armed Forces secretly from the command agree with the militias of Donbass
On the line of armed confrontation in the Donbass established regular telephone communication.
Fighters of the opposing parties constantly communicate with each other on mobile phones, and they do not know about this communication at the headquarters.
The fighters of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the militias of Donbass established communication on cell phones in secret from their high command.
On August 4, reports "Country.ua" with reference to the participants of the military operation in the Donbass.
According to the publication, the commanders of the units are well aware of the names of their colleagues from the opposite side of the front and communicate with them daily by phone.
Communication is not domestic at all: commanders are trying to reach some "tactical agreements."
Often, according to the results of such conversations, there is a truce on a certain part of the front.
Journalists became aware of cases when the congratulations on the birthday of this or that officer received from the front line, from his formal enemy.
Fighters of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and militias of the DPR and LPR are sitting in the trenches on the demarcation line since the spring of 2014, when Ukraine began a combat operation against Donbass.
The foreign Ministry outraged the blocking of the statements of the UN Security Council on attacks on the Embassy of the Russian Federation
The Russian foreign Ministry is outraged by the actions of some Western diplomatic representatives who block the statements of the UN Security Council in the press condemning the terrorist shelling of the Russian Embassy in Syria.
This is reported by the Russian Foreign Ministry.
The ministry recalled that the territory of the Russian Embassy in Damascus on August 2 for the third time in a month was subjected to mortar shelling by terrorists of the groups "Heyat Tahrir-Sham" (formerly "Jabhat al-Nusra," banned in the Russian Federation) and "Failak Ar-Rahman."
Taking into account that the international community is unanimous in the qualification of "Nusra" as a terrorist organization, and the resolutions of the UN Security Council call to counteract this structure, the Russian Foreign Ministry noted that "it would seem, it goes without saying that the terrorist attacks of "Nusra" should meet the universal unconditional and decisive condemnation, and in the assessments of attacks against diplomatic missions there should be no ambiguity."
For the third time in a month, diplomatic representatives of the United States, Great Britain, France and Ukraine in the UN Security Council, alternately, varying the tone of objections, plaustively, circulating the arguments about the alleged lack of necessary information, blocked the proposal of the Russian Federation to adopt a standard short draft statement of the Security Council for the press with condemnation of terrorist attacks on the Russian diplomatic mission in the Syrian capital."
The reluctance to show diplomatic solidarity with us may remain in the conscience of these delegations.
"The most turmoil is that the Security Council's inability to condemn the acts of terrorists encourages them to new provocations and terrorist attacks, gives them a sense of impunity," the Foreign Ministry said, adding that "I would not like these barbarians to create the belief that someone in the Security Council is at the same time."
Vladimir Putin called for limiting the number of unscheduled business inspections
Russian President Vladimir Putin during the meeting on investment projects in the Far East said that the number of unscheduled inspections of entrepreneurs should be reduced to 30% of the number of planned, and also said about the need to limit the deadline for inspections to ten days.
"Unscheduled inspections are carried out, as a rule, without appropriate coordination with the prosecutor's office; only 2-3% is agreed with the prosecutor's office, everything else goes independently," - quotes the President of TASS.
Vladimir Putin also said that it is necessary to prohibit investigators from seizing servers and hard drives at enterprises.
In addition, according to the president, business associations should be given the right to protect the interests of their members in court.
"This, I hope, will make a certain positive in the consideration of cases related to entrepreneurial activities, or related to the violation of the law in the field of entrepreneurship," the head of state said.
As reported by Kommersant, due to the moratorium on scheduled inspections, the number of other types of inspections of entrepreneurs is growing.
In May, on the order of the business ombudsman under the President of Russia Boris Titov, a survey was conducted, as a result of which it was found that in fact there was a replacement for planned inspections by unscheduled (the share of those facing them increased from 21.9% in 2015 to 30.8% in 2016), prosecutorial (from 16.9% to 21.8%), raids (from 7.9% to 13.3%), as well as inspections of citizens (grows from 15 percent) and 15 percent.
More about the inspections of the business in the material "Kommersant" "They went to small business from the other side."
Brothers are fighting for an empire worth more than $500 million
Two brothers are fighting for one of the largest empires in the state of Victoria in the state of real estate in the state of more than $500 million - forty years after their Italian ancestors founded the dynasty.
The former director of the football club Carlton and the developer Colin de Lutis lives in the palace of Turak through three doors from his younger brother Paul, who filed a lawsuit against him in the Supreme Court about the ownership and assets.
Paul wants to get out of the family business since 2014, but in the Supreme Court for the time being, there is a fierce dispute over the terms of the divorce.
Together with her mother, the brothers have owned 87 objects worth more than half a billion dollars, bought since their family bought in 1973, a store on Smith Street in Collingwood.
There, the family founded the company "Westco Jeans," which grew into a network of 160 outlets.
It was sold in 1999 for $85 million.
The money was invested in real estate, and the list of De Lutis family's possessions include today office buildings, building plots in Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments on the Gold shore and in Mount Buleller and shopping malls in the suburbs.
By arrangement with his late father, Colin - whom Paul describes as the "main driving force and dominant personality" of the De Lutis family - owns about two thirds of the company's assets, and Paul owns about one-third.
According to the court, this means that Colin's property is 316 million, and Paul's property is 176 million.
The division of property and money became for Paul a stumbling block.
"The section proposed by Colin gives him, in my opinion, the best parts of the property," he wrote in his first testimony in 2015.
Last Friday, after several unsuccessful attempts at reconciliation, the first hearings were held in the Supreme Court.
The brothers are now arguing about who will control the existing business - from which, according to Paul, Colin excluded him.
Colin claims that this is not the case, but accuses Paul of incompetent management of some objects.
In the testimony given by Colin at the beginning of the trial, he says he hopes to resolve the dispute.
"My Italian roots make me consider the family the highest priority," he wrote.
Court spending is rising like a snowball: hundreds of pages of testimony, emails and reports from companies such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer have been added to the case; both sides have attracted the most prominent lawyers, including Royal Lawyer Allan Mayers, and the best cooks.
Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were immigrants from Italy; since the late 1950s, they have run dairy bars and grocery cons, and in the early 1970s bought a shop in Brunswick.
Under financial guarantees, they bought a store in Collingwood, where Colin opened the first family jeans store.
Colin says he launched Westco when he was "in the last grades of school, and Paul was then a boy (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says that he and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to hand over their possessions to their sons without conflict.
"Luigi often told me that he didn't want the brothers to understand in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer members of the De Lutis group of companies; Colina says Mark received $10 million when he left the business and Luke 26 million.
According to Paul, both Luke and Mark were "dissatisfied with the financial conditions of their separation."
Colin was not a public figure, although he was a former member of the board of directors of the AFL club and, according to the 2015 biography of Eddie McGyre, the best friend of the TV star.
Furfax Media contacted Colin and Paul on Friday and their lawyers.
Only Colin responded by a text message saying that since the case had not yet been heard in court, "I really have nothing to say."
"I am very, very sorry that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and tremble in court the name of our family," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in statements that he was trying to meet his brother's demands.
"Our father would not like to see Paul and I be arguing in court," he said, adding that he "still hopes to resolve the conflict."
On Friday, that hope was dissipated.
"The decision in our case will be delivered soon by the court," wrote Colin.
The new head of the Trump apparatus plans to limit the receipt of information to the president.
Others tried to do that and were defeated.
Maybe John F. Kelly will really be able to do that.
In that case, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House chief of staff is planning to limit the flow of information coming to President Trump, including media news reports, hoping to keep the chief in a more calm state.
That's what reporter Josh Dousie says.
"At a meeting held by the new White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly and his staff on his first working day, he outlined the main problem in the White House under President Donald Trump, which he hopes to solve: the poor channels of information to the president.
Kelly told employees that the information should go through it - in paper form or through briefings - because the president would be better at making decisions if he was getting the right information.
Kelly's diagnosis is perfectly true, but others have already failed, trying to pacify Trump by tracking information.
President Trump's relationship with television has developed decades ago - and now that he's in the White House, his habit of watching TV is still strong.
"When Trump, as a candidate, resented the unfair coverage of the campaign, it was helpful to show him that he was receiving fair coverage in publications that could have been persuaded," said Sam Nanberg, a former election headquarters adviser.
Tara Palmery wrote at the time in Politico that "according to the six former members of the election headquarters, in order to keep Trump's habit of writing on Twitter, it was necessary to ensure that in the information in the person incoming to him there was a constant stream of praise."
All right.
But the idea that Trump's habit of writing on Twitter was "under control" is simply ridiculous.
Maybe these members of the campaign know something that we don't know - for example, that, if they weren't, Trump's tweets would be even more provocative.
We may never know about tweets that Trump hasn't published.
If his staff saved him from trouble at least several times, their efforts were not in vain.
But no one has always managed to keep Trump from fueling the fire.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, divided into rival factions, people are constantly trying to advance their agenda by giving Trump material - reliable or not - that confirms their views.
"Politico" - just for this story - wrote in May about the inclination of advisers to constantly lend the president dubious information.
Here is an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Today's and former Trump officials say that Trump can react very sharply to negative reports in the press, especially those containing dangerous leaks of information, and will not rest until he finds who was behind them.
This happened in late February, when someone slipped the president to print an article with GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocateur Charles K. Johnson, in which the deputy head of the apparatus Katie Welsh was accused of "staying a few leaks" in the White house.
It doesn't matter that Johnson is forever banned on Twitter for his aggressive behavior, that he has not presented specific facts or that in the past he has launched false accusations and then renounced them.
Trump read the article and began to question employees about Welsh."
Goldmacher adds that then-head of staff Rains Priebus and Chief of Staff Rob Porter "tried to build a system to manage the flow of papers that Trump receives and document them."
How did it work?
Three months later, Kelly tries to do the same.
He may be a more effective manager than Pribus, but Trump still has impulsive nature, and his aides are still fighting each other for influence.
These constant factors make Kelly's task very difficult.
Tyumen prosecutor's office fights HIV dissident
The prosecutor's office challenged the decision of the Kalininsky district court of Tyumen, who stopped the criminal case against a local resident, who had a young daughter who had a young daughter from HIV.
According to the investigation, the child died due to the fact that the mother is an HIV dissident and refused treatment.
However, the court released her from responsibility in connection with the reconciliation with the injured father.
The prosecutor's office believes that the crime cannot be left unpunished in order not to set a precedent for other HIV dissidents.
The case against a resident of Tyumen was initiated on the hour. 1 st. 109 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (causing death by negligence) in April - after her three-year-old daughter died from HIV infection 4At stage.
According to the prosecutor's office, the mother is HIV-infected.
"The woman was not treated by herself and refused to treat her daughter, believing that HIV infection does not exist," - explained in the Prosecutor's office of the Tyumen region.
The criminal case was filed in the Kalininsky District Court of Tyumen, which on July 25 decided to stop it.
The petition was filed by the father of the deceased girl, explaining that "I forgave his wife, has no complaints against her, she made amends and apologized."
The prosecutor's office with the court's decision did not agree and filed an appeal, demanding to cancel the order on the termination of the case and send it for a new consideration.
The girl died, and it is impossible to make amends for the harm caused by the crime.
HIV-infected mother, contrary to the recommendations of doctors, refused to examine the baby and treat her from a dangerous infection," - said the press service of the Prosecutor's office.
According to the supervisory authority, it should be punished, otherwise other HIV dissidents will follow suit.
According to the Tyumen AIDS Center, now in the Tyumen region about 12 children with HIV, they do not receive medical care due to the refusal of parents.
"And this situation has already improved - for the year of work of a special group, half of parents who categorically refused to treat children from HIV, changed their opinion - they allowed to diagnose, began to take drugs," - said the press Secretary of the Center of AIDS Elena Loseva.
According to her, it is impossible to influence parents in a legislative way, and as a result, not all HIV-infected children can be found - mothers do not allow them to be examined, hiding, fleeing with children from hospitals.
What are the dangers of HIV dissidents
At the end of last year, St. Petersburg sociologists presented the results of the first study in Russia of the so-called movement of HIV dissidents.
HIV dissidents are people who deny the existence of HIV and refuse to take medication.
Doctors and activists of AIDS-service NGOs call such views anti-medical, and in their spread they see a serious threat.
The terrible photo session, which ended in tragedy, occurred on Thursday, August 3, at the Grechany railway station in Khmelnytskyi.
A cheerful company of drunken young people was walking a bridge over the railway tracks, where a freight train was standing.
One of the friends had the idea to take a spectacular selfie on the roof of the car, reported "FACTS" in the communication sector of the police in the Khmelnytsky region.
The guy began to descend from the bridge to the train, but due to his indiscretion caught up with the power line and instantly received an electric shock.
Fortunately, this case became known to the station dispatcher, who immediately caused an "emergency."
Before the arrival of the doctors, the victim was moved to a safe place, and then hospitalized in the burn department of the Khmelnytsky Regional Clinical Hospital.
The man was diagnosed with burns of the torso of 1-2 degrees.
Now his condition is assessed by doctors as stable.
Law enforcement officers remind that recently, extreme selfies on the roofs of high-rise buildings, bridges, moving transport are becoming increasingly popular.
Police urge people to be vigilant and prevent such photo shoots, especially among children and teenagers.
Scientists have allowed the existence of oceans on ancient Venus
On ancient Venus there could be oceans.
This was suggested by French scientists.
Experts have created a computer model that demonstrated the process of water formation on the surface of the planets, writes Science News.
It turned out that at the beginning of its history oceans were formed, in which there were 10% more water than now on Earth.
Earlier, the "Arguments of the Week" wrote that, according to the hypothesis of scientists, the ocean 4 billion years ago could exist on Mars.
Foreign experts in the course of their research came to the conclusion that the water object was located on the northern hemisphere of the red planet.

The Gypsies overcame the moat and returned to the Christmas tree of the millionaires.
Some of the wealthiest homeowners of the West Midland are again in conflict with the resolute Roma who have overcome the moat dug by the municipal authorities to reoccupy the field near their homes.
Gypsies parked 20 houses on wheels in a field bordering the rich street of Solikhal, which received the joking name of the Little Millionaires.
Bringing horses, infants and many houses on the wheels, they returned after they were driven out no further than in May, and they were not prevented by the moat dug by the municipal authorities to prevent their invasion.
This tactful company found a rupture in the fortifications and squeezed its vehicles through a site that was left unprotected to leave room for the path.
The furious residents attacked the municipality of Solikhallah, saying that he was "incapable of solving this problem."
An anonymous local resident said: "They came here on Monday evening, after they were driven out of Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at passers-by.
The municipality should be shamed and forced to act, because they are not able to solve this problem at all.
The gypsies were here in May, they were driven away, and now they are back.
Even more Roma came last night, and today, perhaps, even more.
"The municipality of Birmingham knows how to solve this problem, they receive long-term court orders to protect their parks," she added.
I live on Streetsbrook Road, and I don't like that I keep paying municipal tax, and the municipality can't even put an end to it.
One local resident, who wished to remain anonymous, said: "It's funny, we've just seen these Roma leave the previous time, and here's the attack going on.
This time there were more of them, and we even saw a horse grazing on the meadow.
A spokesman for the municipality of Solihull said: "We know about the illegal camp on the ground near Stritssbrook Road and are cooperating with the Solikhal police; we are taking the necessary legal action to drive them away as soon as possible.
To help us collect evidence, it is very important that as many locals as possible report any anti-social or criminal behavior to the police on the phone 101.
This allows us to provide an idea of the situation that the court will consider when we present our case to them.

The depreciation of fixed assets at the enterprise is about 60-70%.
1.2 billion rubles are needed for the modernization of the enterprise. Due to the peculiarities of the organizational and legal form, it is obliged to give 50% of the profit to the budget income.
What remains is not enough to implement the modernization plan.
"It is problematic to get money from the owner, it is difficult to talk about attracting borrowed funds from large credit organizations," Deputy Head of the Ministry of Agriculture of Crimea Sergey Petelin said in April this year.
The Crimean Parliament included the company in the forecast privatization plan for 2017.
It was proposed to hold it to corporatize and put it up for auction.

Nizhny Novgorod third-graders defeated more than 40 gravestones
Employees of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in the Nizhny Novgorod region established the identities of citizens who destroyed 46 gravestones in the cemetery of the city of Lyskovo.
The attackers were third-grade students.
The first statement that the gravestones were damaged by unknown, received in the OMVD of Russia in Lyskovsky district on June 27.
In total, 24 people contacted the police on this matter.
As a result, a criminal case was opened under article 244 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation "Destruction, damage or desecration of burial places."
According to the results of the investigation, the police identified the suspects, they were two schoolchildren at the age of 8 and 9.
Juvenile offenders told the police that they were interested in seeing how the monuments fell, and this prompted them to hooliganism.
Preventive measures have been carried out with children and their parents.
Italy is tightening the tone towards the ships of NGOs saving migrants.
Italy has warned the NGOs that own rescue ships in the Mediterranean that they will not be able to continue their work if they do not obey the new rules governing their activities.
"If the NGO does not comply with the new code of conduct, it is difficult to say whether they will be able to continue their activities," Interior Minister Mario Minniti said in an interview with the Turin Daily Stampa.
Minniti's warning came a day after Italian authorities confiscated a ship belonging to the German humanitarian organization "Jugend Rettet," on suspicion that its crew was actually collaborating with traffickers and facilitating illegal immigration.
The humanitarian organization, which worked only a year, declined to comment on the merits of the detailed accusations brought against her by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartozio.
"For us, the salvation of human life is and will remain the highest priority, so we are very sorry that we can not continue activities in the search and rescue zone," the organization said in a statement.
"We will be able to assess all the charges now, only after we gather all the information and we can assess the situation."
The Italian authorities have been following the Juventa vessel, owned by the Jugend Rettet, since October.
His crew is suspected of taking on entire lifeboats on board migrants, whom traffickers sent directly to them, and allowed the smugglers to leave with boats that they could use again.
At least one such meeting is expected to take place just 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the charges, the contents of which were published in the Italian media.
The crew is suspected of violating the orders of the Italian coast authorities, which control rescue operations in this zone, rather from humanitarian zeal than for any other reason.
The Code of Conduct presupposes mainly that Juventa-type vessels will have on board an Italian police officer who will monitor their activities.
So far, only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to submit to the code: "Save Children," the Maltese MOAS and Pro-Activa Spread Hugs from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that she considered the new rules unnecessary, but acceptable, provided they did not entail any "significant changes or interference" with rescue operations.
Among those who refused to sign, there is the Nobel Prize-winning organization "Doctors Without Borders" (MSF).
Meanwhile, Minniti said that a sharp decline in the number of migrants arriving in Italy as a result of rescue operations in recent weeks indicates that efforts to support the Libyan coast guard and cooperation with local mayors are bearing fruit.
"In the last days, we have begun to see the light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He announced plans for further negotiations with the Libyan mayors on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
"In Libya, we don't want to be associated with any of the parties to the conflict."
Recently, the Russian authorities have significantly intensified their policy in the Libyan direction, and with visits to Moscow, delegations of the opposing Libyan sides have become frequent.
The head of the Russian contact group on the intra-Libyan settlement under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation and the State Duma, assistant to the head of the Chechen Republic Lev Dengov told Komi, what goals Moscow pursues in this region and who is beingt on.
Almost nothing is known about the contact group on Libya you are leading.
Let's say the contact group on Ukraine - everyone knows about it.
And here is the veil of mystery.
What exactly do you do, what are you pursuing?
The contact group was established at the initiative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation and the State Duma.
Its activities are supervised by Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov and Adam Delimkhanov (Deputy of the Duma from Chechnya). "I."
The latter is authorized to work in the Libyan direction by the speaker of the State Duma Vyacheslav Volodin.
The impetus for the creation of the group was the detention in Libya of the Russian tanker "Mechanic Chebotarev" (in September 2015, there were 11 people on board. "I."
We were thinking about how to help the crew.
Then a contact group of military specialists, representatives of the State Duma was created, our work was supported by the head of Chechnya Ramzan Kadyrov.
How come you're the one who led her?
Since I have been working on Libya since 2008, I was asked to lead the group's work.
Our activities were not limited to the release of sailors from "Mechanics Chebotarev."
We were able to establish contacts with representatives of all the main groups opposing each other in the Libyan conflict - and from Tripoli (where the UN-recognized government led by Faiz Saraj is based. - "Kommersant"), and with Tobruk (the residence of the parliament that opposes the government and supports Marshal Khalifa Haftar, who controls the eastern regions of Libya. "I."
Thanks to the active participation of Ahmed Metiga (the Libyan Deputy Prime Minister - "Kommersant"), we managed to quickly agree on the release of Russian sailors.
Then it was decided to more effectively use these contacts, to create a contact group.
Its task is to analyze the situation, identify key factors and players, dialogue with all parties to the conflict.
I want to emphasize that in Libya we do not want to be associated with any of the parties to the conflict, we are engaged in dialogue with all.
How many people are in contact group and how many of them are in Libya?
Now the contact group consists of five people.
Among them are people who have experience in law enforcement agencies, including the Ministry of Defense.
We also want to introduce into the group of specialists in the region, representatives of the Institute of the Middle East of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
Constantly in Libya, no one is in our employees, this is not necessary yet.
Is there now Russian military advisers, instructors in Libya.
And if so, on whose side?
There are no Russian military specialists in Libya.
All the conversations and publications about this are not true.
But your contact group the former military is...
Yes, and their presence is necessary.
For example, when we visit hotspots.
Or cities closed to a certain point for us as Misurat (where militia units are based, which played a role in the overthrow of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 and significantly intensified in the following years. "I."
We arrived in Misrata in January of this year.
We were scared, said that there are all Islamists, terrorists.
But it was important for us to assess the situation there ourselves, to analyze the real military potential, who is responsible for what, why there are such rumors, what is the role of the Islamists.
In Misurat, we met with all representatives of the detachments that were engaged in the destruction of ISIS in Sirte (in December 2016, this city on the Mediterranean coast was repulsed from the militants of the banned in Russia "Islamic state" - "Kommersant").
We wanted to see them, meet these people, check the information that they played a decisive role in the destruction of ISIS in Libya, and not Khalifa Haftar, who attributed these merits to himself.
And what conclusion did you come to?
"Islamic State" in Libya did not defeat Haftar?
He didn't do that.
Haftar conducted operations on another front, in Benghazi.
And with ISIS in Sirte fought the structures subordinated to the government in Tripoli.
And, by the way, we invited people to Russia who conducted this anti-terrorist operation.
And they arrived - the visit lasted from 19 to 23 April this year, the Libyan delegation was accepted in the Federation Council, in the Duma, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Rosgvardia.
You, as we understand it, are in all Libyan regions and you are probably the mood of local elites and field commanders.
Do you think it will be possible to implement the ceasefire agreements, on the holding of elections that Khalifa Haftar and Faiz Saraj reached in late July in Paris?
Or again, as has happened many times in the past, agreements will be disrupted, the fighting will resume, the parties will try to seize power alone?
For us, the fact that Saraj and Haftar agreed to another meeting was a good signal, not so long ago it was impossible.
In the recent past, both leaders spoke extremely negatively about each other.
As for Russia's position...
They often write and say that Moscow actively supports Haftar, many believe in this.
We faced this situation when we were in Misurat, and Haftar on this day was on board the Russian aircraft carrier "Admiral Kuznetsov."
It was a coincidence.
But in Misrata they did not believe in coincidence.
We were told, "You're probably very brave people who came to us today."
But our task is to show that we not only support Haftar, we are engaged in a dialogue with all the key participants in the conflict in Libya.
You and Haftar were in contact.
Does understanding with Russian partners facilitate the fact that he studied twice in the USSR on the human, emotional level?
And, by the way, does Haftar know the Russian language?
The Russian, if he knows, is very relative.
But the fact that he studied with us, of course, facilitates dialogue with him.
And besides, it's not just with him.
When we communicate with the military in Tripoli and Misurat, we meet the generals who studied either in Russia or in the Soviet Union.
They speak Russian very well.
And they reach for Russia, to some extent they feel nostalgia for it.
Do you think that the arms embargo imposed on Libya is likely?
Are your Libyan interlocutors interested in the supply of Russian weapons?
They are interested, of course, but, as I said, we do not take someone's side in this conflict and do not want to arm some to the detriment of others.
We would like everyone to be in an equal position.
As for the arms embargo, Libyans are constantly calling for Russia to somehow contribute to its lifting.
The process of drafting a constitution is underway in Libya.
We hope that the parties will reach compromise solutions and achieve internal consensus.
Then the elections should be held, as discussed at the meeting between Saraj and Haftar.
If the elections are and finally a legitimate power is elected (and now none of the parties has such a status), then it is possible to put in the UN Security Council the issue of lifting the arms embargo.
To raise this issue is now pointless and dangerous, it will only lead to an escalation of the conflict.
Recently, the media reported that Italy, faced with the problem of African refugees floating from Libya, feels abandoned to fate by allies from the EU.
Can Moscow in this situation help Italian partners using their ties with the Libyans?
How realistic, for example, is the option that Haftar's detachments will establish control over the coast and put an end to the business of smugglers transferring immigrants to Europe?
A very timely question.
We are actively working on it.
The Italians need Russian support, because Moscow is engaged in dialogue with Haftar, with Saraj, and with Misurata and the south of the country.
And in this matter, tribes in southern Libya play a big role, and they are ready to cooperate with Russia.
Are we talking about the fact that the southerners stop the flow of migrants on the far reaches?
That is, to be able to say, the buses that the Nigerian migrants are going back?
That's what we're doing.
But it's not easy.
Some clans and groups are interested in keeping these flows going.
We hope to help unite the southerners in the negotiation process between Saraj, Haftar and the tribes in the south.
But first, we would like to see the unity of opinion on this issue between Haftar and Saraj.
The head of government in Tripoli Faiz Saraj is considered an Islamist, a supporter of the introduction of Sharia norms in the country.
How much does he hold radical views?
Will this not be an obstacle in building relations with Russia or the West?
I'll give my personal opinion of him.
In my opinion, he is an opponent of radical Islam.
Islamists are in his coalition.
Yes, but he himself holds the position that Libya should be an absolutely normal country - moderately Islamic, open to the world.
He is also actively fighting terrorists.
Where did he get that reputation?
It was created by those countries that are not interested in Russia communicating with Tripoli.
Tripoli is the capital, there is a legislative, executive and judicial power.
There is a national oil corporation, a national bank and other government structures.
Of course, some countries were interested in not getting there.
And we mixed them all the cards and began to actively communicate with Tripoli and Toprough.
And we are already reaping the fruits of this work: Rosneft has concluded an agreement on cooperation with the state oil company of Libya - NOC.
Director of NOC Mustafa Sanallah, with whom the head of Rosneft Igor Sechin made a deal, himself directly from Tripoli.
And two weeks ago, the first shipment of Libyan oil to Rosneft occurred.
What will Russia do to it?
I think I'll resell.
What are Russia's economic interests in Libya?
It is planned to resign the contracts signed at Muammar Gaddafi.
We are talking, in particular, about the previous agreements in the transport sphere (construction of railways), energy ( electrification) and a number of others.
Do Libyans have something to pay?
Well, they have oil.
That is, as in the case of Iran, we are talking about the "oil in exchange for services" scheme?
I don't know what the scheme will be, I don't deal with these issues.
In fact, the economy for Russia in Libya is not the main thing.
We are actually engaged in peacekeeping work there.
The main thing for us is to stop the bloodshed, to help the Libyans to agree with each other so that they can establish order and Libya ceased to be a favorable environment for the development of terrorism.
For Russia, this is the main task - to help the Libyan people and squeeze out terrorists.
Do you have data on the presence in Libya (now or earlier) of radical militants from Russia or other countries of the former USSR?
One of the tasks of our contact group was to find out this.
I met with a representative of the Libyan State Security Committee, who said that to date, not a single native of Russia and other countries of the former USSR is not there.
He said he had about 50,000. records of telephone conversations of representatives of Islamist and radical groups (in Libya). "Kommersant") and the Russian speech does not sound there.
And from what states, then, these fighters?
I don't want to go into these details.
Then we'll formulate the question differently.
How many of the Islamist militants in Libya are the Libyans themselves?
There are almost no Libyans among them, no more than 5%.
The rest are in ours.
Can Moscow hold intra-Libyan talks on the example of Paris?
There are plans like that.
We are actively negotiating with the Libyans, several delegations from Libya have already visited Moscow, and have declared their readiness to come to Moscow or Grozny.
And when can such negotiations take place?
It's hard to say now.
There should be several visits, and then, I hope, there will be clarity on the time and place of negotiations.

A useful present will be presented to Sasha by Minister of Culture of the Moscow Region Oksana Kosareva and Director of the Museum Konstantin Bobkov.
Money for the simulator was collected during the charity marathon "Do not get tired of doing good," which was held in Melikhov on July 15 on Chekhov's Memorial Day.
On the eve of the marathon in the museum received a letter from Sasha living in the village of Manushkino, Chekhov district: "I do not see the eyes at all, so I asked my mother to write this letter."

A 30-year-old resident of Olevsk, Zhytomyr region near the local football stadium, shot several times in the direction of the teenagers who were there.
According to the suspect, he was angered by the noise, the "FACTS" in the communication department of the police of the Zhytomyr region.
After that, the man went to a cafe located nearby.
In the building, he had a conflict, during which the man used a device to shoot rubber bullets, wounding one of the visitors.
The 34-year-old was provided with the necessary medical care, there is no threat to his life.
Police and ambulance arrived at the scene, but the shooter had fled.
Law enforcement officers identified him and detained him on the same day, August 2.
The man could not explain his actions.
He had seized a device for the shooting of rubber bullets, which was sent for examination.
On this fact, criminal proceedings have been initiated under the article. 296 (hooliganism) of the Criminal Code of Ukraine.
The detainee is threatened with imprisonment for a period of 3 to 7 years.
Recall that in Kiev on Lukyanovka in the area of Tatarskaya street on the night of July 28, there was an attack with a shooting.
Sentence of Michelle Carter for reports that prompted Conrad Roy's suicide
A resident of Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years in prison for the fact that she with the help of text messages and phone calls prompted the suicide of her boyfriend Conrad Roy.
Michelle Carter, who is now 20, will have to serve 15 months in prison and another five years of probation.
In June, Carter was found guilty of the manslaughter of Conrad Roy, who committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
Roy's father said at a hearing on Thursday: "My family is heartbroken.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to remain free until the appeal.
She was threatened with a maximum of 20 years, but her lawyers said that both she and Roy suffered from mental disorders.
Carter, dressed in red trousers and a cream blouse, listened to the verdict standing, squeezing his hands and lowering her eyes.
"With her actions, she killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"She interrupted his life to improve her life.
She did not recognize responsibility," she said.
"She didn't show remorse."
But Carter's lawyer said it was "a tragic case she regrets deeply about."
However, Judge Lawrence Monis said that, in his opinion, her "age, level of maturity, or even mental illness did not affect her actions in a noticeable way."
The prosecutor read the statements of Roy's mother Lynn Roy, which says: "It has not been a single day before I mourned the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I can handle it - I try to support his sisters, despite all the pain that will remain with us forever.
Sister Roy Camdin Roy said that she is relentlessly haunted by the idea that she will never be able to attend his wedding or become his children's aunt.
"To deprive a person who has always been with me since I was born is a pain that will remain with me for the rest of his life," she said.
This case is likely to be a legal precedent, as there is no law in Massachusetts that would be responsible for a person's advice to commit suicide.
In 2014, when Roy was found dead in the car with symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning, Carter was 17 years old.
The case caught the attention of the whole country when it became known that he was pushed to suicide by Carter's message.
"You can hang yourself, jump off the roof, stab yourself with a knife don't know there are many ways," she wrote in several messages sent two weeks before his death when he was resting with his family.
A few minutes before the suicide, she wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad" and "You only need to turn on the ignition, and you'll be free and happy."
Judge Monis said that Carter wanted to get attention through Roy's death, and forbade her from communicating with the press to prevent her from getting what she wanted.
The opinions of lawyers on this matter are divided.
One of the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 of the murder of her British apartment neighbor in Italy and was acquitted two years later.
The 30-year-old Knox published her dissenting opinion in the Los Angeles Times, which claimed: "Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help, not prison."
Eugene Bogachev: "I let Langford go like a high-flight bird"
One of the best basketball players of the VTB United League 33-year-old Keith Langford left UNICS.
The departure of the American defender "Izvestia" commented on the President of UNICS Evgeny Bogachev.
Keith made this decision on family circumstances, - said Yevgeny Bogachev.
He has a small child, a wife who did not want to move to Kazan.
Keith wants to be closer to home.
I decided to meet him.
Of course, I could say no and extend his contract, but he deserved a different relationship.
He played in UNICS for three seasons and in each match showed a high level, laid out 100%.
So I let him go like a high-fly bird.
We thanked him.
We wish him success in family life and a game career.
Keith Langford played in the Kazan club for three years, winning the silver of the United League 2015/16.
In the season 2016/17, he received the award to the most successful player of the Euroleague season.
He scored 21.75 points on average per match.
This result is the second since 2004, when this award was established.
Langford, who also won the award in 2014, became the second player in the history of the Euroleague to receive this prize more than once.
In the near future, Langford will sign a contract with the Chinese "Shenzhen," informs Eurohoops.
The American will sign a $2 million contract for $5 million.

Burnt in the sun of a tourist from the suburbs evacuated by a helicopter in Adygea
Adygea rescuers today with a helicopter evacuated from the mountainous region of the republic of a suburban tourist, who received severe sunburns.
The man rested in the shelter "Fisht," located at an altitude of 1.6 thousand meters.
The 27-year-old tourist had increased pressure, and breathing was also difficult.
Preliminary diagnosis is a serious allergic reaction.
The rescuers were approached by the head of the tourist group, who said that the man received burns in the campaign.
Audi will have to modify up to 850,000 diesel cars
The day before the announcement from the side of the Awka, BMW said they would be offering to update the software of more than 350,000 vehicles.
The chairman of the company said that the company believes that there are more intelligent ways than restrictions on driving, meaning European cities - including Munich, where BMW is located - considered the possibility of banning or limiting the use of diesel cars.
Daimler said on Thursday that it would modify three million Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce their diesel outtake.
None of the companies called their move a recall.
European automakers have been actively promoting the use of diesel cars in Europe and the United States to promote compliance with carbon dioxide emissions.
But the nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost for automakers installing equipment that neutralizes diesel car exhaust gas is also increasing, and it becomes difficult to maintain a competitive price for cars.
While German automakers are under scrutiny, Chancellor Angela Merkel's government has also been accused of indulging powerful automakers and ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies try not to repeat the mistakes of Volkswagen, which concealed the use of the so-called "decesses" that during testing could correct the amount of emitted harmful gases so that it complies with the rules, and in normal driving conditions turned off.
In the United States, several Volkswagen leaders were convicted, and the rest are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of the thermodynamics department as part of the engine development team "Audi" was arrested in Germany.
The former manager, Zackeo Giovanni Pamio, is an Italian, and therefore is not protected from extradition and may be brought to justice in the United States.
Earlier this year, an "Audi" was under a German criminal investigation involving Volkswagen after authorities accused Audi of installing the system to circumvent European ejection rules and expanded an investigation that had previously focused on the United States.
The inclusion of "Audi" in the investigation can create serious problems "Volkswagenu": the manufacturer of luxury cars is a source of a disproportionate share of income "Volkswagen."
In Astrakhan, a visitor to the cafe paid with fake money
The police received a message from the employee of the bank branch about the discovery during the recalculation of funds received from the point of catering, suspicious bills in denomination of 5 thousand rubles.
A study conducted at the Forensic and Expert Center found that it was fake.
According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia in the Astrakhan region, one of the visitors of the cafe, who bought a shawarma, paid with a banknote.
It is worth noting that the cash desk was not equipped with a device for determining the authenticity of the bills.
Currently, the police are installing persons involved in the manufacture and sale of a knowingly fake ticket of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation.
Such crimes are punishable by imprisonment for up to 8 years with a fine of up to 1 million rubles.
The Regional Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs urges residents of the Astrakhan region to be attentive when making financial transactions; employees of trade objects are recommended to install devices to verify the authenticity of the funds received.
Astronomers have found a "hell" planet, on which even iron can melt
Having studied the properties of the stratosphere of a giant exoplanet called WASP-121b, astrophysicists were surprised by its temperature, which is able to evaporate iron and other metals.
Experts have noticed that the water molecules are so heated by the light of the star that they emit infrared radiation.
The Hubble telescope captured the aurope of water molecules on this gas giant: this high temperature causes water in the planet's atmosphere to glow in the infrared range.
WASP-121b refers to the so-called "hot Jupiters" - gas giants, in size and mass comparable to the largest planet in the solar system, but located dozensimeter closer to the parent star.
Because of this year, the exoplanet lasts only 1.3 "earth" days, and its gas shell is heated to almost 2,500 degrees Celsius.
Climate change threatens lavender in Provence.
It has become a symbol of Provence and Southern France, but fears are now expressed that it is threatened by climate change.
Lavender grew worse due to dry weather and insects carrying disease; this caused the constant headaches of scientists and farmers trying to find a solution.
Eric Shes, an expert at the CRIEPPAM Agricultural Research Institute at Provence, says: "Lavender in Provence is indeed under threat because in recent years this plant has been experiencing the effects of climate change: in the spring and especially autumn, the rains have become much less.
This affects the life of lavender.
And there are small cicaries jumping on leaves insects that carry micro-bacteria; in very dry weather, there are a lot of them."
A lot is at stake.
Lavender not only attracts vacationers; lavender oil is very in demand in perfumes and cosmetology.
Eric Shes says: "Instead of very long ears with a large number of large colors, we have small, underdeveloped, weakened or absent.
We have fewer parts containing essential oil."
The solutions that are currently being considered include improving water distribution and slowing soil evaporation, as well as spraying plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and breeding varieties more resistant to drought.
Ambassador of the Winter Universiade 2019 met with Krasnoyarsk schoolchildren
Two-time world champion in hockey, Ambassador of the Winter Universiade 2019 Alexander Semin met the day before with novice hockey players and handed out autographs to the fans.
The meeting was held in the tent of the Winter Universiade 2019 within the framework of the thematic week dedicated to ice hockey.
Any visitor to the tent could ride on skates on the site with artificial ice.
In addition, relays, quizzes and games were organized with a draw of souvenirs of student games, a warm-up from the aerobics federation.
Fifty-five schoolchildren participated in the event.
Alexander Semin advised the children to do as much as possible at sports grounds and stressed that the most important thing at the initial stage of training is the hard work and a huge desire to engage in hockey.
"It's great that there is such a platform in Krasnoyarsk as the Winter Universiade 2019 tent, where novice athletes can directly ask questions to the coaches of the teams," the champion said.
It should be noted that the ambassadors of the Winter Universiade 2019 help to promote student sports and a healthy lifestyle among Krasnoyarsk residents.
The discreet will work throughout the summer season until September 25, the press service of the Directorate of the Winter Universiade 2019 reports.
In the state Department commented on the words of Medvedev
The official representative of the U.S. State Department Heather Nauert, commenting at a briefing on the words of Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, said the need to find "area for interaction" with Russia.
According to her, such areas should be found in order to "improve bilateral cooperation."
An example of such successful cooperation, Nauert called the agreement on the ceasefire on Syria.
We are two nuclear superpowers.
"And people around the world agree that the U.S. and Russia should be able to work with each other," she said.
At the same time, Nauert refused to comment on Medvedev's assertion of a full-fledged trade war between Russia and the United States.
"If Russia said this, then, of course, it has the right to talk, but I can't say more on this topic," - said the representative of the State Department.
Earlier, US President Donald Trump signed a bill on tightening sanctions against the Russian Federation.
Commenting on the new package of sanctions, the head of the Russian government Medvedev said that Washington had declared Moscow a full-fledged trade war, putting an end to the hope of improving bilateral relations.
Medvedev also said that the US sanctions will be in force for decades.
In addition, the Prime Minister believes, the American establishment "purely beat" Trump.
Missing in the suburbs bodybuilder found in someone else's dacha lost memory
Bodybuilder Shamil Khanmetov disappeared on the road to Noginsk on July 25 under very spicy circumstances: he left the car to go to the toilet.
For seven days, it was searched unsuccessfully by acquaintances and locals.
And there was Shamil in a foreign dacha in Ramenskoye.
He was completely naked by the owner found in his toilet.
The Dagestan athlete could not explain how it was here and what happened to him.
He couldn't even remember his name and his passport was missing.
To establish the identity helped the announcements about his disappearance.
The doctors who arrived on the call recorded Khanmetov partial memory loss and traumatic brain injury, according to the public Mash.
Probably, the athlete is waiting for other surprises.
The attackers who kidnapped Shamil probably already visited his apartment, the keys to which he also stole.
Oil and gas revenues of July exceeded the forecast by 7.4 billion rubles
In fact, the revenues received at the end of July 2017. exceeded the estimate by 7.4 billion rubles, according to the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation.
The excision, as the agency explains, was mainly due to the higher exchange rate of the US dollar to the ruble compared to the average monthly value of June used for the assessment, as well as due to the excess of the actual volume of gas production and the volume of exports of oil products to the forecasted levels.
"The rejection of the oil and gas revenues of the federal budget from the monthly estimate corresponding to the Federal Law on the Federal Budget for 2017-2019, in August 2017 is forecasted at +40.2 billion rubles," - stated in the message of the Ministry of Finance.
Thus, the total amount of funds allocated for the purchase of foreign currency on the domestic foreign exchange market in the period from August 7 to September 6, 2017 is 47.6 billion rubles.
Accordingly, the daily volume of purchase of foreign currency will be equivalent to 2.07 billion rubles.
The Bank of Russia will be involved in the purchase of foreign currency by the Ministry of Finance of Russia.
Each working day during the specified period, the Central Bank will conclude transactions in the purchase of foreign currency at the organized trading of the Moscow Exchange evenly during the trading day.
The foreign currency acquired will be credited to the accounts of the Federal Treasury in the Central Bank.
The murder of a journalist emphasizes that it is becoming more dangerous in Mexico.
Employees of the weekly Riozos newspaper usually meet on Wednesdays to discuss plans to cover the latest violent crimes in Sinaloa state linked to organized crime, corrupt officials, or the war-intensive drug dealers.
But today, depressed by their own tragedy, they met to talk about security.
They were told they had to change their habits.
Two senior journalists were discussing what it seemed safer: taking the children with them to the office, which in 2009 already threw a grenade, or leave them at home.
Security experts wrote on the board hanging in the room, three words: enemies, neutral people, allies.
They asked journalists to name the names for each column - no evidence is needed, suspicions and internal sensations will be enough.
These are drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected of being kept by the government or cartels, a list of scoundrels, because of which the work on the coverage of chaos in Mexico becomes dangerous.
Violence does not give a respite, and more and more journalists among the corpses that are multiplying in the country: according to the Journalists" Committee, no less than 25 since President Enrico Pena Nieto took office in December 2012; 589 people after attacks and threats are under federal protection; and this year at least seven people have died in seven states.
Among the latter are their publisher and inspirer, co-founder of Riodes Javier Valdes Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on violent drug-related crimes.
His absence is very acute, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, showing the middle finger, with the inscription "Justice" hangs on the facade of the building "Riodes"; two reporters for 30 years, Aaron Ibarr and Miriam Ramirez, wear shirts depicting his smile, face with glasses or his branded panama.
The seminar takes place less than two months after his death; journalists discuss their general trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, and paranoia.
Although in 2010 the office of the special federal prosecutor was organized to investigate journalistic cases, so far, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, only two cases were investigated.
As with most of the thousands of murders perpetrated every year involving drug trafficking and organized crime, murderers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.
Readoser insist that they will write about violence in Sinaloa, although they are killed in grief, although it is now much more dangerous.
Without information about the killers, without justice from talking about security at meetings, there is little benefit, - says Ibarra.
"It's very silly to waste time on this seminar," he says.
"Until we know the reason, we suspect everyone."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of Riodos in the state capital of Culiacan.
He managed to drive only a couple of blocks before his red Toyota Corollo was stopped by two men; he was pulled out of the car and shot him 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which means "Twelfth River."
The shooter left in his car and smashed it nearby.
Valdes was 50 years old.
He has a wife and two adult children.
Rumors usually diverge quickly on the Culiacan.
But almost everything is silent about Valdez.
Since Guzman was arrested and extradited to the U.S. in January last year, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields in the country as rival factions fight to fill the vacuum.
Let's not say that every day on the streets of Sinaloa kill one or more people, or that the cemetery is filled with decorated two-storey mausoleums of drug lures, which are more than the homes of many living people.
Forget for a moment that the state of "calm" is just when one of the cartels takes control of a seaside state with important ports and ways of drug trafficking in the United States.
Despite this and the fact that Valdes was well aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bohorkes, 60-year-old co-founder and director of Rios, was crushed by guilt for failing to protect his friend.
He thinks two mistakes helped the murder.
First, in February, an interview was published with Damaso Lopez, the leader of one of the rival factions of the cartel, who is at war with the sons of Guzman.
The publication could anger the sons; the people, who were believed to have been members of the gang, bought all copies of the publication as soon as they were taken to the kiosks.
The second mistake was that he did not force Valdez for his own safety to leave the country after another newspaper was captured, which wrote about the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder was seen as another milestone in the development of violence against journalists in Mexico.
He walked away from the danger for so long, his friends and colleagues thought that he would always be.
He was an experienced reporter at Noroesta and in 2003, together with five colleagues, he founded Riodos, selling his $50 shares.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to engage in journalism without touching on the topic of drugs," Bohorkes said.
Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation as a bold and fair publication, sales and advertising revenues grew.
Journalists liked that they could publish bold reports, not fearing censorship, and readers were attracted that in this edition they could read about what no one dared to write about.
Eight years after its founding, Riodose received the prestigious Maria Moores Award for his reporter in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdes won the International Press Freedom Prize for the courage in the investigation of the drug trade in Mexico, wherever it leads.
He admitted he was scared.
"I want to live on," he said at the CPJ Award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa is a "lifestyle," he said in an interview with Rompeyento TV last October.
"You have to accept the tasks that lie on you as a journalist - either so or you're just fooling."
I don't want to be asked, "What were you doing when there were so many deaths around... why didn't you say what was going on?"
Riodos employees are bored with Valdez, a joker who fought like a loader in the port, a friend, generous to arms and advice, a teacher who knew how to live.
They relied on their order.
He should always wear his hat.
He had to go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit there at the same table.
Now they ask, "Have he been destroyed by the love of the order once?"
His death also made them doubt their calculations on how best to do their work and stay alive.
"They don't like to know their wives, children, their legal business and underground airfields for drug transportation.
"These things were beyond the line," Bohorques said.
The result, even in the best times, was a high level of self-censorship and the desire for self-preservation.
You have to believe our instincts.
Stay away from what smells bad.
The problem, says Riodose editor Andres Villareal, is that "the misery can be deceived ... and then what happened to Javier" is happening."
The old rules, he says, are no longer in effect in Sinaloa - as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero, and other states, where there is a poisonous mix of lucrative smuggled paths, weak state institutions, and corrupt officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riozos employees gathered for security training, it was suddenly forbidden to make cell phones: a few days before it became known that spy programs, which are sold exclusively to governments, are used in Mexico to monitor journalists and social activists.
Outside, two policemen take refuge in the shade of the tree from 104-degree heat (40 degrees Celsius).
They were instructed by the state government to guard the Riodose office, which is located in a four-story building in the Kuliakan bourgeois quarter.
Some journalists half-jokingly asked if these policemen were in the 50 percent of the order officials about whom the governor himself said they could not be trusted.
A few months ago, journalists went to a mountainous area, which is de facto under the control of gangs of drug traffickers.
In the next issue, Riodos counted on three main topics.
This is the murder in Sinalo of the brother of former boxing champion Julio Cesar Chavez.
They also had the exposure of government spending, concentrated in the governor's hometown.
And there was a group kidnapping of people in one of the most expensive restaurants of Culiacana, a block from the prosecutor's office.
Officially, it was not announced who was kidnapped or how it happened, so it was necessary to be careful when it was time to write about what everyone in the city knew: that it was a favorite restaurant of both drug dealers and authorities.
One of their journalists learned from open databases that the restaurant was registered in the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which dominated all levels of government throughout the past century.
Recently, high-profile allegations of corruption have been brought against several PRI governors.
Villareal asked journalists to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including when the son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped from the raid of the military.
A few months ago, readers would be looking for Valdez's column with the most reliable information about the abduction.
"We'd like we'd know what happened before," said Villareal, 46, for his leaning physique, nicknamed "El Flaco."
"Today, all channels of communication with our sources are broken."
Valdez's cabinet is now being used as a warehouse for posters and stickers with protests against the murders of journalists because the staff became what they never thought of becoming: activists speaking on behalf of the press.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez took several posters and went the next morning to a demonstration at the local prosecutor's office, dedicated to another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the state of Michoacan in the west of the country three days after Valdez was killed.
They found a burned body, and the authorities said it was him, based on DNA tests.
Across the country, journalists began to speak louder, organize protests and write "SOS Press" on the sidewalks and walls of houses.
On that day, Director Bohorques was in Washington, trying to enlist international support in demanding justice in the Valdez case.
At a meeting with Governor Sinaloa the day after the murder of Valdez Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and ordering their murders for telling the truth.
After that, she asked not to give her more tasks to cover the government's activities, fearing that anger would hurt her objectivity.
Valdez has said many times that journalists in Mexico are "encircled" by organized crime, by her accomplices in the government and an indifferent society.
In his latest book, Narco Journalism, he wrote that reporters are not just killed by gangs of drug traffickers; they do so on orders from politicians and security services colluding with organized crime.
The Articul 19 Press Protection Committee estimates that half of the attacks on journalists last year were carried out by order of police and government officials.
"You die in Mexico because they want to shut you up," Ramirez says.
Of course, the murders are frightening people.
Everyone remembers the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias six years ago in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
On her body found a note allegedly written on behalf of the Zetas cartel: "I'm here because of my articles."
The computer keyboard and headphones lay next to its cut head.
Some publications chose to close as the El Norte newspaper in the northern border state of Chihuahua after killing her correspondent Miroslava Brich in March.
Others continue to hold on as "El Manyana" of Nuevo Laredo after the assassination of her boss in 2004.
In 2010, "Diario de Ciudad Juarez" publicly addressed drug cartels with the help of an editorial on the first page entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have left their home states or the country.
It's a painful decision.
It is difficult to find a job in exile, and they are still looking for danger in the streets.
And sometimes they're killed, as it's obviously happened to photographer Rubenin Espinosa, who was killed in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico three months after fleeing Veracruz.
Those who remain and continue to work balance between risky decisions every day.
Ibarra - who once dreamed of being a poet - admits he's scared to write about drug trafficking.
"Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a journalist," he says.
Last Friday, at midnight, when the last issue was already ready for printing, the publishers of "Riodes" sat on the sidewalk next to the office and drank beer when suddenly their phones rang at the same time.
A series of shootings between opposing gangs and security forces near the resort town of Masatlan left behind, according to confirmed data, 19 corpses.
The war continued to ignite, as promised in a series of messages from cartels found in the area.
Sitting on the sidewalk, they posted the news over the mobile phone to the Riodos website.
The next day I had to redo the first page.
The sirens were picked up - another shootout in the vicinity.
Bohorques looked at the defense of the police guarding them.
If they were scared, they didn't show it.
Sitting under a huge portrait of the deceased founder of their newspaper, whose middle finger was put on display throughout Sinaloa, Riodos Employees continued his work.
"How can you think about closing," Bohorkes said, "why on the very day Javier was killed, the practitioner asked me to send her to the street to report?"
Dinosaur used camouflage to avoid enemies
At first glance, it seems like a statue, albeit terrifying.
The researchers said that the first remains of an incredible rhino creature discovered by a Canadian miner have survived so well that experts called it "Mona Lisa among dinosaurs."
It was so well preserved that they were even able to determine that the color of its scaly skin was reddish-brown and to say that it had, in some ways, a dark past.
In a report published in the journal "Modern Biology," it was described as the "the best preserved of the Tyreophores in the history of the finds and one of the best specimens of the dinosaur in the world."
It is a fossil - a newly found specimen of nodosaurus, which lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period, between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His incredible good condition has been stunned by the researchers who call it "really wonderful."
This herbivorous thyroid is the best preserved fossil of this species in the history of the finds, according to articles in the journal National Geographic.
It was found by Sean Fank when he was working at the Sancor Company Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
He came across something that seemed to be different from the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely.
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrellian Paleontological Museum.
The next six years work was carried out to detect an animal inside an earthen block weighing 2500 futs (1,100 kilograms).
Now that all this hard work is done, the finished result can be demonstrated.
It is only worth a little squint, and you can almost believe that he is asleep, - said lead author Caleb Brown, a researcher at the Royal Terrel Paleontological Museum, where the creation is being demonstrated.
It will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa among the dinosaurs.
Studying its skin, the researchers found that it was herbivorous, despite the fact that it was covered with a shell and resembled a walking tank, apparently exposed to significant danger from carnivorous dinosaurs.
This heavily covered dinosaur used red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a protective technique known as a protective coloring, which is also used by many animals of our day.
This would allow him to merge faster with the surroundings and avoid meeting enemies, experts say, suggesting that larger dinosaurs were hunting him.
This 110-million-year-old creature belonging to the nodozaurs family was widely covered in print in May, and is now on display at the Royal Tirrel Paleontological Museum.
The scientists have already studied the animal and gave it the name Borealopelta markmitchelli in honor of museum laboratory technician Mark Mitchell, one of the members of the group who spent more than 7,000 hours behind his painstaking excavation.
The amazing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international group of scientists to document the drawing and shape of the scales and shells on his body.
They discovered a protective coloring, a common method of protection in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its lower side.
Although the protective coloring is well-proverbous, the discovery came as a surprise, because the size of the dinosaur Borealopelta is significantly higher than the size of the currently living animals with a protective color.
It can be assumed that this dinosaur was so actively hunted by carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution preferred the disguise of confrontation as a way of survival.
But most modern animals with protective hepacals - such as deer, zebras or armadillos - are much smaller and are more affordable prey, suggesting that the nodosare had to fight seriously for survival.
"Serious threat from predators to a massive, powerful dinosaur shell shows how dangerous the predatory dinosaurs were," Brown said.
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in the scales of a dinosaur also suggests that its skin should have been reddish-brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal, looking for information about his life, including the preserved contents of his digestive tract, to find out what he ate during his last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, it fell into the river and was taken to the sea, sank and back down to the ocean.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as it is now in southern Florida, and rivers and oceans are likely to spread much further inland than now.
"This nodsauer is truly remarkable in that it is completely covered with surviving scaly skin, and at the same time fully preserved in three dimensions, preserving the original shape of the animal," Brown said.
As a result, the animal now looks almost the same as it looked then, in the Early Cretaceous period.
It is not necessary to resort to imagination in order to recreate it, it is only necessary to squint slightly, and you can almost believe that he is asleep.
The celetal period is an era when the giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs standing on two legs, roamed the Earth.
Although the most remarkable of them, the tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years later than Borealopelta, the thyreophora could be hunted by one of his formidable ancestors.
These include an acquantosaurus, a 38-foot long (1.5 meters) weight of six tons.
Scientists whose latest discoveries are published in the journal "Modern Biology" believe that Borealopelta was taken to sea after death and mummified in the  yet.
The creature was found by Sean Fank when he was working at the Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
According to museum staff, this is the best-preserved thyreophor in the world, along with the skin and shell, and it is intact, from the face to the femoral bones.
On average, these creatures reached about 18 feet (five meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kilograms).
Their characteristic feature was two twenty-inch spikes coming out of their shoulders.
Researchers believe that this herbivorous thyroid thriophore proceeded hard on what is now Canada, until the spilled river took it to the open sea.
But the dinosaur's paratrooper park has preserved its shell with precision to the smallest details.
The fossils of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the remains of the skin still cover the bumpy shell plates along the dinosaur skull.
As Michael Greshko wrote in an article for National Geographic magazine, such a degree of preservation is rare, as winning the lottery.
The longer I look at him, the more amazing he seems.
Fossil skin remains still cover the bumpy shell plates dotting the animal's skull.
His right front leg is stretched along the side, five fingers on it are turned up.
I can count the scales on his sole.
Mikheil Saakashvili managed to get to Poland without documents
Mikheil Saakashvili, who previously headed Georgia, and then the Odessa region in Ukraine, flew to Poland.
At the same time, he did not have documents confirming his identity and citizenship.
The arrival of Saakashvili is reported by the Polish edition of Telewizja Republika, which posted a video on his YouTube channel with his performance.
Saakashvili spoke at an event in honor of the anniversary of the Warsaw Uprising against Hitler's troops in 1944.
Since the politician does not know Polish, although he tried to start the speech in this language, he had to speak English through a Polish translator.
During his speech, the politician touched upon the topic of cooperation between Georgia and Poland, and also spoke about Ukraine.
The fact that the migration service of Ukraine deprived him of citizenship, the disgraced politician learned while in the United States.
How exactly he managed to make a transatlantic flight without documents is still unknown.
Earlier, the former governor of the Odessa region, Mikheil Saakashvili, said that his signature on the questionnaire for obtaining Ukrainian citizenship was forged.
The politician stressed that he did not fill out any questionnaires.
The investigation into the case of Weinziher and Olkhovik extended until January
The term of the preliminary investigation in the case of the co-owner of the group of companies "Renova" Evgeny Olkhovik and the head of the energy holding "T Plus" Boris Weinsikher has been extended until January 2, 2018.
On Thursday, August 3, the Basmanny court is considering the issue of extending the accused house arrest.
The representative of the UK at the meeting announced the decision to last extend the period of the preliminary investigation.
"The special complexity and duration of the investigation is due to the need to seize and conduct an examination of a large number of documents, as well as to conduct investigative actions on the territory of several subjects of the Russian Federation," the investigator said.
He added that the suspects regularly gave bribes to the leadership of Comey.
Their total size is estimated at at least a billion rubles.
According to the investigation, Weinsicher, Olhovik, as well as the former head of Complex Energy Systems CJSC Mikhail Slobodin, who until September 5 headed the company "Vympelcom," handed bribes to the highest officials of the Republic of Komi for the establishment of the most favorable tariffs for thermal and electricity, as well as for the creation of favorable conditions for business.
Weinsicher and Olkhovik were detained, sent to Syktyvkar and arrested for two months, Slobodin fled the investigation and was put on the federal wanted list.
How did one activist learn the answer to the question "Whose streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Britthenie Ferrel was shocked to the bottom of her heart.
Just a day after arriving in New York as part of a tourist trip, a native of St. Louis was sitting on a bed in an apartment rented through Airbnb, viewing Facebook tape on her phone.
She came to the post of someone from high school.
It was said that the police had just killed an eighteen-year-old child, and he's still lying in the middle of the street.
Having noticed that no one else in her tape was postponing to this information, puzzled, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
Her ribbon had a lot of reposts of the user with the nickname "TheePharoah."
A rapper from Greater St. Louis in real time covered the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black eighteen-year-old teenager killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He published a photo of Brown's lifeless body, spread out among the street where it will be four hours.
"It's wildness," thought Ferrel.
But death was not new to her and her circle.
She put off her phone, and later in the evening she went back to tweets that people were going to Canfield drive.
There were pictures of the plaque and screaming people and a man who claimed that he was Brown's father, holding a poster with the words: "The Ferguson Policeman has just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a live broadcast of a police officer standing in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, another policeman, - she said, - he pulled the trigger of the rifle and screamed: "I will kill all of you. The animals! . .
This is a non-standard situation, - according to her own memories, said Ferrel.
It's not a murder like the ones we're used to and who we call typical.
I felt chills at the time.
I was angry and cried.
She took a ticket for the return flight and flew home the next day.
Landing at 11 p.m., she took her six-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that they would both go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrel and Ferguson in the next almost three years was the subject of a new documentary film "Checkey Street," which will be released on August 11.
It's a tale of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience from the perspective of people living in the community and filling the streets, demanding answers.
While Ferrel was going to Ferguson with her daughter, dressed in a flower and wreath to the color, they remembered the conversation that had countless times before the morning, the experience of blacks and their situation.
She remembers saying, "You remember me, how did I tell you about how black people had to fight for what they believed in?
We're going to Ferguson because a policeman killed an eighteen-year-old boy, and that was wrong.
"I couldn't help but take her," Ferrell said later.
What's happening today is the culmination of what happened before.
She needs to know about it, see it and be brought up on it.
It must not only be well versed in activism and organization, but also understand the different levels of black experience and their positions, and what we must do to be free to be free.
Even if I can provide her with an environment in which she herself does not personally face obvious racism, she is no different than any other black girl.
I feel like I'd do her a bad favor if I'd fence it off.
When they arrived in Ferguson, they made the first stop on South Florence's Ruud, on a site across the street from a police station that became a tent camp while activists were waiting for reports of the final non-accusation of Officer Darren Wilson.
Ferrell and his daughter joined a local entrepreneur who was preparing lunch packs.
They collected packages and helped to distribute them to the protesters.
Little in the mind, Ferrel took shape of a new type of activism.
"My activism has changed completely after August 9," she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri-Saint-Louis, she was president of the Association of Sanitarian Students, representatives of national minorities, and was engaged in food justice and health inequalities among black communities.
I didn't have the experience of the organizer.
It came by itself.
A few weeks later, at an evening demonstration, Ferrel met Sabaa Folayan, one of her co-directors.
Folayan said that she and her main cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrere  - just wanted to document the events.
Ferrel came to mind the question: "Do you want to document, or are you trying to find a story that you can play?
This skepticism was inspired by numerous people, often white, who came to the community to benefit from its pain and persistence.
As explained in a recent interview with Folaryan, we have heard that the voices of people who were born and raised in Ferguson do not get into the spotlight, and wanted to do it differently.
By that time, Folyan had already teamed up with her co-director Damon Davis, a local artist known for her activism on the issues of death.
His involvement aroused the sympathy for the project at Ferrel and six other local residents, with whom the project team - Whose streets? has been in contact for the years since the murder of Brown.
"In this documentary, someone doesn't speak for us or with us, it's us," Davis said.
It was the most important thing for me, as these people will be presented, because this is how I will be presented myself.
And although the project's goal was not to focus on Ferrel's experience in quest to show that the movement is not about a savior leader, but about how the community unites, as Folayan said - she was the most open of the film.
As a result, in "Whose streets?" unexpectedly, the personal aspects of Ferrell's life are shown, for example, how she fell in love and married her wife.
"I felt naked," said Ferrell, laughter telling me about how I saw the finished product for the first time.
But I knew that when you do this job and humanize blacks, there must be some level of vulnerability.
In addition, Ferrel's story is again discussing and emphasizing the role of a black gay woman in the broader context of the blacks" movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement - those who created the tag "BlackLivesMatter" on social media after the murder of a black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 - consider themselves homosexual.
"Black gay women in leadership positions support the whole movement," Ferrel says. That's because we're constantly fighting on a few fronts.
Black homosexual women have to bear all this burden.
Folayan agreed with this claim, noting that the movement is actually supported by black women and many gay black women.
However, she insists that this is not a case of positive discrimination, and that Ferrel was not elected as the film's central character because of its distinctive features.
"She was the person who awakened this energy," she said.
On the other hand, it's not a coincidence that it's in the forefront, because when it's
You can feel her energy through the screen.
Meanwhile, Ferguson has long gone" no film cameras, but there are complex racial connections between the community and the police.
Ferrel will be on a probationary period for the closure of the highway during the demonstration.
It describes the socio-political atmosphere of the place, which he calls home, simply: "Bardac."
She's still holding on to the switcher she learned when she took to the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
We must fight for our freedom.
We have to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains.
Two Salvadoran football players disqualified for the bite of US players
The players of the national team of Salvador Henry Romero and Darwin Seren received long disqualifications for unsportsmanlike behavior.
During the quarter-final match of the Gold Cup of the Confederations of Football of North and Central America and the Caribbean (CONCACAF), the Salvadorans bit American players.
The first was the defender Henri Romero.
The Salvadoran bite striker Josie Altidor, and then pinched him by the chest.
Then midfielder Seren, while filing a corner in the penalty area, bite U.S. defender Omar Gonzalez.
As a result, Romero was disqualified for three matches, and Seren - for six.
The meeting itself ended with the victory of the Americans with a score of 2:0, reports Goal.com.
The Emergence of Similarity: The artist creates portraits with the DNA of Chelsea Manning
In the center of the hall at the Friedman Gallery in New York, people's faces hang from the ceiling on the wire - white, black and brown, all elusively similar to each other.
These 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Harborg of brushstrokes and hair prunings sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent pruning from Fort Levenworth prison, where a former intelligence analyst is serving a 35-year sentence for the famous transfer of confidential diplomatic telegrams on the WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition, which opened on August 2, is called "The Emergence of Resemblance."
This is the result of a two-year correspondence between Dewey Harborg, whose art combines technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transgender and famous dissident who Barack Obama commuted the sentence just three days before the end of his presidency.
Analyzing the DNA computer program obtained from Manning and using it to create three-dimensional portraits of individuals that might have people with the genome, Dewey-Harborg created a deep, albeit difficult to perceive, manifesto not only on the plasticity of DNA data - different ways of interpreting them and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also the concept of identity.
Manning, who was born with the name Bradley Edward, but from adolescence openly said that she considers herself a woman, in 2013 was sentenced to 20 episodes, including six violations of the Espionage Act, computer fraud and theft.
Her photos in the prison were inaccessible, so only one photograph of her was known: a grainy black and white selfie, in which Manning in a platinum shade of a wig, clearly feeling embarrassing, sitting behind the wheel of the car; with this photo she was associated.
In 2015, Dewey Harborg completed her 2012 project "Vision of Strangers."
In it, the artist created portraits of unknown people with the help of court evidence such as cigarette butts and chewing gum, extracting DNA from this debris and creating images of what these people could look like.
And then she received an email from Paper Magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted some portrait to illustrate the article," she explained at a show off the show on the new press show.
At the time, Chelsea could not be visited and photographed, so they contacted her and asked if she wanted to get a portrait created from her DNA.
In this unusual way, the artist and her muse, who was in prison, became friends by correspondence and exchanged several letters for two years.
They even wrote a book of comics "Suppressed Images," illustrated by Shoilie Kanungo, who portrayed how in the future the president would soften the punishment of Chelsea and she will be able to visit the exhibition in person.
The fact that Obama really decided to release Manning just a few days after the book's release came out was a pleasant surprise after seven hard years in a Kansas military prison.
There is something profound and strong in the fact that the exhibition opens just now, when Donald Trump declares war on people who reveal secret information in the government, and invents new ways to incite on Twitter the enmity that he is called to soften.
When Dewey-Harborg was asked about the coincidence of this in time, she said that "it's not accidental."
In a statement written on the galley's wall, Manning's huge signature below (with a heart instead of a point over the "i" in her last name) calls for an end to "automatic division based on sex, race, sexual orientation and culture."
On the opposite side is its mitochondrial DNA, a long caterpillar from pencil-prescribed by C, G and A.
Turning on 200 letters (or nucleotides, as a scientifically exquisitely expressed artist), Dewey-Harborg hoped to show how we all are surprisingly similar, at least in its biological structure.
"I hope to explain to people that our genome does not determine what we are, how open genetic data is to interpret and how subjective it is," said Dea-Harborg; her 2007 video "False Memories" is also displayed here.
"DNA data can tell us a lot of different stories, and 30 of these stories are here."
The last part of the exposition, which can be found in one room, is the novel mentioned above in comics.
On it, Manning in the style of the King Kong appears over the building of the Correctional Barracks of the United States with a loudspeaker in his hand.
"If they kill your speech, they will win," it says.
"So never shut up."
"This is a direct quote from the letter she wrote to me," says the artist who welcomes us from Philadelphia.
"I still have goosebumps on my skin when I talk about it."
Manning hasn't seen the exhibition personally - as it was visionary depicted in the comics - but when she comes, she'll be greeted with masks in the center of the room, her own gumfish, gathered like crowds of protesters.
This is also done intentionally, as is everything at the exhibition up to a height (5"2, Manning's height), on which the genetic haplogroups were drawn with a pencil.
"I'd have hung them on the walls before, but now I wanted them to look like a crowd of people," says Dewey Harborg about the portraits.
"I wanted them to be like the mass movement that formed around Chelsea as the movement that stood behind her liberation."
Professors of Northwestern University and employee of Oxford University are looking for police on charges of murder
According to police, there is a nationwide raid on a professor at Northwestern University and an employee of the University of Oxford, who are wanted as suspects in connection with the fact that a man was found to death in a luxury room in Chicago.
According to the records of the Cook County Court, detention warrants were issued on Monday for premeditated murder without the right to be released on the bail of forty-two-year-old Windham Latham and fifty-six-year-old Andrew Warren in connection with their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton G. James Cornell-Duranlo.
According to the documents, twenty-six-year-old Cornell-Duranlo died after being inflicted multiple stabbing injuries.
A warning released by the Chicago Police Department said the body had been found on July 27.
The police received a call, they arrived in the complex of the apartment "Grand Plaza" and found the victim with several wounds on the body.
According to officials, Cornell-Duranlo was declared dead at the crime scene, and detectives are now investigating the death of stab wounds, considering her murder, while the police are looking for two suspects.
Lagram has been an adjunct professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Kabbage, the University's vice president of communications, said in a statement filed by email that Latham was on administrative leave and that he was not allowed to go to Northwestern campuses.
"This is now a criminal case that is being investigated by authorized persons, and the North-West University is cooperating with the investigation," Kabbaj said.
Warren is a senior financial officer at the University of Oxford.
A spokesperson for the University and Somerville College said in a statement filed by e-mail: "We have spoken to the UK police and are ready to provide any necessary assistance to the U.S. investigation agencies.
The statement also said that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to give up.
The head of the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Guglielmi, said he strongly advised the suspects to surrender to the authorities.
"The police have speculation about their whereabouts, but our attempts to find them are intensifying," Guglielmi said.
According to Guglielmi, the local, regional and federal authorities are helping in the search for suspects.
According to Guglielmi, the police called the administrator of the building "Grand-Plaza," who just received a mysterious message that something had happened in the room 1008.
The police called the crime scene awful.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident itself occurred on July 27.
According to him, the data from the video cameras confirm that Latham and Warren were in the building.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim were in a relationship," Guglielmi said.
The management of the "Grand-Plaza" manual issued an appeal to the guests, which reported: "At the moment, the police are working on the chronology of the incident, collect information about the victim and consider a number of motives, including a possible domestic accident.
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko: "We will meet the requirements of the WADA road map in the near future"
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that the conditions of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), set for the resumption of the work of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA), will be fulfilled in the near future.
"A certain stage in the implementation of the requirements was passed, RUSADA was given the right to plan and conduct tests together with the UKAD (anti-doping agency of the UK).
The WADA roadmap was accordingly updated," Mutko said on Thursday.
The Prime Minister commented on the second part of the WADA roadmap for restoring compliance status to the Code, which lists the conditions for the resumption of the work of RUSADA and was recently published on the organization's website.
According to Mutko, it does not contain anything that could present difficulties for Russia.
"Everything has been announced, everything will be done.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," he added.
However, one of the requirements included in the list implies that Russian anddoping structures should publicly recognize the results of the investigation conducted by the WADA of the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, which claimed that doping in Russian sports is controlled by the state.
Regarding this issue, Mutko said: "We are investigating because our anti-doping system failed.
All measures have been taken.
But there were no state programs, and we will not recognize what was not."
Mutko repeated the words of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the Russian independent public anti-doping commission.
On the morning of the same day, in an interview with the Russian edition of "Rsport," Smirnov recognized the problems in the Russian anti-doping structures that had previously taken place, but added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains certain controversial positions and provisions.
Unreservedly, no one is going to accept this report," Smirnov added.
WADA suspended RUSADA from doping control in November 2015 after a doping scandal.
However, in June of this year, he was allowed to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
After visiting the Moscow office of the organization in July, WADA Director General Olivier Niggley said that RUSADA is "moving in the right direction" to restore his work.
Extinguished in the 79-storey tower in Dubai
A major fire that occurred in one of the world's tallest residential buildings, the Torch Tower, extinguished, Reuters reports.
It is noted that firefighters managed to cope with all the fires by 4.00 local time (3.00 MSK).
Local authorities reported that as a result of the incident, no one was injured.
At the time of the fire extinguishing, the streets adjacent to the skyscraper were blocked.
The reasons for what happened are still unknown.
Earlier it was reported that in Dubai there is a 79-storey residential skyscraper The Torch, which is one of the tallest buildings in the world.
All the tenants were evacuated in time.
Buzova's unimaginable outfit shocked fans: trousers that do not cover the cowards
Scandalous presenter of the reality show "House-2" Olga Buzova amazed the audience of the Europa Plus Live festival with dances in panties.
In the eyes of thousands of fans, the newly-discovered singer duet with Nastya Kudri performed the song "We will be hot."
Both girls came on stage in the provocative "bugs" sewn in such a way that the singers were in sight.
On the trousers were inscriptions Buzova and Kudry.
Earlier it was reported that a specialist of one of the Moscow clinics of plastic surgery commented on the changes in the appearance of Buzova.
Stoltenberg acknowledged the deterioration of relations between NATO and Russia
This was reported on Friday, August 4, the news service "Radio 4" with reference to foreign media.
According to him, for the deterioration of relations between the West and Russia, the Russian authorities are responsible.
In an interview with CNN, NATO Secretary General also criticized Russia for the situation with Crimea and "destabilisation in eastern Ukraine."
At the same time, Stoltenberg assured that dialogue with Russia, however, is possible, and further escalation of the situation will not benefit any of its participants.
Earlier on Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump said that relations between the United States and Russia are at a dangerously low level, and accused the US Congress of it.
Metro Ekaterinburg is mastering a new payment method
In October, travel to the Yekaterinburg metro can be paid by credit card, said the General Director of OJSC "I-Net" Pavel Vedernikov in an interview with the "Regional newspaper."
Our goal is to introduce the same system of payment for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in the metro as in other major cities: Moscow, St. Petersburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Novosibirsk.
"We want fans from other countries, guests of the world Cup, to be able to use the metro with their bank cards, without buying tokens and standing in line," he said.
Startups that will help your company not to become another "Uber"
Amy Errett wanted to assess the level of satisfaction among employees of her e-commerce startup, but surveys did not work.
The answers were often vague, useless, or worse, insincere.
And even though she promised anonymity, some employees did not trust this process.
"It has never been consistent and objective," said Errett, a San Francisco-based company of 75 people at the head of the hair care company, Madison Reed, an e-commerce company in the field of hair care.
Therefore, she asked third parties for help.
Now there is a new kind of startups in the field of personnel, which help companies to find out how their employees feel.
By developing and licensing software, the purpose of which is to measure the involvement of employees, they allow companies to make express surveys, reach out to certain teams and demographic groups, to offer employees anonymity and hotlines for complaints, and in some cases to allow whistleblowers to pass the top management and contact the Directorate directly.
Now we have tools like Strava and Fitbit for health monitoring, and where is Fitbit for your company? - says Jim Barnett, co-founder and president of the startup "Glint" from Redwood City, whose analytical programs are used by companies to measure the involvement of employees.
Errett said she had achieved a greater understanding of what its employees think and feel in the three years of their use.
In addition to the express requests and questionnaires of certain teams, the product offers a heat map of the company and shows in a visual form, which units have more complaints and which managers have a low approval rating, which allows it to understand why.
Companies are gradually aware that they need to control the situation in the workplace, otherwise they will become another "Uber," who was involved in the scandal, when the former employee published a blog post in which he described the aggressive situation in which those who expressed dissatisfaction were punished.
For startups like Glint, this desire to control the situation is an opportunity for a profitable business.
Let's talk about the payment dedicated to financial technology, the global governance, regulation and compliance industry could cost more than $118.7 billion by 2020.
The startup of Denvercent, Colorado, helping companies prevent and detect bad behavior, noted a slight increase in interest and activity earlier this year amid a fall in the reputation of Uber.
There are almost 600 customers, including ?Airbnb?, ?Microsoft and ?Tesla?????????????????????????????????????????????????????
Recently, among the customers appeared "Uber."
Like Glint, it allows companies to send custom-made staff surveys, collect confidential answers in real time, and view the heat maps of problem areas.
It also provides a hotline for anonymous text messages that allows employees to report bad behavior.
And if the top manager is affected, the complaints go directly to the directorate.
"The court of public opinion has intercepted power from the inspectors," said Patrick Quinland, founder and president of the company.
If it turns out that the company treats employees poorly or behaves unethically, even if the inspectors do not intervene, the company may face expensive consequences in the form of bribery from customers, the outflow of employees and lawsuits, said Quinlan.
The restaurant chain, where there are more than 25,000 employees in 500 establishments, has used the company for more than a year to make sure that employees are aware of the rules and procedures, and offer an easy way to contact the company's head office.
Previously, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to look for a phone number or mail of the head office, file an official complaint and hope that she would be taken seriously.
It was often a frightening and embarrassing experience, said James Vitrano, head of the legal department of the company's Ruby Tuesday, who said there was no normal way to track employee complaints.
Now that the company is using the service, the problems that used to be hidden from managers sitting in offices in other cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment and unfair pay - can be detected and dealt with them.
"I can get closer to a holistic, comprehensive understanding of the situation of employees," said Vitrano, who runs the risk management group of the network.
And we protect our shareholders from litigation with employees.
According to Quinland, the companies began to be more serious about the ethics, values and involvement of employees in 2002, after the accounting firm "Arthur Andersen" collapsed due to ethical violations as a result of Del Enron.
But only when the social networks became widespread, companies realized that they could not keep their dirty laundry from viral spread on the network.
"Before you start using technology to control ethics, people have used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, charging companies with a regular fee for using their products.
This is a business model and an opportunity that has received the approval of venture investors who supported both startups.
In February, Convercent received $10 million in funding from firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing the company's total capital to $47 million.
Glint received $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing the company's total capital to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising given the interrelated nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
The growing volume of research shows that today's employees expect more jobs than they used to do before.
In hard-competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high wages, and interesting projects are just the minimum required.
Employees want to feel that they are being accepted and appreciated, and that they dedicate their time to the company with a positive mission.
"When people are happy to work in the company, feel they are heard, and that the work they are doing brings results, they are more trying to make such a company a success," says Nina McQueen, vice president of global benefits and employee satisfaction at the company, where both "Converent" and "Converent" are used.
Investors get income when businesses from their portfolio go well; companies are doing well when employees are loyal and engaged.
If third-party analytical tools promise to increase the dedication and involvement of employees, it is not surprising that they find support.
According to the specialists on the workplace, it is important to have data on the involvement of employees.
But the data is useless until the company's trustees take action.
In fact, if a company asks employees for feedback, it may give the impression that change is coming.
And if the changes do not come quickly enough, or do not come at all, disappointment can develop, and employees will lose interest.
"If you're going to ask for 4,000 offers, you should be ready to hold 4,000 conversations," says Russell Rath, president of consulting at the management firm Kotter International, who had to see companies making a mistake, relying too on data collection.
Because, if you don't go to the end, the staff will be guessing: "You've really heard me?"
You don't care?
And if you don't care, why shouldn't I not care?
According to Errett, the company, which now conducts monthly surveys of employees, is able to take action on the same day that someone reports the problem with the help of Glint.
And, after collecting feedback from employees dissatisfied with the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, it was able to reorganize several teams within the company and introduce communication training to solve problems.
It is gaining new knowledge of its employees and hopes that in the long term, this knowledge will help it to more effectively retain employees in the industry, known for their high turnover.
"If you don't try to create a culture of transparency, you'll lose people," Vitrano said.
If you lose people, you lose customers.
If you lose customers, you lose your company.
In Barnaul unleash a new asphalt on the Avenue of Krasnoarmeysky
In Barnaul, radical measures were taken to eliminate the cause of the asphalt failures on Krasnoarmeysky Avenue.
The place where the holes appeared twice on the newly asphalted roadway (crossing with Molodezhnaya Street), it was decided to "open."
Recall that the collapse of a small section of the road near the tram tracks occurred due to the fact that the land in the area of the unexploited network.
According to the Deputy Chairman of the city committee on road management, landscaping, transport and communication Ivan Garmat, for a detailed survey and elimination of the prerequisites for the collapse will conduct a detailed survey.
Depending on its results, the necessary measures will be taken.
It is expected that the restoration of the formwork of hostless communications and their concreting will be required.
This is reported on the official website of the regional capital.
The Bruins team has to do longer due to the fact that the National Student Sports Association canceled training twice a day
Time is approaching 11 p.m.; a crowd of football players from the University of California, Los Angeles are delayed to chat on one side of the new training fields of the team located on campus.
Some of them pulled their shirts, excavating their backs, shiny from sweat after the tense first day of the sports camp.
For many team players, these breaks in the middle of the day.
Players recorded for the summer classes, after a three-hour training, will go back to the dormitories to prepare for the final exams, and the next morning will return to the Wasserman football center for meetings at 6:30.
Shortly before Monday turned on Tuesday, team coach Bruins Jim Mora said: "In the next three days, these guys are waiting for a meat grinder."
The fact that the National Student Sports Association canceled training twice a day, which was invented to reduce the load for players, actually extended their working day - at least until the end of the exams on Friday.
Therefore, the start of the first three trainings of the team of the University of California in Los Angeles was scheduled for 7:15 p.m. to fit in the already tight schedule of players.
The side effect of the lack of two trainings a day was more than a number of days with one training, and Bruins moves the camp for almost a week compared to last year and conducts training during the summer school for the first time in six seasons of Mora in Westwood.
According to the schedule, they will have to hold 18 trainings until August 20, inclusive, before starting official preparations for the first game of the season against the Texas A&M team in September.
Mora said he supported the change of the rules by the National Student Sports Association, despite the fact that it has another point in the tight schedule of players.
"For three or four days, we've given them this tremendous load, it's a serious test," Mora said.
And they just overcame it, they're working, they're wonderful guys.
I think that when we live to Saturday and we have more time, it will be really healthy.
When the camp is over, the University of California in Los Angeles will make the training closed; this is not an easy task, as its fields are in direct sight with the adjacent parking lot and from the nearby Lasquin Center, an expensive hotel that has already been bombed with soccer balls that have overcome the defensive grid behind the gate.
Players from Bruins must occupy the hotel starting this weekend, but Mora admits that when rooms are free during the season, there may be a problem.
"We're going to be guarded," Maura said.
It's a serious problem, and I'm not exaggerating the danger, assuming that someone can rent a room, sit there and record a video.
If you have a video of the training, it's very serious.
But we'll have security there and there'll be security guards in the parking number 8.
We'll do everything we can with what we have.
I won't worry too much about it.
We have a plan.
All victims of the terrorist attack in St. Petersburg discharged from hospitals
All victims during the terrorist attack in the metro of St. Petersburg in April were discharged from hospitals.
This was reported in the press service of Vice-Governor Anna Mityanina.
According to the data at the end of July, three people remained in the hospitals, reports "TV Center."
Recall that the explosion in the metro of St. Petersburg occurred on April 3 of this year.
The bomb blew up the suicide bomber Akbarjon Jalilov.
As a result of the terrorist attack, 15 people were killed, as well as the perpetrator himself.
In the criminal case, 11 people, including the alleged organizer Abror Asimov, were arrested.
Recall that on the eve of Rospotrebnadzor recommended the metro of St. Petersburg to revise the plan of measures to ensure transport security, in particular, increasing the number of metal detectors.
Facebook strengthens checking in the fight against fake news
Facebook will more often send texts suspicious to hoaxes to independent experts and show their findings under the original posts, the world's largest social network, which is trying to fight the so-called fake news, said Thursday.
In a statement on its website, the company said it was beginning to use improved machine learning algorithms to recognize possible hoaxes, send them for verification, and possibly show the results of the fact-checking under the original post.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main ways of spreading so-called fake news, which many believe have had an impact on the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
The issue is also actively debated in Europe after French voters were misled by false reports before the presidential election in May, and in Germany, before the September elections, they announced support for the plan to penalize social media if they did not quickly remove hate posts.
On Thursday, in a separate statement in German, Facebook reported on testing a new fact-checking algorithm that was launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to seeing what messages are disputed by independent inspectors, people want a broader context to make informed judgments about what they read and what they share," wrote Sarah Sue, Facebook news feed manager.
She added that Facebook will continue to test the feature of "linked articles" and work on other changes in the news feed to solve the problem of fake news.
Create a Comic Romance: One Castle in English History
In the recent past, the tiny castle of Scotini was shot in the music video "Squeeze," and in the 70s and 80s served as a haven for Margaret Thatcher.
But 700 years from his cozy place in the Byel Valley Valley in Kent, he watched a turbulent story around him, and now inspired Jamie Rhodes, a Yorker with a doggym and a propensity for historical documents, a comic novel.
"I think it's so beautiful to look at the handwriting of a man who died 300 years ago," he says.
"You feel it so personally when you keep this letter in your hand."
"The Castle in England" covers the Middle Ages to the Edwardian era and tells about the families who lived in Scotchney; each story is illustrated by one of the young British artists - Isaac Lenkevich, Bryoni May Smith, William Axley, Becky Palmer and Isabelle Greenberg.
This is not the first Rhodes book, which is based on archival data: in 2014 he wrote "The Teeth of a Dead Man and Other Stories" - a collection of documents from the British Library; this project suddenly touched it to the bottom of his heart.
"I could touch just the fingerprint on the edge of a letter written in the 1700s by a double agent working on the Jacobites," he says.
"It's his fingerprint."
And the letters always smell of smoke, because in those days a fire was kindled for lighting.
And in 300 years, in the future, you think you're there too.
I love the archives!"
For a man gripped by such a passion for old papers, get support from the National Fund and the English Academy of Sciences and the English Academy of History and live in the castle for four months ("Honestly, I've stayed there a little") seems too good to be true.
Rhodes studied the "new" Victorian castle for all day, walked through the archives and considered numerous treasures of the estate and ancient things - for example, the heads of hyenas on the walls or bottles that lay in the moat of the century.
He walked through the park and the ruins of the old castle, talked to the foresters, gardeners and sometimes with artists who worked on illustrations to his book.
Then at night he "drinked his whisky and sat down to write."
The history of Scotney Castle is not very much studied because the National Foundation gained full access to it only in 2006, when the last heiress, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived there ten years later, the staff was only beginning to deal with the archive, which he describes as "that aristocrats had been dumped in the attic for centuries."
The diaries, letters from the time of the British Empire, maps showing who owned what: "You think that the land disputes are boring," says Rhodes, "but for this birch two families beating.
It's a good thing, guys!"
In some of the collection's stories, the castle becomes the starting point for wider research in English history: for example, in the "Educator," the hero leaves the newly built castle to join the Peasant Revolution of 1381.
"There is information about the revolt that occurred in the castle in 1380, in a book called "Kenta and Sussex's Knight's Families," says Rhodes.
"The peasant revolt began in these places, and I thought that revolt was a good start.
Maybe they were connected?"
Other stories are strongly related to the history of the castle - for example, the "Priest," which tells about the Jesuit priest, whom the Darrel family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or the "Smuggler," about 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrel, who is believed to have staged his own funeral, stuffing the coffin with stones (it was discovered a few years later, when the coffin was dug up).
The Darrels are the father of Rhodes's favorite family of all that Scotneys populated: "The gentlemen seem to have been a perfect scam, always in debt and spent money on what they couldn't afford.
In different generations, Darrel men have solved their debt problems by marrying rich older women - I imagine them as a company of cute guys who know how to care for the heirs of great fortunes.
After finishing the work at the castle, Rhodes is looking for other opportunities to get a unique writing experience.
He lived two weeks in the Finnish wilderness, where he wrote a graphic novel about Elimyanymyaki - a place where at the beginning of the 20th century there was a sanatorium, and then it was overgrown with wood.
But Skotni remains a special place for him.
"I was sad to leave," he says.
"I felt like this: damn it, I have to go back to real life."
Fifteen major banks choose "Russia"
The conflict in the Association of Russian Banks (ARB) is developing: following Sberbank, VTB, VTB-24, Alfa-Bank, Gazprombank, Rosselkhozbank, Binbank and FC Otkritie, seven more credit organizations are going to leave this public organization.
Thus, the share of organizations that have left the ARB will account for at least 80 percent of the market.
But this is not just a way out - all banks that announced the break with the ARB are negotiating with another public organization that unites credit institutions - the Association of Regional Banks "Russia," headed by a well-known politician Anatoly Aksakov, Chairman of the State Duma Committee on the Financial Market, recognized, by the way, at the end of the last session and the most effective head of the Duma Committee and a deputy on the number of drafts prepared.
The beginning of the conflict within the ARB was laid during the discussion in the Federation Council, when the Interregional Banking Council considered new bills, in particular, involving a new classification of banks, depending on the size of the authorized capital.
Then Garegin Tosunyan, the president of the ARB, said that, according to the association, this bill is being adopted in the interests of the largest banks, which are thus trying to limit the capabilities of small and medium-sized banks in the regions, intercepting their clientele.
Among other claims there was criticism of the Central Bank, which, according to Tosunyan, is not always justified to revoke licenses from some banks, which, however, was attacked by the representative of the Central Bank: many heads of fined banks, in particular, Vnesheconombank, were part of the governing bodies of the ARB.
Apparently, this exchange of mutually exclusive opinions in a very sensitive relationship with the main regulator of the banking environment and became a visible reason for the fifteen largest banks, saying that the agreement with the policy of the ARB, began to prepare for accession to the association "Russia," noting that "the effectiveness of the work of the ARB will be nachied at a low level, and constructive dialogue within the banking community is not actually held."
Investors will be better
What's the end of this?
We will answer immediately to the main question that arises at the slightest failure or conflict in the banking sector or next to it: depositors are not in danger, rather, on the contrary, the reliability of the banking system will increase.
Head of "Russia" Anatoly Aksakov, known for its sensitivity in all regards to the interests of banks and their customers, a high-level professional, who is highly valued in the Central Bank: almost all the management of the Central Bank is present at the annual events of the association, and all significant legislative initiatives of the regulator go through expert assessments of the "regionals."
In the personnel and organizational plan, obviously, there are no special upheavals.
Undoubtedly, the ARB gets into a difficult financial and managerial situation after losing such powerful and influential participants with their contributions and lobbying opportunities.
However, in this oldest - established in 1991 - an organization that advocates the interests of the banking community - there is considerable potential to continue to improve banking legislation and the sphere of monetary circulation in general.
It is not to say that the association "Russia" with open arms are ready to accept on any conditions new members, judging by the reaction of its leader, Anatoly Aksakov ("maybe too much"), who on July 21 at a briefing in the press center of the Parliamentary newspaper, said that "literally the next day, representatives of the banks that left the ARB asked me to consider the possibility of increasing the potential of our association "Russia."
Their proposals are to strengthen the voice of bankers in the Association's Council, as well as pay more attention to new banking technologies.
Now the negotiation process is underway, the proposals of both sides are being studied, the agenda of the extraordinary congress of the association, which will be held in Sochi in mid-September within the framework of the international banking forum, is being prepared.
We'll figure it out there.
Also, Anatoly Aksakov, stressing that "the chair does not hold," called possible the new head of the updated association "Russia" Georgy Luntovsky, who leaves in September the post of Deputy Chairman of the Central Bank, highly describing his business and human qualities.
On August 18, Anatoly Aksakov, who is now resting in the Crimea, plans to interrupt his vacation for one day and arrive in Moscow, for an extraordinary meeting of the Association Council "Russia," where it is planned to consider the issue of the agenda of the extraordinary congress of "Russia."
The entrance of cars with a gasoline engine to large cities of Russia will not be limited
Deputy head of the Ministry of transport Nikolay Asaul said that, contrary to media reports, the entry of cars with a gasoline engine in large cities of Russia will not be limited.
This is a more radical form of our concept.
Our concept is that we need to gradually improve the environmental class.
And there the concept immediately switch to zero emissions.
I don't think we're technically ready for that.
The question is, since what year?
This is the same at the level of slogans of the phrase - let's ban.
Where and when?
Tomorrow?
Shall we close the whole city?
"In 20 years - I don't know, maybe this will happen," - quotes "Prime" words of the Minister.
Earlier, the newspaper "Izvestia" reported that by August 17, Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich was instructed to study proposals on possible options for state support for electric transport submitted to the government by the General Director of PJSC KAMAZ Sergey Kogogin.
Among the proposals, according to the newspaper, is the use of cars with ICE in large cities and resorts.
Washington is changing the rules for obtaining a green card.
According to the media, President Donald Trump said that a new US immigration plan will be adopted, according to which the rules for obtaining a green card will change.
The plan envisages a reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for obtaining temporary work visas and restrictions on obtaining family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republican Party and supported by the president.
The bill will be discussed in two chambers of Congress.
This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save taxpayers billions of dollars, and do so by changing the U.S. to give out greencards to citizens of other countries.
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the existing scheme.
The new application process will provide benefits to candidates who speak English, have cash resources that allow them to support themselves, and have the skills that will benefit our economy," Trump said.
The appearance of sex robots is real, and it should bother us.
We did not have time to think that 2017 can no longer get worse, a new report on technological successes in the production of sex robots has been released.
Oh, yeah.
Sex robots are in the spotlight.
The Responsible Robotics Foundation (FRR) recently released a report on the development of sex robots in the next 5-10 years.
According to Noel Sharkey, Honored Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and the co-founder of FRR, we must take their appearance seriously.
Users will be able to choose the color of the robots' eyes, the shape of the nipples and the type of nails.
"People are giggling about this, but firms are already sending them to consumers in large numbers, and soon we will see them much more," Sharkey said.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable brethren in robots with silicone skin, warm to the touch, and with almost human replicas controlled by artificial intelligence.
Users can also "customize" their robots to their liking, choosing everything from the color of the eyes and the shape of the robot's nipples to the shape and color of the nails.
But the fact that many robots have a "personality," compared to which the Stepford Wife would seem very progressive, worries even more.
Modern sex dolls have turned into robots with silicone skin.
For example, RealBotix robot allows users to customize the quality they find attractive in robots - for example, shyness.
There are still sex robots of Roxxxy Gold, developed by "True Companion," which come with an already programmed individuality - for example, "Cold Farrah" gives the impression of shy, and "Wild Wendy" has a "cold" character.
"Roxxxy Gold has a character that fits yours perfectly," reports "True Companion."
So she loves what you love, she doesn't love what you don't like, and so on.
She changes the mood during the day, like a real person!
She may want to sleep or chatter, or she may be "in the mood."
In the appearance of sex robots, a lot of concern - not least because they replace real human relationships - but most of all worries the subordinate image of a woman, the association with rape, which causes the capture of the Cold (read: resisting) Farah.
On the website "True Companion" Roxxxy is compared to a vibrator, only for men.
"If a woman (sic!) Maybe a vibrator, why can't men have a Roxxxy?" - it's on the site.
But these sex robots are not just fetishes or just new sex toys.
Their appearance and increasing complexity points to something darker and deep in our culture, to a departure from the ideal of gender equality in the direction of the desire for sex with submission as an optional supplement.
Most men, of course, will not buy sex robots, and although FRR marks their growing popularity, they remain on the periphery of consumer culture.
But what is conveyed to us from the periphery can be very instructive about the meanings of the era in which we live.
And many people are not bad and not aggressive until the free market will give them the opportunity to do so.
It's not a coincidence - that these complex sex robots came up exactly when women's rights around the world were threatened when the White House had a president who praised women.
The most terrible thing in the television series "The Handmaid's Tale" is not graphic images, twisted bodies and squeezed eyes, namely how realistic this vision seems realistic.
The Republic of Gilead is an exaggeration, but now it does not seem so big.
The goal of the sex robot industry is to achieve such physical similarity to real women (only with proportions of pornstars) that technology allows.
Their creators want them to seem human to the touch to copy the movements of the human body.
But it is their "character" robots do not look like real women.
They can't break up with their partners or leave them.
They have no life or a biography - nothing that could point to independence or something else that could destroy the illusion of total dependence.
These are beautiful slaves.
Or, as they say in 2017, the maids.
A native of Los Angeles, Eugene (the Uma) Jitter, who has played for the national team of Ukraine since 2013, will not help our national team at the European basketball championship, the final part of which will start on August 31.
This was reported in an interview with the BeBasket portal by the general manager of the "blue-yellow" Andrey Lebedev.
We tried to negotiate with Jeter, but unfortunately he won't come for family reasons.
We're going to Eurobasket without a naturalized player because we don't want to take someone we don't know.
"This situation will provide opportunities for the development of our young players," he said.
Let me remind you: with the direct participation of Jeter, the Ukrainian national team took a record sixth place at the EuroBasket 2013 and for the first time got to the World Basketball Championship, where the "yellow-blue" could not overcome the group stage, and the native of the United States scored an average of 15.4 points per game, made 3 rebounds and gave 5 assists.
Jerker has stopped playing for the national team of Ukraine since the resignation from the post of head coach of our national team of American Mike Fratello, who left this position in 2015.
The men's Eurobasket-2017 will be held simultaneously in four countries: Turkey, Romania, Israel and Finland.
The Ukrainian team will hold their matches of the group tournament on the Promised Land.
The wards of Yevgeny Murzin in Group B will have five fights: with Germany (31 August), Italy (2 September), Georgia (3rd), Lithuania (5th) and Israel (6th).
In preparation for the tournament, our men's team held two control matches, in which it lost to the Dutch and Belarusians.
The great feat of Trump?
To portray Meta Romney seems very reasonable.
In the Trump era, the commonplace was the fact that the political controversy that polarized the American electorate on the micro level broke some families.
Between Thanksgiving and Christmas, American newspapers were lined with columns about how to deal with the terrible relatives voting for Trump.
We're all tense so we're gonna burst soon.
Less talk about Trump's ability to connect families.
I'm writing about it because my cousin, the leftist poet from Chicago, who had been on knives with Republicans in her family, came to me in New York this week.
She reminded me that unification in the struggle against a common enemy can have a strong effect.
Under Trump at the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican brother she has been arguing with for decades, suddenly and strangely on the same side.
At dinner, this is undoubtedly good; but I cannot but think that in a broader context it can be quite dangerous.
Trump has breathed forces into the left flank, but the deforming effect of his rule can shift us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and "normalization," we mean the unlikely possibility that one day we will stop amaze his antics.
There is, however, an even more dubious scenario in which Trump "normalizes" the most right-wing Republicans, which, against the background of his standards, will suddenly seem like a model of common sense.
I caught myself on the fact that I miss the old-fashioned madness of Mitt Romney today - with a dog on the roof of the car and a 14 percent income tax (but we at least knew what his tax return looks like) - compared to both Trump and the other seems very small evil.
When Trump leaves, it will be enough for the next Republican candidate to be in his mind to see a huge step forward.
When my cousin went to the center, we went with the kids to a carousel in Central Park - the largest carousel in the New York City Department's farm and the best way in the city to spend $3 if you don't need caffeine.
The horses are formidable and huge, the pictures of fiberglass on the central drum - grimace clowns and animals, who, bent, look at their backs - extremely sinteres, and the ringing music, oddly enough, delights.
So many of the known things in this city are disappointing: the views from the skyscrapers are obsolete, the silhouettes of buildings are too crowded to cause awe, and the reality of the city does not have time for the dream.
Thirty-five years have passed, and I'm still going through the day I learned that the Suiss Cottage area is not a Swiss chalet (the "Ye Olde Swiss Cottage" pub is not counted), but a large circular crossroads in North London.
And a carousel in Central Park is still an unusual, magical place in which a child of two, a child of eleven and two women in forty can have a great time.
If I could give a karusal score, I'd bet five, but fortunately, no one asked me to do that.
And in the department store this week, I was asked before I was checked with a card on the terminal, to evaluate your "experience" of purchases on a scale from one to five stars.
In the coffee shop on the corner of my street, the same plus the option to accompany the estimate with tips of 15 percent - this is for the order at the counter.
As a result, not only the interaction neutral in the idea slows down, but also it is necessary to bring a personal attitude to a situation that does not involve him.
A poor saleswoman in the department store was smiling while I was tired of valuing my five-star credit card experience.
Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital due to chest pain
Pistorius leaves the prison because of a visit to the doctor for the second time.
Last year, he was transferred to a hospital to treat cuts on his wrists, which, according to the prison administration, he received as a result of a fall in a cell.
Pistorius was convicted of premeditated murder after the prosecutor's office appeal against the initial sentence for manslaughter.
He killed Stenkem in the early morning of Valentine's Day in 2013, shooting her several times through the bathroom door in his Pretoria house.
Pistorius said that he took his girlfriend for a night thief hiding in his toilet.
The prosecutor's office announced its intention to file another protest, this time against Pretorius' six-year term, which she said was too soft.
The Attorney General's Office has said it will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal will be heard this year.
The term of Pretorius may increase by 15 years if the prosecutor's office succeeds.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
Suspect in the beating of the journalist NTV elected a subscription to leave
Metropolitan law enforcement officers chose a measure of restraint in the form of a subscription for a non-departure for a man who attacked the journalist of the NTV channel Nikita Razvozzhaev during a live broadcast from Gorky Park on August 2.
This is reported by TASS with reference to the official representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation Irina Volk.
"As part of the investigation of the criminal case initiated under article. 116 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation ("Beatings") against a 32-year-old man who hit the face of a correspondent of one of the TV channels in the Central Park of Culture and Recreation named after Gorky, the suspect was elected a measure of restraint in the form of a subscription for departure and proper behavior.
The representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs added that an administrative protocol for disobedience to the police was drawn up against the suspect.
On Wednesday, August 2, during the live broadcast, a drunken man approached the correspondent and hit the face.
As it turned out later, the bully has nothing to do with the VDV.
According to Razvozhaev himself, the paratroopers, on the contrary, tried to detain the Muscovite.
Two Bulgarians detained in Greece for illegal tent parking
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, two Bulgarian citizens were detained in Greece for an illegal tented parking lot.
On the morning of August 1, a group of people who put tents in the wrong place, including two Bulgarian citizens, was detained in Sithonia.
They were released the same day, while the investigation is still being conducted.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the TV channel "Bi-Ti-Vi" that the citizens of Bulgaria were then released.
The Greek authorities have tightened control over the free camping and have already imposed serious fines on anyone caught while parking in a place not intended for this place.
Inspections will be carried out throughout the season.
According to the ministry, the court may impose a fine.
The Russian Foreign Ministry accused the US Vice-President of the rhetoric of the "cold war"
The statements made during the European tour of US Vice-President Michael Pence, criticized the Russian Foreign Ministry.
"It is with regret that Washington is increasingly rolling back to the primitive ideological stamps of the Cold War, which are completely detached from reality," the Russian foreign ministry said in a statement.
So the Foreign Ministry reacted to Pence's words about the "Russian threat" and attempts to forcible reshuffle the borders he said in Podgorica.
The Russian Foreign Ministry pointed to the destructiveness of the choice "either with the West, or with Russia" and the non-obviousness of the thesis about the supposedly alternative entry of the whole of South-Eastern Europe into NATO.
Russian diplomats also recalled that it was the United States that violated international law by using force to dismiss Kosovo from Serbia and thus created another hotbed of tension.
"We urge our American colleagues to stop the insulting of Russia and its foreign policy, which is invariably based on respect for partners and readiness for joint constructive work, on mutual consideration of interests," the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
The paramedic was injured in an accident with an ambulance in the suburbs
The accident occurred in the suburbs of Stupino, as a result of the collision of a foreign car with the ambulance carriage suffered a paramedic.
Today, at about 08:10 GMT, there was a collision of a Mitsubishi car with an ambulance in the city of Stupino, Moscow region.
"As a result of the collision, the ambulance turned over," - said TASS in the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in the Moscow region.
Law enforcement officers are working at the scene of the accident, the circumstances of the incident are clarified.
In the Odessa region, a woman threw her newborn son at the construction site, wrapped in a cellophane package.
On the evening of August 3, the Razdorn police department received a message from a local resident that he had found a package of a baby in an unfinished private house.
"At the scene went to the police and doctors who promptly delivered the child to a medical institution," - reported in the Odessa head of the National police.
Doctors determined that the boy was born a few hours before his discovery, as evidenced by the presence of the umbilical cord.
In the course of the priority operational and investigative measures, the identity of the woman was established - a 36-year-old local resident.
It is also found that the woman has three more young children.
As noted in the chapter, in the field of view of law enforcement officers, the family had not previously been and was not on special records.
At present, the police establish the circumstances and reasons that forced the woman to do so, after which a procedural decision will be made.
The baby is now under the supervision of doctors.
As previously reported, in Nikolaev, a 21-year-old woman threw her premature baby in a garbage bin.
Gregory Leps: "I'm rushing into battle, though 55 is not 30"
One of the most successful artists of the Russian stage Grigory Leps on Sunday will celebrate its 55th anniversary.
Before the celebration, the singer spoke with the columnist "Izvestia."
I remember how your "half" was noted.
A special tent in Luzhniki, Gloria Gaynor sang for the birthday boy, a powerful salute over the Moscow river.
You must have figured it out when you wanted to spend your next five-year plan.
Are the plans come true?
When it comes to the profession, it was a good time.
I worked a lot, I went through the whole country three times, gave 120-130 concerts a year.
We have released two good albums.
Of course, I'm not the one that, say, 20 years ago.
The biological clock is not fooled.
Singing the way I sang at my 30s is getting harder.
However, I'm fighting, I don't want to stop.
And I'm with new people, I think I'm going to a different level.
With them, you and the new album are recording, the first in three years.
Yes, work on it is now underway.
In fact, we've already recorded everything in my studio and now we'll send it to Los Angeles.
It's called "What are you so serious?" a song of the same name, which was written together with Timati.
She's not quite ready yet, so we haven't done it anywhere yet.
We'll do it later, when we'll shoot the clip for it.
And the album will be presented in November - for a series of my anniversary concerts in the Moscow "Crocus City Hall."
Your new album was handed a hand by the cool American drummer Chris Coleman.
Do you seem to want to attract him to your touring band?
In my opinion, Coleman is one of the most outstanding drummers in the world today.
He came to my studio, recorded his parties.
I offered him to join my band, and Jeremy Coulson (a well-known drummer involved in different projects. - "Izvestia") offered.
But for long work in Russia, they put forward, to put, excessive conditions.
It was about fees from 35,000 euros. up to 45 thousand euros. in a month.
Then I thought that in the post-Soviet space I would find worthy musicians.
And found a great drummer Max Malyshev.
It is better to feed your own (smiling).
Sometimes I want to jeopard one of them, not for what.
For example, guitarist Fedor Dosumov is highly quoted internationally.
Western music magazines are written about him, he is invited to various guitar festivals.
Steve Wai, after listening to his game, said that "a new generation of guitarists, with other performing techniques, has come."
Your album boils down in Los Angeles, American musicians are collaborating with you, but you still can't come to the United States?
Are you trying to lift this ban?
I'm not doing anything right now.
There are a number of lawyers who are dealing with this issue.
As a musician, I am truly sorry that I can't get to America.
I've said I'm studying there many times.
The more you communicate with real professionals, the more useful it is.
We're not dumb, but we don't have that kind of experience, schools.
Our performers of popular music for 70 years were not the tasks that American musicians have always solved.
They wanted the highest quality sound.
I'm trying to follow the same principles.
Now for some reason, the UK has denied me entry for ten years.
But every year I will still apply for a visa to the British Embassy so that I can again be allowed to go there and most importantly - to work there.
The rest of Europe is sympathetic to me.
And in August, you plan a concert in Monaco, not a custom, but a billboard, right?
Yes, there is a good "Sporting" hall in Monte Carlo, I've been there once.
Now invited again, and, as far as I know, all the tickets to the concert have already sold out.
At the "Randeva Lima Vaikule," which will begin on July 20 in Jurmala, you will go?
She invited me, and I responded.
Lyme is a wonderful singer and a gorgeous woman who knows how to present herself and a beautiful vocal, and even a whisper.
After the tour and jubilee concerts, as far as I know, you once again want to turn to the work of Vladimir Vysotsky.
Two albums with his songs you already have in the discography.
When will the third come out?
Probably next year.
But it will be completely differently done.
I want to record about 80-90 songs of Vysotsky in about the same serve as he did.
Only voice and guitar.
No other arrangement.
I will be accompanied by our famous musician Timur Vedernikov.
I will try to attract Alexander Rosenbaum to participate in the album.
I talked to him about this, we have a good relationship, but he's a person busy, so we'll see how it works.
You and the songs of Boris Grebenshchikov gradually introduced into your repertoire.
Why don't you make an album of his stuff?
Boris Borisovich is a wonderful man and a great musician.
I crossed paths with him several times and asked: can I sing this or that song of his song?
He said, "Grigory, I am writing songs to make them performed."
Please try it, sing.
It's probably interesting to record this album.
So far, I do not have such a task, but in the future, in a year or two, if Boris Borisovich does not object, I may make such a project.
If you don't focus entirely on the affairs of your production center.
I believe that until you have realized his potential, have not signed contracts with all the artists that you are interested in?
There are a number of performers that I would dream of having under my wing, but they are independent, well-established people.
You mean Sergey Lazarev?
Seryozha is a brilliant singer, I invited him.
I can disagree with his repertoire, but he is a professional and he has his own development strategy.
And in my center now there is Alexander Panayotov, whom I led in the "Voice."
We signed a contract and we are working.
In our pop music, such singers are rare.
It will be a pity if he does not reach the heights they deserve.
I'm trying to pick him up the repertoire, I'm making clips.
I hope for a good result.
I'm also trying to promote other artists of my center: I buy them songs, we pay poets, sometimes their tracks get into the rotations of TV and radio channels.
If they do not reach great heights, I will still bring our cooperation to a logical conclusion.
At the release, they will receive a recorded album, several clips.
And then, if they want, they can go their own way, and I will not insist that they return the money invested in them.
Although I'd be pleased if one of them succeeded in commercial success and paid me the interest we negotiated in the contract.
But if that doesn't happen, I'm not going to block the oxygen to anyone.
Let everyone work, make their way, prove how I once proved.
If you are offered a tour of Ukraine tomorrow and guarantee entry to the country, will you go?
I'm still invited there.
This is mainly closed activities.
As for the big tour...
I am a man of my country, a Russian, by my own conviction, flew to Syria on the same plane that crashed.
If tomorrow they say that you need to fly to some other point in the interests of the state, I will fly.
And I don't care what bloggers and other critics will think of me.
I am sincerely sorry that this situation has been with Ukraine.
I think we are one people and we should be together.
I'm sorry that this is unlikely to work, at least soon.
And earlier I gave 40-50 concerts in Ukraine in a year.
Met it like nowhere else.
Very grateful audience.
And he collaborated with several Ukrainian artists: Ani Lorak, Sveta Loboda, Artem Loik...
In Ukraine, a lot of gifted people, and it is a pity that now they can not fully spill out their talent on a wide Russian audience.
Music should unite and entertain people.
I would be happy to invite some cool Ukrainian performer to Russia, for example Slava Vakarchuk, and made a joint concert with him.
But I think that's unlikely at the moment...
Andrey Okhlopkov was transferred from the cosmodrome
As it became known "Kommersant," the technical director of the cosmodrome Vostochny Andrey Okhlopkov began to work in the State Space Research and Production Center (KHrunichev).
Previously, he was de facto engaged in the construction of the Vostochny cosmodrome, but due to disagreements with the leadership of the Ground and Space Infrastructure Operation Center (CENKI) was transferred to the enterprise in Moscow Fili, where he will coordinate the production.
Mr. Okhlopkov will not have a changer: the post of technical director, most likely, will be abolished, and the functionality is scattered through the units of the CENCI.
That the technical director of the Eastern and Deputy General Director of CENCI for technological development Andrey Okhlopkov moved to work in the Khrunichev SCOPC, "Kommersant" told top managers of several enterprises of the space industry, as well as an employee of the government apparatus.
"He has been working in a new post for several weeks," - said the interlocutors of "Kommersant" in the industry.
It was not possible to get an operational comment from CENKI on Thursday, and Mr. Okhlopkov himself was unavailable for comments.
However, the information "Kommersant" was officially confirmed in the SCOPC.
He decided to move to the post of director for the coordination of production, - said at the enterprise. - Andrey Okhlopkov, the task set for him to provide the launch minimum for the first launch at the Vostochny cosmodrome has fully fulfilled.
Mr. Okhlopkov moved to work in CENKI in 2013, having the shoulders of service in the space forces, in particular at Baikonur, and in Plesetsk - at the "northern" cosmodrome held the post of first deputy commander in the rank of colonel.
In 2009, Andrey Okhlopkov became a defendant in the criminal case.
The investigation accused him of bribery: allegedly, from his filing, regional merchants received for kickbacks of state orders, but did not fulfill the obligations taken to clean the separated parts of launch vehicles in the Arkhangelsk region and the Republic of Komi.
In 2012, the jury found him not guilty.
The responsibilities for technological development laid on it in CENKI were extended to different projects, but the main of them was the construction of the cosmodrome in the Far East.
The then head of the Federal Space Agency Oleg Ostapenko in an interview with Kommersant directly said that the situation in the East "was critical in October 2013."
The fact is that a strategic mistake was made during the planning: the completion of the construction and the first launch of the Soyuz-2.1 carrier rocket were planned for the same time - the end of 2015.
To carry out the launch before the end of the year, they decided to complete the construction one-and-a-half earlier and the deadlines were postponed from December to July 2015.
To speed up the process had to go on a trick: CENKI specialists began to conduct parallel installation of technological equipment on unfinished facilities.
The main supporter of this idea was Andrei Okhlopkov.
Despite the existing risks and the transfer that occurred (instead of December 2015, the Soyuz flew only on April 28, 2016), this idea justified itself, says the source of "Kommersant" at the spaceport: "Otherwise we would not have carried out a single launch from the Eastern, but would be engaged in construction."
Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, who oversees the creation of the cosmodrome, jokingly called Andrei Okhlopkov his "space Sussanin," but he almost always asked for information about the construction.
I remember Mr. Okhlopkov and straightforward: for example, in an interview with Kommersant, he proposed to deprive the Federal Agency for Special Construction (Spetsstroy) the status of the only performer in the Eastern and directly work with subcontractors: "Why should we put all the eggs in one basket of Spetsstroy?"
This idea found support in the government.
Since 2017, CENKI has assumed the duties of the general contractor to complete the construction and installation work at the start-up complex to the planned fourth quarter.
According to Kommersant, the reason for the transition of Mr. Okhlopkov to the new place of work was disagreements with the leadership of CENKI on the ways to complete the construction of structures and complexes of the cosmodrome, as well as the methods of working with subcontractors.
"It was decided that this would be better for everyone," says one of the top managers involved in the construction of the East.
An employee of the government apparatus, in turn, calls the decision strange: "He was one of the best specialists, it will be difficult to find an equivalent replacement."
According to Kommersant, this will not be required: the position of the technical director of the cosmodrome will be abolished, and its functions will be scattered by CENKI units.
In music schools there will be a program of training in two specialties
In the future, pupils of children's music schools will be able to receive two specialties at the same time.
According to the Deputy Director of the Department of Science and Education of the Ministry of Culture Svyatoslav Golubenko, for this you can reread the students re-listed disciplines, and the issue with the payment of other classes in the second specialty is solved with the help of special grants, reports RIA Novosti.
"The Ministry of Culture has taken this issue to control, and together with the expert community we will develop a mechanism that will allow the two specialties to be mastered, but at the same time will not contradict the current legislation in the field of education," - said Golubenko.
Last Friday, during the "Nedetsky conversation" of Vladimir Putin with the pupils of the Sirius children's center, Maria Andreeva's student said that she was forced to pay for repetitive items in the second specialty at the Moscow Conservatory.
The girl said that she is studying in the class of violin and piano and has awards of competitions in both directions.
The head of state recognized her issue as very relevant and promised to help.
In Mexico detained climbed on the wall in the skyscraper 17-year-old Russian
In Mexico detained 17-year-old Russian Kirill N., who climbed the wall on the roof of a high-rise building, reports the portal El Universal.
The incident occurred in the capital of Mexico.
The young man, with the help of two unknown men, climbed through a three-meter fence to the territory of the Nestle office buildings complex and independently climbed one of its towers.
At the same time, he did not use any special equipment, insurance and ropes.
Detained the young man on the roof.
Employees of the Ministry of Public Security lowered him to the ground by helicopter.
He was then sent to the National Institute of Migration.
It is found out whether the young man is legally in the country.
Meanwhile, the video with a young man climbing the high-rise became popular on the Internet.
Users called the young man a "spider man."
According to the media, such experiments are a hobby for him.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate can help ease the VZK.
Red meat and chocolate are considered a nightmare for your digestive tract.
But recent research suggests the opposite: a diet rich in meat proteins and dairy products can help alleviate symptoms in those who suffer from inflammatory bowel disease.
This incurable disease, which affects about 1.3 million people in the U.S. and 300,000 in the UK, leads to colic and bloating, chronic or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Usually, to mitigate symptoms, patients are advised to avoid meat and dairy products, but researchers at the University of Washington found that the main amino acid of the protein tryptophan contributes to the production of immune cells that increase the tolerance of the intestine.
Lead researcher Dr. Marco Colonna explained that the immune cells in the intestine are ensuring that harmful microbes coming from food do not penetrate the body.
Cells that can trigger the inflammatory process are balanced by cells that increase tolerance, protecting the body and not harming sensitive tissues.
If the balance is too severely disturbed towards inflammation, it can lead to inflammatory bowel diseases.
Experiments have shown that mice that have a certain bacterium in the intestine, there are cells that increase tolerance.
And this bacteria need tryptophan - one of the building elements of protein - to trigger the appearance of these cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have established a link between one species of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is part of the normal gut microbiome and the development of a population of cells that increase tolerance.
The more tryptophanes were kept in the diet of mice, the more these immune cells they had."
He suggested that the same thing would work for humans: the combination of L. reuteri and a trythophane-rich diet may contribute to a more tolerant and less anti-inflammable environment in the intestine.
Postdoc, Dr. Louise Cervantes-Barangavas, studying the variety of immune cells increasing tolerant, found that one group of experimental mice had these cells, and the other group that belonged to the same line but was kept separately.
She suggested that the difference may be caused by the gut microbiomes of mice - communities of bacteria, viruses and fungi that usually live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The DNA of the mice's intestinal cells were sequenced and six species of bacteria present in mice with immune cells but missing from mice without them were found.
Mice grown in a sterile environment that did not have a good microbiome and did not develop this type of immune cells, received L. reuteri, and they had immune cells.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, the researchers grew L. reuteri in a liquid environment and then carried small portions of fluid - without bacteria - to underdeveloped immune cells isolated from mice.
Immune cells have become cells that increase tolerance.
When the active component was separated from the liquid, it turned out to be a by-product of tryptophan processing, known as indole-3-lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the number of tryptopphan in the food of mice, the number of these cells increased by about 50 percent, but when tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells also fell twice.
Dr. Cervantes-Barang explains that humans have the same tolerance-enhancing cells as mice, and most of us have L. reuteri in their gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether the by-products of tryptopphone from L. reuteri contribute to the development of cells in humans in the same way as in mice, but in people suffering from inflammatory bowel diseases, defects in the genes associated with tryptophan have been found.
She says: "Perhaps the development of these cells should be strengthened, because these cells depend on the inflammatory processes on the inner surface of the intestines.
High levels of tryptopphan in the presence of L. reuteri can potentially lead to the expansion of their populations."
According to Jose Mourinho, "Manchester United" hired Genius in the person of Nemanja Matic
"Manchester United hired Nemanja Matic, according to Jose Mourinho after the midfielder debuted in the match against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.
The player, acquired for 40 million pounds from Chelsea, began with a 2-1 win in Dublin in the last pre-season match of the United before the UEFA Super Cup match against Real Madrid on Thursday and impressed as a midfielder, while players like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira broke out when they were in the midfielder.
However, since Matic did not take part in the pre-season tour of Chelsea in Asia, he seriously lacked preparation for the game, and he survived only 45 minutes, which, according to Mourinho, requires revision before the start of the Premier League season.
"It takes time, but his experience, his mind, the genius is in the way he thinks - he thinks in football," said Mourinho.
We will help him prepare sooner than late.
Just like Matic, his newmates Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku began the game at the stadium of Aviv, when Mourinho began to form his main line-up by the beginning of the next season.
The newspaper reported this week that Mourinho wanted to hire three more players, but stressed that the club had already achieved fantastic results by hiring three of the four players he wanted to hire first.
"I am grateful to the club for having produced three of the four," he added.
I'll be even more happy if they get me four out of four, but they've already tried very hard for me.
Former leaders of the Social Democrats of Lithuania persuade them to remain in the ruling coalition
Former presidents of the Lithuanian Social Democratic Party, former Prime Minister Algirdas Butkevicius and Gedimias Kirkilas, as well as the former Sejm Speaker from the Social Democrats Cheslovas Yerschens appealed to party members to remain in the ruling coalition.
As reported by the "Parliament newspaper," due to frictions with partners - the Union of peasants and "green" - in the Social Democratic Party initiated a discussion whether to remain in the ruling coalition.
And here are three senior experienced comrades who sent an open letter to the party members, in which, in particular, it is said: "It is clear the disappointment of the party's comrades in the results of the elections, but the coalition with the "peasants" created for us not very easy, but still the conditions for the further implementation of the goals of social justice, which, on our initiative, are provided for in the government's program, and for the political domination of the left-wing parties."
According to the former leaders of the party, the discussion so far "has an expression of opinion based on emotions without specific arguments."
The authors of the letter fear that their party may lead Lithuania to political, economic and social instability.
Disabled Anton Mamaev was fined
The Moscow City Court commuted the punishment of the wheelchairman Anton Mamaev from four and a half years in prison to a fine of 200 thousand. The rub.
Earlier, by the decision of the Timiryazev court, the convicted person was released from the pre-trial detention center.
At the same time, the Moscow City Court confirmed that the accused is a criminal, since he organized a robbery and kidnapping of a motorcoal from a former special forces fighter.
The Moscow City Court by its decision commuted the punishment of Anton Mamaev to 200 thousand. The rub. The fine.
"Mamaev is the organizer of the robbery, which also forms the composition of the crime, and, accordingly, such a person should be brought to criminal responsibility," - said the press Secretary of the Moscow City Court Ulyana Solopova.
In this case, the court took into account the state of health of Mamaev, the factual circumstances of the case, the absence of aggravating circumstances.
In addition, the court applied st. 64 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, according to which it is possible to impose punishment below the lower limit.
As for the assistant to Mamaev Vasily Serozhtanov, the court did not establish the circumstances that would be the basis for changing the category of gravity and changing the sentence.
Anton Mamaev himself said that he remained dissatisfied with the decision of the Moscow City Court.
I'm disappointed with the court's decision.
The only legal solution would be an excuse, intends to continue to fight for justice.
His lawyer Andrei Orlov did not rule out the appeal of the verdict in the cassation instance of the Moscow City Court and the Supreme Court.
"We will use all the levers up to the European Court of Human Rights," he told RIA Novosti.
Recall that 28-year-old Muscovite Anton Mamaev, suffering from spinal muscular atrophy, became a defendant in a criminal case last fall.
The disabled person claims that he bought a motor scooter from acquaintances for 160 thousand. rub. to sell.
However, the owners of the scooter, among them a former special forces fighter, said that the disabled person and his assistant Vasily Sereshtanov took away their property, threatening to use violence.
On June 30, the Timiryazevsky District Court of Moscow sentenced Vasily Sereshtanov to three years of colony, and Anton Mamaev to four and a half years in prison with serving a sentence in a general regime colony (according to the hour. 2 st. 162 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation).
After the immobilized disabled person was placed in the pre-trial detention center, the Public Chamber, the Prosecutor General's Office, the Commissioner for Human Rights under the President Tatiana Moskalkova joined the case.
As a result, in mid-July Anton Mamaev was released from the pre-trial detention center by the decision of the same Timiryazev court.
The defense, in turn, appealed the decision of the first instance in the Moscow City Court.
The ONF will prepare a report on the environment
The final "actup forum" of the All-Russian People's Front (ONF) in 2017 will be devoted to environmental issues, a source in the ONF told Izvestia and confirmed the head of the executive committee of the movement Alexei Anisimov.
According to him, following the results of the forum, the "front guards" plan to prepare a report to the President on the problems of domestic ecology, as well as to propose a strategy for their solution.
The interlocutors of "Izvestia" in the ONF note that the report to the head of state will contain "deep analytics" on the situation in all federal districts of the country.
According to Izvestia, the final forum of the ONF will be held in the autumn.
The exact date of its implementation has not yet been determined - as a rule, it is adjusted to the schedule of the president, who is the leader of the movement and is traditionally present at the key events of the ONF.
The front held several interregional environmental conferences, one in two federal districts - in Rostov-on-Don, Kaliningrad and Kirov.
The final conference will be in the capital of the Republic of Buryatia Ulan-Ude.
On the basis of the proposals that were expressed and will be expressed at these events, we will form systemic proposals for solving environmental problems, the interlocutor told Izvestia.
Olga Timofeeva, co-chair of the Central headquarters of the movement, who heads the State Duma Committee on Ecology and Environmental Protection, said that the "front guards" will report to the head of state on the work carried out within the framework of the Year of Ecology in Russia.
The final environmental forum and the "Forum of Action" of the ONF are likely to be combined.
Over the year, we overgrown a powerful team of experts in the field of environmental problems, saw gaps in the legislation, stopped dozens of violations of the law.
All this will be included in the report that we are preparing for the President as the leader of our movement.
In addition to this document, the "front guards" will report on the work on priority projects of the ONF, - told "Izvestia" Olga Timofeeva.
According to her, the forum will be invited to the special representative of the head of state on environmental activities, ecology and transport Sergey Ivanov.
Previously, he had already participated in the work of the ONF Media Forum, which was held in St. Petersburg in April.
In a few months, the Year of Ecology will go down in history, and the most important thing to do today is to launch environmental mechanisms so that they work for years to.
So that these issues do not fall out of the agenda, - added Olga Timofeeva.
Head of the Regional Policy Laboratory of the Expert Institute for Social Research (ESIS) Andrey Kolyadin noted: raising environmental issues, ONF acts in line with the presidential agenda.
Many things they as experts proposed in various forums, and these initiatives received the support of the president, - said "Izvestia" Andrey Kolyadin.
He stressed that to date, it is impossible to exclude the economic potential of the environmental agenda, which can give regions an additional impetus for development.
In the future, with the help of the ONF, the regions will be able to lobby not only the solution of their environmental problems, but also the development of ecotourism, the expert added.
The relevance of environmental issues was demonstrated by the "direct line" with Vladimir Putin in June.
In particular, the president was asked questions about the garbage dump in Balashikha (already closed) and about coal dust in the port of Nakhodka (already developed a bill to ban the open transshipment of coal in settlements, one of the authors - Olga Timofeeva).
Experts in the field of ecology believe that the legal basis for solving environmental problems in Russia as a whole has been created, the issue is further law enforcement practice, as well as in the position of civil society.
We need a clear implementation of the decisions taken by the state, - says the head of the charitable foundation "Ecology for all" Leonid Bochin.
Sergey Tsyplenkov, a member of the HRC, the head of the non-governmental organization "Greenpeace of Russia" in a conversation with Izvestia stressed that a responsible approach of society and business is necessary for the successful solution of environmental problems, there is little legislative effort.
As soon as society and business realize that the solution of environmental problems is a much more profitable step in the strategic perspective, the situation will change, - said Sergey Tsyplenkov.
The expert stressed that it is necessary to reverse the trend that violation of environmental legislation is an economically beneficial solution for business.
A British inventor implanted a microchip to get into the house and a car on a swing of his hand
The British inventor became the first person in the country to install a microchip so that he could open the door of his house, enter the office and even start a car with a simple swing of his hand.
Thirty-seven-year-old Stephen Northam implanted a tiny chip between his thumb and index fingers and is now through his firm, BioTech offers this service to firms and individuals who want to simplify their lives through technology.
He teamed up with Dr. Jeff Watson, an anesthesiologist-consultant from the Royal in Winchester, making sure that the procedure is carried out in accordance with medical standards.
The technology is similar to the microchip that drive cats and dogs, and the procedure takes only 30 seconds.
Northam also replaces house and car locks with chip-compatible at 300 pounds for one lock.
The married father of one child has already installed the technology in his home and in his car, which starts when his arm is on the steering wheel.
The requisition for the White House cost taxpayers thousands of dollars
According to the records of the armed forces provided to the magazine, the White House's decision last month to bring a Marine Helicopter to the South Lawn to an event dedicated to American industrial production cost taxpayers as much as 240,000.
The white and green Sikorsky VH-3D, known as the Marine One, when the president is on board, became the centerpiece of the July 17 event at the White House, which showcased American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and top White House officials surveyed technology from all fifty states.
The helicopter, produced in Connecticut, was exhibited near a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi.
According to the records of the First Marine Helicopter Squadron (HMX-1), the Helicopter Department responsible for the management of the helicopter, the White House Military Department ordered the presence of a helicopter in a private order, or FRAGO, just 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn on the occasion of a "unusual event."
"I just wanted you to make sure that you know, because it's an unusual much-reaching event in the press," - wrote the commander of HMX-1 in an email to his boss, the first deputy chief of aviation of the Marine Corps, on the eve of the event.
The letter indicated that the helicopter will arrive on the South Lawn at about 7 a.m. on July 17 to attend an event scheduled for 3 p.m. and will remain there before the lawn is vacated between 6 and 9 p.m. on the same day.
The letter adds that if the departure from the White House is delayed, a second crew will be required to fly back in accordance with restrictions on working hours.
The first crew accompanied the helicopter during the event, and the unit's security guards remained near the aircraft while it was on the ground.
From the records received by the magazine TIME, it was unclear whether the second crew was required.
Hetcha's law prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
According to the records, HMX-1 clarified whether the event is inconsistent with this decree.
"We asked, among other things, whether this violation of Hatch's law, and we were told that no, "the commander wrote.
"It seems that you have nowhere to go," the deputy chief replied.
The event "Made in America" was declared the White House as an official event, and Hatch's law did not apply to it.
But even official events have political notes.
During the event, the president made efforts to advance the health care reform that was at the time in the development of the Senate and praised attempts to regulate government regulations.
The use of aircraft, known as the Marine One and Air Force One for political purposes, is unlikely to be a new phenomenon.
Presidents are required to use them for travel.
But to ask them for the only advantage of photo opportunity is unusual.
Trump was already the subject of discussion in February, when the presidential plane drove in the background during his first election rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account was flooded with reports of complaints about the use of the presidential aircraft by his predecessor.
The White House is thrilled with the show "Made in America," which featured products from 50 states made by American workers from American materials," White House deputy spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said.
HMX-1 crews often perform training flights around the Washington agglomeration and on the South Lawn to train the United States president's transportation to the White House to an inch.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, the HMX-1 conducted 58 training landings at the White House.
According to one of the officials, the flight made for the event "Made in America" was counted to the crew at the expense of the necessary training flights in a month.
The helicopters of the unit on that day also flew 11 additional hours as part of the "Nen-presidential tasks" support.
According to the White House, the taxpayers were not charged for any of the other exhibits presented at the event.
A representative of the company said that the company did not participate in the organization of the demonstration of the helicopter in the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not keep the budget on presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact amount spent on the event.
But, according to the Ministry of Defense's 2017 fiscal year, the Department of Defense's reimbursement rate for VH-3D is $23,380 per hour.
The records of the unit recorded that the flight time in the air was 30 minutes in each direction from its airfield based on the marine aviation base of the Kuantico Marines in Virginia.
The White House says the real cost of using a helicopter is much lower than that rate.
Calculating the cost for taxpayers, based on an approximate rate of reimbursement, is completely wrong, "says Walters.
These exemplary rates include personnel, maintenance and many other irreversible costs that are included in annual appropriations.
According to a study conducted in 2015 by the RAND Corporation, reimbursement rates do not include the cost of personnel, but, indeed, take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance and the costs indicated in the contract.
At the time, former White House spokesman Sean Spicer spoke in defense of the use of the helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to show things done in America this week," Spicer said.
And I know that the company and Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they are contributing to national security, and that there are hundreds, if not thousands, of the people whose workplace depends on it.
And I think, like most Americans, that we are all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment, which has worked tirelessly for so many Americans.
Therefore, of course, it is quite appropriate to pay attention to this.
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter, inspecting the South Lawn during the event, but he definitely sat on the driver's seat in a fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump appealed to representatives of the company, joking with the press on the company's own fleet of products.
"I know "Sikorsky," the president said. I have three of them.
Moscow will allocate grants for resuscitation departments of city hospitals
Every year, the grants "Saving Life" will be allocated to intensive care units and intensive care units of the capital's medical clinic.
The funds will be used to encourage doctors and nurses.
Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin visited the Yudin City Clinical Hospital.
During the examination of the clinic, he handed a letter of gratitude to the trauma doctor orthopedicologist Victor Protsko, under the guidance of which a complex operation was carried out to reconstruct the teenager's foot.
Sergey Sobyanin also spoke about the decision to annually allocate grants to resuscitations and intensive care departments of urban clinics.
The funds will be used to encourage doctors and nurses.
According to the mayor of the capital, the clinical hospital named after Yudin to date is one of the largest in Moscow.
In recent years, the clinic has received a new modern equipment that allows its doctors to carry out unique operations.
The clinic was opened in 1961 on the basis of the Kolomna rural hospital.
Currently, the medical department is designed to receive more than a thousand patients.
In addition to resuscitation and hospitals, there are day rooms here.
The staff of the hospital has 2,800 employees.
The total area, occupying the medical clinic, is 23.7 hectares.
In February of this year, the medical institution became a participant in a pilot project for the organization of short-term stay hospitals (SKP).
They are designed to carry out relatively small operations.
In the process of surgical interventions, advanced medical equipment is used, which allows to significantly reduce the rehabilitation time of patients.
After the operation in the hospital, they spend only a few hours.
Only in the first half of this year, 36 thousand patients were provided in the Dudin clinical hospital.
Medical staff of the clinic performed 15,800 operations of varying degrees of complexity.
NBU reported the absence of buyers of the Ukrainian "daughter" of Sberbank
The National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) reported the absence of applications for the purchase of the Ukrainian "daughter" of Sberbank.
About it on Friday, August 4, reports TASS with reference to the representative of the press service of the NBU.
The NBU confirms that on August 3, 2017, the package of documents from the citizen of Belarus and Cyprus Victor Prokopney to coordinate the indirect (through Paritybank) acquisition of 100 percent of Sberbank's shares.
"Documents from other potential investors for the purchase of Sberbank's shares in the NBU have not been received," - stated in the message.
On August 3, Belarusian businessman Viktor Prokopenya withdrew the application for the purchase of a subsidiary of Sberbank.
On July 28, it became known that the National Bank of Ukraine refused Russian businessmen Said Gutseriev and Grigory Guselnikov in the acquisition of the Ukrainian "daughter" of Sberbank.
The regulator substantiated its decision by the fact that the businessmen did not provide the necessary documents for verification for their compliance with the requirements of the legislation of Ukraine.
Sberbank announced the sale of its Ukrainian "daughter" to the consortium Norvik Banka and a private Belarusian company in March this year.
The majority shareholder of the consortium was Said Gutseriev, the son of Russian businessman Mikhail Gutseriev.
Sanctions against the "daughters" of five Russian banks in Ukraine, among which was Sberbank, were introduced in mid-March.
During the year, they are prohibited from withdrawing capital from the country in favor of the parent organizations.

Democracy in Afghanistan depends on the role of women in politics, the UN said.
Elections can only be representative when all members of society, including women, participate, are attended, the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan.
According to Nicolas Haysom, the incumbent head of the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, hundreds of women are running for provincial council elections, three women are fighting for the post of vice president, and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.

In Venice tightened fines for tourists for inappropriate behavior
The Venetian authorities have tightened fines for swimming in canals from 50 euros to 500 euros.
For walks around the city in a swimsuit or with a naked torso will now be fined 200 euros.
100 euros will require those who arrange a picnic in a public place or ride a bike in pedestrian areas, reports TASS with reference to the Association of Tour Operators of Russia.

Electricity is cheaper for residents and for commodity producers of Buryatia
The efforts of the Soviet and post-Soviet authorities of the Republic of Buryatia (Eastern Siberia) to establish fair tariffs for consumers of electricity are beginning to bear fruit.
From September 1, the cost of low voltage electricity for industrial recipients has been reduced by 25%.
Federal Antimonopoly Service of the country in accordance with the Decree of the Government of the Russian Federation "On Amendments to the Rules of the Wholesale Electric Power and Capacity Market and the Combined Prototype Balance of Production and Supply of Electric Power (Power) within the Unified Energy System of Russia by Subjects of the Russian Federation" (from 17.07.2017. No. 842) established indicative prices for electricity and capacity for industrial consumers of the Republic of Buryatia.
As a result, the cost of electricity for Buryat commodity producers is reduced by a quarter, which will greatly facilitate the life of small and medium-sized enterprises and individual entrepreneurs.
For many decades, the leaders of the republic have outdated the thresholds of Moscow cabinets in futile attempts to equal the region in tariffs with the neighboring Irkutsk region with a cascade of hydroelectric power plants on Angara, flowing from Baikal, the main catchment area for which is Buryatia.
And only this year's progress began.
In March, the tariffs for electric energy for the population of the republic were reduced from 4.24 rubles/kWh to 3.93 rubles/kWh, or 7.3%.
With the inclusion of Buryatia by the decision of the federal government in the List of territories of price zones of the wholesale market, for which the features of the functioning of the wholesale and retail markets are established, the turn of industrial consumers is established.
According to analysts, this is only the beginning, since the population of the Irkutsk region pays for a kilowatt / hour of 1.01 rubles.
But no one dares to name at least the approximate date of the new tariff moves in the direction of the downward for Buryatia.

National Union of Unskilled, Municipal and Boilers (GMB) Concerned about Investment at McVitie's Factory in Glasgow
The union demands guarantees from the managers of the biscuit manufacturer McVitie's in connection with its long-term production commitment at the Glasgow plant.
The Scottish branch of GMB reports that the company has bypassed the silence of the issue of future investments at the CTO object.
The factory, producing, among other products, Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies, employs more than 500 people.
Pladis, the owner of McVitie's, reports that over the past few years has invested more than 5 million pounds in the facility.
The company adds that in the event of any changes in the work of the facility, employees and representatives of the trade union will be the first to be the first to know about them.
In a letter to the head of the facility owned by the company, the Scottish branch of GMB demanded that McVitie's respond to concerns that funding would not be put into upgrading production lines.
Senior organizer Drew Duffy said that the members of our trade union are deeply concerned that we cannot get clarity from the general head of the facility on business needs and investment plan for the future of Tolcross.
Families have worked here for generations, and the concentration of workers is great in local society and on the territory of Greater Glasgow; it is the most important pillar of decent work on the territory of high unemployment and social deprivation.
Thus, in terms of jobs, wages and prosperity, and against the backdrop of Brexit, the rising subsistence level and the chronic decline in production, the East End Glasgow desperately needs the prosperity of production at the McVitie's factory.
According to a representative of Pladis, the driver of the Ctros facility only yesterday received a letter from the Scottish branch of GMB, and the company will respond immediately, as we appreciate our constant cooperation with employees and representatives of the trade union.
Two months ago, we held a regular meeting with GMB employees and representatives in Tolcross, where we discussed a number of issues openly.
We talked to employees that as all companies operating in the most competitive and unstable economic climate, we are constantly reviewing our actions - and this applies to all our facilities and activities - to remain competitive.
In recent years, we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our Cockrose facility, especially in production lines and improvements in functional indicators.
We are fully aware of the value of Tolcross as a production facility, and in the event of any changes in the work at this facility, the employees and representatives of the trade union will learn about it first.
Putin said that the authorities will not give instructions to Rosneft and Gazprom
Vladimir Putin said that the issue of gas supplies to the Eastern Petrochemical Company (VNHK) should be connected by the Kremlin and the Cabinet of Ministers, but no one will give instructions to Gazprom, as well as Rosneft.
So Russian President Vladimir Putin responded to the request of Igor Sechin to assist in resolving the contradictions that have arisen.
The head of state drew attention to the fact that relations between Rosneft and Gazprom should be resolved exclusively on the basis of market principles.
Earlier, the head of Rosneft, Igor Sechin, at a meeting on the implementation of major investment projects in the Far Eastern Federal District, said that the lack of an agreement with Gazprom on gas for the VNHK puts the project under threat.
Sechin noted that the dialogue with Gazprom on this issue continues.
"Gazprom offers to find gas resources from Rosneft's perimeter, but we do not have such resources," Sechin added.
Recall that Rosneft asked to allow it to use gas from the Kirinsin field of Gazprom, located on the Sakhalinsky shelf for the "Eastern petrochemical company."
In June, Gazprom said that negotiations on this issue continue, and "there are no sharp corners there."
Did PSG - Barcelona warn about the transition of Neymar three years ago?
Participant in La Liga may regret his interest in Marco Verratti
"Paris Saint-Germain will not stop chasing Neymar after the club offered 189 million pounds for his ransom, but did they warn Barcelona of the world record for the flight, held three years ago?
The sensational proposal revived the summer transfer window, when the Ligue 1 club was ready to break the world record for the cost of the transition, more than twice the previous mark associated with the return of Paul Pogba to Manchester United last season for 89 million pounds.
When it's over, Neymar will be the most expensive player in the world, and we are also the highest paid professional athlete in the world, as PSG offers him a salary of more than 500,000 pounds a week.
It is known that Barcelona is angry at how the proposal was expressed, and how Neymar terminated the contract, despite the fact that, as the source insists, close to the leadership of the Catalan club, the club has always done everything possible for the player since his transition from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned of this opportunity three years ago by the president of PSG?
When Manchester City expressed interest in hiring Blaise Matuidy in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi issued a harsh warning to any club that would like to lure one of the best players in PSG.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we'll stand up to them, we'll make offers to their players," he said.
We respect all clubs.
But if they try to recruit one of our players, they will be expected by the consequences.
Apparently, "Barcelona has crossed this line, when the Spanish club earlier this summer expressed interest in midfielder from "PSG" Marco Verratti.
PSG made it clear that they would not release the Italian player to the national team on any terms, and now, Barcelona probably feels the consequences of his offer in the form of the loss of one of his most valuable players, Neymar.
