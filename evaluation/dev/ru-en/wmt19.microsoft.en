The number of recruits from Ukraine preparing to be sent to Donbass has been named
The official representative of the People's Militia of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People's Republic (LPR), Andriy Marochko, said that in the winter of 2018-2019, Ukraine will send at least 3 thousand recruits to Donbass.
According to him, in this way Kiev plans to "somehow complete the units."
"The reluctance of Ukrainian citizens to serve in the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, mass dismissals led to low staffing of units," Marochko said, as quoted by RIA Novosti.
He also did not rule out that the real numbers of Ukrainians drafted into the army could be increased if necessary.
In 2014-2017, Kiev launched the so-called anti-terrorist operation (ATO), which was later replaced by the Joint Forces Operation (JFO).
It was assumed that this measure would lead to an increase in the role of the Ukrainian security forces in resolving the situation.
At the end of August 2018, the situation in the Donbass escalated due to the murder of the head of the DPR Alexander Zakharchenko.
The DPR authorities qualified the incident as a terrorist attack.
During the investigation of the criminal case, several people involved in the explosion were detained.
According to preliminary data, they confirmed that the sabotage was organized by the Ukrainian special services.
US authorities forced Musk to leave the post of chairman of the board of Tesla
American businessman Elon Musk will leave the post of chairman of the board of directors of the company Tesla founded by him at the request of the US authorities.
To settle claims of the Federal Securities and Exchange Commission, the entrepreneur will also pay $ 20 million.
According to CNBC, the pre-trial agreement with the department allows Musk to remain in a senior position at Tesla.
At the same time, he is obliged to pay $ 20 million and leave the post of chairman of the board of directors within 45 days from the date of the agreement and for at least three years.
Two independent directors will be appointed in his place.
It is specified that the agreement has yet to be approved by the court.
On September 28, it became known that the US Securities and Exchange Commission accused Musk of misleading shareholders with a statement that there were sufficient funds to buy back shares of this company and sued the entrepreneur in court.
We are talking about the publication of the businessman on Twitter, where he announced his desire to buy Tesla shares at $ 420 apiece, but did not do it.
After the tweet, the company's shares rose by almost 11%.
The head of the British Foreign Office compared the EU with the Soviet Union and prison
British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt compared the European Union to the Soviet Union and accused Brussels of capturing the member states of the community.
The diplomat made such a statement at the congress of the ruling Conservative Party in Birmingham, which opened on Sunday, September 30.
As noted by the Daily Mail, in this way Hunt commented on the difficulties in the negotiation process on Brexit.
What happened to the belief in the European dream and its ideals?
The EU was created to protect freedom, and the Soviet Union did not allow anyone to leave it.
The lesson of history is obvious: if you turn the EU from a community into a prison, the desire to leave it will not decrease, but will only grow, and we will not be the only prisoner who wants to escape from captivity," the minister said.
He also added that attempts to punish Britain for the decision to leave the European Union will only exacerbate the crisis, Gazeta.ru notes.
In mid-September, British Prime Minister Theresa May said that Brexit negotiations had reached an impasse.
So she commented on the results of the informal summit of the European Union in Salzburg.
The decision on Brexit was made in 2016 following a referendum.
It is expected that the withdrawal of the United Kingdom should take place before April 2019, but negotiations with Brussels on this issue are complicated by many factors.
In particular, there is still no clear agreement on how the parties will interact after London leaves the community.
In addition, the question of the Irish border remains open.
The President of South Korea who received mushrooms from the DPRK was presented with two dogs
South Korean President Moon Jae-in received two puppies as a gift from North Korean leader Kim Jong-un after a visit to Pyongyang.
It is reported by Reuters with reference to the representative of the administration of the South Korean president.
"During the summit, a pair of Pongsan dogs were offered as a gift.
On Thursday, they were received," the department said.
The dogs are about a year old, "as an aid for their adaptation," the North Korean side handed over several kilograms of food.
The gift was made in honor of the inter-Korean summit, which was held from September 18 to 20 in Pyongyang.
The Hunting Breed Pongsan is from North Korean wolves and got its name from one of the districts of the DPRK.
As the agency notes, Moon loves animals, he already has two such dogs, which were given to him by the former leader of North Korea, Kim Jong-il.
Dogs aren't the only gift.
Kim Jong-un also handed over to his colleague two tons of delicatessen matsutake mushrooms.
He ordered to distribute these mushrooms to members of families separated during the Korean War, who have not yet reunited with their loved ones from the DPRK.
The head of the Altai village council stopped the hunger strike in defense of the interests of residents
The mp said on his Facebook page that he had stopped starving for several reasons.
The head of the village council said that the situation has reached an impasse, the district administration does not respond to his demands, and he needs to do his job.
In addition, the prosecutor's office began to check the situation, and the heat supply organization STPK promised to begin work on preparing the system for the passage of the winter heating period of the village of Sibirsky next week.
Also, residents of the village council made and took away to the governor of the Altai Territory a mass collective appeal "concerning the current catastrophic situation."
Boronin himself said that he felt normal, he fulfilled his duties as head during the hunger strike in full.
As Boronin explained, the villages of Sibirsky and Rogulichny have centralized heat supply systems, which means that the authority to prepare them for the winter should be performed by the administration of the Pervomaisky district.
However, so far no one has started these works.
The head of the village council also protested against the lack of proper control and support from the government of the Altai Territory and against the financial policy of Gazprommezhregiongaz Novosibirsk.
In addition to the proper preparation of settlements for the winter, Boronin demanded "to immediately organize on the territory of the municipality a full-fledged independent section of communal services with appropriate staff units."
Named new buildings in Moscow with the cheapest apartments
In the first half of 2018, about three thousand housing units with an area of 30 square meters and a cost of up to four million rubles were bought in new buildings in Moscow.
More than half of such transactions accounted for two residential complexes, according to the materials of the Portal Urbanus (available to Lenta.ru).
The leaders in terms of housing sales in the budget of up to four million rubles were the Nekrasovka residential complex, located behind the Moscow Ring Road, in the Kotelniki district (Southeast Asia), and the Barbaris apartment complex in the Bibirevo district (SVAO).
Notable in the structure of transactions with budget housing were also two residential complexes in New Moscow - "Southern Bunino" and "Maple Alleys".
Urbanus analysts note that the share of transactions with apartments up to four million rubles in these new buildings reaches 60 percent of all sales and provides half of the total revenue.
"It is necessary to recognize the impact of apartments with a budget of less than four million rubles on the commercial success of the Tsentralny microdistrict in Novye Vatutinki and the Filatov Lug residential complex," the study says about two more residential complexes in New Moscow.
At their expense, about 35 percent of the volume of financial revenues is formed.
Earlier, the rating of districts of Moscow with the cheapest apartments in new buildings was presented in the real estate agency "Bon Ton".
According to the company, the lowest prices for primary housing (149.9 thousand rubles per meter) in September 2018 were recorded in Southeast Asia.
In second and third place were VAO and SVAO with indicators of 184.1 and 192.8 thousand rubles, respectively.

Telegram users complained about the failure of the new version
iPhone users complained about problems in the work of the Telegram messenger after the update released on September 28.
The user's phone number can be found by his username
Complaints relate to gadgets with the current operating system iOS 12.
According to their owners, after the update, the application shows a white screen or closes immediately.
Representatives of the messenger reacted to the failure.
According to them, the problem may be related to the migration of information to a new application written in the Swift language.
Telegram temporarily suspended the automatic update of the application until the problems are resolved.
On April 13, the Tagansky Court of Moscow satisfied the claim of Roskomnadzor to block the Telegram messenger in Russia.
Three days later, telecom operators began to implement the decision.
The reason was the refusal of the administration of the messenger to provide the FSB with the keys for decrypting correspondence necessary to obtain data on terrorists.
In August, Telegram changed its privacy policy and agreed to disclose the IP address and mobile phone number of a suspected terrorist user upon receipt of a court order.
The audience of Telegram after the blocking in the Russian Federation decreased by 1.2 million

Elon Musk is forced to leave the post of head of the board of directors of Tesla
The US Securities and Exchange Commission and Tesla founder Elon Musk settled their dispute in a fraud case.
It is reported by CNBC News.
According to the channel, as part of the agreements reached, Musk will have to leave the post of head of the board of directors of Tesla.
At the same time, the commission allowed Musk to retain the post of head of Tesla.
As noted, the founder of Tesla will also have to pay an administrative fine of $ 20 million.
A similar amount will be charged from Tesla.
At the same time, the money will be distributed among the affected investors.
In addition, the company must appoint two independent directors.
Elon Musk is an American entrepreneur who is included in the list of the 50 richest people in the world according to Forbes magazine.
He is the head of the space corporation SpaceX, the neurotechological company Neuralink and the developer of electric cars Tesla, as well as the co-founder of Paypal.
The US Securities and Exchange Commission previously sued Tesla CEO Elon Musk because of his message posted on Twitter about a possible buyout of the company.
Last month, Musk announced plans to make Tesla a private company and buy back all shares on the stock exchange at a fixed price of $ 420.
The share price of $ 420 was established allegedly "because of the importance of this number in the culture of marijuana," Bloomberg reported earlier, citing Stephen Peikin, co-director of the commission's security department.
At the same time, Elon Musk subsequently abandoned his plans to buy back shares.
Commenting on the lawsuit filed against him by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the businessman said that he considers the accusations of fraud unfounded, and added that he is very disappointed and saddened by these claims.
"Honesty is the most important value in my life, and the facts will prove that I did not violate it in any way," the businessman said in an interview with CNBC.
At the same time, in August, a group of Tesla shareholders filed a class action lawsuit against Musk, complaining about the financial losses incurred.
The plaintiffs argued that the businessman's posts brought them losses.
In particular, one of the shareholders said that the tweets of the businessman were misleading, which is why sellers of Tesla shares were forced to buy securities at artificially inflated prices to cover their positions.
Also, other plaintiffs noted that Elon Musk's careless statements led to sharp fluctuations in the exchange rate.
In September, Elon Musk was accused of stock exchange fraud by the head of the research company Citron Research.
Meanwhile, if Musk could not resolve his dispute with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, he would face removal from the management of the company and even prison.
This, in particular, was stated to CNBC by the former chairman of the commission Harvey Pitt.
Musk is "not a bad guy who doesn't know how to run a car company."

The ROC compared the possible renaming of the UOC with the actions of the fascists
The head of the Department for External Church Relations (DECR) of the Moscow Patriarchate, Metropolitan Hilarion of Volokolamsk, compared the possible renaming of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church to the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of the fascists in Germany.
Metropolitan Hilarion of Volokolamsk on the causes of the conflict with the Patriarchate of Constantinople, the possible church schism and its political subtext
According to him, now that "the conflict between Russia and Ukraine is in an acute stage," renaming the church is like "Jews putting on a yellow six-pointed star" in fascist Germany.
"This means labeling the church as an enemy organization, and it is for this purpose that this bill was created," a representative of the Russian Orthodox Church said on the Rossiya 24 TV channel.
The Metropolitan also stressed that the UOC is not a Russian church, but a Ukrainian one, since "the believers of this church consider themselves Ukrainians, they are patriots of their country."
The UOC called on the exarchs of Constantinople to leave its territory
Grand Prix in Sochi: full house, Russian car and the return of Kvyat
Over the next ten years, Russia may have its own racing car.
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Kozak said this, summing up the results of a meeting with Russian automakers on the eve of the start of the Russian Grand Prix in Sochi.
Also, the Deputy Prime Minister shared his opinion on the return of Daniil Kvyat to Toro Rosso and assessed the attendance of the Russian stage of Formula 1.
The result of our meeting with automakers should be in the foreseeable future just the creation of the Russian Formula 1 car, which has no analogues in the world, - said Dmitry Kozak.
We need to stimulate our automakers in this direction.
It was about plans until 2024, but I do not think that in such a time frame it is possible.
I think it's a more realistic timeline over the next ten years."
From 2012 to 2014, the Marusya team competed in Formula 1 under a Russian license.
According to the Deputy Prime Minister, there are already investors who are ready to invest in the creation of a domestic team in the World Championship in auto racing in the Formula 1 class.
I know that in Russia there are fans of motor sports, wealthy businessmen who are ready to invest, ready to invest in the creation of the Russian Formula 1 team," he said.
"We are ready to support them morally.
Let's hope that we will have such a team.
I suspect that thoughts about the creation of a team appeared, among other things, because such an infrastructure appeared in Sochi."
Tomorrow "Sochi Autodrom" is waiting for a full house.
According to Dmitry Kozak, the organizers managed to sell all 50 thousand tickets.
Look, even at the qualification, the stands were practically filled, - said the Deputy Prime Minister.
I can say that revenue this year has grown by 72% compared to last year.
This is a good, positive result.
We are also preparing an action plan to improve the efficiency of the sochi Autodrom infrastructure throughout the year.
This will be an additional tourist product that will give even greater attractiveness to Sochi.
Dmitry Kozak did not bypass the main topic of the day for Russian motorsport fans - the return of Daniil Kvyat to Toro Rosso.
We all congratulate Daniil together and wish him success next season," the deputy prime minister told Izvestia.
He's a budding racer.
Next year, for the first time in history, two main Russian pilots will be able to take part in the Formula 1 peloton at once.
Although the further fate of Sergey Sirotkin in the "Royal Races" remains unknown.
His contract with Williams ends at the end of the season, and the results are not yet impressive: he took 18th place in qualifying for the Russian Grand Prix.
Let's hope that next season there will be more of our main pilots than this year, - said Dmitry Kozak.

A few years earlier, he, being a cold, had sown mucus from his own nose on a petri dish (this is a kind of glass lid in which experiments with bacteria are carried out) and a few days later discovered that the bacteria that were there had been destroyed.
Almost as by chance, he discovered penicillin.
Fleming's name was included in the list of the 100 most prominent personalities in the history of mankind.
His discovery, according to many scientists, changed the course of history.
With the help of penicillin, medicine began to cope with most of the oldest diseases, previously considered incurable - tuberculosis, syphilis, gangrene ...
When, shortly after receiving the Nobel Prize, Fleming arrived in the French capital in 1945, Parisian newspapers wrote: "To defeat fascism and liberate France, he did more than dozens of divisions."
According to experts, Fleming's discovery of the world's first antibiotic saved the lives of more than 200 million people on Earth.
Alexander Fleming died at his home in London in 1955 of a heart attack.
He was cremated and a week later his ashes were buried in London's famous St Paul's Cathedral.
Where, by the way, my wife and I drew attention to this wordy Russian-speaking guide.
A few years later, we had a chance to observe the statue of Alexander Fleming in full growth in the most unexpected place in the capital of Spain.
There, next to the main arena for the Bullfighting Plaza de Toros de Las Ventas, the most famous Spanish matadors erected a monument to a man whose efforts saved, in their opinion, the lives of hundreds of outstanding masters of bullfighting.
By the way, this, in my opinion, very interesting porcelain work was found by me there, in Madrid, but at a different time and not at all for this reason.

Trump spoke about "falling in love" with Kim Jong-un
From mutual cruelty, the leaders of the United States and the DPRK have reached almost the point of falling in love with each other, Joked Donald Trump.
US President Donald Trump made a good joke about his successes on the front of resolving the North Korean crisis.
Starting with mutual threats of destruction, now the leaders of the two countries have so corrected relations that they are almost in love with each other, the American president noted.
The owner of the White House recalled that he accepted the North Korean problem from the previous administration as the main difficulty in foreign policy.
Trump noted that Barack Obama's team so launched relations with the DPRK that it could not even reach the country's leadership - they simply did not pick up the phone.
Then the United States and the DPRK were on the verge of war, and today the North Korean leader writes "beautiful letters" to the White House, Trump said.
Trump admitted that at the beginning of his work he was also "cruel" to Kim Jong-un, which, however, was mutual.
However, now their relationship has improved so much that the leaders "fell in love with each other."
At the same time, Trump asked not to take his words literally and warned that the American media would interpret them as incompetence.
Trump drew attention to the fact that recently Pyongyang stopped nuclear and missile tests, and also closes military training grounds.
All this is the merit of the work of his administration, the American president is sure.
Last Tuesday, Donald Trump spoke flatteringly about Kim Jong-un from the rostrum of the UN General Assembly.
Trump thanked the North Korean leader for his courage and the steps taken to de-escalate tensions.
At the same time, Trump noted that sanctions against the DPRK will remain until the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.
Negotiations in Singapore
On June 12, the first-ever talks between the leaders of the United States and North Korea took place in Singapore.
After a serious aggravation of relations and mutual threats of the use of nuclear weapons, the summit looked like a turning point in the protracted US-Korean crisis.
Following the talks, the parties expressed their intention to move towards a peaceful resolution of the contradictions, although they did not assume any legal obligations.
The positive results of the meeting were the cessation of nuclear and missile tests of the DPRK, as well as the return to the United States of the remains of American soldiers who were in the country.
At the same time, other practical steps towards the denuclearization of North Korea are still stalled.
The media reported that after the Singapore summit, the United States sent the DPRK several scenarios for disarmament, but Pyongyang rejected them, calling them "gangster".

Nitsoy urged to supplant the "Moscow language with a Ukrainian product"
Ukrainian children's writer and fighter for the purity of the native language Larisa Nitsoy called for the ousting of "the Russian-speaking Moscow product and the Moscow language" from Ukraine.
She proposes to do this with a Ukrainian product - "a cultural wave, a cultural onslaught."
Nitsoy shared her thoughts on the "expediency of eradicating the Russian language in Ukraine" with the Ukrainian edition of obozrevatel.
According to her, the corresponding Ukrainian product is now being prepared - it even exists and continues to develop further.
Over time, Ukrainians will "recover" from this "Moscow language", she is convinced.
For example, in neighboring Poland, according to her, Russian speech used to be widely used on television and radio, but it practically did not remain in the public space.
At the same time, according to Nitsoy, Ukrainians do not use aggressive methods in this process: the actions of the authorities prohibiting the use of the Russian language, in her opinion, are only "an expansion of the boundaries for Ukrainian speech at the legislative level."
Earlier, Nitsoy shared her experience in maintaining the "Ukrainian-speaking regime" in a children's camp in the Carpathians, where she was invited to work.
In December 2016, she threatened to sue the Watsons chain of bookstores, the cashier of one of which communicated with her on Russian.
Not getting her way, Nitsoy threw change at the girl.
She calls the use of Russian words by Ukrainians "linguistic schizophrenia", urging Ukrainians to abandon Russian letters even in the spelling of surnames.
Recently, Nitsoy said that the name "Rus" was stolen from Ukrainians, so Russia should be called Muscovy.
Even the Security Service of Ukraine could not avoid the writer's wrath: having come there and overheard the conversations of employees with each other in Russian, she made a scandal and left, slamming the door.
At halftime, we had a men's conversation, and it bore fruit.

"It seems to me that we wanted to win more," Kulakov was quoted as saying by Ural's official website.
"Such a difficult game turned out, at halftime we had a serious men's conversation, and it bore fruit: we scored two goals and did not concede.
"You missed a few matches because of the injury you got at the beginning of the month.
How did you feel today?"
"If you can stand 90 minutes, then everything is fine!
In fact, I felt good.
Maybe at the end, a little bit of energy to make sure nothing happens.
And so, the doctors and physiotherapist Vladimir Anatolyevich Gashnev brought me to this game, for which they are very grateful!
"What about the atmosphere in the team?"
"It's no secret that after victories it is easier to recover, and the mood in the team is good.
Now we have a white stripe, although at first it was black.
We need to continue in the same vein and please the fans."
"Did you miss the game in the time you didn't get on the field?"
"There is such a thing, I missed it a little, because a really unpleasant situation came out.
But once again, thanks to the physiotherapist and doctors who put me on your feet.
The most important thing is that we won and pleased the fans.
And the rest is secondary."

The referendum in Macedonia recorded violations
Four incidents related to violations of electoral legislation were registered in the Republic of Macedonia in a referendum on an intergovernmental agreement with Greece on renaming.
This was announced on Sunday by the press secretary of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Tony Angelovsky.
Since the opening of polling stations, 4 incidents have been recorded, which have been eliminated," he said.

"The Ministry will act in accordance with the law so that citizens can safely exercise the constitutional right to freely express their will.
We call on citizens to comply with the laws and refrain from any violations of public order and tranquility and any violation of the secrecy of the vote," the Interior Ministry spokesman said.
Citizens in Sunday's referendum are asked to answer one question: "Do you support EU and NATO membership by accepting an agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Hellenic Republic?"
The referendum is intended to resolve a 27-year-old dispute between Macedonia and Greece over the name of the former Yugoslav republic, which coincides with the name of the northern Greek region.
On June 17, during a solemn ceremony on the shores of Lake Prespa, along which the border between the two countries passes, the foreign ministers of Macedonia and Greece signed an agreement on the new official name of the former Yugoslav republic.
It provides for the use of the name "Republic of North Macedonia".
This treaty should solve not only the long-standing dispute over the name of the country, but also open the way for Skopje to join NATO and the EU.

This opinion was expressed by the head of the Syrian Foreign Ministry, Walid Muallem, in an interview with RT, which aired on Sunday.

The accusation for the Dagestani deputy became news
The Sovetsky District Court of Makhachkala imprisoned for two months a deputy of the People's Assembly of Dagestan Rajab Abdulatipov, suspected of participating in a criminal community that registered disability for bribes.
"Kommersant" became aware of the details of the investigation materials, shedding light on how, according to the Investigative Committee of Russia, the younger brother of the former head of the republic Ramazan Abdulatipov Rajab Abdulatipov contributed to the criminal actions of the now former head of the Main Bureau of Medical and Social Expertise Magomed Makhachev and his accomplices.
Among other things, during the operational-search activities carried out by employees of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, it was found that Rajab Abdulatipov lobbied for the appointment of Magomed Makhachev to the post of head of the bureau, allegedly receiving 70 million rubles for this.
Earlier, the investigation against Magomed Makhachev, other managers and employees of the territorial bureaus of medical and social expertise under his subordination initiated a criminal case under Art. 210 (creation of a criminal community using official position and participation in it), Art. 290 (receiving a bribe by an organized group), Art. 292 (official forgery) and Art. 159 (fraud on a particularly large scale) of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.
As follows from the materials of the investigation, at the end of 2013, Rajab Abdulatipov, knowing about the illegal actions of Magomed Makhachev and his accomplices involved in the embezzlement of funds from the Pension Fund, joined their activities, joining a criminal community.
Being the head of the Department of the Federal Migration Service of Russia for Dagestan and having connections in state authorities and law enforcement agencies, as well as using his family relations with the head of Dagestan, Rajab Abdulatipov, investigators believe, "ensured the activities of other members of the criminal community, established contacts with officials of state bodies to support the illegal activities of Magomed Makhachev and his stay in the  as the head of the federal state institution "The Main Bureau of Medical and Social Expertise for the Republic of Dagestan", organized the illegal establishment of disability for citizens. "

"Of course, everything that is presented to me today as an accusation, for me all this is new, I am completely unfamiliar with it," he said.
The court arrested the deputy from United Russia not for ten days before being charged, as was the case with previous high-ranking Dagestani officials, but immediately for two months, since Article 210 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation appears in his case.
According to the Code of Criminal Procedure, the investigation has much more time to bring charges - up to 45 days from the moment of detention.

Serbia's president wants to ask Putin for support
Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic will discuss with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin the situation with Kosovo and ask for his support during a meeting in Moscow.
Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow.
During the meeting, he plans to discuss with his counterpart from the Russian Federation the current situation with Kosovo.
In addition, Vucic intends to ask Putin for support.
The Serbian leader made the corresponding statement during a press conference, the local newspaper Vecherniye Novosti reports.
According to the source, the head of Serbia said that, speaking about the need for support from the Russian side, he does not mean military support following the example of Syria.
Aleksandar Vucic said that he did not want to allow a scenario in which any major military clashes could occur on the territory of the state.
The president of the country promised to make every effort to preserve peace, the newspaper reports.
We add that according to the Serbian media, the meeting of the heads of Russia and Serbia is scheduled for the upcoming Tuesday, October 2, writes "Lenta.ru".
A day earlier, it became known that the Serbian president brought the army of the state into full combat readiness because of the situation with Kosovo.
We are talking about the events of last Friday, when several dozen Kosovo special forces entered the territory adjacent to the lake supplying water to the Gazivoda hydroelectric power plant.
It is specified that this hydroelectric power station is located on the territory of Kosovo, but at the same time it belongs to the Serbian energy system.
Recall that Kosovo declared independence from Serbia ten years ago, however, Belgrade refused to recognize this fact.
In the spring of last year, the parties stopped negotiations on this issue.

Kosachev: At the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly, the topic of Russia in a negative way was practically absent
The head of the Federation Council Committee on International Affairs, Konstantin Kosachev, considers the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly successful for Russia and does not exclude that it can become a turning point in the perception of the Russian Federation as an integral participant in solving global world problems.
"The uniqueness of the current 73rd session, in my opinion, lies in the fact that the rhetoric, to which we have almost become accustomed in recent years in relation to Russia, has now been much more muted," the senator said in an interview published on Sunday by Rossiyskaya Gazeta.
He explained that in previous years, russia was sometimes "designated as one of the three main threats to humanity, then along with Ebola, then along with climate change or terrorism, Russia was in this series, at least in the presentation of a group of Western countries, which spoke on this subject quite unanimously."
At the 73rd session, Kosachev emphasized, "the topic of Russia in a negative way was practically absent."
"If you carefully analyze the speech of the PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, the President of France, the speech of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Germany, I am not taking Ukraine, Georgia, or the British, in any case, there was no choir for sure," the politician said, noting that Russia "was no longer a kind of wall against which tennis ball strikes are trained."
The head of the relevant committee of the Federation Council does not exclude that this indicates a certain trend, which, in his opinion, "will highlight the current session [of the UN General Assembly], although this trend may fully manifest itself in a year, in two, three."
"I do not rule out that the current session in some sense may be a turning point," Kosachev admitted, explaining that "there are too many examples of how with the involvement of Russia it is possible to move forward in international affairs."
As an example, he cited the situation in Syria, around Iran and North Korea.
"So far, unfortunately, this is not Ukraine, but I have no doubt that the Russian vision of the Ukrainian crisis will also be in demand over time," the parliamentarian added.
This is due to the fact, he believes, that there is "an adequate, sensible perception of Russia as not just possible - an integral participant in solving global problems of our time."
"I wouldn't want to be wrong, but I have a feeling that we are passing a point somewhere beyond which the movement will no longer be a reversal, it will be a movement forward," he added.
Another "interesting and important feeling" in this context Kosachev called "a request for a Russian vision of how the modern world should develop."
"I attended a lot of meetings of the head of the Russian delegation [at the session of the General Assembly] Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, I held my own meetings, and I saw with great pleasure that if a year or two or five years ago no one was interested in Russian opinion, the Russian vision of what is happening in the world, by and large, no one was interested, now the situation is different," the chairman of the Federation Council Committee said.
In his opinion, this is due to the fact that "the so-called new liberal order, which is personified with the West, does not have answers to the questions of how to solve world problems due to the obvious lack of ideas in the global space, the lack of ideas on how to solve the problems of the Middle East, the problems of terrorism, the problems of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, the problems of migration."
"And here the demand for the Russian vision is becoming more and more obvious," Kosachev expressed confidence, stressing that he considers in this sense "the current session successful for the work of the Russian delegation, successful for Russia."

Damascus announced its right to use military force in Idlib
Damascus hopes that in the Syrian province of Idlib it will not be necessary to use military force, said The Foreign Minister of the Syrian Arab Republic Walid Muallem.
At the same time, according to him, Syria has the right to do this.
The minister added that Turkey has the opportunity to quickly solve the problem of withdrawing militants of the Jabhat al-Nusra organization banned in Russia from the demilitarized zone in Idlib, RIA Novosti reports.
The Foreign Minister also stressed that Damascus will have to resort to a military solution to the problem of the territories east of the Euphrates in the event of the desire of the Kurds for separatism.
At the same time, according to Muallem, negotiations with the Kurdish SDF forces were good until they broke down because of the United States.
On September 17, Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan agreed to create a demilitarized zone by October 15 along the line of contact between the armed opposition and government troops in the Syrian province of Idlib.

Earlier it was reported that the 37-year-old defender was negotiating a transfer to Spartak Moscow.
According to RT with reference to the Mirror, the former captain of the England national team John Terry headed the youth team of Chelsea.
According to the source, a well-known player, who has long played for the London club, will lead the team no older than 23 years.

First Deputy Speaker of the Verkhovna Rada Iryna Gerashchenko apologized to the Ukrainian journalist Roman Sushchenko, convicted in the Russian Federation for "espionage", for the fact that he has not yet been released from prison.
She said this in a video message to a political prisoner, recorded on the eve of the second anniversary of the illegal arrest of Sushchenko by the FSB.
According to her, these days an action is taking place under the walls of the Russian Embassy in Paris, the participants of which announced a hunger protest demanding the release of prisoners of the Kremlin.
Every day, French journalists, politicians, cultural figures, among them there are people who know you well, are starving, supporting Oleg Sentsov, other political prisoners of the Kremlin, and of course, you.
There is not a single international meeting, not a single negotiation, not a single interview, where the President of Ukraine, the Ukrainian authorities, all of us, did not demand to put pressure on the Kremlin, to put pressure on Putin with one demand - the release of Oleg, the release of Roman, the release of all political prisoners of the Kremlin and those guys who are illegally held in the occupied territories of Donbass and Crimea," Gerashchenko said.
She also expressed confidence that the tests will harden every Ukrainian, making us "angrier, tougher in protecting the national interests of Ukraine, in protecting every Ukrainian, in understanding what is good and what is evil."
Recall, the correspondent of Ukrinform in France Roman Sushchenko was detained by Russian security forces on September 30, 2016 at the Moscow airport.
On October 7, he was charged with espionage against the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine.
On June 4, 2018, the Moscow City Court sentenced Sushchenko to 12 years in a strict regime colony, and the Supreme Court of Russia recognized this verdict as legitimate.
Russian jailers granted the last request of the Ukrainian before he was transferred to the colony.

"I couldn't even hold a spoon"
Vakhtang Kikabidze on the fight against cancer
Now many artists talk about how they managed to cope with oncology.
The disease, unfortunately, does not spare anyone, and the stories of popular people about the victories over cancer, gives hope to many patients.
Famous actor Vakhtang Kikabidze admitted that he was alive only thanks to his wife.
Many years ago, he was diagnosed with a terrible diagnosis, which sounded like a sentence.
"It was as if I had been hit on the skull with a hammer from below.
I fell.
I lost my bearings.
They put me in the hospital.
I couldn't hold a spoon there, I couldn't stand there, I fell all the time.
They began to do tests, it turned out that things were bad, the artery does not pass blood.
They brought me to Moscow, they said that I had a large purulent cyst in my head, they urgently performed an operation.
And during the operation, the doctors saw a tumor behind the cyst," Kikabidze said in the program "Once".
The tumor turned out to be malignant.
Then, 37 years ago, residents of Tbilisi even came to say goodbye to the idol on the threshold of his house.
But the actor's wife did not allow the live actor to be buried, she firmly believed that she could cope with the disease and for more than a year did not leave the bed of her beloved husband.
If it weren't for Irina, I wouldn't be alive today.
Whenever I had critical situations, she was there like a rock," the actor admitted.
The actor managed to cope with the disease, now he lives happily in his house in the center of Tbilisi.
And from time to time he refutes rumors about his illness, then about his untimely death, which now and then appear on the Web.
The creators of the site "Peacemaker" included in the section "Purgatory" the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Hungary Peter Szijjártó.
The reason was "an attempt on the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine."
In addition, the foreign minister of the neighboring country was caught in "direct threats of invasion of Ukraine" and "support for separatist sentiments in Ukraine", as well as in participation "in the organization of a provocation aimed at mass violation by citizens of Ukraine of the legislation of Ukraine."
It should be noted that in front of Szijjártó in the "Purgatory" fell the viceroy of the Kiev-Pechersk Lavra Pavel and the primate of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriartach) Onufriy.
The reason was their opposition to the receipt of the Tomos by the Ukrainian Local Church.
Earlier, commenting on the issuance of Hungarian passports to Citizens of Ukraine in Transcarpathia, President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko demanded respect for the sovereign rights of Ukraine.
The authorities called the amount of the "golden parachute" of the Voronezh deputy governor
A one-time payment of 23 salaries to the Deputy Governor of the Voronezh Region Yuri Agibalov was made on the basis of the regional law "On Public Positions".
At the same time, the real amount of the "golden parachute" of the released acting official was several times less than the amount voiced in the media.
Such explanations were provided to the press service of the regional government.
According to the law, the salary for the position held by Agibalov is 11,189 rubles.
Thus, the press service emphasized, the size of the one-time payment amounted to 223,892 rubles minus income tax, and not 1 million rubles, which was written by the media.
The official received an insurance old-age pension from July 2018.
His experience in public office is more than nine years.
The appointment of this pension and a one-time payment to him is made immediately after dismissal from the post, explained to the agency "RIA Novosti" in the government of the region.
At the same time, the payment of additional payments to Agibalov's pension was suspended when he was appointed to a state post, and the size of his salary did not change compared to the previous period.
The winner of the gubernatorial election, acting governor of the region, Alexander Gusev, took office on September 15.
Agibalov was dismissed from his post due to the expiration of the term of office of the acting head of the region.
Similarly, the powers of other officials who held public positions in the region ended.
On September 29, the Telegram channel "Nezygar" published documents from which it followed that Agibalov, who resigned from the post of vice-governor, was paid severance pay in the amount of 23 salaries, and two days after that he again received a similar position without the prefix "acting".
State Duma deputy urged to tell schoolchildren about the dangers of masturbation
Onishchenko holds the post of First Deputy Chairman of the Committee on Education and Science.
Based on the experience of his work, he noted in an interview that adolescents are provoked to masturbation by harmful information that they find on the Internet.
It is worth fighting this at the level of educational institutions and families, the deputy added.
Gennady Onishchenko, deputy of the State Duma of the Russian Federation (in an interview with the radio station "Moscow Speaks"):
As part of the general sex education of children, this should be done by explaining the paguba, because here there is a certain risk to the sexual health of the child, both boys and girls.
The problem is objective, it is that the maturation of children comes quite early, and then large scissors appear between their puberty and the ability to officially enter into intersex contacts.
According to Onishchenko, the solution of the problem is hindered by "hypocrisy", silence of "problems of sexual age" and the lack of a culture of adequate upbringing of children.
The doctor is sure that many teenagers face masturbation.
The deputy believes that to practice lessons about the dangers of masturbation is primarily in the schools of "hyperurbanized" regions.
"If we start this conversation in our Muslim republic, we simply will not be understood, to put it mildly," the professor said.
Gennady Onishchenko - current academician of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, member of the Presidium of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, Doctor of Medical Sciences, Professor.
Honored Doctor of Russia and Kyrgyzstan, member of the Presidium of the All-Russian Public Organization "League of the Nation's Health".

AfD became the second most popular in Germany
The anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany is breaking another popularity record, and Angela Merkel's ratings are falling.
Apparently, the inhabitants of Germany began to seriously tire of the immigration policy of Angela Merkel, thanks to which the country became a coveted target for millions of refugees from the Middle East.
This is most clearly evidenced by the latest opinion polls, according to which the anti-immigrant party "Alternative for Germany" is becoming increasingly popular, and the positions of the ruling bloc of Merkel and Seehofer are weakening.
This week, the AfD broke another record, rising to second place in the ranking of popular sympathies.
Right-wing conservatives with 17 percent of popularity managed to bypass the Social Democrats, who have about 16 percent.
The gap of one percentage point can be attributed to a statistical error, but it is impossible not to note the fact that the AfD created in 2013 from a small group of Eurosceptic economists managed to turn into a serious political force.
Leadership in the overall standings still continues to be held by the ruling bloc of the CSU / CDU, which has about 30 percent.
However, there is a tendency to lose points - back in April, support for Angela Merkel's bloc was four percentage points higher.
The personal rating of the German Chancellor, who heads the German government for the fourth consecutive term, is also declining.
Today, 48 percent of Germans support Angela Merkel, which is 7 percent lower than last year.
We add that after the Social Democrats are the Greens (15%), the Left (11%) and the Liberals (10%).
Evolution of the "Alternative"
The Alternative for Germany party was created in September 2012 on the basis of the alternative choice 2013 group, which included immigrants from the Christian Democratic Union.
The group initially opposed the government's course, but at first it dealt only with economic issues, including the problems of the euro and interaction within the EU.
At the same time, the group opposed germany's "sponsorship" of weak EU economies, did not rule out the possibility of returning to the German mark and the country's complete exit from the European Union.
As the immigration crisis deepens, the AfD's political platform has expanded.
In 2013, the group took shape in a full-fledged party, which occupied the niche of Eurosceptics and began to harshly criticize the government for the failure of immigration policy.
In the last parliamentary elections in 2017, the AfD managed to break into the Bundestag for the first time, receiving 94 seats (out of 709).
Two representatives of the "Alternative for Germany" will receive seats in the European Parliament.
A video has been published with a journalist who called the citizens of Ukraine a "nation of morons"
The host of a political talk show on Ukrainian TV, the author of two books Ostap Drozdov admitted live that he considers his compatriots a "nation of morons."
They believe the TV and don't read much.
As Drozdov noted, it is difficult to live and work in such a country.
"We are not instilled with a culture of reading and accepting texts from childhood," the journalist said.
Local nationalists immediately criticized Drozdov's words, accusing him of lacking patriotism and greed.
As previously reported, the State Committee on Television and Radio Broadcasting of Ukraine began to fight against literature in which there is the slightest hint of criticism of the Kiev authorities, banning as many as 201 publications from importing.

Anyone can buy this car.
Roshel Defence Solutions said it was already accepting applications for its new armoured car.
Armored car of the apocalypse Roshel Senator APC
On the topic of the apocalypse, money is made not only by video game producers, film studios and book publishers.
Now a new niche for themselves is mastered by automobile companies.
So, the Canadian Roshel Defence Solutions presented its armored car of the apocalypse Senator APC.
In their free time, the engineers of this company create armored cars for the police.
Roshel Senator APC is designed for 12 passengers, which without much comfort, but in complete safety are placed in an all-welded armored capsule.
This bunker, and otherwise the design can not be called, since the level of its armor corresponds to the B7 standard, is installed on the chassis of a powerful Ford Super Duty pickup.
Its bottom, also armored, is able to protect the capsule from explosions by grenades and anti-personnel mines.

Named the period of death of the Universe
The universe will last another 140 billion years, which is ten times the age of the observable world, which is about 13.8 billion years.
The study of an international team of scientists is posted in the library of electronic preprints arXiv.org and is aimed at publication in the journal Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan, according to the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun.
Experts came to such conclusions by observing with the help of the HSC camera (Hyper Suprime-Cam) of the Subaru telescope for about ten million galaxies.
By tracking the distribution of dark matter and dark energy, which account for more than 95 percent of the energy-mass of the observable world, scientists working within the framework of the standard cosmological model ΛCDM (Λ Cold Dark Matter), estimated the rate of expansion of the Universe, which turned out to be slightly slower than previously thought.
In a press release, the Subaru Observatory notes that the observations made it possible to obtain a detailed three-dimensional map of the distribution of matter in the Universe, and taking into account the data of the European Space Telescope Planck clarified the restrictions imposed on the parameters of ΛCDM.
In July, scientists simulated the possible death of the universe.
Three years earlier, their colleagues had presented new arguments that the observed world would cease to exist in 22 billion years as a result of the Great Divide.
Another attempt to unite the initiators of the pension referendum has failed
The opportunity to find out the opinion of the people on the pension reform is postponed indefinitely
In Moscow on Saturday, a meeting of the federal initiative group of the referendum against raising the retirement age was held.
It was attended by representatives of 13 subgroups that registered different formulations of questions (in total, the Central Election Commission registered five formulations).
They decided to apply to the CEC with a petition for the registration of a single initiative group and ask the Russians a question: "Are you in favor of not increasing the age established by the legislation on pension provision as of July 1, 2018, upon reaching which Russian citizens receive the right to an old-age pension?"
This wording was registered by the Vologda subgroup, whose representatives did not participate in the meeting, but it was considered the simplest and most legally capacious.
Most of the participants in the meeting were supporters of a member of the "Fair Russia" Ilya Sviridov (six subgroups) and the Communist Party of the Russian Federation (four subgroups).
They were joined by three independent subgroups - from Nizhny Novgorod, Voronezh and Orenburg.
Earlier, Sviridov told Vedomosti that invitations were sent to all the initiators, and representatives of about 40 subgroups expressed their consent to come.
But, for example, Marina Semenova, who heads the Vologda subgroup (her wording was supported by 15 more subgroups), told Vedomosti that she did not receive an invitation and did not plan to come: "We did not understand who is a friend and who is an enemy."

"Admiral" created big problems for us
Zinetula Bilyaletdinov: "Admiral" created big problems for us
Ak Bars head coach Zinetula Bilyaletdinov summed up the results of the KHL regular season match against Admiral (4:2).

And that we won is also very important."

In the match "Loko" - "Akhmat" Turbin's mistakes poured in like a cornucopia
Former referee of the all-Union category Vladimir Levitin commented on the work of referee Evgeny Turbina in the match of the 9th round of the Russian championship "Lokomotiv" - "Akhmat" and analyzed the controversial episodes of the game.
- How do you assess the refereeing of Evgeny Turbin in the match "Lokomotiv" - "Akhmat"?
- I believe that this referee has confirmed his unsuitability for refereeing matches of the Russian Premier League.
I am surprised that in the meeting of the fifth round "Spartak" - "Dynamo", neither Turbin himself, nor the leaders of the DSI did not draw serious conclusions about his low qualifications.
The result was not slow to affect in the ninth round: errors in his actions, private omissions of rough receptions poured in like a cornucopia.
For example, in the 50th minute, the railwayman Eder was overwhelmed with his hands in his penalty area by Akhmat defender Rodolfo.
It's eight yards from goal, but Turbin doesn't put a penalty.
- How do you assess the episode involving Idowu, which was in the 82nd minute, when it seemed that the ball hit his hand?
- I believe that there was a deliberate play with the hand of a defender in his penalty area.
Turbin was close to the moment, can clearly see this episode and his first assistant on the right.
Reserve referee Sergey Karasev should have seen this moment.
However, all three slept and no penalty was awarded.
Therefore, the score in the match was distorted, and sports justice was violated.
This was the very case when refereeing in concepts supplanted and buried the sporting spirit of the game.
- In the 52nd minute, Turbin did not dare to send off the visitors' defender Oleg Ivanov, who violated the rules in the fight with Krykhovyak, and when the referee showed him a yellow card, defiantly applauded him.
What do you think of this episode?
Did you need to show the second "mustard"?
- At this point, Turbin and the first yellow card showed not quite on point.
The second would be illogical.
- Oleg Ivanov said after the match about the double standards of refereeing, that some teams are given penalties for such violations as in the episode with Idova, and some do not.
What do you assess the words of a football player?
- Depends on what is meant by double standards.
There was a penalty.
He wasn't given.
So, the referee does not give a second penalty to the opposite goal.
That's the principle that's being used.
And the second point of double standards is that the referee looks at who plays.
Lokomotiv played on Saturday and Akhmat has serious complaints about Turbin's work, because the team was infringed upon.
Matt Damon played accused rape judge Kavanaugh at SNL start
American actor Matt Damon played US Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who is accused of rape.
Damon appeared in the first episode of the new season of Saturday Night Live on NBC.
During a small sketch, the actor played Kavanaugh at a Senate hearing on rape charges.
The U.S. Supreme Court nominee previously attracted attention with his emotionality and detail of his stories during a conversation with Senator Amy Klobuchar.
So, Kavanaugh repeatedly confessed his love for beer, but stated that he never got drunk to the point of unconsciousness.
In addition, in an attempt to exonerate himself on rape charges, Kavanaugh claimed that he was a virgin in those years.
Those chances were also beaten by Damon.
All I did was drink a lot and didn't think about sex at all.
I was the proudest, drunkest virgin anyone had ever seen.
Everybody knows that," matt Damon said.
Kavanaugh was previously elected chief justice of the United States.
Barbra Streisand found strange behavior in her cloned dogs
American singer Barbra Streisand said that the clones of her dead dog behave completely differently than the original pet.
"They're not alike.
In fact, [clones] look like her, but it is impossible to clone the soul, "the 76-year-old singer emphasized.
In late 2017, Streisand ordered two clones of her 14-year-old Coton de Tulear dog named Samantha, who had to be put to sleep due to health problems.
In July 2018, it was reported that a Chihuahua dog named Miracle Milly, who was named the smallest dog in the world, was cloned for the 49th time.
Experts are cloning a six-year-old animal in an attempt to understand why it is so miniature.
The United States is thinking about a naval blockade of Russia because of the supply of oil and gas
The United States may launch a naval blockade of Russia in order to gain an advantage in the global energy market.
The US authorities are so zealous in the struggle for success in the global hydrocarbon market that they are ready to resort to a naval blockade of Russia, which remains one of the world's main suppliers of energy.
About the possibility of a sea blockade on the eve told the head of the US Department of Internal Affairs Ryan Zinke.
Contrary to world practice, the US Department of the Interior performs not police, but civilian functions, including the implementation of a policy in the field of natural resources.
Therefore, Zinke's statement came out quite within the competence of the department headed by him, although it was not devoid of political color.
Speaking at an industrial event in Pittsburgh, Zinke said that thanks to naval forces, the UNITED STATES controls sea lanes in the Middle East region and can block them if necessary.
From the words of Zinke it followed that the need may be associated with Washington's desire to prevent Russian supplies to the world energy market.
Zinke recalled that Russia still receives the lion's share of its revenues from supplies to the world market of oil and gas.
The desire to distribute energy supplies in the Middle East as well as in Eastern Europe was the main motive for Moscow's activation in this region, Zinke is sure.
The minister made it clear that the United States still expects to ensure its leadership in the global energy market by becoming the largest supplier of oil and gas.
To do this, Washington will have to squeeze out Russia and Iran, and a naval blockade of trade routes is an acceptable measure on this path, Zinke believes.

He is young, talented, creative and in his work strives for new non-standard forms of self-expression.

Supersonic passenger aircraft in the Russian Federation will be put into mass production
Serial production of supersonic passenger aircraft in Russia will begin after 2030.
This was stated by the Director General of the Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute named after Zhukovsky Kirill Sypalo.
According to him, the scientific center carries out work on supersonic topics both within the framework of international consortia and cooperation with the Ministry of Industry and Trade.
"According to our feelings, it will take us two to three years to get a technology demonstrator, as well as another 10-15 years to obtain a serial machine that allows us to carry out transportation across the expanses of our homeland," Sypalo added.
He said that now Russian specialists are faced with the question of how to make the equipment economical and safe at the same time.
In early September, the developer of aviation equipment PJSC "Tupolev" announced the completion of pre-design work on a supersonic passenger aircraft, according to calculations, the aircraft will be able to reach speeds of up to 1900 km / h at an altitude of 11 km.

Formula 1 Russian Grand Prix Race
In Russia, there is a club that I follow
Former captain of Chelsea and the England national team John Terry - about why he visited the match of the ninth round of the Russian championship "Spartak" - "Rostov" (0:1).
"In Russia, I have a club that I follow.
I follow it quite recently and it was interesting for me to look at it from the outside.
I can't say that I am a fan, because my heart belongs to Chelsea, but I have sympathy for Spartak and once again I want to apologize for the decision," Terry was quoted as saying by the Chelsea fans' website.
Recall, "Rostov" with 18 points rose to third place in the standings, and "Spartak" is located on the fifth line, having 15 points in the asset.
In the next round, the red and whites will play enise Enisey away on October 7, and Valery Karpin's charges will host Orenburg a day earlier.
An expensive violin was handed over to a pawnshop for a pittance.
When a man brought a violin to the LBC Boutique and Loan pawnshop in Somerville, Massachusetts, a pawnshop worker offered only $50 for a looking old and unpresentable instrument.
But experienced store manager Dylan McDermitt suspected that this was an old and expensive tool, and turned to an expert for advice.
Then it turned out that the violin was made in 1759 by the famous Italian violin maker Ferdinando Galliano and is estimated at 250 thousand dollars.
Only the bows to the violin are estimated at 16-18 thousand dollars.
The investigation revealed that the violin was recently stolen from one of the residents of the city, and the instrument was returned to the rightful owner.
It is not yet known how the violin got to the person who handed it over to a pawnshop, but he does not have any previous clashes with the law.
The manager says that now everyone bringing a violin to the pawnshop will be asked to play it to make sure that it really belongs to the client.
In the ninth round of the RPL, we are waiting for an exciting confrontation: Spartak will host Rostov at its stadium in Tushin under the leadership of Valery Karpin - a person, as you know, who is not at all alien to the "people's team".
A special piquancy of this meeting is given by the fact that the clubs now have an equal number of points - 15 each, and they share 3 and 4 places in the standings, lagging behind the far-reaching Zenit and being one point from Krasnodar, which tomorrow plays with Dynamo.
The red and whites now have a difficult streak: the club is again surrounded by idiotic scandals, in the Europa League Massimo Carrera's team unexpectedly flew in to Rapid, and recently lost at home to Akhmat.
After the derby with CSKA, which ended in a fair draw, Spartak beat Chornomorets in the Cup with a minimum score and not without difficulty, and it is too early to say whether the most popular club in Russia came close to overcoming the crisis.
Rostov could not win three matches in a row, but they have not known defeats for five matches.
Let's see if Karpin manages to extend the unbeaten streak with such a crucial match for himself.
The previous meeting of Karpin Rostov with Spartak ended in favor of the capital's team.
Kick-off is at 19:00.
Indonesia is shaken by aftershocks after a powerful tsunami
In Indonesia, where a few days ago there was an earthquake that provoked a three-meter tsunami, meteorologists observe more than 170 aftershocks.
The magnitude was 7.4, mainly affecting the island of Sulawesi, according to the TV channel "Russia 24".
The death toll exceeded 420 people, and more than five hundred were injured.
The authorities notified the population about the threat of a tsunami in advance, but later it was canceled.
The fact is that the devices did not record the approach of the wave.
The fate of dozens of residents who were preparing to celebrate the national holiday on one of the embankments of the city of Palu, which was most destroyed after the disaster, is still unknown.
London erupted with accusations against Moscow
Russia is trying to rewrite the results of the Cold War, said British Defense Secretary Gavin Williamson.
But England will defend its values, he stressed during a speech at the congress of the ruling Conservative Party in Birmingham.
Threats are increasing, Iran and North Korea are becoming more dangerous, enemies operate in gray areas with the help of cyber attacks and false news, the minister added.
But the biggest of them is Russia, which is building up its military presence in Ukraine and the Arctic region.
Moscow has repeatedly refuted such statements by Western politicians, TASS reports.
At the same time, british Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said that Russia would have to pay a high price if it did not adhere to international rules and use chemical weapons.
Hunt mentioned the story of the poisoning in the English city of Salisbury in March of this year, ex-colonel of the GRU Sergei Skripal, convicted of spying for the UK, and his daughter Yulia.
In the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, a referendum on joining the EU and NATO is taking place, subject to a change in the name of the country.
The referendum is designed to resolve a 27-year dispute with neighboring Greece over the country's name, which coincides with the name of a neighboring Greek province.
One of the first to vote was Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, an ardent supporter of renaming the republic to North Macedonia.
Preparations for the referendum and today's vote are being watched by international organizations.
The head of the observation mission of the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, Jan Petersen, told Euronews how the work of the observers is organized:
Approximately 100 teams have gone around the country to observe today the entire process, from the opening of polling stations to their closure, then the counting of votes and the preparation of protocols.
During the month, 10 of our teams worked in the country, which monitored the preparation for the vote, the work of the media, the observance of the law on the financing of election campaigns and the organization of the referendum.
Faye Dulgeri: "About 500 foreign observers are closely monitoring the voting.
Groups of observers record in detail what is happening and communicate with members of election commissions in order to then present them in the final report."
The translator compared the mentality of Russians and Germans
The mentality of the Russian and German peoples is different, but the few differences between them do not play a big role for mutual understanding.
This was announced on the International Day of the Interpreter, September 30, by a professional simultaneous interpreter Bärbel Saxe.
She has been engaged in translations from Russian and English for more than 30 years.
"Germans like to plan events calmly, and Russians, as the proverb says, "harness for a long time, but go fast."
But it seems to me that for mutual understanding between peoples and for the work of the translator, this does not play a significant role," the specialist said in a comment to RIA Novosti.
According to the translator, to understand that the two countries cannot do without each other, "it is enough to know history."
And in the future, Sachse noted, it makes no sense for Germany to ignore Russia.
Russia is a natural part of Europe, there is no point in trying to ignore it.
We need Russian gas, oil, there are many things that determine our common destiny," she said.
A day earlier, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that the country was trying to "establish relations" with Russia and maintain them.
According to her, the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which is being built from the coast of Russia to Germany along the bottom of the Baltic Sea, is especially important for Berlin.

The fundraiser opened on September 28 after Ganzi complained about low income.

The comedy "Evening School" headed the American box office
The comedy "Evening School", which debuted in American cinemas last Friday, earned $ 28 million for its first weekend at the box office.
This result allowed a simple picture with Kevin Hart and Tiffany Haddish in the lead roles to head the US box office for September 28-30.
In the international market, the film, so far released in only 20 countries, collected $ 5.5 million, including 2 million from British viewers.
In the struggle for the first line, the creation of Malcolm Lee, remarkably, quite noticeably ahead of another newcomer of the Western box office - the cartoon "Smallfoot", a curious story of the acquaintance of a charming Yeti with a representative of a human family, in the existence of which the main character never believed.
The project of directors Cary Kirkpatrick and Jason Reisig for its opening weekend collected $ 23 million, generally meeting the expectations of experts who predicted the film 20-25 million over the weekend.
As for the total fees of "Smallfoot", at the moment they amount to $ 38.6 million (while it debuted in 50 countries): the most active here was Mexico, which replenished the treasury of the film by 3.6 million.
The top three this time was closed by the children's fairy tale "The Secret of the House with a Clock" from the master of horror Eli Roth, which finally proved that the director knows how to make high-quality films for an audience of 12+.
For its second week at the box office, the film adaptation of John Bellers' book with the charming Jack Black with Cate Blanchett earned $ 12.5 million, bringing the total worldwide box office to 53.8 million.
Despite the relegation from the top 3, the thriller with Blake Lively and Anna Kendrick "A Simple Request" continues to surprise with a "+" sign: for 17 days at the American box office, Paul Feig's picture, from which some unrealistic financial achievements were not originally expected from the word "at all", collected $ 43 million (including 6.6 million for October 28-30) and right now has as much as 62.9 million in total revenue.
The last representative of the top five this week was the horror "The Curse of the Nun", which collected $ 5.4 million during the reporting period.
The spin-off "The Conjuring" at the end of 24 days in American (and not only, of course) cinemas has $ 330 million in total earnings on its account and recently proudly bears the title of the most successful film of the franchise, which also includes two parts of the "Conjuring" itself and two tapes about the creepy Annabelle doll.
Directly following the horror film by Corinne Hardy at the end of last weekend is another representative of the genre - the debutant of "Hellfest", one of the main youth horror films of the year.
In its first weekend, the brainchild of the famous editor (and recently director) Gregory Plotkin, who previously worked in a number of large horror projects, including "Happy Death Day", which "Hellfest" is very similar in places, earned $ 5.1 million in the United States.
Given the film's modest budget, the result is extremely positive.
The seventh were "Crazy Rich Asians" ($ 4.15 million), which, it seems, do not think to fall out of the top 10 of the American box office: the romantic comedy, which has been on the screens for the seventh week, at the end of September is the sixth in the ranking of the highest-grossing films of the genre in history with an indicator of 165.7 million.
This is the amount the picture has earned at the moment in the domestic market - the total revenue of the tape is 218.8 million.
As for the last three lucky ones who got into the top ten in the US box office for September 28-30, they were "Predator", "White Guy Rick" and ..." Crimson Mint", which earned $ 3.7 million, 2.38 million and 1.1 million, respectively, over the past weekend.
We add that next weekend in the United States will be in full swing to collect the long-awaited "Venom" with Tom Hardy, who - there is no doubt - without any problems will seize the leadership in the American box office at the end of the first weekend of October.
Of the other premieres of the coming week, it is worth highlighting the musical-melodrama "A Star is Born", the winner of the Venice Film Festival from Bradley Cooper, and the crime drama "Your Hatred".

Valery Belov: The Lord helped Siberia today
Head coach of Vityaz Valery Belov on the defeat against Sibir (3:4) in the KHL regular season match.
"My colleague spoke about the fans of Sibir, and I want to note our fans," Belov was quoted as saying by the official website of Vityaz.
"I hope they will also support, because now almost every game is a full stadium, a great atmosphere.
In terms of the game, probably, the Lord helped Siberia today, because they were very rudely mistaken, especially our leaders.
In general, our leading leaders lost the micro match 0-3, so it was difficult for us to pull this match out, although there were chances.
But, nevertheless, I will still take the blame on myself.
Because apparently they missed something in the preparation.
Compared to the last match, it was a different team."
"It's Ugly Nepotism"
Viewers are outraged by the choice of Agutin on the show "The Voice"
Viewers of the show "Voice 60+" accuse mentor Leonid Agutin of "ugly nepotism and brazen fraud."
When in blind auditions he recognized the voice of his father Nikolai Agutin from the first notes, many hoped that he would remain neutral and not turn to the performer.
But filial feelings took over, and he chose a relative to his team.
Then many considered it a joke, but forgave the mentor bias at the first stage.
But the "joke" dragged on, and the father of the star absolutely unjustifiably took the place of more worthy performers.
And now the audience is not ready to forgive Agutina for such injustice.
Yesterday, we, the viewers of the show, resented the nepotism of the ugly and frank dragging of our close relatives to the final staircase.
I even doubted that Agutin would have enough strength and conscience not to drag his father to the end at all to the first place, "said Irina Petrovskaya and Ksenia Larina in the program "Man from the TV".
Meanwhile, for the sake of his father, Leonid Agutin "leaked" beautiful performers who really sang, while Nikolai Petrovich whispered a touching song about his mother, explaining that the audience wants to continue to see his father in the show.
But, as it turned out, this is not at all the case, the audience wants an objective assessment and see really talented performers in the final, and now Agutin has discredited the show.
"I sympathize with the participants of the "Voice" from Agutin's team - they were doomed."
"Last time Agutin showed how much he loves dad, and today he had to show himself to be a professional."
"The contest has lost its meaning."
"Remove two talented people from the project and leave your dad in the project who does not sing but whispers, how can I call a mentor after that?",
"I like the way my father sings, organize a concert for him in the Kremlin for your money and see how many people come to this concert."
This is the "The Voice" show, not the "Tough Relatives" show.
"It was unprofessional on Agutin's part."
"Then you have to offer your dad to perform on your own show, not on a show that is done for Channel 1 money."
"It was a real chance for someone, and he took someone's place.
And I don't understand why a voiceless dad should make me understand more than any other participant with real vocal data.
Why was a worker from Surgut with a magnificent voice and timbre merged, and Agutin's father was brought to the final?
And then we all complain that on stage and from the screens the same faces for decades!
Because you can't break through nepotism!"
"What were you waiting for?
It's Russia!
All around blat and nepotism.
And the money in the family budget will not be superfluous!
The theatre of the absurd continues!"
Users also remembered that in one of the seasons of the traditional "The Voice", Gradsky's son came out at blind auditions.
Then it didn't even occur to me to take my son to his own team.
Moreover, he said: "Come on, get out of here, everything is clear."

Canada's Department of Defense has issued an order that allows military personnel to wear beards.
According to CBC, the bill contains instructions for the care of the beard.
It is noted that the military may be ordered to shave "for security reasons."
The beard of a military man can not be longer than 2 cm, it must also be neatly trimmed, and the neck and cheekbones - shaved.
At the same time, Navy employees were allowed to wear a beard only on land.
It is expected that the innovation "will increase morale in the army and attract more Canadians to the service."
The ban on wearing a beard has been in effect in the Canadian army since World War II.
Earlier it was reported that police in France were also allowed to wear beards and even have tattoos.
At the same time, a court in Egypt upheld the decision to suspend police officers who wear beards.

In Russia, they will begin to fine for violations in the field of shared construction
From tomorrow in Russia will begin to fine for violations in the field of shared construction, reports the channel "Russia 24".
Companies and officials face punishment if they do not transfer data on the house under construction to the Unified Information System for Housing Construction in time.
The innovation will help for those who decided to buy an apartment in a new building, but are afraid of the bankruptcy of the developer.
This was discussed at a conference in St. Petersburg for representatives of the construction industry.
Due to amendments to the law on shared construction, developers will have to fully borrow from the bank.
And many experts are already talking about a possible strong rise in price of apartments.
But as it turned out - not everyone agrees with this.
In the center of Kiev, a robber threatened a man with a knife, forcing him to withdraw money from an ATM.
The incident occurred on the evening of September 29 on Ivan Kudri Street, the capital's law enforcement officers reported.
According to the victim, an unknown person approached him and started a conversation, but then suddenly pulled out a knife and demanded to give him money and a mobile phone.
Since the victim did not have cash, the stranger ordered to withdraw money from the bank card.
After the attacker received 4 thousand hryvnias and a phone, he hit the victim and fled," the report said.
Law enforcers managed to detain the robber, it turned out to be a 25-year-old Kievan.
He now faces up to seven years in prison.
Also, the police are working on the version of the involvement of the attacker in other similar crimes.
Recall that on the eve of Odessa there were several resonant robberies of collectors.
In one case, armed robbers were caught with a drone.
The scientist spoke about the possible scientific program of the expedition of the Russian Federation to the Moon
The head of the Space Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences Anatoly Petrukovich told RIA Novosti about a possible scientific research program for Russian cosmonauts on the moon.
According to him, now the scientific community is engaged in the development of areas of such work.
"There is no consolidated opinion yet," the scientist emphasized.
He noted that one of the options is to place a low-frequency radio telescope on the far side of the Moon, which would avoid interference from the Earth.
"This is the only place where such a telescope can be deployed to study cosmic sources of radio emission," Petrukovich added.
He also believes that the moon could be used to conduct robotics tests, use local resources for construction.
In addition, astronauts should be involved in the search for primitive organic matter on the Earth's satellite, the scientist believes.
This could help determine how life appears on planets.
Earlier, the head of the Roscosmos Corporation said that in the optimistic version, the Russian Federation could carry out a manned flight to the moon by 2030.
Offended customer dumped a basket of feces in the store 7-Eleven
Damian Simms, a 41-year-old resident of St. Petersburg (Florida), as they say, "had a tooth" for the manager of a 7-Eleven convenience store: in May, he kicked him out of the store for inappropriate behavior.
And he decided to take revenge on his enemy in an original way.
At half past two in the morning, he entered the store and dumped the contents of the basket he had brought with him onto the floor and on some of the goods on the shelves.
In the basket were feces and urine, which Simms "borrowed" from a nearby mobile composting toilet.
Arriving at the scene, the police arrested the "avenger".
He was jailed and released pending trial on $300 bail.
He was charged with unlawfully invading someone else's property and a criminal offense, and was forbidden to enter the store and approach the manager.
Although Simms' crime looks more ridiculous than serious, the court sentence can be quite harsh, since he has repeatedly violated the law before: it includes theft on a large scale, robbery, illegal possession of weapons, drunk driving and cruelty to animals.

This was stated by US Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke.
Speaking at an industrial event in the American city of Pittsburgh, the head of the department said that for the Russian economy the only source of income is the sale of energy and Moscow is pursuing an active policy in the Middle East to sell oil and gas there, as it does in Europe, writes the Washington Examiner.

Sergey Sirotkin: I couldn't do anything, and it was very painful
Russian williams driver Sergey Sirotkin commented on the result of the Russian Grand Prix race.
"To be honest, I don't really want to talk about what's in my head.
I had a good start, and in the second corner I found myself between two cars that immediately squeezed me.
I lost all those positions that I played at the start, momentarily, immediately.
I was in a very bad position.
Stuck in traffic.
We were hoping that after the others stopped at the pit stop, we would get into the "clean air" and the pace would return, but the rubber was gone.
Plus I struggled with my partner, there was contact with him too.
As I understand it, he was a little mistaken.
We found ourselves in this situation on the most overtaking track of the season, there was nothing I could do and it was very painful, to be honest.
I don't want to talk about it anymore," RIA Novosti quoted Sirotkin as saying.
Recall that Sirotkin in the race at the Russian Grand Prix finished 18th, the winner was the British pilot of Mercedes Lewis Hamilton.
Tarpishev called absurd the removal of Glushakov and Yeshchenko from the basis of Spartak
President of the Russian Tennis Federation (RTF) Shamil Tarpishchev commented on the suspension of Spartak Moscow players Denis Glushakov and Andrei Yeshchenko from training with the first team after liking the criticism of the team's head coach Massimo Carrera, Sport Weekend reports.
Carrera's actions were absolutely absurd.
To pay attention to such things is nonsense.
I absolutely disagree with what Carrera is doing.
This only deepens the discord within the team.
Firstly, these are poems, you can read and perceive them in any way.
If I were Carrera, I wouldn't react to that.
Everyone has an opinion.
Second, everyone wants to get a good job.
If Glushakov and Yeshchenko put likes, it does not mean that they have something against the coach.
I think the Italian lacks the flexibility to perceive the situation.
And it doesn't serve the normal climate on the team.
Today Spartak does not have a game, so this situation did not need to be inflated at all.
Maybe we should have laughed at it together.
Spartak have a lot of things out of order in different lines, there is a lack of chemistry after the introduction to the youth team.
Relations within the team, apparently, do not add optimism before this match," Tarpishchev said.
The game of the two teams will be held on September 30 and will begin at 19.00 Moscow time.
Earlier, John Terry, who refused Spartak, headed the youth team of Chelsea.
Pupils of Sirius discussed nature-like technologies with scientists
Pupils of the educational center "Sirius" in Sochi, participants of the School of Agrobiology and Plant Genetics, attended a lecture by scientists of the national research center "Kurchatov Institute".
The researchers' speech took place as part of the program of the Global International Forum of Convergent and Nature-Like Technologies, organized in Sochi on behalf of Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to the website of the educational center on September 29.
The lecture was opened by the documentary film "Kurchatov Codes", during which the President of the Kurchatov Institute, Corresponding Member of the Russian Academy of Sciences Mikhail Kovalchuk spoke about global challenges as a driving force for the development of civilization.
The scientist's lecture was published on the Sirius website.
Schoolchildren learned that modern technologies need a huge amount of energy.
Alternative energy is not yet able to produce such volumes.
To solve this problem, according to the organizers of the forum, nature-like technologies, which young scientists are working on today, will help.
In addition, Kovalchuk raised the topic of responsibility for the development of nature-like technologies, and also spoke about the risks that inevitably arise when creating such technologies.
"The arrival of such technologies is a unique thing, it is a colossal boon.
This is the explosive growth of medical technologies, this is the improvement of the quality of life and infrastructure.
But there is a second side.
The development of nature-like technologies is actually a technological reproduction of wildlife systems.
There is a downside - purposeful intervention in human life.
There are always risks.
A car appeared - people began to die under the wheels.
But cars are still used.
The dual nature of technology at once.
I am creating a new medical technology, and at the same time I can create weapons of mass destruction," REN TV quoted the scientist as saying.
After watching the film and discussing modern scientific breakthroughs, schoolchildren were able to ask questions to the participants of the meeting.
The speakers were Yulia Dyakova, Candidate of Physical and Mathematical Sciences, Head of the Kurchatov Complex of NBICS-Nature-Like Technologies of the Kurchatov Institute Research Center and Vyacheslav Demin, Head of the Kurchatov Complex of NBICS Technologies.
The Sirius Educational Center in Sochi was created by the Talent and Success Educational Foundation on the basis of the Olympic infrastructure at the initiative of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The purpose of the educational center is the early identification, development and further professional support of gifted children.
Earlier in September, it was reported that the winners of the all-Russian online Olympiad in information security "Cyber Call" will be sent to study at Sirius.

Macedonia referendum failed due to low turnout
The referendum was designed to approve an agreement by authorities in Athens and Skopje to rename the Balkan country "North Macedonia."
Greece objected to the use by the Macedonians of the name of their historical province.
The renaming promised the former Yugoslav republic the opening of the way to NATO and later to the EU.
But, according to the EFE agency, only 34% of the turnout at Sunday's plebiscite "did not reach" the constitutional threshold of 50%.
However, since the referendum was only advisory in nature, it is possible that the authorities in Skopje will decide not to abandon the renaming.
Speaking shortly after the polls closed, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, a proponent of changing the name of the republic, said that if there were more "yes" votes cast, Macedonia would change its name, despite the unachieved quorum.

Kemerovo residents were outraged by a herd of sheep in the cemetery
On September 30, on the well-known Kemerovo page in the social network, a message appeared from an eyewitness that horned animals were freely walking around one of the local cemeteries.
Animals in a considerable herd walked between the fences and plucked the grass.
Commentators expressed different opinions: one of the locals noted that there is no harm in the presence of small cattle in the cemetery, and their appetite can even help in clearing the territory of weeds and grass thickets, but some of the residents of the city did not like the behavior of animals:
"These are graves, not pasture.
There's nothing for the rams to do there.
Of course, you can't say that they are blasphemous, but that's not the point." (style preserved) - the indignant Kemerovo woman noted in her message.
Anyway, one of the eyewitnesses noted that the problem in the form of animals in the middle of the cemetery is already known, and soon the necessary measures will be taken.
Pushing and leading - how right?
The word pressure doesn't exist.
That's right - to dominate.
The word "to press" in the sense of "to gravitate, to exert influence, to influence" exists only phonetically, because we hear the sound [a] instead of [o] in the word "to dominate".
We use this word, believing that it comes from the word "pressure".
But "pressure" and "pressure" are not only not close etymologically close, but even in some sense opposite.
See for yourself.
To dowlet (church-bookish, obsolete) means "enough, full, enough, to be sufficient for someone or something, to satisfy."
Contentment, pleasure are related words.
Previously, it still had the meaning "not to depend on anything, to have a self-sufficient meaning" - "to dominate yourself."
Old Church Slavonic "dovylti" is related to the words "to command" and "will".
Pushing, suppressing is completely different.
These words have truly frightening "relatives": daos - "wolf" (crushing sheep), deyja - "to die" and dvaidī - "to oppress".
The similar phonetic appearance of the words "pressure" and "dominate", as well as the inevitable obsolescence of the latter, forced them to enter into contamination.
So we have this very "d[a]fly", which is also used in writing through the "a", which, in a good way, is wrong and impossible from the point of view of the processes of origin and development of these words.
So, that's right - to dominate.
But this word is outdated, in its correct meaning no longer used.
If you want to point out that any circumstances/people are having a negative impact on you from above, use the word "push".
You can also use the "exert pressure" design, but remember that this is clerical.

But the behaviour of our car was the best since the beginning of the weekend."
"During qualifying, you were not inferior in speed to Sebastian Vettel, but in the end the gap was still noticeable.
Why?"
"My attempt went well, but then one of the Mercedes drivers was in front.
He was preparing to try and still managed to let me pass, but it looks like I lost some time on it.
However, it is unlikely that this greatly affected the result. "
"It's very difficult to overtake in Sochi, will the start of the race be a key moment?"
"Probably, yes, but you never know how things will turn out.
It will not be easy in any case, because our car is noticeably slower than mercedes cars."

And one morning, a cute sticker appeared on the pole with a photo of a green bike and the inscription: "Just for him."
There was no limit to the delights of mother and baby.
Christie thanked the honorable well-wisher and praised him for an interesting and fresh idea.

"This is the World we need!"
Readers asked the journalist, if suddenly she still manages to find out who was the author of this idea, to tell about it.
After all, this man, apparently, is somewhere nearby: he has repeatedly watched how the baby parks, since this came to his mind.

In Kurgan, bailiffs demanded that a long-dead woman pay a state duty of 200 rubles.
This is reported by the "Ural Meridian".
In mid-September, relatives of the late Maria Mitrofanovna Slepneva received a letter from the Kurgan Department of Bailiffs, in which it was reported that enforcement proceedings had been initiated against the 105-year-old woman.

Vucic upheld the highest level of combat readiness of the Serbian army
Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic ordered to leave in force the highest level of combat readiness, in which the Armed Forces of the country were brought because of the situation in the north of the autonomous province of Kosovo and Metohija.

Numerous migrant communities and anti-racism organizations had sent an open letter to the Minister demanding his resignation.
with the help of an operation in Syria, Russia protected itself from terrorists
During the three years of the Russian military operation in Syria, about 100,000 terrorists were killed, of which 85,000 terrorists were destroyed by the Aerospace Forces of the Russian Federation.
This was told in connection with the third anniversary of the beginning of the Russian military operation in Syria, the former commander-in-chief of the Aerospace Forces, the head of the Federation Council Committee on Defense and Security Viktor Bondarev.
He noted the high accuracy of the use of weapons from the air: the Aerospace Forces have inflicted and continue to inflict all strikes exactly on terrorist targets.
According to Bondarev, tens of thousands of terrorist facilities have been destroyed in Syria in three years - we are talking, for example, about ammunition depots, fortified areas and headquarters.
With the help of Russian airstrikes, the jihadists' defenses were hacked - this was a decisive contribution to the advance of the Syrian government troops, Interfax reports.
At the same time, according to Bondarev, the operation of our military in Syria made it possible to protect Russia itself from terrorists, many of whom had Russian passports.
At the beginning of the operation in Syria, more than two-thirds of the territory of the Arab Republic was under the control of terrorist groups, including the Islamic State (IG, banned in Russia) and Jabhat al-Nusra (banned in Russia).
According to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, about four thousand militants from among Russian citizens and about five thousand citizens of post-Soviet countries fought on the side of isIS, TASS reports.
And we are talking only about recorded persons, not counting those who have not been identified, Bondarev emphasized.
Most of them were trained and ready to take up arms at any time, and Russian passports gave them the right to freely enter the territory of our country.
Thus, Bondarev noted, in Syria, Russia is fighting international terrorism on distant borders - otherwise this evil "would pour over to us."

Syria accused the United States of supporting terrorism
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem accused the United States and its partners of war crimes in Syria and support for terrorism.
The [Western] coalition has completely destroyed the Syrian city of Raqqa, it has destroyed infrastructure and public services in the areas against which its actions were directed, it has committed massacres of civilians, including children and women.
These killings are war crimes under international law," he said.
According to Muallem, the United States and its partners provided "direct support to terrorists," since the goals of the militants and the Western coalition in Syria coincided and implied "sowing chaos, death and destruction in their path."
The Foreign Minister also noted that the fight against terrorists in Syria is almost complete, and the country has become safer and more stable.
Muallem added that Damascus also intends to cleanse Syria of illegal foreign presence, and priority in the reconstruction of the country will be given to Syrian partners.
In September, the head of the Russian Center for Reconciliation of the warring parties in the republic, Lieutenant General Vladimir Savchenko, said that two American F-15 aircraft struck the Syrian province of Deir ez-Zor with banned phosphorus munitions.
The U.S. has denied all the allegations.
President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko believes that respecting the sovereignty of other states, Ukraine has the right to demand the same respect for its own sovereignty.
The head of state said this during a trip to the Kharkiv region, commenting on the issuance of its passports by Hungary in Transcarpathia.
Protecting Ukrainian citizens, I defend the sovereignty of our state.
Just as we respect the sovereignty of other states, we demand the same respect for Ukraine," Poroshenko said.
According to Poroshenko, he, as president, will protect Ukrainian citizens, wherever they are - in the east or in the west of the country.
At the same time, the head of state supported the position of the Foreign Ministry in the passport scandal with Hungary, which consists in the intention to expel the consul of this country from Berehove.
"I fully share every letter that was said by the Foreign Ministry," the President said.
As reported by "FACTS", on September 19, a video appeared on the network, which recorded the moment of issuance of Hungarian passports to citizens of Ukraine at the Hungarian consulate in Berehove.
At the same time, they took an oath of allegiance to Hungary aloud.
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin noted that the Consul of Hungary, who appears on the video with the distribution of Hungarian passports to Ukrainians, must leave the territory of Ukraine either by the decision of Budapest itself, or will be expelled by Kiev.
It also became known that the prosecutor's office of the Transcarpathian region opened a criminal case on the issuance of Hungarian passports.
The incident was qualified under the article "Treason".
Putin secretly flew to Siberia
It is known that Vladimir Putin spent the last two days in Dushanbe, where he took part in the work of the Council of CIS States, and also held a number of bilateral meetings with the presidents of neighboring countries.
Data on the flights of the Russian "board No. 1" on the Flightradar website indicate that at about 6 p.m. Tajik time on September 28, the Il-96-300 took off from Dushanbe airport and headed northeast.
In the area of Lake Balkhash, the transponder of the aircraft was turned off.
The direction of his flight suggests that the liner could fly to Khakassia.
According to the Baikal24 agency, the president in Abakan on the night of September 29 was personally met by the head of the region Viktor Zimin.
According to unofficial information, Putin flew to the republic to spend the weekend, but the sources of the site believe that the true reason is the "problem of the second round."
Next Sunday, the second round of elections for the head of the region should be held in Khakassia.
Valentin Konovalov (CPRF) and the current head of the republic, Viktor Zimin (United Russia), entered it.
However, on September 21, Zimin withdrew his candidacy.
Andrei Filyagin ("Fair Russia") should take part in the upcoming tour together with Konovalov.
Khakass media suggest that Putin may accept the resignation of the head of Khakassia and appoint a new acting head of the republic, as well as make a decision on the fate of Zimin.
Putin already visited Khakassia in January this year.
Along with Tuva, this republic is one of the president's favorite places for recreation.
More than 10 million Syrians have become refugees since the beginning of the armed conflict that has been going on in Syria for seven years.
About five million people have fled to other countries, most notably neighboring Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan.
Now, according to Damascus, hostilities are nearing completion, and the country is ready for the voluntary return of refugees.
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem said, speaking at the UN: "The situation on the ground has now become more stable and secure thanks to the successes achieved in the fight against terrorism.
The Government continues to rebuild the areas destroyed by the terrorists, bringing them back to normal life.
All conditions have been created for the voluntary return of Syrian refugees to the country that they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic sanctions, which have complicated people's lives and deprived them of their livelihoods.
The Syrian authorities also called on the international community to facilitate the return of refugees and to allocate funds for this purpose.
Meanwhile, the United States and the European Union refuse to provide assistance to Syria, saying that first of all a political solution to the conflict must be found.
Volkswagen fully admitted its guilt in the "dieselgate" in January 2017.
In December last year, Oliver Schmidt, one of the managers of the American division of the company, was sentenced to seven years in prison.
The Group's losses are estimated at at least 25 billion euros.
This amount includes not only fines and compensation.
Until June next year, the automaker is obliged to buy or fix 85% of the cars involved in the scandal.
In February, the company's management said that the obligations have already been fulfilled in respect of 83% of cars, so the program will be completed ahead of schedule.
"Volkswagen" is trying in full swing to compensate for losses and regain the trust of customers.
Thus, recently the management of the concern has changed again, and a large-scale restructuring and fundamental changes in the management system have been announced.
Moreover, Volkswagen promises to buy even new cars if German cities ban diesels on their streets: such a right of power was received in February this year.

Metropolitan Hilarion compared Kiev's decision to rename the UOC with the actions of the fascists
The head of the Synodal Department for External Church Relations of the Russian Orthodox Church, Metropolitan Hilarion, compared the renaming of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate to the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of the fascists against the Jews.
"It's like putting a yellow pointed star on a Jew in Fascist Germany, it means marking the Church as an enemy organization, and it is for this purpose that this bill was created," the metropolitan said on the Rossiya-24 TV channel (quoted by Interfax).
In his opinion, this step will have the most serious consequences right now, when the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is in an acute stage.
Kiev thus hopes to gain full control over the UOC and "outlaw it," the cleric believes.
"This is the Ukrainian church, and the believers of this church consider themselves Ukrainians, they are patriots of their country," he added.
Earlier it became known that the deputies of the Verkhovna Rada are working on the implementation of bills No. 4128 (on changing the subordination of religious communities), No. 4511 (on the special status of religious organizations) and No. 5309 (on changing the name of religious organizations).
The latter involves renaming the UOC of the Moscow Patriarchate.
Viceroy of the Pochayiv Lavra called for the protection of Orthodoxy and Ukrainian shrines
The Vicar of the Holy Dormition Pochayiv Lavra, Metropolitan Vladimir, called for the protection of the Orthodox faith and Ukrainian shrines.
The text of his address to the faithful of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC) was published on Saturday on the monastery's website.
At different times in history, our predecessors and Christians who were close in faith and spirit had to confess their faith and defend their shrines.
Given the situation that has developed, and according to the information that we have, and according to the death threats that are spreading, it is clear that we will have to go through something," the metropolitan said.
He asked for support – prayerful, moral.
Also, the viceroy of the Lavra stressed that, probably, "your physical presence will be needed."
The cleric added: "Lenin's grandchildren - in spirit, threaten reprisals, and therefore we will protect our shrine."
Those who are not indifferent to the fate of the Pochayiv Lavra - an Orthodox Ukrainian and world shrine, should be ready to protect it, the appeal says.
The Metropolitan urged not to follow the lead of those who mislead believers.
The UOC has the canonical status defined by the Tomos of October 29, 1990 from the Mother Church.
And now someone wants to make the Catholic Pope Bartholomew dependent on the Patriarch and friend.
The new style with its consequences is unacceptable to us Orthodox Christians.
And we are satisfied with the status that our church has," the viceroy of the Lavra said.
He recalled that since October 1990, the UOC has been canonically independent and completely independent in its management.
There is no administrative and financial accountability of the Moscow Patriarchate.
In fact, our church already has a Tomos.
What other Tomos do we need?" said Metropolitan Vladimir of Pochayiv, urging believers and all citizens to ask themselves whether other denominations have a Tomos, whether they are independent of the Vatican.
Believers to some extent figured out and decided which temple they should go to.
However, someone wants to sow enmity and discord again.
Some people are jealous that the domes on the temples that they want to destroy shine," the priest stressed.
Pochayiv Lavra is the largest temple complex and monastery in Western Ukraine.
The Lavra is located on the top of pochayivska Mountain, 70 kilometers from Ternopil.
The first historical information about it dates back to the beginning of the XIII century.

Cling to every word, live in a normal, ordinary family," @nataliamama37 wrote.
There were also those who advised Buzova to turn to psychologists or at least read books on this topic.
"Maybe you should read the literature on psychology?
What should be done so as not to writhe the victim out of himself?" the @liashukgalina wrote.
However, there were those who supported the singer.
"Olga, you, most importantly, do not be upset.
Your person will not say big words to the whole country and then simply do not fulfill them," @arina_prostyle supported Buzova.
"You're a queen and you need a king, and whoever traded you for papers just doesn't deserve you.
Nose up and move on," @kreszentia_f wrote.
Earlier, Nazarov explained his decision to take 2 million rubles and abandon Buzova by the fact that the singer has no sympathy for him.
He decided to send all the money to charity.
If we continue to play correctly as well, the victories will come.
Dynamo Moscow head coach Vladimir Vorobyov on the defeat to Avtomobilist (0-1) in the KHL regular season match.
"It was a good game, interesting, although it went to the goal," Vorobyov was quoted as saying by Avtomobilist's official website.
"We tried to play very simply.
I really liked the first period.
We didn't use a few good moments.
In the second period, the opponent squeezed us a little, we persevered.
But the removals "fed us" a bit.
The guys played great, followed the coaching setup.
I think if we continue to play the right way, the victories will come.
We didn't score, games aren't won with zero goals, but the content of the game was right.
Luck will come if we keep playing in that direction."
"In your opinion, has Avtomobilist improved compared to the meeting in Nizhny Novgorod?"
"There was no foreign unit playing then.
In the preseason, the teams solved other problems, a lot of young guys played.
I think there was a completely different game, a different hockey.
Avtomobilist is a good good team.
According to the standings, it is clear that the team plays correctly.
Good hockey, good atmosphere both in the arena and in the city.
You can only wish them luck.
The team is moving in the right direction.
A lot of good players, there are leaders.
Solid defense, good goalkeeper.
It was hard, we were preparing.
We knew that the team was going undefeated, we wanted to reverse it, but it didn't work out."

The main Macedonian oppositionist refused to vote in the referendum
In Macedonia, on Sunday, September 30, a referendum is held on the issue of an intergovernmental agreement with Greece on the renaming of the Republic of Macedonia.
Citizens are asked to answer one question: "Do you support membership in the EU and NATO by accepting the agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Hellenic Republic?"
Nevertheless, the leader of the leading opposition party, the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization - Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity (VMRO-DPMNE), Christian Mitskoski, said that he would not vote in the referendum.
As explained by the press secretary of the party Naum Stoilkovsky, Mickoski decided to abstain from the vote in order to express his disagreement with the treaty, which he considers "harmful".
According to the spokesman, the current referendum decides on the renaming of the country and nothing more, while the strategic goal of the party is to achieve membership in NATO and the EU.
A week ago, Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov also refused to participate in the referendum on September 30.
He explained that he chose the name for the country 27 years ago in a referendum on independence. The Macedonian leader considers the renaming of the country a negative factor.
"A new semi-sovereign state with a new name is being created," Ivanov said.
The agreement on the new official name of the former Yugoslav republic - the Republic of North Macedonia - was signed by the foreign ministers of Macedonia and Greece on June 17 this year during a solemn ceremony on the shores of Lake Prespa, along which the border between the two countries passes.
This agreement should resolve the long-standing dispute over the name of the country, as well as Skopje's path to NATO and the EU, reminds TASS.

In order to monitor the provision of assistance, the European Commission sent its experts to the region.
As noted, the funds will be used for disinfection, as well as providing the victims with food, water, temporary shelters and medicines.

The United States is satisfied with the growth of opiate production in Afghanistan
The sharp aggravation of the situation in Afghanistan on September 26 was much discussed in Tehran.
There were multilateral consultations with the participation of Iran, India, China, Afghanistan and Russia, which was represented by the Secretary of the Security Council Nikolai Patrushev.
In fact, on Afghan territory, militants unleashed a real terrorist war against state authorities and the civilian population of the country.
This year has become a record for the number of bloody terrorist attacks, as a result of which thousands of ordinary Afghans were killed," Patrushev said.
Afghanistan's woes did not begin yesterday.
After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the main enemy of the United States was declared the terrorist group "Al-Qaeda" (banned in the Russian Federation), settled in Afghanistan.
Less than a month later, America and nato allies launched Operation Enduring Freedom there.
It's been 17 years.
Thousands of American troops are still on Afghan soil.
And peaceful life is even more illusory than it was then.
American troops are driven behind the fences of dozens of their bases.
As they can, they pay off the militants for money - just so that they are not touched.
The Afghan government controls a smaller part of the country's territory - 40 percent, according to Patrushev.
50% - from the movement "Taliban" (banned in the Russian Federation).
Another 10% - for ISIS terrorists (banned in the Russian Federation).
But they're growing fast there.
The goal is to create a barbaric pseudo-caliphate in Central Asia - exactly the one that did not work out for them in Iraq and Syria.
America, apparently, is satisfied with this.
It is also satisfying that over the 17 years of the American presence, the production of drugs (opiates) in Afghanistan has increased at least 40 times.
Colossal growth in the area planted with opium poppy and multibillion-dollar profits.
Macedonians are preparing to vote in a referendum on joining the EU and NATO, subject to a change in the name of the country.
The agreement to rename the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to the Republic of North Macedonia was reached on June 17 as the result of long negotiations with neighboring Greece, which refused to recognize the right of its northern neighbor to be called Macedonia, seeing in such a name an attempt on the Greek province of the same name and Greek history.
Lyupko Petkovski, political scientist: "Thanks to this agreement, Macedonia or North Macedonia gets the right to a better future, hope for social change.
And Greece will consolidate the right to its past.
There are no perfect agreements.
They arise as a result of difficult compromises that cannot make absolutely everyone happy."
The renaming of the country is advocated by the ruling Social Democrats, led by Prime Minister Zoran Zaev.
Against - the conservative opposition and the country's President Gheorghe Ivanov.
According to journalist Tsvetin Chilimanov, it makes no sense for Macedonia to join the EU - it is enough to have a partnership with it: "Many of those who do not like the agreement believe that the current socialist government led by Zaev was imposed from the outside in order to change the name of the country.
But this decision will entail negative consequences.
First of all, the loss of sovereignty.
Obviously, there are countries that would not like Macedonia to remain one of the sovereign countries in the Balkans."
Fei Dulgeri, Euronews: "The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia faces the biggest challenge in its history.
The country was at a crossroads.
The choice that the citizens of Macedonia will make will determine the future not only of the Balkans, but also of Europe as a whole."
