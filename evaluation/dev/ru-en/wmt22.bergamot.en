From my point of view, the program on literature was formed by ladies of Balzac age on the basis of their interests.
From 19th-century Russian literature, we preferred Danilevsky and Volkonsky.
They wrote fiction, of course, from the point of view of those very ladies of Balsakov's age.
And the psychology and torment of the heroines of Tolstoy and Turgenev for teenagers are not so interesting.
Teenagers are rarely interested in the psychology of heroes.
Thank you very much, very interesting.

I remember with horror these feasts and guests in the parents' house.
Guests on the doorstep, and on the stove more cutlets are roasted, mother is baked up the floor.
God, I'm on my way to the table without strength.
And then the utlicens with an exchange, clean the house.
A week before the holiday, you drag food, cook two days, the day of cleaning after.
And the guests what?
They are good, and the cake is with you.
I don't like the holidays since then.
Even for my family, I set a table at a minimum.
And I cook them delicious, punching very often for nothing.
Germany: Fourth Coronavirus Vaccines Are Imminent
The fourth vaccination will be required in the summer or autumn of 2022.
According to the expert, the current vaccination in Germany will not be final, but will continue with renewed force.
Despite an active vaccination campaign in Germany, not two, no three doses of the coronavirus vaccine, it will probably not be enough to fully protect.
The head of the Association of General Practitioners Ulrich Weigeldt is convinced of this.
On Saturday, December 11, reports Die Welt.
"We expect the fourth vaccination to be required in the summer, at the latest in the autumn," the expert said.
In addition, Wigeldt hopes that the fourth vaccination against coronavirus can be carried out "in combination with influenza vaccination."
This will help to achieve the best results.
In addition, increased vaccination can help in the fight against the spread of the new strain of the coronavirus "Omicron."
The new option is particularly dangerous.
So, the probability of re-infection "Omicron" is three times higher than that of strains Delta or Beta.
This is evidenced by the results of a preliminary study conducted in South Africa.
Based on this, manufacturers of BioNTech / Pfizer plan to provide a vaccine adapted for Omikron by March 2022.
The companies emphasize that the two doses of the vaccine do not provide sufficient protection against infection with a new variant of the coronavirus "Omicron."
A study by BioNTech and Pfizer found that at two doses of the vaccine, the efficacy is significantly lower: "the neutralizing potential is reduced by more than 25 times."
"This indicates that two doses of BNT1622 do not provide sufficient protection against omicron-sum infection," said BioNTech and Pfizer.
A third dose is therefore needed.
Experts insist on accelerating the rate of vaccination in the country.
For example, Bernd Salzberger, chairman of the German Society of Infectious Diseases, advocates a reduction in the interval between the second and third vaccinations.
Moreover, according to Salberger, accelerated vaccination will affect the spread of both the delta virus and the omicron-variance of the coronavirus.
"Israel's experience is very convincing to show this," the expert said.
Pontoon21, Bet-A Vib, 54 Silent, 54 mm, 8,5 g.
The Bet-A-Vib series is a special branch of Bet-A families from Pontoon21.
It (as well as the Kalikana Vib series) differs from many other Vibs in that it was originally created taking into account the use for ice fishing, and not just for fishing.
These vibs have a greater weight than those close in size of analogues, which undoubtedly has a positive effect on the nuances of the use of these interesting lures.
Another recognizable feature is the top fin made of durable and elastic plastic, creating additional shades of vibration in vertical and horizontal wiring.
As a "winter viba" when caught in the pendant Bet-A-Vib demonstrates a rather aggressive game.
Often the most catchy is simple monotonous animation, that is, the movement of the uddle up-down almost without pause.
When planning, the deviation from the vertical axis is not very great, which is convenient when fishing in a limited space, littered underwater vegetation, bayas and other obstacles for which a hook is possible.
In addition, a slight deviation is relevant when catching a pikeperch and a large perch in the winter, and especially in the middle of winter, when you need a point and aggressive supply of bait.
Having reached the extreme point of the trajectory, Bet-A-Vib instantly unfolds and returns to the original vertical.
No less successfully, Bet-A-Vib is also used for winter fishing of pond trout.
To please her whims, you can choose from two modifications: with or without a noise capsule (NS - NanoSound).
It was also noted that Bet-A-Vib with a plumbing game is able to tease a passive pike that does not react even to a lively.
When catching the zass Bet-A-Vib demonstrates the range and accuracy.
This wobbler is understandable and not capricious, well combined with a fishing line and braided cords of even large diameters.
For catching the pike, pike, chersha or perch in addition to uniform relevant and "step," sometimes with a "chirk" on the bottom.
If you catch in hindsed places, you can change the front tee to a double, which will reduce the probability of hooks.
Among the baits of their class Bet-A-Vib are among the most resistant in work and, as a result, one of the most catchy.
With the same success can be used both on relatively small and in rather deep areas.
All models are equipped with hooks Owner ST-36.

According to the media, the "Wagners" allegedly fought in Donbass, Syria, Mozambique, Sudan and the Central African Republic.
This group is not listed either in the law enforcement agencies or in the register of legal entities, and its fighters are absent from the form lists of personnel.
This company is under U.S. sanctions.

Against this background, the Libyan High Electoral Commission has postponed indefinitely the announcement of the final list of candidates, Sky News Arabia reports.
Foreign policy through the eyes of Russians
38% of Russians see more success in the country's foreign policy than failures, 29% believe that failures prevail.
"An example of success - "were protected in Syria, restored peace there," "the decision on Nord Stream 2," "the world was intimidated that the cool weapons," "We squeezed away."
The main setbacks are "conflict with Ukraine," "conference with Western countries," "isolation from the world," - stated in the study of the Fund "Public opinion."

Pulmonologist Puryasev suggested that people with weak immunity are able to easily tolerate a strain of "ocmiron"
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity can tolerate it more easily than those who have a strong protective reaction of the body
Pulmonologist Sergey Puryasev explained why the strain of coronavirus "ocmiron" can be dangerous.
The reason should be sought in the conditions of the birth of the virus.
Scientists believe that "ocmyron" originated in the body of an infected HIV or suffering from immunodeficiency.
That is, during the mutation, he did not encounter any resistance from immunity.
Because of this, it is more aggressive.
Due to the fact that there was no response from immunity, it became very fast.
Apparently, there he has these spike-proteins, spikes, there may be more than they should be, their antibodies were not cut during mutations, - commented pulmonologist Sergey Puryasev.
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity can tolerate "ocmiron" easier than those who have a strong protective reaction of the body.
It turns out that the body's strong response to anything, to any infection, is not always good.
In such cases, the body can kill itself.
So this happens in pneumococcal infections, when young people are killed 30-year-olds, and the old 60-year-olds in the form of sneezing it.
The immune response is frantic in the young man, he is completely inadequate: where it was possible to only threaten with a finger, he beats, like a gun on sparrows, - concluded Sergey Puryasev.
The doctor also reminded that the coronavirus has dangerous side effects and the most unpleasant of them is pneumonia.
Inflammation of the lungs is bacterial and viral.
If the first is treated very successfully and quickly, in the second case you can often stop only the symptoms - all the hope for the body.
The first sign of developing pneumonia will be the beginning of intoxication of the body - this is the temperature, weakness, malaise.
Then there are respiratory symptoms: difficulty breathing, sore throat, coughing.
Pain on the right or left, abdominal pain can also indicate a developing problem.
Meanwhile, in Russia by the end of the year can begin to vaccinate the younger generation from 12 to 18 years.
Virusologist, head of the laboratory of genomic engineering MIPT Pavel Volchkov noted that this category is very actively affected by kovid.
Teenagers who go to school, the number of contacts as much as possible.
This is the most socially active interlayer, as well as pupils of kindergartens, - said "Moscow 24" Pavel Volchkov, virologist, head of the laboratory of genomic engineering MIPT.
Great thanks to the author for this article.
I'd love to refresh memories...
Teath-In.
In those distant seventies-eight and eightieth, no dance floor did not do without the melodies of this group.
And at home, going with friends, they arranged dances to their music.
Immunologists hypothesized why people with obesity become victims of kovid
The authors studied the adipose tissue left over from bariatric surgery and found that fat cells known as adipocytes could be infected with coronavirus.
The immune cells located in adipose tissue, macrophages, also became infected, and showed a strong inflammatory reaction.
The researchers also investigated the adipose tissue of patients who died from kovid and found particles of coronavirus in fat surrounding various organs.
It is known that HIV and influenza viruses can hide in adipose tissue, using it as a reservoir, in an attempt to avoid the immune system's response.
Probably capable of this and SARS-CoV-2.
Biologist told about the causes of dementia
Candidate of Biological Sciences Semyon Goloshykin called the causes of dementia and spoke about the ways of its prevention in an interview with radio Sputnik.
According to the WHO, more than 55 million people suffer from the disease.
The syndrome manifests itself in the gradual loss of cognitive functions - over time, a person has difficulty oriented even in a familiar environment.
Goloshykin noted that most often neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders and lack of certain vitamins lead to dementia.
Some factors increase the risk of the disease.
These include hypertension, diabetes, elevated cholesterol, obesity, depression and alcoholism.
At the behavioral level, the role of factors such as social isolation and the lack of active cognitive activity is possible," he said.
Dementia is also affected by harmful habits - smoking, alcohol abuse, sleep disorders and sedentary lifestyle.
Among the first signs, the expert noted the forgetfulness, inability to concentrate and reduce the level of abstract thinking.
"It is debated that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and one of the risk factors for its occurrence," the biologist added.
To prevent the onset of the disease, WHO recommends maintaining the necessary level of physical load, training cognitive skills and abilities that require memory and logic.
Previously, Professor of the Department of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Medical Genetics, PHSAEI of the Russian National University.
N.I. Pirogova, head of the Department of cognitive impairment of the Federal Center of the brain and neurotechnology Anna Bogolepova spoke about the causes of memory problems.
Egypt has returned about 30,000. Illegally removed artifacts
Over the past 10 years, the Cairo government has managed to return about 30,000 to their homeland. artifacts that were smuggled out of the country.
This was reported on Saturday, December 11, on the Al-Hayat TV channel, the chief inspector of the Department of returned antiquities of the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities of Egypt Shaaban Abdel Gaouad.
Since 2011, the Egyptian state has managed to return 29,300 artifacts.
Only this year, 5,300 monuments of ancient Egyptian civilization were found at the Bible Museum in Washington," he said.
Abdel Gaud said that all smuggled artifacts are registered in the archives.
The department's staff are now working to return them to Egypt.
In particular, experts "track auctions around the world and sales on the Internet" through foreign and Egyptian sites, as well as social networks.
The chief inspector said that on their return, cultural property is restored and then exhibited in museums.
According to him, one of the returned artifacts was the ancient skeleton of a man found in Belgium, which is now part of the exposition of the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, the Egyptian authorities appealed to Interpol with a request to help find a bust of the pharaoh Tutankhamun, sold at an auction in London.
The auction house Christie's held auctions on July 4, at which a bust of over 3,000. It was sold for $5.97 million (about 680 million rubles).
This caused dissatisfaction from Egypt.
The Egyptian side also claims that the art object was illegally removed in the 1970s from the Karnak temple in Luxor.
The head of Tutankhamun, depicted in the image of the sun god Amun, was kept in a private collection and has not been put up for auction since 1985.
How the relic got to Europe is unknown.
In recent years, Egypt has been actively seeking the repatriation of illegally exported from the country at different times of antiquity.
According to the authorities, 95% of smuggling antiquities are the result of archaeological research of "black diggers."
"The Crimean Tatars are not taken into account" - and this is correct, since the Crimean Tatars (232 thousand) - this is an independent people (close to the Turks).
If you want to add, then only 42 thousand people - so many Tatars (Kazans) live in the Crimea (see. the Census).
The Crimean Tatars are a separate people, and the name of this people consists of two words!
They are united only by the Turkic language group.
FT: Credit Suisse wants to access personal mobile devices employees
Credit Suisse requires its employees to provide the bank with access to their personal mobile devices, writes the Financial Times.
The fact is that in Europe and the United States, the Swiss bank does not issue to its employees corporate communication devices, instead offering a discount on the purchase of a mobile phone or smartphone from a partner - a telecommunications operator.
Under the current rules, the bank can view information on corporate devices issued to its employees, as they are used to solve business issues with colleagues or customers.
The bank enjoys the right to verify mobile devices in extreme cases - for example, if an employee used it to meet a client who was not approved by Credit Suisse.
Now, after many employees switched to remote mode of operation, the bank wants to extend this rule to all devices that were used to solve work issues.
According to the newspaper, the bank's management has set a deadline, before which employees can get acquainted with the new rule.
Officially, Credit Suisse does not comment on the new requirement.

Part 4
The last year of Sergey Yesenin's life - 1925 - was fruitful in terms of creativity, but the most difficult for the earthly existence of the poet and his "ego."
He is already outside of any literary associations, chilled with imaginism, he himself, but is known, in demand, at times strongly scolded by critics, even maliciously, but the reader is ready to carry it in his arms.
Over the year, more than 60 poems were written, many of them are real masterpieces, the cycle "Persian motifs" was completed, the poem "Anna Snegina" was written, 8 books were published, the collection "Russia Soviet."
And the main success - at the end of June 25 of the year, the State of Civil Affairs concluded an agreement with Yesenin for the publication of his works in 3 volumes.
None of the modern poets of such honor were not awarded such honor, he is the first!
In addition, it made very good money - under the contract, the fee was 1000 rubles per month for 20 months (the director of the plant, for example, received 300 rubles. per month, engineer - 200).
The money was needed that year more than ever.
Yesenin married the granddaughter of Leo Tolstoy Sophia Tolstoy, it was necessary to arrange the family life, to keep the sisters Katya and Sasha, as well as his mother.
It seems that life has been established, there is something to rejoice, but for him everything is painted mainly in dark tones, as if the nightmare of the poem "Black Man" (written in November 1925 and published after the death of Yesenin):
My friend, my friend,
I am very, very sick.
I don't know where that pain came from.
Is the wind whistling?
Over an empty and deserted field,
It's like a grove in September,
It's darkening the brains of alcohol.
Many acquaintances noted that Yesenin has passed strongly, looks bad, clearly sick.
Increasingly, hiccups, nervous breakdowns are repeated.
And the reason is probably not just in alcoholism...
However, if such a diagnosis - alcoholism - Sergei Alexandrovich was put by someone, there are no reliable documents left.
For example, dating back to May 1923, when Yesenin, at the insistence of his fourth wife, American women Aisadora Duncan corrected health in the clinic near Paris with Professor Peter Gannushkin (again to him will get two years later, already in Moscow).
But the testimonies of the poet, scandals on this ground, the drives to the police abound - they are scattered into dozens of memoirs.
Since the beginning of the 20s, the poet's terrible romance with the green serpent has developed rapidly.
At the end of the summer of 1923, Yesenin for a short time settled with a friend, imaginista Ivan Startsev.
Surprisingly, with his very good income, he never had his own housing either in Moscow or in St. Petersburg, he was found in rented apartments, hotels or acquaintances.
The elders recalls:
"I came only to spend the night, and in most cases in a sane, drunken state.
One day, returning at four o'clock in the morning, Yesenin fell on the staircase...
Falling, scratching his face and hoarse.
Having recovered a little, he began to cough continuously, spraying all the sheet with blood.
And Yesenin himself after a voyage in Europe and in the United States (there was a dry law in the United States, but Duncan took a decent supply of alcohol with her) admitted:
"I have not seen anything there, except for the zucchini and the streets.
At the end, I stopped remembering people.
Well, I drank, of course...
And I drank because the longing bite."

According to Yablonsky, the sanctions against Belarus temporarily "stopped Lukashenko," but he "is engaged in an active search for new ways."
The Polish official is also sure that now illegal migrants will be used as weapons "in many parts of the world."
As the website kp.ru wrote, earlier the European Union introduced the fifth package of sanctions against Belarus.
It affected 17 individuals and 11 organizations.
In Europe, they said they were ready to continue to expand restrictive measures against the republic, "unless the situation in the country improves."
In response, Minsk imposed a food embargo on a wide range of goods from countries that had previously decided to impose sanctions against Belarus.

"Not on the crown": when a velvet jacket makes a man a laughingstock
At the 2021 secular events, velvet jackets dominated.
Perhaps the first to announce his new fashion solution was Daniel Craig.
Back in September, at the premiere of the film "No Time to Die," he appeared in a velvet raspberry jacket and a traditional "bond" butterfly.
His example was followed twice by Prince William, who first put on the ceremony of awarding the Ecopremia The Earthshot Prize inconsistent with the royal dress-code green velvet jacket, and then chose a more classic option for the event in support of the Royal Variety charity.
A couple of weeks ago, the trend was tried on himself and Lionel Messiah.
The footballer came to pick up the seventh "Golden ball" in the velvet jacket Dolce & Gabbana.
His sons were dressed in the same.
AliExpress is already seeing a growing demand for velvet men's jackets in Russia.
According to analysts of the service, received in "Gazeta.Ru," they began to buy 1.4 times more often.
The most popular warm velvet jackets with lining and fitted silhouette, the main colors are dark beige, burgundy, dark blue and, of course, black.
The average price of such models is from 3 to 6 thousand. The rub. At the same time, men prefer to buy only jackets - sets of velvet costumes they choose less often.
You can buy them not only from online retailers.
There are budget options in H&M, Mango, Next and Zara.
In the luxury velvet steak segment this season are presented in almost all brands - both Brioni, and Paul Smith, and Etro, and Saint Laurent.
The most desirable is the model Gucci, in which he came out for one of the premieres of the film "Gucci House" Ambassador Jared Leto.
Choosing jackets of expensive brands, you can be sure that the velvet is made of silk.
Thanks to the special technology of weaving the threads, a dense fabric is obtained with a locky outer texture and a smooth inner side.
More budget options are made from cotton or polyamide, but, accordingly, serve less.
Lamode expert Ilya Vakhoshkin warns that in the case of a velvet jacket, the main thing is not his model or style, but appropriate.
"The velvet requires evening light, so such a jacket is perfect if you are going to a party or a solemn event," Vakhoshkin explains. - It will also be suitable for those cases if the invitation indicates the dress code "Black Tie" or "Creative Black Tie."
Another important criterion, the observance of which allows you to make a choice in favor of a velvet jacket, is the status of its buyer.
"A man in a velvet jacket, in the first place, should get the right advanced party with affluence, - say the authors of the Telegram channel about the men's fashion "Beauty Brammell." - The owners of velvet jackets, as a rule, belong to the caste of those people who rarely buy tickets.
They are simply invited to time-time secular events, where the dress code is always indicated.
Ilya Vakhoshkin offers to combine a jacket of velvet with the same elegant things: classic trousers with arrows, plain shirts, silk ties, loafers with brushes, cuffs.
Too simple and everyday things will look inappropriate.
Fashion experts from "Beauty Brammella" are sure: it will be inappropriate to appear in the velvet jacket of an ordinary employee at the corporate corporate, but if we are talking about "manager from among those who are filling this event, then "yes," he is such a thing in the topic."
If the employee of the rank is lower, and its goal is to move higher in the complex hierarchy of the company or knock out financial bonuses, then it is better not to wear a velvet jacket.
The management will definitely appreciate the phrase "not a cap," - say the editors of the Telegram channel about men's fashion.
Very ambiguous feeling from the voice.
It's an unnatural timbre, so exhausted.
And it is not associated with the cute face of a young girl.
To be honest, I don't understand the admiration of others.
But with all my heart I wish you good luck in life.
It's all about money - alternative energy is heavily lobbied, that is, it is paid.
Billion-cold investment.
Are they in sorrow?
The price of electricity has risen.
Traditional energy is also not in the overhead - both gas and oil and coal were bought cheaper than they now sell.
For fuel, wild demand.
The cumerka drips.
Who's in the fly?
As usual, an ordinary buyer.

Therefore, Western politicians should not be considered idiots "swatched" energy crisis.

I haven't seen a single beautiful person on the pictures in the article.
Just mediocrity within the average passengers.
Perhaps, if such characters are so confident in their beauty that they decide to show it to the whole car, then they will not fit, most likely.
But only because of the mental disorder and the ignorance of such "beautiful (-c)," but certainly not because of their appearance.

Immunologist said that revaccination in 4-5 months will help protect against the strain of coronavirus "omicron"
Revaccination in four to five months may protect against a new strain of coronavirus infection "omicron."
This statement was made by immunologist Nikolay Kryuchkov, who called the vaccination six months later, taking into account the appearance of a new strain, "a very long period."
"With the previous strains, this period was normal, but it is best to carry out the procedure in five months, and people with chronic diseases - in four," - said the expert, calling in parallel with the vaccination campaign, to engage in revaccination.
Hooks also noted that early revaccination provides a good titer of neutralizing antibodies.
"If a person was vaccinated and a booster, or he was ill and vaccinated, or was vaccinated and ill, he received "hybrid immunity," that is, many antibodies and neutralizing enough," - said the expert.
The G7 warned Russia of "scaling consequences" in the event of an invasion of Ukraine
The G7 countries (Great Britain, Germany, Italy, Canada, the United States, France and Japan) issued a statement following the meeting of foreign ministers in Liverpool.
It emphasizes that Russia's "military aggression" against Ukraine "will have huge consequences and costly" to Moscow, but the document does not describe.
"We, the foreign ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America and the High Representative of the European Union, are united in our condemnation of Russia's buildup of military might and aggressive rhetoric against Ukraine," the statement said.
The ministers further urge Russia to "delight the escalation, use diplomatic channels and comply with their international obligations regarding the transparency of military activities," as US President Biden spoke during a video call to Russian President Putin on December 7.
"We reaffirm our support for the efforts of France and Germany in the Normandy format to achieve full implementation of the Minsk agreements with a view to resolving the conflict in eastern Ukraine," the G7 foreign ministers said.
Any use of force to change borders is strictly prohibited by international law.
"Russia should not doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have huge consequences and a serious price in return," they warn.
We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, as well as the right of any sovereign state to determine its future.
We welcome the restrained position of Ukraine.
We will intensify our cooperation in our common and comprehensive response," the statement said.
Earlier in the day, the head of British diplomacy Elizabeth Trass said that Russia will be subjected to "serious consequences" in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
According to her, this meeting showed "a single voice of the G7 countries, which account for 50% of world GDP, and which made it very clear that the invasion of Ukraine will have huge consequences for Russia."
The Pfizer vaccine was considered 32 times less effective from the omicron-sum
The effectiveness of the vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech against the omiccron-stimump of coronavirus is 32 times lower than in comparison with the rest of the disease.
To this conclusion came scientists from the University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University of Hong Kong, reports South China Morning Post (SCMP).
The vaccine was considered less effective on the basis of a study of antiviral activity in citizens who received two doses of the drug from COVID-19.
"We see that most people had a high level of antiviral activity against the original version of Sars-CoV-2, but this ability was significantly reduced against omicronity," said Professor Malik Peyris.
At the same time, scientists stressed that vaccination remains the most reliable way to protect against severe disease in case of coronavirus infection.
Previously, scientists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted the development of the coronavirus pandemic, taking into account the impact of the omicron-sum on it.
The authors of the study concluded that the omicron-stenm could cause a new wave of virus circulation and increased mortality if not taken.
The head of the Ministry of defense of Ukraine accused Germany of blocking the supply of weapons to NATO in Kiev
The head of the Ministry of defense of Ukraine Alexey Reznikov accused the government of former German Chancellor Angela Merkel of blocking the acquisition of suicide weapons within NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times on December 12, Reznikov recalled that last month, Germany vetoed Ukraine's purchase of anti-axis systems and rifles to destroy drones.
At the same time, it is noted that later Berlin softened its position on the rifles, recognizing them as a non-lethal weapon.
According to the Minister of Defense, Kiev intends to seek the acquisition of the above-mentioned weapons within the framework of bilateral agreements with the allies.
In particular, we are talking about the United States, Great Britain, Lithuania and France.
Meanwhile, the FT notes that the position of the new German government under the leadership of Chancellor Olaf Scholz on the permission of arms supplies to Ukraine remains unclear.
Earlier on Sunday, the Ambassador of Ukraine to Germany Andriy Melnyk expressed the opinion that Kiev should not expect from Berlin the supply of weapons to Chancellor Scholze.
According to him, the previous leadership of Germany explained its refusal to provide weapons with the risk of developing a military escalation of the conflict in the Donbass, despite the "occupation of part of the Ukrainian territory by Russia."
The same "illogical" position, the diplomat is sure, Germany will retain under the new chancellor.
In August, Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that Kiev expects help from Berlin in equipping the Navy.
In Ukraine, they hope that Germany "will be a partner of Ukraine in the technical sense," the president added.
It was also noted that in the spring of this year, the co-chairman of the Green Party of Germany, Robert Khabek, visited the republic, where he advocated the sale of defensive weapons to Kiev.

Revealed ways to return stolen money through online stores
There are several ways to get the money stolen through online stores and not fall victim to fraud in the future.
They were revealed by information security experts in an interview with RBC.
So, to reduce the risk of large losses when the bank card data is included in the hands of attackers, it is recommended to store fixed assets on a card or bank account that is not used in online shopping.
Some of the savings can be deposited in a savings account and withdrawn as necessary.
Experts also recommend to create a separate card for online shopping.
If the money was stolen when shopping in stores that do not use 3D Secure security technology, you can launch a refund procedure.
"Within the rules established by payment systems, unauthorized transactions conducted without the use of 3D Secure, responsibility is vested in the participant in the settlement chain, who does not use this service," - said the representative of Promsvyazbank.
The expert from the international payment provider Ecommpay Arthur Zaremba stressed that the buyer has the right to apply to the bank for the dispute of the fraudulent operation no later than 120 days after purchase.
In addition, if the offender used a card on online resources that do not require two-factor authorization, the transaction can be protested and returned the money.
It is noted that in some cases, online stores themselves return funds to the client, if the order has not yet been sent to delivery.
On November 19, a member of the Civic Chamber, director of the Safer Internet League, Ekaterina Mizulina, reported that only in 2021, 11,000 appeals were received for various cases of fraud: from the sale of fake documents to the theft of personal data.
According to her, an effective solution under the current circumstances can be the creation of a single window for complaints against online fraudsters.
Shoring arrived in Poland to discuss "Nord stream-2" and EU legislation
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz arrived in Warsaw for talks on the crisis with migrants on the border with Belarus, the independence of the judiciary in Poland, the build-up of Russian troops near the borders of Ukraine and the situation with the Russian gas pipeline "Nord stream-2."
Although Scholz has declared his quest to maintain good relations between Germany and Poland for many years, the leaders of the two countries expressed unequivocal expectations from each other.
Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said he would urge Scholz to oppose Nord Stream 2, which is expected to deliver Russian gas to Germany bypassing Ukraine.
According to Moravetsky, Russia can use the gas pipeline against Europe as a means of political pressure.
In turn, Germany supported Poland's efforts to stop the flow of migrants trying to get into the country from Belarus.
Berlin said it would help Warsaw and Brussels resolve the crisis.
The judicial system of Poland, however, remains one of the reasons for disagreement.
The European Court of Justice fined Poland, finding that the judicial reforms carried out by the right-wing Law and Justice party violated EU law.
Poland refused to pay the fine, and its highest court ruled that national legislation took precedence over EU rules.
The new German government, sworn in on Wednesday, despite the demands of Poland and the United States, has not made public commitments to stop the work of Nord Stream 2 in the event of an invasion of Russia in Ukraine.
U.S. officials told members of Congress that they had reached an understanding with Germany about the gas pipeline shutdown if Russia invaded Ukraine, a senior U.S. Congress official said on Tuesday.
German officials did not confirm the reports, but Scholz warned about the consequences on Wednesday if Russia violates the border of Ukraine, and this position was confirmed on Sunday by representatives of the G7.

Found money in the wall of the church plumbing will be paid 20 thousand dollars
Plumbing, which found money in the wall of a church in the US state of Texas, will be paid a reward.
This was reported in a press release of the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston.
The incident occurred in a large evangelical church of Lakewood, where Pastor Joel Austin preaches, who promises that devout Christians are waiting for wealth and prosperity.
In November 2021, plumber Justin Cowley repaired one of the church toilets and found thousands of packages of money and checks under the insulation.
He conveyed the find of the church and, according to him, did not even receive from Austin even gratitude.
"I wanted to hear him say, "You know, Justin, you did the right thing.
We understand what you did and what you could do," KPRC-TV quoted him as saying.
Apparently, the find is related to the theft that occurred in the church of Lakewood seven years ago.
Then disappeared about 200 thousand dollars in cash and 400 thousand dollars in the form of checks, which were stored in the church safe.
The money was insured, so the church suffered no damage.
However, for information about the criminals announced a reward of 25 thousand dollars.
Justin Coley couldn't claim that amount, as the award has expired.
Despite this, the non-profit Crime Stoppers of Houston, which at one time allocated five thousand dollars for the award and later received another $ 20,000 as a gift from the Lightwood Church, decided to reward the honesty of the plumbing.
He'll get $20,000.
Earlier it was reported that the police questioned pastor Joel Austin about the money found in the wall of the church of Lakewood.
Tanya, her statements, her actions - this is her characteristic "as a person of the real."
Therefore, the attitude to it is so negative.
And it's not that "it is financially much richer than all the scribes," as they write here.
There are people richer, but not everyone behaves as brazenly as defiantly as this madam.

In Brazil, obliged citizens to present passports of vaccination when entering the country
In Brazil, they were obliged to demand from the coming to the state of covid-passport, the decision was made by the judge of the Federal Supreme Court of Brazil (STF) Luis Robert Barroso.
This is reported by CNN Brasil.
Citizens who have contraindications to vaccination have been released from the presentation of a certificate from vaccination.
Also in the list of exceptions are persons who arrived from countries where the lack of vaccines is proven.
"The situation is even more serious, given that Brazil is a popular tourist destination for New Year's, pre-carnival and carnival parties, as well as other events, which involves an increase in tourist flow," Barroso said.
Earlier, the Brazilian authorities ordered tourists unvaccinated from coronavirus infection to observe a five-day quarantine.
Full protection scheme against COVID-19 has been disclosed
Virusologist, doctor of medical sciences, Honored scientist of Russia Anatoly Altstein in an interview with Ura.ru revealed a scheme of complete protection against coronavirus infection.
According to him, this can be achieved by introducing injection and using nasal vaccine.
With internalization, a large number of immunoglobulin A are formed in a large number of immunoglobulins. This does not happen when the vaccine is administered by injection.
Immunoglobulins A protect the mucous membrane, so the virus can not penetrate the body.
And inside after vaccination, we most form immunoglobulins G (antibodies).
And if you inject both vaccines, you'll get a lot of A and G immunoglobulins. But so far there is no decision on double vaccination," - said the doctor.
The chief prophylaiser of the Ural Federal District, doctor of medical sciences Sergey Tokarev, in turn, said that the main advantage of nasal vaccination together with injection is the ability to stop being a carrier of COVID-19.
He added that this will help by the fact that in this case, the protection of the body, presumably, should be maximum.
Earlier, the Minister of Health of the Nizhny Novgorod region David Melik-Guseinov said that a new surge of the COVID-19 pandemic will lead to the spread of a new coronavirus infection among children.
According to him, this is the picture observed in other countries, where another wave of the pandemic came earlier.
Inna, um...
I talked with a coffee and akale (morning for a long time) so - if you are ready to exchange a warm house, feed, affection, love and games for the current bitch, then go ahead.
But the pesel was trained and generally clever.
I chose my community and went home.
On the video, a method that works in 90 percent of cases.
Not taken from the ceiling, believe me.
I brake many of the masters so that they would not run after the dog, although they lamented that out, 200,000 were running away (pomil), took the hand and took the other side.
As a result, "200 thousand" chose the owner, and not the dog, who ran somewhere there.
Mass protests by opponents of vaccination in Europe do not stop
In the Austrian capital of Vienna, more than forty thousand demonstrators took to the streets.
They expressed dissatisfaction with the restrictive measures and plans of the authorities to make vaccination against kovid mandatory.
From February next year, unvaccinated people will have to pay a fine of 3,600 euros.
The Spaniards, outraged by the health policy, held a peaceful march in Madrid.
Some held posters with the inscription "This is a false pandemic," "I will not be vaccinated."
A major protest against sanitary passports took place in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia.
In the autonomous community, the covid-certificate is required for access to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes and night entertainment venues.
The decision to introduce sanitary passports by the authorities of a number of regions of the country made against the background of an increase in the number of cases of coronavirus infection.
In Luxembourg, more than a thousand protesters protested against the tightening of restrictive measures and QR codes.
The action began peacefully, but then escalated into clashes with the guards of order.
A group of demonstrators began throwing stones at the police.
In response, law enforcement officers used water cannons.
Nikolai S., even in Wikipedia, there is no consensus on this.
Kashevarov-Rudnev is also designated as "the first Russian doctor, doctor of medicine," probably because she began to study earlier.

Only one agree with Zakharova: the Americans carried only death and looting to any country, wherever they appeared.

The WHO has found "momicron" in six dozen states
The World Health Organization (WHO) said that a new strain of the coronavirus "omicron" has been identified in 63 countries.
A number of experts say that the spread of the new strain could have catastrophic consequences.
The pace of distribution of the strain was reported in the message of the WHO.
As of December 9, the strain has been identified in 63 countries, in all six WHO regions.
This is despite the fact that it began to spread only from the end of November.
WHO is also concerned about the high rate of spread of the new coronavirus option.
WHO experts express fear that the new strain according to preliminary data can bypass the degree of spread of the strain "delta," it is also an Indian version of the coronavirus, which is now the leader in all countries without exception.
Earlier, the Director General of the World Health Organization Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that the omicron-stom can have a significant impact on the course of the coronavirus pandem.
In similar conclusions came also in the UK.
Experts at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that the "moicron" in the coming months will supplant the "delta."
And the number of cases in the UK alone will be about 1 million. This is despite the fact that officially "omicron" at the moment several hundred people are sick in the Kingdom, and according to estimates up to 10 thousand.
British experts predict tens of thousands of deaths from the strain "omicron," and at the peak of hospitals will be taken to hospitals more than 2 thousand people daily.
What the British health system will not be able to cope with.
The situation is complicated by the fact that according to the latest studies, the effectiveness of the vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech against the strain "omicron" is 32 times lower compared to the rest of the disease.
How it reacts to the "omicron" Russian "Sputnik V" is still unknown - this will become clear in the next few weeks.
The Gamalea Center has only just begun testing the Russian vaccine on the "omicron" strain.
Why see the stages of ageing?
It would be better to see your exercises more.

Or hands on the waist?
Curious Squirrel, you are right, communication on the Internet is completely different, communicate easily and relaxed, and in a personal meeting and nothing to say.
And to see a person live, maybe it's not what you expected, not hooked - hence the attitude.
When they meet their own person, then the views will change.
And again, the Soviet times are called the "time of demons."
But then people believed in God much more honest than today.
And they were brought up almost according to God's laws (love for one's neighbor, do not steal, etc. "Dc).
What ideology is today - money at all costs.
There is little faith in the Boltuns like the Globa (they don't have it at all), but even if so, the time of demons came in the 90s.
Our St. Petersburg, or rather the Leningrad municipality with Bolshoy Zelenina, maintains communication so far.
Of course, we are not the closest friends, but we try to preserve the warmth of the relationship of the older generation.
Maybe this is due to the fact that there were no visitors in the apartment, the rooms were not rented, and no one canceled the blockaded brotherhood.
We see you more and more at the funeral.
Lara Angelskaya, but you'll drop!

It's a pity that it's not as soft as puppies or kittens, so bruises, bumps, scratches are commonplace, and no boomerang!
And for what?
The brother pushed, the strength not calculated?
And you are always so dexterous that you have never hurt anyone and never injured yourself?

Five actions that will help to avoid diabetes
Problems with blood sugar are among the most common in the world.

Experts advise to adhere to a low-carbohydrate diet.
Such a diet will not only help to reduce weight, but also protect against sudden fluctuations in sugar levels.

Because of overeating and lack of water, heaviness and breakdown."
An additional role is played by the late rise.

How much hidden sugar in the usual foods?
Sugar is not the best source of nutrients.
Its excess in the diet can lead to type 2 diabetes, as well as cause cardiovascular and cancer.
Consumers should take into account that under an unfamiliar word in the product may be indicated hidden sugar - an ingredient similar to the sugar in calories, composition and glycemic index.
On the label can be presented several dozen names, in fact, denoting sugar.
One of the most common and frequently found names are glucose and fructose.
There may also be other glazed sugars, such as dextrose (sugar derived from corn), levulose (fruit sugar), molasses (black molasses), agave syrup, etc.
These are all simple carbohydrates that belong to mono- and disaccharides, and they can be not only in confectionery, but also in ketchup, doctoral sausage, bread, etc.
As stated in Roskachestvo, the most effective way to reduce sugar consumption is to consume whole and raw products, as well as pay attention to the label and many different sugar names.
Different types of sugar are to taste, but no matter what the ingredient in the product - syrup or nectar, processed or unprocessed, brown or white - it still remains sugar.
It is not easy to calculate the exact amount of sugar, as it is necessary to take into account not only the amount of sugar indicated by the manufacturer on the package, but also the fact that vegetables, fruits, etc. They initially contain a certain amount of sugar.
Thus, the total amount of sugar can be much higher than indicated on the label.

He recalled that Germany and the United States made a statement, which recorded the support of Berlin's energy transformation of Ukraine.

In New Caledonia, the third referendum, held on 12 December, ended with the same result as the previous two.
According to the first partial results announced on Sunday, December 12, at noon, most of the residents of New Caledonia voted during a referendum against the independence of their territory.

Several presidential candidates spoke in favor of the territory remaining in France, as it is "the last European Union presence in the Pacific."
"The new Caledonia must remain French," Erik Zemmour repeated repeatedly.
The same statement was made by Republican candidate Valerie Pecress, who published a column in Le Figaro at the end of October, urging the Caledonians to remain French.

However, the president added: "France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia."

Readers of WSJ criticized the article about relations between Russia and the United States
Readers of The Wall Street Journal criticized the article by Professor Christopher Hartwell, in which he described his vision of relations between Russia and the United States.
The author expressed concern that the West allegedly sacrifices Ukraine to Russia.
In his article, he convinces readers of the danger that comes from Moscow, and allowed a number of offensive statements against Russian President Vladimir Putin.
At the end, Hartwell called on Western countries to "convert a united front against Russia."
Readers of the WSJ expressed their disagreement with the position of the American professor.
"There is quite a lot of false information in this article," one of the readers quotes RIA Novosti.
"Europe is not ours to "lose it," and Ukraine is not our land.
"The U.S. and NATO allies will never enter a nuclear war with Russia for Ukraine," he said.

Ukraine will begin to produce jet drones of the new generation
At the new Ukrainian-Turkish plant will begin to create jet unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) type ANKA.
This was reported on December 11, by a freelance adviser to the head of the office of the Ukrainian President Alexei Arestovich.
That is, they are able to act against air objects, against other drones.
Even against the manned aircraft.
They will be Ukrainian engines and the rest of the Turkish avionics: the corps and the like," - quotes his Dialogue.ua.
Commenting on the main features of ANKA devices, Arestovich said that we are talking about reactive, not piston UAVs.
According to him, this is a new generation of drones after Bayraktar, which exceed its "all characteristics."
The first batch of the UAV should be produced by the plant at the end of next year, concluded Arestovich.
The ANKA aircraft was created by the Turkish Aerospace Agency in February 2014.
The development of the drone was carried out by the Turkish authorities in cooperation with a number of private companies since 2010.
On the eve of the Ukrainian General Staff classified data on the use of Bayraktar drones and Javelin missile systems during the military operations of the combined forces in the Donbass.
On December 6, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that the country began construction of a plant for the manufacture of modern military drones.
According to him, Ukraine intends to use drones.
On September 29, Bayraktar Savunma and the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense signed an agreement on the construction of a center in the Kiev region, which will conduct training of personnel, as well as testing and maintenance of Turkish UAVs Bayraktar.
The press service of the office of the Ukrainian leader called this memorandum "a great step forward."
At the airport from the container escaped two lions
Lions escaped at Singaporean Changi Airport.
This is reported by the Straits Times.
Two predators managed to get out of the container with seven lions, arrived on one of the planes.
The publication notes that it remains unknown, from which country they were brought to Singapore, and where they were sent.
One of the fugitive lions lay on the roof of the container.
The beasts could not move away from him because of the protective net installed nearby.
The confrontation ended after the arrival at the airport of the Mandai Wildlife Group, which is in charge of all Singaporean zoos.
They immobilized lions with the help of darts with a tranquilizer and plan to deliver them to a quarantine institution.
Earlier it was reported that in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, the lion escaped from the owner and walked around the streets of the city.
On the same day, the beast voluntarily returned home, people were not injured.
Experts warned about the threat of cancer because of vitamin B9
Studies suggest that an excess of vitamin B9, also known as folic acid, can lead to cancer.
This was warned by the Daily Express.
According to experts, there is strong evidence that people who do not have a lack of folic acid, are less at risk of getting some types of cancer, in particular, colorectal.
However, exceeding the necessary dose on the contrary contributes to the growth of cancer cells.
A professor at the University of Alabama in Birmingham, nutritionist Beth Kitchin advises to monitor the amount of folic acid consumed during the day.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms per day.
The threat of cancer increases only if you deviate significantly from this number to a larger or smaller side.
Kitchin recommends not to take vitamin B9 in tablets without a doctor's recommendation, be sure to monitor the dosage and avoid flakes with milk and other foods that contain folic acid.
Previously, nutrition consultant Rachel Fine called folic acid a substance that slows down aging.
Since it is, among other things, contained in avocados, Fine recommended that men after 50 years of age more often eat this fruit.
In the UK, about 75,000 people could die from omicron stamm by April. The Man
The forecasts of British scientists show that due to the spread of the omicron-stimum of the coronavirus in the next five months in England may die up to 75 thousand. a person, if you do not tighten restrictive measures in the winter.
This was reported by the newspaper The Guardian, citing a study by experts of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), reports TASS.
According to the most optimistic forecast of specialists who are part of the scientific advisory group on emergency situations under the British Cabinet of Ministers, by April 2022 in the country will record at least 25 thousand. deaths due to the strain of omicron, and in total hospitalized about 175,000. The patients.
At the peak of the disease, the hospital will receive more than 2,000. Infected daily.
"Serious measures to combat the coronavirus may be required to prevent the National Health Service from congestion if the Omicron-siam is more contagious than the delta variant and the current vaccines will not be able to prevent infection," said mathematician Rosanna Barnard of LSHTM.
Earlier, the UK Health Safety Agency reported that if the rate of distribution of the omicron-slum continues at the current level, then by the end of the year in the country will be identified about 1 million cases of infection.
By mid-December, the omicron strain could become dominant in the United Kingdom.
At the moment, 1,898 cases of omicron stamma infection with the coronavirus have been found in the UK, of which 633 have been detected in the last 24 hours.
At the same time, on December 9, the head of the British Ministry of Health Sajid Javid pointed out that in reality this figure can already reach 10 thousand. The cases.
I wanted to write some clever comment, but I finished reading this place:

Demand for superyachts has risen by a quarter in the world
The construction of superyachts this year and orders for next year are beating all records in the world, despite calls to reduce the hydrocarbon footprint and the fight against climate change.
In the world register of ships, the number of ordered yachts was 1200 units - a quarter more than last year.
In the era of combating the effects of climate change, it is difficult to imagine that the number of people who have the desire and money for a floating fortress for $50 million or more will not decrease.
But they are becoming more and more.
This year, 25% more ships were ordered than in the previous year.
Brokers say there hasn't been such a hype in the market for 20 years.
The first reason is that many who can afford a yacht are afraid of infection on land and prefer to hide from the pandemic on board their own ship.
The second reason is also related to coronavirus.
If earlier all these people went to the office and met with business partners personally, now the vast majority of them work remotely, and negotiations are held on the zoom.
Broker Will Christie told the newspaper that the shipyards are taking orders for new yachts for 2025 and later.
This means that customers are willing to pay more, if their yacht was ready for at least a year or two earlier.
"People just crave freedom and the super-rich could afford it," he says.
In Western society, many criticize this behavior of the rich and call it decadent.
The rich, sociologists say, do not want to understand that during the time of deprivation of travel to space, life on yachts or flights on their own planes cause public irritation, because the elite does not want to share the responsibility for climate change with all over the rest of humanity.
Economists are urging governments to act and propose new taxes and rules for the super-rich, while they understand that with such a mobility of money, it will be extremely difficult to implement.
Meanwhile, only the number of superyachts ordered, but also their characteristics, is impressive.
Of the 1,200 vessels, 27 have a feed length above 100 meters.
Norwegian billionaire Rekke is building a yacht REV Ocean 183 meters long.
After the launch, it will be the largest yacht in the world.
The yacht has a "lunar pool," as well as a submarine designed to study the depths of the sea.
On the existing super-yachts, there were usual helical sites, open-air cinemas, and on some of them, such as, on the yacht of the w w w w wrestler McGregor - a martial arts platform.Professor of economic anthropology of the American University in Indiana Richard Wilk says that compared to the total number of greenhouse gas selections, the carbon footprint produced by the super-rich, is insignificant.
But it has symbolic significance, considering that the world's multi-billionaires are just over 2,000 people.
This is just another example of the overconsumption of a very small group of people.
Scientists have found that the emission footprint of billionaires is thousands of times larger than the trace of the average inhabitant of the planet.
If one person produces an average of 5 tons of CO2 per year, the world's largest polluter, Roman Abramovich, is responsible for 33.9 tons of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere in 2018.
At the same time, two-thirds of the emission trail was choking on his yacht Eclipse with a length of 162.5 meters.
Even if there is no owner on board the yacht, the team continues to poison the planet.
The owner can call the captain and give the command to drive the yacht, for example, from the Mediterranean Sea to the Caribbean.
The owners of the superyachts do not evoke the sympathy of other people when they, as Australia's richest woman, Gina Reinhard, who owns the mines on the continent, complain through the Utub that there is no room for their giant ships.
It is also difficult to understand her call to build marinas for the ships mousseed of 50 meters.
Determined a dangerous weekly dose of alcohol leading to the development of bowel cancer
American scientists have determined what amount of alcoholic beverages a week increases the risk of cancer.
This is reported by the Daily Express.
Experts came to the conclusion that the use of four or more servings of alcoholic beverages per week is associated with an increased risk of oncology.
At the same time, the likelihood of developing the disease increases with an increase in the amount of alcohol consumed.
Moreover, moderately drinking men have a higher risk of bow intestinal cancer than women.
The exact cause of the development of this type of oncology scientists can not determine, noting only that certain factors lead to a process harmful to the body.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at the level of a two-year-old child
Many, or rather all dog lovers, are sure that these creatures are very clever.
But even they do not know how much four-legged pets are actually developed.
Over the years, biologists have conducted various experiments to know for sure how intelligence is developed in animals.
Although the dog's vocabulary is not as extensive as the human dog, a new study proves that the dog can consistently respond to 89 words or phrases.
The papers of the scientists were published in the publication Sciencealert.
Dogs can not play chess or compose poems, do not understand anything in politics, economics and art, while they often manage to fool their masters.
Representatives of some breeds, experts believe, show better results in understanding the words of the human language, but statistics for accurate conclusions are not enough.
So, some breeds are traditionally considered dog geniuses - for example, labradors.
Scientists have come to the conclusion that dogs are capable of logical thinking, and in terms of the ability to learn, they are not inferior to a two-year-old child.

In Ukraine, they are preparing for the trade of the United States and Russia
The United States and Russia will "trade" about Ukraine's accession to NATO, said analyst Oleksandr Kochetkov in his article for the publication "Glavred."
In his opinion, Washington and Moscow in the near future plan to continue negotiations on guarantees of the United States that Ukraine will not join the North Atlantic Alliance, despite the words of the American leader Joe Biden on the right of countries "to enter anywhere."
If you are offered something obviously unacceptable, well, for example, to sell a close relative into sexual slavery, you will not bargain, but just send the offer.
And in relation to Ukraine, there is a bargain," the analyst wrote.
Kochetkov added that Russia does not plan to attack Ukraine, but seeks a dialogue with Kiev.
"Preparations are carried out secretly, quickly and immediately move to offensive actions, and do not wait for the group to be found and counterpited forces are deployed," he said.
China stimulates the development of railway transport
Advanced Chinese technology attracted the attention of companies from the United States, Germany, France and other countries at the China International Railway Transport and Equipment Production Exhibition 2021, held in Zhuzhou city, Hunan Province (Central China).
The main technologies developed by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd., allow trains to automatically detect and diagnose technical malfunctions, said the company's representative Hou Zhaov-in.
The high-speed trains running on the China-Laos railway line, which was put into operation earlier this month, are already equipped with these technologies, which will provide increased reliability and performance of rolling stock.
Over the past six months, China has significantly increased exports of rail vehicles and many countries in Asia and Europe are witnessing "Chinese speed."
In May of this year, the production line of CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd came down from the first two-deck high-speed electric trains developed in China, designed for export to Europe.
With a maximum working speed of 200 kilometers per hour, these trains will run on the railways of Austria, Germany, Hungary and other European countries.
In November, the test operation of the metro train, developed by the above-mentioned company for Turkey, began.
The train will be on the metro line connecting the center of Istanbul with the city airport.
Traffic on this metro line will be open next year.
It will be the fastest metro line in Turkey at a speed of 120 kilometers per hour.
"The Chinese railway transport equipment manufacturing industry is one of the industries with the highest level of innovation and the strongest international innovative competitiveness," said Feng Yaosyan, head of the Chinese Trade and Investment Committee's China Trade Committee (CCSRMT).
"This industry is the main competitive advantage of Chinese production of high-end equipment in the global market," Feng Yaosyan said.
After more than 60 years of hard work, having carried out a number of independent research and development, China has established an advanced system for the production of equipment for railway transport, with a full range of aids and with large-scale production activities.
According to Feng Yaosyan, the country ranks first in terms of electrification of railways and in operational mileage on high-speed and urban railways.
Biologist listed early signs of dementia
Candidate of Biological Sciences Semyon Goloshykin in an interview with radio Sputnik listed the early signs of dementia.
According to him, signs of future dementia can be forgetfulness, as well as a number of mild cognitive impairments, such as inability to concentrate, plan, reduce the level of abstract thinking.
Discussion is underway that hearing loss could be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and one of the risk factors for its occurrence, the expert said.
Goloshykin stressed that the causes of dementia can be neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders, lack of certain vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer's and atherosclerosis of the cerebral vessels are the most common causes of this syndrome.
The biologist noted that to date, doctors do not know the effective ways to treat dementia.
Therefore, it is necessary to start its prevention in time.
According to him, to reduce the risk of developing dementia will help to learn foreign languages and active communication.
The WHO also recommends maintaining moderate levels of exercise, regular training cognitive skills through games and hobbies that require intense memory engagement and thinking logic
"There are recommendations on the use of various dietary supplements, but their effectiveness and expediency are still being discussed in the scientific community," Goloshykin said.
"The World Health Organization recommends maintaining a moderate level of exercise, regular training of cognitive skills and abilities through games and hobbies requiring intensive engagement of memory and logic of thinking," Goloshykin said.
Earlier, the charity for dementia research in the UK said that the disease increasingly affects people aged 40 years.
Doctors called the early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.
The first alarming sign can be considered problems with vision, because of which the patient acquires difficulties in recognizing objects.
Another sign of developing dementia, experts called aphasia - a condition when a person can not find the right words to convey what he wants to say.
Neurologist demanded to send Saakashvili for treatment abroad
Former President of Georgia Mikheil Saakashvili needs psycho-nervous treatment and rehabilitation abroad, said neurologist Otar Toidze, who is a member of the consilium of doctors created under the ombudsman of Georgia.
His [Saakashvili] neurological status is leading in his disease.
Stable problems are problems with movement, coordination, variability of character," - said the expert, noting that this does not go beyond the regulatory framework and now the former president needs to be sent to special rehabilitation.
"We call this neurorehabilitation and psycho-nervous rehabilitation, the possibility of which we have not found in Georgia," Toidze said, demanding that Saakashvili be treated in a special institution that is not in Georgia.
On the evening of December 7, Saakashvili began sabotaging medical care after prison officials subjected him to disciplinary punishment.
The Georgian policy quickly managed to abolish the punishment and restore itself to its former rights.

Protesters in this city announced a medical dictatorship, and vaccination was called an experiment.
In Spain, since the beginning of the pandemic, more than 5.2 million cases of coronavirus infection have been identified, more than 88 thousand. Patients have died.
In Russia, it is also planned to impose restrictions on the unvaccinated.
The government submitted drafts on the unified system of QR codes to the State Duma on November 12.
It is assumed that the Russians will be able to visit the venues of mass events, cultural institutions, catering and retail facilities with the presentation of either a certificate of vaccination or a disease, or a medical withdrawal from vaccination.

A cool rise: how the Chinese become skiers
The Olympics should attract millions of people on the slopes and help create resorts of international level in the country
China hopes that the Olympics will not only attract 300 million citizens to winter sports, which will allow to collect 1 trillion yuan designated by President Xi Jinping, but also contribute to the economic development of the backward remote provinces.
Taiwu ski resort in Zhangjiakou, located near the venue of the Winter Olympics, is becoming increasingly popular with the Chinese.
In addition to the construction of infrastructure in the region, landscaping is also carried out: workers plant trees.
The country has more than 700 ski resorts, but only 20 of them are large enough to host international competitions.
In many regions of China, where the resorts are located, including in Zhangjiakou, there are problems with snow.
The main task for the long term is to provide a comfortable and interesting holiday in Chinese resorts, so that all beginners become regulars.
But that's a long way from here.
The game organization adviser, Justin Downs, said that since his last visit in 2007, the Chinese ski industry has changed beyond recognition.
Every winter more and more Chinese go to the slopes.
Fiona, a snowboarder from Beijing, one of them.
Despite the major changes, it will take many years to create a ski culture here, Downs believes.
Many resorts are located in agricultural and mining areas.
These regions have yet to be actively developed and created there the necessary infrastructure for recreation.
Gao Maqong, 70, lives in Chongli, near the Winter Olympics.
He notes that in recent years there has been a boom in winter sports tourism.
Two years ago, a high-speed railway was held from Beijing to Chongli, and no locals are suffering from work.
More and more shops are opening up in the country, selling clothing and equipment for winter sports.
On the slopes open the catering points with dishes of national cuisine.
On Taiw now there is even a testing station on COVID-19.
China is aiming to create a thriving winter sports industry, its athletes should become the leaders of the largest international competitions, and resorts and equipment to reach the world level.
More than 500 million people in the world could face extreme poverty due to pandemic, WHO said.
More than 500 million people in the world could be plunged into extreme poverty due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has stalled the progress of humanity on the issue of universal access to health services, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank (WB) said.
In connection with the International Day for Universal Health Coverage, WHO and the World Bank have published two complementary reports on 12 December.
In them, they stated that the pandemic led to failures in the provision of medical services, caused excessive tension in health systems.
In this regard, for the first time in 10 years, immunization coverage has decreased, and deaths from tuberculosis and malaria have increased.
The WHO and the World Bank stressed that the pandemic has triggered "the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, so it has become more difficult for people to pay for treatment."
This situation pushes more than 500 million people "in extreme poverty because they have to pay for these services out of their pocket."
In October, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the coronavirus pandemic plunged more than 100 million people into poverty, and more than four billion people have virtually no social support.

Reuters: Taiwanese minister disconnected from broadcast on "Summit for Democracy" at the request of the White House
The speech of the Minister of digital technology of Taiwan Audrey Tan at a panel discussion during the US-organized "Sammit for Democracy" was put on the mode without a video, according to the recording of the summit on YouTube.
Reuters, citing sources, claims that the picture was disabled at the request of the White House.
According to them, the reason was the map, on which Taiwan was allocated a separate color from the PRC, which considers the island its territory.
The map, shown by Ms. Tang, was compiled by the South African non-governmental organization CIVICUS and ranked the world's countries in civil rights.
Taiwan was highlighted green as "free," and the PRC, the DPRK, Laos and Vietnam - red as "closed."
After the minister showed the map, the picture on her part was replaced by a screenshot with a note that the opinions of the participants of the discussion "do not necessarily express the position of the US government."
China was not invited to the "SMM for Democracy."
Reuters sources note that the map, which was demonstrated by the Taiwanese minister, could go against the policy of "one China," which Washington adheres to.

The "Summit for Democracy" organized by Washington was held from 9 to 10 December with the participation of representatives of 110 countries and territories, as well as civil associations and charitable organizations.
Russia was not invited to the summit.
During the "zero day" of the summit, Nobel Peace Prize laureate, editor-in-chief of Novaya Gazeta, Dmitry Muratov, called for the creation of an international fund through which the money obtained through corruption was given to charity.
Earlier today, Deputy Secretary of the Security Council of the Russian Federation Yuri Averyanov said that the summit carried "anti-Russian and anti-Chinese charges."

The foreign Ministry spoke about the "sad conclusion" in relations between Russia and the United States
Deputy Foreign Minister of Russia Sergey Ryabkov in an interview with "Izvestia" assessed the prospects for relations between Moscow and Washington.
He noted that the long way of interaction led to sad conclusions, and the problems between the two countries did not begin yesterday.
There is one-sided negative predictability, but in part of some prospect of improving relations, everything is completely unpredictable.
This is a sad conclusion on the long journey that we have taken with the current administration, with Trump and Obama.
The problems did not begin yesterday," the diplomat said.
According to Ryabkov, the problems are associated with the desire of the United States to impose approaches to Russia on many issues.
The Deputy Foreign Minister added that he would not risk to give optimistic forecasts about the prospects for improving relations and would not expect a change in Washington's position.
He explained that with the exception of areas such as strategic stability and cybersecurity, no progress has been made.
At the same time, Russia calls on the United States to a responsible approach in matters of international security and hopes that the signals will be heard, and the Americans will listen to the arguments of common sense.
Earlier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov at a meeting with US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said that Moscow is ready to restore dialogue with the United States.
Virusologist warns of the danger of being vaccinated with a nasal drug from COVID outside hospitals
Those who have developed a Nasal Vaccine against COVID-19 may have allergies and they need the help of doctors, so the first points for vaccinating with this drug should not be organized at airports and shopping centers.
This was reported by TASS virologist, corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, the head of the laboratory of bionanology, microbiology and virology of the Novosibirsk State University Sergey Nethesov.
It is easier to organize nasal vaccine vaccination points at airports and shopping malls, but I would only do so in medical institutions at first.
The fact is that the likelihood of an allergic reaction to such a vaccine is available, it is small, but it is desirable that a person then sits next to the doctor's office.
Doctors have special sets of anti-allergic drugs, which act in just a minute or two, which is sometimes very necessary," - said Nethesov.
According to the virologist, it will be possible to think about vaccination in shopping centers when experience in the use of the drug will be accumulated.
He also stressed that when using the nasal vaccine, it is important that it hit the mucous membrane in the nasal cavity.
At the same time, there is a possibility that the vaccine will not reach its destination if the nasal congestion is blown out after injection.

The WHO preliminarily considers "Omicron" less dangerous than "delta"
The World Health Organization (WHO) preliminarily believes that "Oomikron" is less dangerous than the delta-scraper of the coronavirus.
However, there is data on the decrease in the effectiveness of vaccines in the disease with a new version of COVID-19.
As of December 9, the "omicron" is registered in 63 countries.
"Preliminary data and significantly altered antigenic profile of the protein strain "omicron" suggest a decrease in the effectiveness of the vaccine against infection and transmission of the variant.
According to preliminary conclusions from South Africa, it is assumed that it ("the severity of the disease" - ed.) "It may be less severe than the "delta," the WHO said in a statement.
The organization notes that so far all the reported cases of omicron infection in the EU are easily or asymptomatic.
However, the new strain, according to preliminary data, is spreading faster than "delta."
In Russia, two cases of omicron-stimom infection have been registered.
They were "formerly immunized," the Gamalea Center reported.

In Ukraine called four scenarios for Zelensky
Former Verkhovna Rada deputy Vadim Denisenko listed four options for the development of events for the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky in 2022.
In his opinion, the head of state can remain without the support of the West, and may also go to compromise on Donbass.
On Sunday, December 12, Denisenko said in a publication on the portal "Glavred."
The first option, which Denisenko called "the perfect storm," suggests that Ukraine will cease to support key Western countries, reaching an agreement on the future of the country without its participation.
Such a development will contribute to the deep crisis that Kiev may face in 2023.
"Parallelly there is a decrease in the prices of key goods, which we traditionally export ... internal protests and the confrontation of the authorities with key FGG (financial and industrial groups). Ed.) "The ex-parliamentary added.
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario for the development of the situation - "war against all."
This forecast will come true in the case of high turbulence in world politics, in which the Ukrainian authorities will face a number of problems.
Because of this state of affairs, the Ukrainian leadership can make compromises on Donbass, as a result of which it is possible to confront the country.
At the end of the summer, Zelensky's position will weaken, the probability of such a situation, according to the former MP, is up to 50-55%.
The third option for the development of the situation in Ukrainian politics is the opposition of the population and the president who disagrees with Zelensky, which is why it is likely to seize control over the power bloc and implement "populist initiatives."
In the course of this option, Zelensky will begin "reformatting the authorities," Denisenko added.
Another scenario is the transformation of Zelensky into the "father of the nation."
This can lead to some event that will be a great shock to society.
"The event should be large enough to trigger a reaction from external partners and lead to an increase in support for Ukraine," Denisenko said.
Such a scenario is possible as a result of a natural disaster, man-made disaster or aggressive actions of Russia, the former deputy believes.
At the same time, the Russian side has repeatedly rejected any likelihood of an "attack" on Ukraine.
In Moscow, it was the Ukrainian authorities, NATO and the United States that are increasing military activity near the Russian borders.
Earlier, on November 11, the survey of the sociological group "Rating" showed that the rating of the Ukrainian president fell to a record low, amounting to 19.3%.
This is the lowest since his election as head of state.
Analysts predicted the situation in which, in the case of the upcoming presidential elections of Ukraine, only 21.8% would vote for Zelensky, while the former president of the country Petro Poroshenko - 14.5%.
At the same time, only 19.3% expressed support for the president among all respondents.

The poet arrested for the action on the Red Square: "For a quote from Yevtushenko 10 days give, here it is, the power of poetry!"
At the beginning of the week, 21-year-old poet Alexander Volchenkov was arrested for ten days.
A HSE student was detained on Red Square with a poster on which the hashtag "Poetve" is a larger poet.
This quote belongs to the writer Yevgeny Yevtushenko.
On Alexander was drawn up a protocol on the administrative article on the repeated violation of the procedure for holding a public action.
He was first detained on January 23 on Pushkin Square, at a rally in support of Alexei Navalny.
"The goal was to draw attention to poetry in general, now interest in it, unfortunately, is lost, to the decline of culture common in Russia and also a small hope to inspire unknown poets to write their poems on the Internet under this hashtag," - explains Alexander.
We contacted the young poet to find out the circumstances of the detention and to reveal in more detail the message of his message.
How did the police have treated you this time and before?
What did you ask in the department, how did you comment on your action?
This time, the staff were more correct, the detention was as polite as possible, as ridiculous as it did not sound in some context of the word.
On Pushkin took the riot police and took hard.
They asked standard, about the motives.
When they heard, in principle, they looked, if not approving, then understandably.
With the exception of the all 4 sides of the monkey, everything was very correct, but I knew what I was going on.
And if after the action under this hashtag they begin to write their poems, at least a few people, I will spend these 10 days not in vain.
Maxim, according to the protocol, alone, speak at least the language of the tumb-yumba tribe.
And at public and official events they speak the language of others, so that it is clear to everyone what happened in the Bundestag on September 25, 2001, or in the native language through a translator.
This is a protocol and nothing more, by the way, Angela Merkel speaks Russian perfectly and nevertheless resorts to the help of an interpreter.
And even at official events, a transcript is being held according to the old pen, and the stenographer does not have to know several languages.

Researchers told how potatoes help in the fight against age-related disorders
The study showed that potatoes are rich in vitamins and trace elements that help improve blood circulation and lower cholesterol.
The root fruit contains vitamins of group B, vitamin C, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, riboflanin, folic and pantothenic acid.
All these elements help the body's systems function.
In addition, potatoes help in the fight against age-related disorders.
Due to the large content of the tick, it is useful for the gastrointestinal tract, and with regular use can also help in the prevention of hypertension and atherosclerosis.
However, for the greatest benefit, it is better to extinguish or cook the root fruit, rather than roasting in oil.
Earlier, The Daily Express warned that potatoes can be dangerous for diabetics, as well as other products with a high glycemic indicator.
These are carbohydrate foods that quickly break down into sugars such as sugar, sweet soft drinks, white rice, and white bread.
In early December, the Kommersant newspaper warned of a possible shortage of Russian table potatoes, noting the reduction in its production in private utility farms and an increase in processing capacity.
According to market participants, the shortage of products at the moment will be able to replace only imports.

For example, on Lostfilm, which is available in the search results of both "Yandex" and Google, you can watch pirated copies of the Netflix series "Game in the squid" and "Tenderness" directed by Anna Melikyan - the original series of the largest video service in Russia ivi (part of AIV).
On Kinogo, which is also available in the search engine, you can see the animated novelty "Encanto," but, judging by the quality of the video, this is the so-called screen (pictured in the cinema a pirated copy of the film).
On Filmix, which can also be found through search engines, the series "Univer. 10 years later, TNT TV channel (part of Gazprom-Media).

Estonian scientists will look for life on Venus
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in collaboration with the Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies, is preparing three space missions for Venus to search for signs of life in the atmosphere, the "Actual Chamber" reported on Sunday.
The purpose of the missions that start five years are to assess the suitability for the lives of the clouds of Venus, and then to search for life there.
For the project, Tartu scientists have proposed tools to measure the acidity and oxygen content in the clouds of Venus.
Until now, it was assumed that the clouds of Venus, the planet closest to Earth, are too acidic to have life there, but probably originally Venus was a planet of the Earth type.
A trial from Venus should arrive during the third mission.
Suppose that if we find life there, the main question will be whether it is like the earth or the earth.
If it is very similar, it will be obvious that the earthly life did not begin on Earth.
If it is different, it may be more likely that life was born on Earth," said Mihkel Pausalu, head of the Estonian team of the project "Venus Life Finder."

Metaverses will change the Russian business
The theme of the metacells became popular this fall, when Mark Zuckerberg announced the transformation of Facebook into Meta.
For the market, this event was an important signal: the largest player confirmed the development of a new format of digital interaction between people.
So, business in Russia, as well as in the world, will invest in the creation of their own metacaves and their subsequent monetization.
The meta-universities should be considered as a continuation of objectively existing trends.
On the one hand, the trend towards creating remote interactions in the conditions of a pandemic, because people are tired of disunity and restrictions.
On the other hand, it is a consequence of the business's desire to develop ecosystems and adapt operational models for them.
With the third - they are a logical continuation of the trend of digitalization of assets, when any rights, securities, works of art and even money go into digital format.
Anya, you're right, changing food is a conscious process.

You can eat a spoon, try it - and enough.

The British economist could not give a forecast for 2022
The British economist Jim O'Neill could not give a forecast for 2022, because, in his opinion, such attempts will turn into a failure.
He wrote about it in an article for Project Syndicate.
The expert believes that next year will be full of unpredictability and any trend can change the turnover.
The most important factor remains the coronavirus pandemic, and in second place - inflation, he believes.
O'Neill also admitted that he does not know whether the price hike is temporary or not.
As the expert pointed out, even before the pandemic, it was clear that "the world of the endless generosity of central banks has already outlived itself" and it's time to return to relationships where inflation-adjusted interest rates will correlate with the expected GDP growth rates.
O'Neill noted that against the background of the pandemic, the continuation of ultra-soft economic policy may, according to some experts, lead to a new surge in inflation.
In addition, attention should be paid to the issue of productivity growth, as well as increasing the level of poverty and climate change, O'Neill summed up.
Earlier, Mikhail Shulgin, head of the global research department "Opening Investments," said that positive expectations for the dollar for 2022 remain, while the growth potential will be less significant.
Among the risks for the dollar, Shulgin called the monetary policy of the Fed, the dynamics of oil prices and fears against the background of the coronavirus pandemic.

The Russians gave car dealers about 4.5% of the country's GDP
According to the results of 10 months of 2021, the Russians spent 2 trillion 784 billion rubles on the purchase of new cars, which is 28% more than in the same period last year, according to statistics from the agency Russian Automotive Market Research (NAPI).
To understand the scale - about the same amount (about 3 trillion rubles) was spent by the state to support citizens and the economy during the coronavirus pandemic.
Last September, at a meeting of the heads of the countries of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, President Vladimir Putin said that this amount is comparable to more than 4.5% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) for 2020.
In terms of revenues in the Russian market, the Korean brand Kia leads.
For 10 months of this year, he managed to sell cars in the amount of 325.7 billion rubles, which is almost 24% more than a year earlier.
The Hyundai related Kia brand has an even greater increase - more than 35%, and revenue from the sale of cars is estimated at 279.3 billion rubles.
At the leading positions, this brand and in increasing the weighted average price of the car - for the year Hyundai, it grew by almost 21%, to 1.94 million rubles - only Changan, Chery, Geely and Mercedes-Benz were more than the dynamics of the rise in prices.
At the same time, sales of Korean brands have not so much increased: according to statistics from the Committee of Automakers of the Association of European Businesses in Russia, in quantitative terms, Kia sold 9.4% more cars over the same period than a year earlier.
Hyundai - almost 12%.
Closes the top three in terms of sales in monetary terms, the Japanese Toyota - on cars of this brand, the Russians spent 275.5 billion rubles in 10 months, which is 14% more than a year earlier.
The Japanese are followed by Mercedes-Benz with 266.1 billion rubles (+75%) - the German premium brand increased both sales (by 37%), and the weighted average price of the car (almost 28%, to 8.2 million rubles).
"Mercedes-Benz at the same time has a good increase in sales and weighted average price - more, for example, than BMW - hence a greater increase in financial capacity," explained NAPI CEO Tatiana Arabaji. the
In terms of sales growth, Chinese brands are showing fantastic performance, which has also significantly increased its financial capacity this year."
Russian Lada, according to the dynamics of income growth, shows the average market indicators (plus 28%), on the cars of this brand, the Russians spent 229.4 billion rubles in 10 months.
At the level of last year, there are companies in terms of financial capacity, the sales of which in pieces fell in 2021: in particular, Volkswagen, Mitsubishi and Nissan.
UAZ and in the minus - for 10 months, the Russians spent on SUVs and pickups of this brand 12 billion rubles against 12.4 billion rubles a year earlier.
Against the background of problems with the supply of automotive components and interruptions in production that covered the entire world car industry, the car companies continue to continuously adjust prices - the same "AvtoVAZ" increased the cost of Lada models seven times a year, the last rise in price (by 8-10 thousand. The roubles occurred at the end of November.
Regularly rewrite the price tags for their products and other car manufacturers.
The volume of the Russian automotive market in monetary terms will increase further - in addition to the shortage of cars, inflation does its contribution to this, as well as the desire of automakers to wager past losses, experts believe.
In the conditions of a shortage of cars, I think many automakers were even able to partly shift to the consumer the costs of past periods that they could not put in the price of cars earlier,
says the analyst "VTB Capital" on the automotive industry Vladimir Bespalov. the
I believe that financially, automakers feel very good now, maintaining high sales margin."
The indirect indicator of this is the growth rate of the cost of cars, which are observed during 2021, prices for new cars are growing faster than inflation, the expert said.
In the long term, the market will grow in quantitative terms and in monetary terms, but mainly due to inflation and complication of the design of the machines themselves, Bespalov predicts.
With the increase in supply, opportunities for price increases will be limited.
In monetary terms, the Russian car market will continue to grow next year, even if the growth in the cost of cars slows down, automakers will be able to get their income at the expense of volumes, said Sergey Burgazliyev, an independent consultant on the car industry.
Given the increased demand and insufficient supply, now automakers are looking to get the most profit from every car sold, Burgazliyev said. the
Increasing the production of machines is not expected in the next six months, while in Russia the hype is fueled by the uncertainty of citizens in the future.
Against the background of the situation on the market, cars turned out to be a good object for investment - a car bought a year ago, even with mileage, can now be sold more expensive than the original cost, the expert says.
Biden spoke about the transfer of the US military to Ukraine in the event of an invasion of Russia
The US leadership has never considered sending the U.S. military to Ukraine in the event of an "invasion" of Russia.
This statement was made by U.S. President Joe Biden.
"There have never been such plans," the White House chief said, answering a journalist's question about whether the U.S. has abandoned such an idea.
Biden noted that in the event of an escalation of the situation around Ukraine, Russia will face economic consequences.
At the same time, he stressed that the United States and NATO have no obligation to use military force to protect Ukraine in the event of an escalation.
The American leader also said that the possibility of using American troops unilaterally for the defense of Ukraine on the agenda is not worth it.
Biden explained that if Russia invades the territory of Ukraine, the United States will transfer forces to the Eastern European countries of NATO (Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Estonia).
"We will have to send more U.S. and NATO troops to the eastern flank, B9 - all those NATO countries in respect of which we have a sacred commitment to protect them from any attack by Russia," Biden said.
Earlier, the press Secretary of the President of Russia Dmitry Peskov stressed that Moscow has no intentions to invade the territory of Ukraine.
At the same time, he pointed out that Moscow sees the problem in the combat use of the drones supplied by Turkey by Kiev, as well as in the fact that "the American weapons are approaching our territory."
I leave with such interviews.
If already in the interview they want to make me listen to screams, wait for hours, drink an incomprehensible burda and wash a cup - it's scary to imagine what will happen at work.
I will find a normal place for myself, without an eye layer, where you immediately talk to the head.

Because to confirm his lies about involvement in the security forces, he quickly repeats the challenge and continues to scare and persuade.
We need more helpful recommendations for the people.
That's bullshit...
I don't believe it was.
They don't know what to come up with, who to accuse.
