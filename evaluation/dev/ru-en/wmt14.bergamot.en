Germany is the first in Europe to introduce "undefined sex" when registering children
Germany will be the first country in Europe to be allowed when registering children born by hermaphrodites, instead of male or female, to indicate "uncertain."
The parents of the child will have the right to leave the column "sex" for a time in the birth certificate of the unfilled.
Instead of "F" (female sex) or "M" (male sex), parents can temporarily record "X" (uncertain).
This decision is aimed at not pushing parents to rush with the operation to "clarify" the sex.
According to statistics, one in 2,000 newborns in the world are born a hermaphrodite.
Anger over the verdict of the organizers of the terrorist attack in Bali
The survivors and relatives of 202 who died in the bombing in Bali in 2002 reacted angrily to the sentence handed down to the last of the conspirators, who appeared before the court, and said that Umar Patek should be shot.
Patek, who has spent nearly 10 years on the run as one of the most wanted people in Southeast Asia, was sentenced to 20 years in prison yesterday for his role in creating explosive devices used during the attack.
He may be released within 15 years if he receives parole.
The 45-year-old defendant was found guilty of mass murders in an attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, in which 202 people were killed, including 88 Australians, and injured dozens more.
He was also found guilty on a number of other terrorism-related charges, including in a wave of church explosions across Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
Prosecutors demanded a life sentence, although they could insist that a person, nicknamed "pilot" for his reputation as a master of explosive devices, should be sentenced to death.
This decision exacerbated the painful memories of a mother from Perth June Cortin, who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in a terrorist attack carried out by Patek and his accomplices nearly a decade ago.
Hardly holding back her tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
He must appear in front of the shooting team, - said Ms. Cortin AAP.
I have to live every day knowing that I will no longer have grandchildren and I will not see my daughters.
The club was destroyed when a massive explosive device laid in a van parked outside was put in a boat parked after 11 p.m. on 12 October 2002.
Peter Hughes was at the Paddy bar, where a suicide bomber blew up a backpack stuffed with explosives, only 20 seconds earlier.
After this terrorist attack, he fell into a coma and IUmiral three times, being connected to the life support system.
Mr. Hughes said Patek should share the fate of the other three members of the terrorist cell, Jemah of Islamiyah, responsible for the massacre of Amrosi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra, who were executed four years ago.
Indeed, this guy deserves the death penalty the most.
Save his life, well, there is no reason to save him a life.
Get 20 years after killing 202 people and injuring hundreds of people - that's not much.
Patek is the last of the perpetrators of the terrorist attack in Bali, who appeared before the court.
He was hiding for almost a decade, but was eventually detained in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where U.S. forces killed former al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent showed that intelligence had testified: Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden in an attempt to restore ties between the terrorist groups of Southeast Asia and Al-Qaeda.
"He didn't give up," said Ms. Cortin.
Until recently, he did not regret how much grief he had caused to other people.
The verdict was handed down on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the terrorist attack, which will be celebrated later this year in Bali and Australia.
"There will be a lot of tears this year," says Ms. Cortin.
Patek can still appeal his sentence.
Medvedev expects that the aircraft SSJ-100 will be delivered to Europe
Russia expects that after the consolidation in the markets of Latin America and Asia, the Superjet 100 aircraft will be supplied to Europe.
"We expect that in total we will receive such agreements on more than 170 copies of aircraft of this type," - quotes "Interfax" the words of Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, said at a press conference with the Prime Minister of France Jean-Marck Ayrault.
The head of the Russian government noted that serious cooperation has been established with their French colleagues, since this is a joint project.
We discussed some of the financial issues related to insurance today, but we hope that after this aircraft is strengthened in Latin American and Asia-Pacific markets, it will also be delivered to our partners in Europe.
"I hope that he will someday be delivered to France," he said.
The SSJ-100 is an aircraft built by Sukhoi Civil Aircraft in partnership with Alenia Aermacchi.
The ship is developed on the basis of modern technologies and offers high standards of quality and comfort in the segment for 100 seats.
Goalkeeper "Chicago" Nikolai Khabibulin stressed: he understands that he must play better.
According to the 40-year-old Russian, he will continue to work hard in training.
In the last two meetings of the Hawks, Habibulin first missed six goals from Tampa Bay, and then four from Ottawa, and in the second game he was replaced after the fourth missed puck.
We have to play well, and in the last two games I have not succeeded," - quotes CSNChicago words Khabibulin.
- I need to find confidence in training, probably it is worth approaching them as games, and try to achieve the best result.
You have to study your past games and work on the flaws you have.
There are a few small components that I need to improve, but in training I feel quite decent.
But for some reason, after a few heads, everything turns into some kind of snowball.
Maybe I need to relax a little.
The goalkeepers - I don't think I'm the only one - always try to play the perfect game.
If I miss four, five, six, I'm not thrilled.
It doesn't matter what happens in front of my gate.
I'm still working on myself to miss so many pucks.
It's great that my teammates support, but in principle everything is simple: I have to play better.
"Two games are not the whole season, but I wanted to do them much better.
But what happened happened.
I have to put it aside.
I'll just try to play the next match better.
The power engineers of the Dnipropetrovsk region have started a unique program to rescue... Stacks of Storks
In the old days, to imsuit to the court of the storks, the villagers on a high pole installed a wheel from the cart, and the heavy nest was held on it well.
Such special supports have not been put for a long time, so the storks have chosen the poles of power lines - intertwined branches rely on wires, so the atystical house is reliable.
Grandmother Anya, near the house of which in the village of Ivanovka Petrikovsky district for twenty years lives an athyst family, began to notice how the nest settles, despite all the efforts of its inhabitants.
Birds put new twigs on top, and the lower layer has already flown between the wires, is about to collapse.
Of course, it is a pity for a family of storks who nested at the estate every year, took out and fed three or four chicks over the summer, but you do not want to remain without light.
As soon as the birds flew to the warm edges, Anya's grandmother called the Tsarichansky DEN, which owns the support.
I didn't even expect to react so quickly.
When our specialists arrived in Ivanovka, they were surprised that the nest is still holding, - said the technical director of DTEK "Dneprooblenergo" Sergey Berezovsky.
On the wires, which were, in fact, already inside the nest, weighing 150-200 kilograms, corrosion began.
At any time, the birds could die from the electrical discharge.
And the locals risked being left without light due to wire damage.
Therefore, linear monters began an operation to save the nest, and not for the first time in our practice.
Helped by ornithologists from Dnipropetrovsk National University, who have developed a scheme for the transfer of the nest.
They also conducted trainings for employees of district networks.
Famous Dnipropetrovsk ornithologist Alexander Ponomarenko advised power engineers at all stages of the reconstruction of the nests.
To begin with, it was estimated that in the area in the emergency condition there are more than 50 aristine "apartments."
For their reconstruction were welded special metal platforms, resembling a funnel.
The base was splintered with willow branches, and then moved the old nest there.
According to the experts, it is enough to lay the old branches as the basis so that the birds recognize the nest and return to it.
The statists will build their own home.
A month ago, the first nest was reconstructed in the village of Peschanka of Novomoskovsk district.
Next to the electric pole put a new reinforced concrete pole and placed on it a platform with an old, already inhabited nest.
The whole operation cost the power engineers nine thousand hryvnias.
And the other day, the same housewarming took place in the village of Ivanovka, Petrikovsky district, at the estate of grandmother Ani.
Here the platform was fixed in the same place, only lifted over the wires.
Ornithologists are sure that cautious, conservative birds will not even notice in the spring that their "apartment" has undergone major repairs.
Until the end of the year, the same reconstruction awaits four more nests in the Pokrovsky and Tsarichansky districts of the Dnipropetrovsk region.
By the way, while some save rare birds, others ruthlessly kill them.
The other day, the whole area flew around the sad news - in the village of Ust-Kamenka, Apostolovsky district, on the day of the opening of the hunt for the phalans, poachers for entertainment shot a swan family, who lived on a local pond.
Noble birds were not afraid of people at all - the locals fed them and did not offend them.
When the villagers, hearing the shots, ran to the pond, four handsome swan girls were already lying on the water dead.
Now the staff of the Apostolovsky district police department are figuring out who shot the birds listed in the Red Book.
Stuck in Chita American Boeing is preparing for the flight
Conducted under the Treaty on the Open Skies of observation flights over the territory of Russia and made an unplanned landing in Chita on Wednesday, an American plane on Friday, November 1, at 8:30 Moscow time will leave the air harbor of the city.
The airport management allowed the departure of the board, receiving money for fuel.
As reported at the airport, the plane will fly to Ulan-Ude.
According to other sources, he will go to the United States.
As reported, the plane flying to Ulan-Ude landed in the Trans-Baikal Territory due to fog.
Because of unpaid bills, he was not released from Chita airport.
On board the plane are 30 people, including the crew, two nights they spent on the territory of the airport, according to ITAR-TASS.
According to the terms of the Open Skies Treaty, people on board the aircraft do not have the right to go outside the airport of Chita, they can pass border control only at two airports in Russia - in Kubinka and in Ulan-Ude.
The Treaty on the Open Skies was signed in 1992 and 34 States participate.
Observational flights are made over the territories of Russia, the United States, Canada, European countries.
The main tasks of the Treaty are to develop transparency, to promote the monitoring of the implementation of agreements in the field of arms control, to increase opportunities for crisis prevention and to resolve crisis situations within the OSCE and other international organizations.
Vitaly Mutko: Watermelons?
I think we came back 15 years.
Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko expressed his opinion on the riots in the stands during the match of the Russian Cup "Shinnik" - "Spartak."
I am a supporter of the organizers of sports events - clubs, leagues, RFU - are responsible for all this.
But we see that they took a ditch position.
They expect someone from the outside to come and bring order.
This is a very good position, but not quite correct.
It is necessary to organize fans, clubs should invite their stewards, and not let the case go to the ground.
We have now developed a special government decree on rules of conduct in stadiums.
Once it is accepted, we will be very involved in this problem.
But I will definitely invite all the organizers of the football process.
I read Leonid Fedun's interview.
The state, they say, let's make the law quick.
It feels like the Bayern fans in Yaroslavl came and arranged all this.
We are outside observers.
And in general, it's terrible to see how the podium is watered from the fireplace.
And this is in a country that is preparing for the World Cup.
"I feel like we're back 10-15 years ago," Mutko said.
A lawyer with cocavy addiction, who warned the leader of the criminal group about the police investigation, was imprisoned
42-year-old Basharat Ditt conveyed information to the criminal authority of Neil Scarborough
The lawyer feared that his secret drug addiction would be disclosed
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Royal Court.
A prestigious lawyer who told the drug lord about a major police investigation because he was afraid of exposing his secret drug addiction was jailed for three years.
Basharat Ditt, 42, handed over secret information to criminal authority by Neil Scarborough about the investigation of his activities on drug trafficking after being threatened by his cocaine addiction.
A lawyer dubbed Bashe and nicknamed among the criminals "cool lawyer" was arrested at home in 2011 after a police spill on Scarborough, whom he had previously represented at a drug-related trial.
The officers noticed that 32-year-old Scarborough left three bags of cocaine at a lawyer's home in Lackburn County Lancashire while he was at a dinner with lawyers with colleagues.
The investigation revealed that Ditta regularly used a Class A drug after tests showed traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and on credit cards.
For eight months from January to August 2011, he tried to illegally obtain information about the arrests of two people on behalf of Scarborough, as well as one of his accomplices.
All four of the suspects were under police supervision as part of a large-scale investigation into the activities of the criminal organization for the sale of heroin and cocaine in Lancashire, Cambria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
They and another 32 people were later imprisoned after police seized in a series of heroin and cocaine raids worth 1.5 million euros and more than 200,000 euros in cash.
Ditt, 42, was handing over information to the criminals for fear that his cocaine addiction would be disclosed.
Today, in the Liverpool Royal Court of Diet, who works for Forbes Solicitors, a law firm in Blackburn, was covered in shame after pleading guilty in two cases of deliberate obstruction of justice following the results of a three-week court in the Liverpool Crown Court.
He confessed to the possession of cocaine at one of the previous court sessions.
The lawyer's revelation came after the police investigating Scarborough found that he had spoken regularly to Ditt on the phone since February 2011.
Two detectives followed the suspect and found him approaching Ditt's house in Blackburn and placed 60 percent clean in a black golf glove under a lawyer's trash cans.
Shortly after the transfer, Scarborough repeatedly called off to Ditt, who was at dinner at the Ewood Park football stadium of the Blackburn Rovers.
The lawyer returned home for drugs; nine conversations took place between them.
The court found out that Ditta regularly used cocaine after tests found traces of Class A drug in his hair, wallet and his credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but denied cocaine use, said he had spoken to the suspect as he was his client, and insisted that their communication was a lawyer.
During his detention, Ditt took his wallet and tried to take out several credit cards, but all of them were confiscated, and a hair sample was also taken.
During the interrogation in the police, he said that along with the workplace, he had both a home office and clients came to his home for legal affairs.
However, the court learned that after important arrests, he called the largest participants in the illicit drug trafficking, a number of which he previously represented in court to tell what detectives know about them.
In an indictment, Anne White said: "If anyone knows that you should not break the law, it's a criminal lawyer."
Mr. Ditt was accused of a criminal lawyer abuse because he had entered a very close relationship with certain clients.
The contact we're talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer who supplies drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his conversations will certainly prove legitimate because he was their lawyer.
However, this has largely crossed the boundaries of the usual relationship between the lawyer and the client.
He obstructed the police investigation as much as possible to allow these individuals to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditt did not honor his profession, but disgraced her.
He got too close to certain customers, in particular Scarborough, and made it possible to doubt his disinterest.
Ditt did not plead guilty and stated: "If I were a corrupt lawyer that I am not, and I would like to convey information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not wait 15 hours, I would have done it immediately.
But after the meeting, senior officer Lee Holstead of the Lancashire police said that he turned from a criminal lawyer to a criminal criminal as soon as he began to buy drugs from organized crime.
His addiction to cocaine made him hopelessly compromised and vulnerable for the purposes of the main members of the criminal groups, which instructed him to obtain valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers must follow the highest standards of professional ethics and inspire trust and confidence to society.
Mr. Ditt betrayed that confidence and tried to cover up with his profession.
The investigation into Mr. Ditt &apos; s case was led by Lancashire &apos; s unit for particularly dangerous organized crime, which had already been sentenced to three cases of cocaine storage and now to obstruct justice, demonstrating our desire to bring a fair punishment for criminals.
Let this case be a warning to criminals that no one is out of reach of the law.
We'll find you and bring you to justice.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years after pleading guilty to conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine and marijuana.
Another 35 people involved in the machinations were sentenced to 153 years for drug-related crimes.
On his website, Ditt organized a conversation in the form of questions and answers in which he says that his dream job is a lawyer representing clients with a death sentence in America, the perfect companion for him at dinner - Mohammed Ali, and the motivation in the work is inequality.
Producers of jet aircraft feud over the width of the seat, when the stakes are large orders
A fierce dispute erupted over the width of tourist-class seats on long-haul flights, setting the tone for a fierce confrontation at the Dubai Air Exhibition this month.
The dispute will revolve around the width of the seats provided on long-haul flights to economy class passengers whose interests are not always the focus of airlines, while the scope of the allocated space for them plays a key role in the claims about the effectiveness of the latest aircraft offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
Airbus this week called for the introduction of an industry standard that would provide for a seat width of at least 18 inches (46 cm) in economy class cabins, but its main American competitor Boeing says that this should be decided by the airlines.
The dispute is at a time when aircraft manufacturers are competing in sales of increasingly large versions of their twin-engine long-haul aircraft, and the event on November 17-21 is expected to have potentially record orders.
The layout of the rear of the aircraft - especially whether 9 or 10 people sit in a row - is at the center of statements about the economic efficiency of new projects in the "mini-a-aerobuses."
Boeing claims that its updated 777X will accommodate 406 people, based on economy-class seats of more than 17 inches wide, placed in 10 in each row.
Airbus says the competing version of its A350 will carry 350 people in economy class on seats 18 in inch, 9 in a row.
Aircraft giants often exchange strikes on technical issues through advertising in the professional press.
And now Airbus is reaching out directly to the public before the Dubai air show, where the 777X is expected to become the leader with more than 100 orders.
She recently demonstrated what the start of a new advertising war by showing the financiers a slide depicting three people in a restaurant pressed against each other, under the name "Would you agree to this?
"Boeing offers long-haul flights in the seats narrower than regional turboprop aircraft," said Airbus sales chief John Lehi.
With a change in the diet, people gain weight, but the airplane seats have not changed dramatically.
Between the early 1970s, when the wide-body Boeing 747 set the standards for modern long-distance travel, and the age-old weight of the average American man aged 40 to 49 years increased by 10 percent, according to the U.S. Department of Health.
The waist of the average American man of the 21st century is 39.7 inches, according to statistics from the U.S. health service.
Airbus claims that its competitor adheres to the concept of the seats of the 1950s, when the average waist of those recently called the "reactive public" was already.
Airbus says it has ordered a study suggesting that an extra inch in the width of the seat improves sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing is challenging Airbus's numbers by seat size and says manufacturers should not interfere with decisions on how airlines find a balance between tariffs and amenities.
According to her, research shows that the convenience of the cabin depends not only on the width of the seat.
"It really comes down to giving airlines a choice and the ability to do what they think they should do to succeed," said Kent Craver, a Boeing specialist in salons.
They don't want us to decide for them what they'll make.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, the question is to increase the space on the sides, but for suppliers, this is increasingly becoming a factor that can affect profits.
Behind this dispute is a race for plane orders estimated at at least $700 billion at catalog prices in the coming decades - enough to change the ratio of American and European exports.
As the Reuters first reported in July, the location of the seats is precisely what fuels the rivalry in the battle between the latest jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim a 20 percent increase in profitability per place in their last two-engine long-haul models compared to the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.
The stated characteristics of Boeing are partly based on a comparison of the 10-seater rows of the 777X with the original 9-seat layout of the design of the 777 solution.
Winning in specific cost decreases when compared with the 10-seater layout currently used.
The reason Boeing is doing this is to squeeze more seats and make your aircraft more competitive than our developments," said Kevin Keniston, head of Airbus passenger comfort in Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that the cabins with full 10-seater rows for the existing 777 indicate that many passengers prefer a dense seating that can go hand in hand with lower fares.
The seats eighteen-inch width would be ideal for passengers, but the reality is that from a commercial point of view, Airbus's offer is driven by a threat from the 777th model, said interior specialist Mary Kirby, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats, but offer a catalog of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
Travelers around the world rollers even carry roulettes with them to check the competing layouts.
Praised comfort, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with a very dense layout of the cabin for low-cost airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers the A350 with 10-seater rows, but says it hasn't sold it yet.
Until recently, Airbus emphasized the need for additional cabin modifications, offering wider spaces bypassing some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern aircraft, experts say, its call for a new industry standard is unlikely to take off, but may divert attention from the wave of sales of the 777X.
Oleinikov: one-third of rural settlements in the suburbs are completely subsidized
Deputy Governor of the Moscow region Yuri Oleinikov said that almost a third of the rural settlements of the Moscow region are completely subsidized
A total of 187 settlements out of 288 are subsidized from the region's budget.
In 2013, 187 settlements out of 288 receive subsidies from the regional budget.
The share of subsidies in the budget revenues of 122 rural settlements exceeds 50%, and 83 - 100% subsidized.
Within the framework of the budget provision, about 25 billion rubles are sent from the regional budget," Oleinikov said.
The vice-governor also noted that only three urban settlements - Mytishch, Odintsovo and Pushkino - have more than 1 billion rubles in 2013.
The income of rural settlements of many areas is less than 3 million rubles, "this is not enough."
The cost of maintaining the local administrative apparatus in 88 settlements of the Moscow region is more than 70%, "at the same time, there is a decrease in the quality of services," Oleinikov said.
Earlier, he instructed the heads of municipalities of the Moscow region until the end of November to think over what settlements need enlargement, unification in urban districts or changes in the system of administrative management.
These proposals will be finalized by the end of January.
Prior to this, the governor of the Moscow region said that as part of the administrative reform in the suburbs it is planned to reduce the number of subsidized rural settlements.
Also in the Mozhaisk, Kashir, Solnechnogorsk, Kolomna districts, Lyubertsy and Kotelniki there is a request for enlargement of municipalities.
Discussions on this issue in the cities and areas of the region will begin in November.
Chairman of the Moscow Duma Igor Bryntsalov also said that to unite in the framework of the upcoming administration plan about 30 rural settlements in 12 districts of the Moscow region.
This is due to the fact that of the 178 rural settlements in the suburbs, less than a third have a "acceptable" financial base, and 100 - subsidized.
The concern about security in Mozambique is growing as a result of the conflict of powerful people
Under the statue of Samora Machel, the founding president of Mozambique, who looked at them from above down, thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo to chant slogans about peace at one of the rare demonstrations here.
"We want peace back; we want stability," said Vanessa de Susa, chief executive of the investment company.
Fearing for the future of her country, she changed her business suit to a T-shirt decorated with the inscription "We demand security in Portuguese," and joined the crowd on Thursday in the capital's Independence Square.
Within two weeks, there were almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, one of the most violent skirmishes since the armistice over 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a well-known rebel movement, which was supported first by the white authorities of Rhodesia and then by the apartheid-era South African government as part of efforts to destabilize the country's independent government.
After the 1992 truce, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country is unlikely to slide back to a full-scale conflict, but recent events have made foreign investors and locals nervous.
Rates are high for a fast-growing economy, as the discovery of huge offshore gas and coal fields in the northwest could raise more than $50 billion in investment in the next few years from companies such as Rio Tin, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the United States.
The ruling Frelimo party, the leading political force since 1975, and the Renamo party accuse each other of the tensions.
The Renamo party claims that the government became the instigator of the recent clashes, attacking its members in the province of Sofala, the traditional stronghold of Renamo, on October 17.
Attacks on former rebels then escalated when government forces attacked Renamo's bases and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group's leader, told the Financial Times newspaper Fernando Mazang, a spokesman for Renamo.
The government blames Renamo for initiating clashes, accusing the party of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Gebusa has tried to allay fears about instability.
Hebusa told AFP, a French news agency, on Wednesday that Mr. Dhlakama felt like a "loser" who wanted to use "everything" that remains of his strength to try to prove that he could impose his own decisions on the government.
Both Frelimo and Renamo insist that they want to avoid war.
However, fears rose after reports that Mazanga had declared Renamo's refusal to the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the Financial Times that he meant that the Frelio party had in non-compliance.
"Our goal is to return to negotiations, but seriously," Mazanga said.
The previous negotiations between the parties have done little to ease the tensions that have intensified a series of clashes this year.
"These are two influential people (Gebusa and Dhlakama) who faced foreheads," said Joseph Hanlon, an Open University lecturer and an expert on Mozambique.
None of them is a good negotiator and none of them are ready to make the necessary concessions.
The Renamo party, which is trying to achieve electoral reforms, has already announced that it will boycott the municipal elections scheduled for November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators interpreted this pressure as an attempt by the weakened movement to achieve concessions and financial bonuses from the government.
The share of votes in favor of Renamo has been declining since 1992, while the new party - the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), which was founded by a former member of Renamo, is expected to improve its performance in these elections.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Gebusa, who is due to resign next year when his second term ends, wants to destroy democracy in the country.
"He does not want a multi-party democracy, he doesn't want a transparent election, he doesn't want peace because he doesn't want to leave the presidency," Mazang said.
It is not clear what capabilities Renamo has, but it has already carried out devastating and rapid attacks on police stations and cars on a key highway leading from north to south.
Most of the skirmishes took place in the province of Sofala, which is located a few hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but includes Beira - a port that mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, are used to export coal.
In June, Rio suspended the use of railway tracks for about a week after Renamo threatened an attack on the railway.
Mazanga was evasive when asked whether Renamo would repeat the threat.
The Renamo party wanted to warn the international community that the affairs in Mozambique are not going very well, Mazanga said.
Instability has increased government dissatisfaction, and many people are also concerned about corruption, slow pace of development and frequent recent kidnappings, says Fernando Lima, head of independent media company Mediacoop.
"People think that the responsibility for the country's future lies with the government and the president, who must find a solution to these problems," he says.
Omar Sultan, a demonstrator, said people just wanted stability.
"Nobody cares either by Renamo or Frelimmo, they just want to resume the world, they want free access to the roads," he said.
Rules for using electronic devices on aircraft in Australia will remain in force
Passengers of Australian airlines will need to continue to turn off their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing, despite measures in the United States to ease the rules regarding these devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has allowed U.S. carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read e-books, watch videos, or play games on their devices during take-off and landing, provided they remain in the "Flight Mode."
Passengers can already do this during the main part of the flight, but many are annoyed that they do not have access to their e-books during take-off and landing.
Australian carriers are considering this decision, requiring U.S. airlines to carry out a huge amount of work to meet the new requirements, but indicated that they do not plan to change their procedures in the near future.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also noted that they are considering the statement, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical phases of the flight are still in effect in Australia.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority currently has no special rules governing the use of electronic devices in aircraft.
This issue is governed by rules that require air carriers to maintain security at any time, and passengers to comply with the safety rules reported to crew members.
Virgin, which has already discussed with the Civil Aviation Aviation Aviation Safety Authority the expansion of the use of its Wi-Fi entertainment system on board, was not against the changes, but said it would follow the instructions of the regulator.
"We would welcome the consideration by the Civil Aviation Aviation Aviation Aviation Safety Authority of the issue of allowing the use of electronic devices, because we really think it will improve the quality of customer service now that it (the onboard wireless entertainment system) is on our aircraft.
Qantas said it would adhere to the current rules.
Our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing, and in the near future we do not plan to change it, she said.
The decision of the FAU applies to American airlines.
Nevertheless, we are always interested in regulatory changes that could benefit passengers, and we will certainly be carefully examining the FAA's decision and the reasons it caused.
For U.S. carriers, the impact of the order will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will have to prove that their aircraft are resistant to radio interference from mobile devices, as well as to revise manuals, manual baggage regulations and instructions for passengers.
"Once the airline checks and confirms the vistrity of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable, lightweight electronic devices, such as tablets, e-books and smartphones, at any height.
In rare cases of poor visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to turn off their devices during landing.
In addition, according to the recommendation of the group, heavier devices should be located under the seats or in the upper luggage compartments during take-off and landing.
Obama gives up his words about health care
Among the storms of criticism, President Obama yesterday backed up relative to his often repeated, unequivocal promise that "If you like your health insurance plan, you can keep it.
Seeing hundreds of thousands of people being informed of the termination of services from their providers, Republicans have criticized the president in recent days for misleading American society.
Yesterday, Obama made his initial public promise a little.
"Most people with health insurance that works can keep it," he said in a speech in Boston.
Regarding what he called a "imminitence" in the news about the termination of services, Obama urged Americans receiving these notifications to look for other options on the market.
Most people will be able to get better, comprehensive health insurance plans at the same price, or even cheaper than predicted.
"You will get more favorable terms," he said.
The administration said that no one should be surprised that 5 percent of the population who buy insurance on their own may be forced to change plans because their coverage does not meet the new standards required under the Affordable Health Care Act.
"Let me say directly to these Americans: you deserve better," Sibelius said in a speech to the House of Representatives' Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington.
Sibelius, who oversees the implementation of the law on affordable medical care, said the launch of the site of online sales has been going on "descurity" from October.
"I'm upset and angry as everyone else," she said.
I really want to restore your trust.
The irritated Sibelius dropped the phrase that the microphone caught on on, sitting behind her assistant at yesterday's hearing in the House after a heated debate with House of Representatives Billy Long, a Republican from Missouri, whether she was obligated to join Obama's health program.
After more than three hours of hearings, Long once again urged Sibelius to say why the Affordable Health Care Act did not voluntarily abandon government-sponsored insurance to acquire a plan through HealthCare.gov, which it now imposes on millions of Americans.
Dmitry Medvedev: the case of Greenpeace will be considered fairly
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev on Friday said that the case of Greenpeace activists will be considered in strict accordance with Russian legislation.
France may have no doubt that the case will be conducted in compliance with the law, we hear all concerns.
"We can guarantee compliance with the laws," Medvedev said at a meeting with French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Eero.
Among the detained Greenpeace activists is a French citizen.
Pierre Pisan, as well as other activists, are charged with hooliganism.
"I asked if we can expect a humanitarian gesture against the detained citizen," - quotes "RIA Novosti" Mr. Eero.
"Our country cannot support activities that can damage the environment, no one has the right to violate the laws," - said Dmitry Medvedev.
According to him, the activities of any structures that are trying to influence technologically complex and insecure processes, including energy production, is dangerous.
He stressed that these objects "like a powder barrel," and recalled what was happening in the Gulf of Mexico, reports RIA Novosti.
A friend of Semyon Varlamova said that the hockey player suffers from alcoholism
A friend of hockey player Semyon Varlamova Evgenia Vavrinyuk said that he suffers from alcoholism, reports the Russian News Service.
"He has no idea how to stop drinking," she said.
Recall that Vavrinyuk filed a lawsuit for beating the goalkeeper of the Russian national team Semyon Varlamov, who is also a member of the club "Colorado."
According to her, the hockey player shuffled her by her hair, and also beat her - after the attack, her arms, chest, abdomen and neck were damaged.
Varlamov himself came with the culprit to the Denver police and confessed to the beating, describing the incident in detail.
He was arrested but later released on bail of $5,000.
The court did not restrict the athlete in movements around the country, but forbade to approach Vavrinyuk.
He is also facing up to 6 years in prison for domestic violence.
Blizzard released a 19-year-old platformer for free
Studio Blizzard released its 1994 Blackthorne platformer on PC.
This is reported by WoW Insider.
According to him, the game became available in Battle.net in the section of the classic Blizzard games.
However, some gamers note that at present, only those users whose accounts belong to the American part of the service can download it.
For Russian users, the game is not yet available.
As reported by the media, the version that Blizzard has now released on PC, outwardly does not differ from the original version of the game.
The soundtrack to the Blackthorne also remained unchanged.
The Blackthorne platform, which Blizzard released 19 years ago, was originally released on the SNES console.
His events unfolded on the planet Tuul, whose inhabitants were divided into a dark and bright kingdom.
One day, the dark ruler Sarlak decided to kill the light king Vlaros and become the sole ruler of the planet.
The main character of the game is the son of Vlaros Kyle, who was saved from death by sending to Earth.
Twenty years later, he returned to Tuul to fight Sarlak's henchmen and protect the inhabitants of the planet.
The original Blackthorne was the first game the studio released after its renaming as Blizzard Entertainment.
It was called Silicon & Synapse.
Blackthorne was published by Interplay.
Coulson resorted to phone hacking to check a confidential message
Former News of the World editor Andy Coleson allegedly used the phone, he was hacking, and splashing, while trying to confirm false information about the novel by Charles Clark, who was then Secretary of the Interior.
The prosecutor, royal lawyer Andrew Edith told the court of Old Bailey that in May 2005, the News of the World newspaper received false news that Clark was dating his "attractive special adviser" Hannah Polby.
The newspaper instructed private detective Glenn Mulker to break into Polby's voicemail and lurks in the house to interview, but Coleson also called her and left her voicemails.
The prosecution believes that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not the kind of person who will stand near someone's house, hoping to catch someone by surprise, he is a person who likes to offer history to people to see what they'll say," said Mr. Edith.
He said the News of the World newspaper used three ways to investigate stories: phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third.
Obviously, he knows about the second, about surveillance, he just has to.
What about the first one?
Does he know about phone hacking?
He says no, we say, "Oh, yes!
Rumors of Clark's novel first caught the attention of News of the World, when a source sexually interested in Mrs. Polby was told: "Don't waste time, she's with Charles."
The cassette with voice messages received from her phone at least three times was withdrawn from the house of Mulkeira in August 2006.
Investigators also found records on the computer of a private detective in which Miss Polby and her sister appeared as Projects.
During the period when she was under surveillance, Ms. Polby's grandmother and grandfather received anonymous calls asking for information about her, Mr. Edith said.
At this time, former chief reporter Neville Carlebeck and former reporter James Weatherup controlled the surveillance of Ms. Polby's movements.
Leaving her a voicemail on June 18, 2005, Coulson said: "I have a story that we plan to publish tomorrow and I would very much like to discuss with Charles.
Mr. Edis said that Coulson's involvement in this story took place in the same scenario as with other influential people, such as former Interior Minister David Blanckett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson had confronted Mr. Blanckett about an affair with a married woman while he was dating the matchmaker Rebecca Brooks, who was then married.
Coulson and Brooks deny colluding with other people to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulkeir, Thurlbeck and Weatherup admitted to hacking phones.
In the bases of the Ministry of Internal Affairs there is no group "Brother's Circle," to which Leps was listed in the United States
In the databases of the Russian security forces of the group "Brother's Circle," to which Washington listed the singer Grigory Leps, is not listed.
As noted to Interfax in the law enforcement agencies of the Russian Federation, after reports appeared in the media about the introduction of the US Treasury Department Grigory Leps in the control lists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian criminal syndicate "Brother's Circle," all databases were checked, but such a group was not found.
The dissemination of this information contributes to the maintenance of the myth of the so-called "Russian mafia," which allegedly operates abroad, according to law enforcement agencies.
"Even in the name itself - "Brother's circle," there is some element of mystery, contains a hint of a secret bed.
"All this is very similar to a PR action," - said the Agency interlocutor.
On October 31, the US Treasury announced the inclusion in its control lists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian criminal syndicate "Brother's Circle" by Arthur Badalyan, Grigory Lepsveridze, Vadim Lyalin, Sergei Moskalenko, Yakov Rybalsky and Igor Shlykov.
The individuals on the list are suspected of having links to the few Vladislav Leontiev and Gafur Rakhimov, who are considered influential members of criminal groups and are on the sanctions lists of the United States since February 2012.
According to the US authorities, Grigory Leps "serves as a courier for the delivery of money on behalf of Vladislav Leontiev."
The production center of Grigory Leps refused to comment on the US accusations against the singer, calling them "brain."
In 2011, U.S. President Barack Obama put the Brat Circle syndicate among "substantially transnational organized criminal groups" and instructed the Treasury to "undermine and prohibit their global criminal operations."
The blacklisting of the American Ministry of Finance entails blocking his assets in the United States and a ban on business contacts with him of persons living in the States.
Scientists have shed light on how the dog's tail movements are associated with her mood.
Earlier studies have shown that satisfied dogs wag their tail to the right side (from the dog's point of view), while anxious dogs wave their tail predominantly on the left side.
But now scientists say that other members of the dog family can notice these subtle differences in tailwring and respond to them.
Professor Giorgio Wallworthigra, a neuroscientist at the University of Trent, says: "It is well known that people have the left and right sides of the brain differently involved in the formation of ductuators that cause positive or negative emotions.
Here we tried to look at this in other species.
He added that, just like a human, dogs have the right part of the brain controlling the left side of the body and vice versa, and the two hemispheres play different roles in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to the versatile tailings of other dogs, researchers observed the animals when they watched movies about other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of animals and analyzed their behavior.
We'll probably soon understand why their tails sometimes head to one side and sometimes to the other.
Professor Wallworthigara said: "We showed the dogs videos of dogs - either naturalistic versions or silhouette to get rid of any other distorting factors, and we could manipulate the tail movement and direct the tail more to the left or right.
When the animals saw that otherwise, an unspeaking dog moved the tail to the right (from the point of view of the dog's wagging tail), they remained completely relaxed.
But when they noticed that the tail was inclined mainly to the left (again from the point of view of the dog wagging tail), their heartbeat increased and they looked alarmed.
Professor Wallworthiara said he did not think that the dogs intentionally communicated with each other through these movements.
In fact, he believes that the dogs learned from their experience, what movements they should worry about, and which ones should not.
If there are several encounters with other dogs and often wagged their tail in one direction is associated with more friendly behavior, and the right side gives less friendly behavior, the dog reacts on the basis of this experience.
The researchers say these results could give owners, veterinarians, and trainers a deeper understanding of their animal's emotions.
Dog Behavior expert John Bradshaw, a visiting fellow at the University of Bristol Veterinary School, said it was not the first study to test whether the left and right sides mattered.
Last year, a group of scientists from Lincoln University found that dogs turn their heads to the left if they looked at an aggressive dog, and to the right if they look at a happy dog.
And in another scientific work of the University of Victoria in Canada, he reported: "Dogs were more likely to approach the robot dog, when the wagging of her tail was directed to the left, and not to the right, instead of becoming alarmed, the opposite behavior towards the Italian study.
He said the differences could have been due to the fact that dogs in various studies did not fully perceive animals in films or robot dogs as dogs.
It could be helpful to explore how dogs react to real dogs, he explained.
While there is sufficient evidence in different mammals that the two hemispheres of the brain are used for different purposes, many details are yet to be clarified, and the dogs are no exception.
However, given the ease with which their behavior can be reported, we'll probably soon understand why their tails are sometimes directed in one direction, and sometimes in the other.
Are the elites of Europe ready to do business with England?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with a commitment to gather business representatives and determine what changes the UK welfare and job creators want to see in relations with the EU.
To that end, we ordered the largest and most comprehensive survey of British business leaders, asking them to express their thoughts on the UK, business and the EU.
YouGov surveyed more than 1,000 business leaders representing a wide cut of business in the UK in size, sectors and regions.
The survey's findings will come as a surprise to many.
We found that the vast majority of enterprises are currently looking for export opportunities outside Europe, paying special attention to countries that are modernizing and growing, while the EU countries are stagnating.
They want the government to prioritize new trade ties with countries like China, India and Brazil rather than spending time on a long and difficult process of reforming confusing EU institutions.
When asked about their views on specific political issues, from antitrust regulation to product laws, most business leaders believed that controlling these key areas of competence should be returned to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the single market, and business representatives said that the costs of regulation from Brussels are now outweighing the advantages of being in the European trade zone, - agreed even 40 percent of large enterprises, traditionally the most pro-European of all companies.
Our survey of business executives found that a clear majority wants the UK to pursue a course of changing the treaty and relations with the EU, based on trade, not on politics.
This result, which was observed among businesses of all sizes and major business groups, shows that the business insists on a significant change that will return the authority back to the UK.
The bids are high - achieving changes in the contract and more favorable conditions for the UK will provide a 16 percent shift in the vote to stay in the EU.
The prime minister should have no doubts: this survey shows that British business supports his plan to revise the terms of UK membership in the EU.
He also shows that the business expects the revision to lead to a significant shift in the current balance of power back to the UK.
The best conditions for British businesses are possible and become more necessary as the eurozone embarked on a closer economic and financial unification.
Priority should be given to jobs and economic growth in the UK, and as our survey results show, for business, this means an increased focus on trade and fundamental changes in Brussels" regulatory activities.
Turkish politician declared a hunger strike against the wall on the border with Syria
In mid-October, the authorities began the construction of a separation wall in the area of the city of Nusaibin in the south-east of Turkey.
Local residents and representatives of the pro-Kurd party PMD strongly opposed the construction.
The mayor of the Turkish city of Nusaybin, Aishe Gekhan, on the border with Syria, announced a hunger strike, protesting the construction of a separation wall on the Turkish-Syrian border, the press service of the Peace and Democracy Party (PDM) reported on Friday.
The police repeatedly dispersed the protest demonstrations.
Turkish Foreign Minister Muammer Guler first denied the construction, then said that the wall is being built to ensure the security of the borders.
"Nusaybin's mayor Eishe Gekhan, a member of the PMDD, has declared a hunger strike, thus turning her protest against the construction of the wall into a deadly struggle," the party's press service said.
The mayor of the city believes that the construction of the wall is designed to isolate the Kurdish population of the two countries from each other, the Kurds crossed this border freely for half a century.
"This is an inhumane situation with which the Kurds will never agree," Aishe Gekhan said.
According to the press service, on November 7, a rally against the construction of the separation wall is planned in Nusaibin.
This morning in the Saratsky district, the driver of the car "Peugeot" went to the oncoming lane on 115 km of the highway Odessa-Reni, and collided with a bus in which there were six people.
This is reported by the press service of the management of the State Emergency Service in the Odessa region.
As a result of the incident, the 31-year-old driver of the car "Peugeot" was killed.
A 55-year-old passenger and a 44-year-old bus driver were injured, who was stabbed to his leg.
Doctors provided the woman with first aid on the spot, she refused hospitalization.
The ambulance staff also examined all the other passengers.
Rescuers with the help of a crane picked up the bus and released the bus driver, whose foot was clamped in the door of the bus.
In Siberia, you should not be vegan: greenhouse tomato will not replace the soup
Why vegetarianism is not suitable for life in Siberia, the correspondent of RIA Novosti found out.
People who completely abandon animal products should not live in Siberia.
Here they will not transfer the winter without losses for health, and no greenhouse tomatoes do not compensate for them, according to Novosibirsk nutritionists and doctors interviewed on the eve of the vegan.
Drinking Oil Liters
Strict vegetarianism, when they refuse not only meat and fish, but also from milk, honey, eggs, it becomes a fashionable way of life.
However, dietitians are sure that in Novosibirsk and other cities of Siberia adhere to such strict norms in nutrition, at least, it is not useful for health.
The complete rejection of animal products is harmful.
Animal proteins contain essential amino acids, which are very difficult to compensate with plant ones.
It is necessary to include at least milk or eggs in the diet," - said the nutritionist Marina Bozhay.
It gives an example of fish containing essential fatty acid Omega-3.
The richest vegetable oil is flaxseed.
"To consume it in the quantities necessary for a person, you need to drink liters!" - says the nutritionist.
Doctors are sure that the residents of Siberia special attention should be paid to the diet in winter.
In this season, vegetarianism is in doubt.
In the conditions of our realities, high food requirements are imposed.
In order not to freeze, you need high calorie content.
"If a person restricts himself for animal products, respectively, he does not take this calorie content," - says the expert.
This is agreed by the dietitian Olga Poznyak.
She adds that imported vegetables and fruits are not the way out.
It is better for a person to eat mainly products that are grown in the region of residence or where he was born.
The genetic code is tuned to better assimilation and digestion of these products.
And in the winter, people do not want to chew a cucumber, but a hot soup or something more saturated," - explains his position doctor.
According to her, from the fact that vegans can eat, various cereals, cereals, legumes, local vegetables, apples remaining in the winter, frozen berries are really useful.
But this, of course, is not enough for proper nutrition.
According to gastroenterologist Claudia Arifulina, Siberians in the bodies have sufficient vitamin levels only from mid-August to mid-September.
The complete transition to vegetarianism in our harsh natural conditions, when the temperature can change by 30 degrees per day and in May the snow lies in the poor is impractical.
The body needs energy for life, and this, above all, fat," - says the doctor.
Doctors note that veganism is especially harmful for children and pregnant women.
Children grow, they need building material, including in the form of amino acids.
And adhering to vegetarianism, we give them inferior.
Pregnant women also need increased protein, vitamins and trace elements in the menu.
"The vegans do not receive them," the God is sure.
Arigulina says that an adult is free to choose anything, "play in the toys that he wants."
He has an already formed organism, a skeleton, organs.
Children should eat well.
If parents deprive him of some trace elements or amino acids, choosing for him what he will eat, it is just a violation of the rights of the child.
"The lack of certain substances for the development of the brain, vision, bones will not be restored tomorrow," she says.
All medical specialists interviewed agree on the low quality of grown in winter in greenhouses and imported vegetables and fruits.
The fact that we are brought and grown in greenhouses contains fewer microelements we need than (grown) in the open ground.
"The quality of the food is not that," says the God.
Arifulina also notes that imported and greenhouse vegetables and fruits are far from ideal standards.
Sometimes the desire of producers to harvest a larger harvest is detrimental to the quality.
"Apples do not become brown on the cut, cucumbers quickly turn yellow and mold, tomatoes tasteless and non-flavored," - quotes the doctors, adding that they are most likely stuffed with excessive amounts of fertilizer.
And they become suppliers not of vitamins, but fiber.
This is not agreed by the head of the laboratory of the Siberian Institute of Physics and Technology of Agrarian Problems, Candidate of Agricultural Sciences Vera Petruk.
She says that with the right approach and compliance with all the norms and requirements in greenhouses, it is possible to grow full-fledged vegetables.
If they try to drive out more from a square meter, then, of course, water will be more often, and overfeed the plants with mineral fertilizers.
For example, when too many nitrogen fertilizers, tomatoes grow rapidly, they are large, but watery and unsweetened," she explains, adding that the issue of quality, first of all, depends on the comprehension of the manufacturer.
Russia Outside the fight for pollution of cities by cars
Attempts to solve the transport problems of large cities have been observed in most of the world's megacities since the second half of the twentieth century.
As a rule, it was about their reorganization and expansion of highways, or attempts to reduce the demand for car trips, the number of cars and the time of their use.
The example of Singapore is widely known, where a strict quota of the increase in the number of private cars has been introduced, and the right to purchase them at auctions.
Its price can be two to three times the price of the car itself.
European cities, including London, have imposed a fee for entering the city center.
In Germany, for example, in Hamburg and Stuttgart, so-called green zones are introduced, where only cars with a certain eco-class are allowed to enter, using also high-quality fuel (including biofuels or electric cars).
The Beijing Environmental Protection Agency, for example, approved in 2012 the "five-year clean air plan" with a total cost of about 250 billion yuan (about $40 billion).
According to Li Kunseng, director of transport pollution control at Beijing's Municipal Environmental Protection Office, the main goal of the five-year plan is to reduce the leading air pollutants by 20-35% by 2017, an increase in the number of private cars to a level not exceeding 6 million (now 5.2 million), as well as an increase of no more than 5% in fuel use per vehicle.
According to the agency, now vehicles in Beijing are responsible for 22.5% of total air pollution.
Among the main measures of the program is the restriction of the use of road transport, as well as the introduction of additional taxes for car owners.
Among other things, the urban measures of the "green five-year plan" include the accelerated transition to European fuel standards compared to the rest of the country, the introduction of a local system of eco-standards and marking of cars and fuel, restriction on the entry of cars in the central part of the city, a ban on the use of obsolete vehicles (in addition, the creation of incentive financial programs to replace old cars with hybrid or electric vehicles), the development of electric vehicles (including public and high-speed).
Among the automotive innovations of Beijing is also a ban on all private cars to move within the fifth transport ring (only in the capital of China six) one day a week (there is the relevant information contained in the license plate of the vehicle), as well as the issuance of registration plates for cars based on the lottery (for example, in 2011, the first year of the lottery, the total number of permits for the registration of private cars in Beijing was only one third of the number of 2010).
According to the current state program "Environmental protection for 2012-2020," the number of cities with high and very high air pollution should be reduced to 128 (in 2012 there were 138).
According to the Ministry of Natural Resources, in 2011 the "movable sources" accounted for 41% of all emissions of pollutants into the atmosphere of cities.
In Moscow, for example, emissions from cars are ten times higher than industrial, and in St. Petersburg - nine times.
In Russia, they are only beginning to think about the possibility of restrictive regulation of cars on the streets of cities.
Mikhail Blinkin, Director of the HSE Institute for Transport Economics and Transport Policy, believes that administrative and fiscal measures aimed at suppressing the demand for car travel are obviously unpopular, they can be taken by society only if they are fully universalized.
In the case of Moscow, there is a unique problem associated with the structure of its fleet, where there are two clusters of poorly sensitive to any regulatory impact - service and personal cars, as well as "privileged" users, the total number of which is at least 200 thousand. (about 5% of the total number of Moscow's fleet).
Recently, urbanists from the center of ECOM in St. Petersburg prepared a study where the balance of urban areas between residential buildings, the area of the road surface and the number of vehicles is analyzed.
The main findings of the researchers: the city center is provided with roads half the required, and most motorists living in the center do not use cars every day, leaving them for a long time in parking lots or just on the streets.
As a result, it is proposed to build not parking, but storages of cars, not to expand, but to reduce the roadway (so that the streets become more friendly for pedestrians), as well as limit the use and placement of personal transport within the boundaries of the territory of the security zone of the historical center (common area of about 3212 hectares, covering a number of central districts of the city).
The price of fuel will be led by a tax maneuver, which provides for an increase in the tax on the extraction of minerals (MET) on oil simultaneously with a decrease in export duties and an increase in excise duties.
According to experts, these measures can bring an additional 619.3 billion rubles to the budget.
Trip on mud, rivers and jungles for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical care in rural Cameroon
bull and his team spend almost every weekend taking hundreds of patients.
There are not many doctors in this West African country - only one in 5,000 people.
Vote here or through your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwell is one of the top 10 of CNN's 2013 protagonists.
You can vote for him or any of the other 10 main characters to be the Hero of the CNN Year.
This man will receive $250,000 to continue his outstanding work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle saw his father return to life and again fall into an unconscious state, wandering through hospitals that were not properly equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwell was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaounde, Cameroon's capital.
At first, his hand was broken, but the infection spread to the brain and caused hematoma, which reminded itself for the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon, Georges Bwelle said.
If we had the money, we'd take him out of Cameroon.
Instead, Belle accompanied his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals for years, receiving any treatment they could get.
"It's not easy," said Bwell.
You can leave home at 5 a.m., run to the hospital to be the first, but you're not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
Some may die because they have to wait.
The situation hasn't changed much since Bwell's father died in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor per 5,000 in Cameroon.
By comparison, the ratio in the United States is one doctor per 413 people.
And even if the Cameroonians could see a doctor, many of them would not be affordable.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of the health expenditures in it are private.
"The only problem with poverty," said Blatle.
And because of poverty, they can't enjoy their lives.
Seeing the suffering of his father and so many of his compatriots, Bwell was determined to do something about it.
Last year, Dr. Georges Bwell and his team of volunteers conducted 700 free operations.
He became a doctor and works as a vascular surgeon at the Central Jaounde Hospital.
He also founded the non-profit organization ASCOVIME, which organizes trips to the countryside on weekends to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have provided assistance to nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 more people are stuffed into vans, tied to the roofs of medical supplies and drive on rough terrain to visit the village in need.
They don't always have luck.
More than once they had to push cars through the rivers and dirt.
But when they arrive, they are met as real heroes: it is a holiday with songs and dances and the best rooms that the locals can offer.
Free medical care in these villages is indeed a reason for the holiday, and Bwell with its wide smile and boundless energy is more than happy to join the fun.
The next morning, the team begins to receive hundreds of patients.
"We accept 500 people on every trip," said Blatle.
They come from all over the area within a radius of 60 kilometers from the village, and they come on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics provides a variety of medical services.
Many people receive treatment for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others can get crutches, donated glasses, or free birth certificates - the documents needed for the school that many poor families simply can't afford.
In the evenings, the team conducts simple operations under local anesthesia.
Operations are usually carried out in a school building, municipality or in the house; after the procedure, patients get up and go to the postoperative area to make room for the next person.
Using the generator for lighting the operating and sanitary handling of the equipment, Bwell and his volunteers work until early Sunday morning.
This is an unbearable pace, but the purposefulness of the brigade usually helps to support village musicians.
"They beat the drums all night so that we can be awake and keep working," said Bwell.
On Sunday, the members of the brigade go back to the city, tired, but proud of their work.
This group, consisting of Cameroonian doctors and international medical students, conducted 700 free operations over the past year, and they know that their help can be of great importance to those they help.
One person explained that the free hernia treatment operation he received would allow him to work again.
"It will change the future for me and my family," the man said.
In addition to these weekend clinical receptions and work at the hospital, Bwell's surgeon also works at night in private medical clinics around Yaounde.
It is this second work, he said, provides 60 percent of the funding of his non-profit organization; the rest of the funds are covered by private donations.
"I don't even know when he's asleep," said Katie O'Malley, second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia, a volunteer in the Bwellle group.
He's always either in the hospital or trying to make money for the organization so that these campaigns can continue.
For future doctors and nurses like O'Malley coming from the US and Europe to join Bwell in the implementation of his tasks, it's an opportunity to practice they would never have had at home.
"We were able to assist in operations where we helped remove blood stains or keep the instruments for Dr. Bwelle," O'Malley said.
As a sophomore student, you would never have had that opportunity in America.
Volunteer students usually pay for their own travel to Cameroon, often arriving with donated medicines.
But upon arrival in Yaounde, their meals, transport and training pay for Bwell.
"He's a hero, no doubt," said O'Malley.
He gives his life to this organization, and his desire to help the people of Cameroon indefinitely.
For Bwell, almost constant workload is not a difficult test.
To help live a happy life for others, to fulfill the promise made to his father - this is what brings him great joy.
"I'm so happy when I do this job," said Bwell.
And I'm thinking of my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I'm doing this to make people laugh to reduce their pain.

For the "Russian mafia" in the United States finally fixed a new name - "Brother's circle"
This week, the blacklist of the "Russian mafia" in America was replenished with new names and four companies.
The US Treasury Department introduced three representatives of Russia, two citizens of Uzbekistan and an Israeli in the "Brother's Circle."
One of the Russians was the famous singer Grigory Leps, whom the United States suspects of transporting money for members of the group.
In total, in the black list of the United States, 22 people involved in the "Brother's Circle," and six affiliated organizations.
However, many experts have expressed doubts that such an organization really exists.
"The statement on the "Brother Circle" is more like an attempt to unify disparate criminal groups," said Mark Galeotti, an expert on organized crime and a professor at the University of New York.
In his opinion, the "Brother's Circle" reflects the popular perception of the "Russian mafia."
"I have not met anyone in Russian law enforcement agencies or anywhere else who would confirm the existence of such a criminal organization," Galeotti said.
Mr. Galeotti agrees with Professor George Mason University Liz Shelley.
"If they work together, it's more like a criminal network, but not an organization," she said.
In the middle of last year, Mark Galeotti suggested that the "Brother's Circle" unites to a greater extent close to the Russian thief in the law of Aslan Usoyan, known as Grandfather Hasan.
The criminal authority was assassinated in January this year.
So, the activities of Lashi Shushanashvili and Zakhaly Kalashov, who joined the list in 2012, were closely associated with Grandd Hassan, and another member of the list, Temuri Mirzoev, was a nephew of Deda Hassan.
However, Mr. Galeotti notes that some individuals are not relevant to Usoyan.
In his opinion, they were all united rather by common financial and criminal interests, such as the supply of drugs from Afghanistan.
Meanwhile, the scandal over the inclusion in the "Brother's Circle" Grigory Leps - the favorite singer of Russian President Vladimir Putin - attracted the attention of the Kremlin.
Naturally, we expect that we will receive more detailed information from our American partner colleagues, and therefore such a decision was made, why it was included in such lists, - said the press Secretary of the head of state Dmitry Peskov.
In any case, he (Leps) is a citizen of the Russian Federation.
As well as the interests of all citizens of the Russian Federation, its interests will be protected.
Tony Blair said he would take the chance to return as Britain's prime minister, but admits that a return is unlikely.
On the eve of an interview on the fifth anniversary of his departure from his post, the 59-year-old politician outlined his views on various aspects of domestic policy.
Since his resignation in June 2007, after a decade as leader, Blair has largely avoided discussing British policy, limiting most of his comments to foreign affairs and his role as ambassador in the four Middle East peacekeepers.
Asked if he would have returned to the post of Prime Minister, Blair, according to the London Evening Standard, said: "Yes, of course, but it is unlikely that this will happen, so ...
The head coach of Milan Massimiliano Allegri expressed regret over the draw's result in the match of the 10th round of the championship of Italy with Lazio.
The expert also noted that the failures at the start are due to a series of injuries to the leading players.
"I'm sorry we haven't managed to win," Allegri quotes Tmw.
The team played a good match, creating 3-4 good opportunities.
In the first half, we did not allow Lazio.
In the second, the Romans added, but in general I can't say that we lost concentration.
I should have won.
Last season we completed the task of getting into the Champions League.
Now we are lagging behind the schedule, but this is due to a whole series of injuries to key players.
Rami and Honda?
These are very good players, with character.
Our team is still good now.
Look at Kaka, who had a high-level meeting.
British police hand over Assange for extradition
British police today handed a notice of the extradition of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who took refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and asked for asylum.
Scotland Yard said they had handed over to a 40-year-old Australian an official demand to surrender with a demand to appear at the police station, adding that if this requirement was not met, he would be further subject to arrest.
Assange faces extradition to Sweden on charges of sexual offenses after he has exhausted his capabilities under British law, when the Supreme Court dismissed his appeal against extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would hand it over to the United States, he took refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London on June 19, asking the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard gave the 40-year-old man an official demand to surrender, which obliges him to arrive at the police station on the day and time of our choice, a spokesperson said.
It still violates the conditions of bail.
The Embassy refused to comment on the delivery of the notification to the police.
Assange fears that he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States to present him with possible charges of espionage after the publication of more than 250,000 U.S. diplomatic cables on the secrecy website WikiLeaks.
Now Roman Senchin is in Paris at the presentation of his novel "Yeltyshev," translated into French.
Recall that this novel became the finalist of four awards: "Clear glade," "Russian Booker," "National bestseller" and "Big Book."
And last year, the writer for this book was awarded the prize of the Government of the Russian Federation in the field of culture.
Roman Senchin is an undoubted leader in the generation of the current thirty-year-old and forty-year-old prose writers.
Almost every publication of its hard, built on modern life material of stories and stories causes he heated controversy among critics of various directions.
It can be argued that the articles collected together about Senchin's prose and journalism, reviews of his books and magazine publications create a curious and unexpected landscape of Russian literature from the late 1990s to the early 2010s.
In discussions about the works of "one of the most controversial contemporary writers," according to critic Sergei Chuprinin, the speech is for the most part about what its participants understand by the word "literature," as see the present and future not only of our literature, but also life.
Unfortunately, the volume of the book did not allow the inclusion of most of the articles and reviews from the regional media and the blogosphere.
Analytical and review articles are given, as a rule, in abbreviation in the sections "Abzacs..."
Snowden could be questioned in Russia
Former U.S. intelligence officer Edward Snowden is likely not to travel outside Russia to testify on cases of wiretapping German Chancellor Angela Merkel's telephone conversations.
As told Interfax on Friday, a source familiar with the situation, the American can answer the questions of representatives of the Prosecutor General's Office of Germany in writing or in turn in Russian.
The departure of Edward Snowden outside of Russia is almost excluded.
"In this case, he will lose refugee status and can be extradited to Washington by U.S. allies," the source said.
"At the same time, in principle, the Prosecutor General's Office of Germany could send representatives to the Russian Federation or transfer written questions to Snowden," - said the source, adding that this issue should be worked out at the interstate level.
Earlier, the deputy of the German Bundestag Hans-Christian Strebel said that Edward Snowden is ready to testify in the case of the wiretapping of the German Chancellor's negotiations by the American intelligence services.
Snowden is ready to testify to German law enforcement agencies either in Moscow or on the territory of Germany.
The former CIA officer said he knew a lot.
Despite the fact that the NSA blocked all his movements, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
However, for this it is necessary to clearly define all the conditions for his arrival," - said Strebrelet TV channel Euronews.
Snowden's lawyer Anatoly Kucheren, commenting on the statement of the source of Interfax, said that his client can cooperate with German investigators, but when and how - will decide himself.
U.S. citizen Edward Snowden, who worked for the US National Security Agency (NSA) and the CIA, fled to Hong Kong in May 2013, after which he published information about the secret operations of the US intelligence services on surveillance on the Internet.
Snowden flew through Moscow in transit, but could not leave the airport due to the fact that his passport was canceled by the US authorities, in absentia, and remained in the transit zone of Sheremetyevo airport until early August.
On August 1, Snowden received a document on granting him temporary asylum on the territory of Russia for a year and on the same day left Sheremetyevo.
Yesterday, the lawyer of the American Anatoly Kucherena said that his client got a job in a "large Russian company."
The NSA's surveillance of Angela Merkel was reported by German media last week.
According to journalists, the telephone conversations of the chancellor's Americans began to listen in 2002.
The surveillance station was allegedly at the U.S. Embassy in Berlin.
The German authorities after the publication of this information said that the surveillance of Merkel violates the laws and sovereignty of Germany.
The release of the Land Rover racing series
Inside are racing seats and six-point seat belts, as well as an internal communication system.
Additionally, you can get upgraded brakes, a package of services that provides access to the mechanics of Bowler Works, logistic support and storage of the car between events.
Drew Bowler, managing director of Bowler Motorsport, said: "Rally members who are contacting Bowler have changed.
Some of them are not experienced riders, but people looking for excitement, adventure and access to world-class events.
We are pleased to offer this way in partnership with Land Rover and MSA and believe that this format offers a new way to try various Rally disciplines in the UK and abroad, as well as prepare participants for the difficult conditions and realities of the rally raid.
We were very pleased to develop the Defender Challenge car - it will be a really exciting championship.
In addition, the Defender Challenge provides one day in February for training and testing, as well as the opportunity to participate in events in the desert in North Africa and the Middle East.
Children should study myths and legends as models of lifestyle, the author says.
The Tales of the Torah could show that a rough force cannot defeat the refined cunning, and the legends of King Arthur show how important it is to have a dream.
Saying that many myths will be "too wild, too scandalous and in some cases too obscene to teach in schools," Cross-Holland advocates for the "thorough selection" of the age-appropriate texts.
"I think it's wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education," he said.
I advocated the introduction of them into the training program for twenty years.
He added that "excessive moralization of authors and teachers" is chasing interest in children, and the main ideas are "sublimi" in fascinating stories.
Cross-Holland, who translated Beowulf from the Anglo-Saxon language, and also wrote a "Collebant of Norwegian Myths" for Penguin and British Folk Tales, said, "You certainly may have intentions, but you should keep them to yourself."
Perhaps a big difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need to feel some hope.
Not that everything should be simplified or lead to a happy ending, but it is necessary that there be an innate understanding of good and evil.
And this must be sublimated; revealed through history, not clearly formulated.
The old principle is to show, not tell.
Goldman Sachs warns of risks to Russian economy
Goldman Sachs has warned of growing risks for Russia's main driver of fragile economic growth - consumption.
This is primarily a crisis of non-payments on unsecured consumer loans and mass reductions in workers.
Our main concern now is not that growth has slowed, but rather the structure of this growth.
Recently, it is completely driven by consumption, which almost does not reduce the turnover," said Clemens Grafe, chief economist at Goldman Sachs for Russia, presenting yesterday the quarterly report of the investment bank on the Russian economy.
Now the nominal increase in wages in Russia is about 10%.
With inflation of 6%, it will be able to provide future consumer demand at about the current level, expect in Goldman Sachs.
But the profitability of Russian companies is falling, so, most likely, they will be engaged in optimizing the costs of personnel.
Today we see a significant increase in the share of wages in GDP: if wages are growing by 10%, then GDP - only 2%, - said Mr. Grafe.
The companies faced a reduction in profitability.
If it doesn't grow, it can lead to dismissals and increased unemployment.
It is impossible not to raise the salaries of Russian business, commented the chief economist of Barclays Capital in Russia and the CIS Vladimir Pantyushin.
Unemployment near historical lows, competition for workers is high.
To lure employees from the outside or retain the current, employers have to raise salaries.
Consumption in Russia is supported and very rapid growth of demand.
According to Mr. Grafe, due to the extremely high rates on consumer loans, this type of lending does not have a multiplicative effect on the country's economy.
"We did not see the benefits for the economy from the growth of demand, the money does not diverge on the economy, but returns to the same banks in the form of interest payments," the economist said.
But the problem is different - Goldman Sachs expect an increase in delays in unsecured loans.
They are taken mainly by poor people who have nothing to provide.
Interest on such loans is high.
As a result, they are not returned more often," Mr. Grafe said.
Therefore, the second threat to the growth of the economy in Russia is a possible crisis of non-payments on unsecured loans.
Director of the HSE Banking Institute Vasily Solodkov is already seeing signs of a brewing banking crisis.
Small credit institutions, without access to the cheap resources that state banks have, were forced to raise funds from the population at high interest rates.
In response, state banks came on the path of war and began to reduce credit rates, - continues the economist.
Small credit institutions cannot issue loans at the same interest, otherwise they will have a negative interest margin.
If state banks do not abandon dumping, Russia is in danger of a full-fledged banking crisis, believes Vasily Solodkov.
Deprivation of licenses of a number of banks in recent weeks, the economist considers the harbinger of mass collapse.
"The state banks themselves will not cope with such a situation: the deposit insurance system was not originally designed for a systemic crisis," the head of the institute warns.
But the growth of consumption will slow down without a crisis of non-payment, believe in the investment bank, - because of the refusal to index the salaries of civil servants and the military, laid down in the current version of the draft budget.
Part of the impact on consumption will be mitigated by the freezing of the tariffs of natural monopolies (and, as a result, a decrease in inflation).
But only partially: if the investment does not grow (and there are no prerequisites for this yet - see the increase in consumption will still slow down, confident in Goldman Sachs.
Vladimir Pantyushin from Barclays Capital does not yet see the prerequisites for the implementation of pessimistic scenarios.
"The main risk is the fall in the price of oil," he says.
According to him, the Russian economy will begin to shrink at the cost of oil below $ 90 per barrel.
Goldman Sachs also noted that the Central Bank is not yet able to reduce interest rates in the economy.
There is a paradoxical picture: inflation has decreased, and banks began to raise rates.
This may mean that they did not believe the Central Bank, which announced the transition to inflation targeting," Clemens Grafe said.
The interest policy of the Central Bank does not affect market rates, affects only the rates of interbank lending.
"For the Central Bank, this is the collapse of all hopes," Clemens Grafe estimated.
The money received at the auctions of the Central Bank, banks are used not for lending to the economy, but to manage their liquidity
As soon as the rate decreases, the exchange rate immediately changes, it means that the funds are trying to go on speculation against the ruble.
"Sooner or later, the Central Bank will understand that this strategy does not work," Mr. Grafe said and recalled that the state plans to launch the ruble into "free swimming" by the end of 2015.
But you will have to do it earlier, or raise the key rate of the Central Bank (5.5%), he believes.
According to him, the ruble is now artificially overestimated by 10%.
Ruble only one road - to weaken, - concludes the expert.
But if the Central Bank will drop a shadow of doubt in the financiers that the liquidation of the currency corridor is not part of the policy to weaken the ruble, it can bring down the ruble much stronger.
Snowden agrees to testify about Merkel's wiretapping
Bundestag deputy Hans-Christian Strebele met Moscow with Edward Snowden.
During the conversation, the issue of whether Snowden could be questioned as a witness by the Prosecutor General's Office of Germany in the case of a possible wiretapping of the phone of the German Chancellor specials to the US special forces.
Snowden expressed his readiness to testify.
The meeting could take place either in Moscow or in Germany.
He made it clear," Hans-Christian Strebel said, "that he knows a lot.
And despite the fact that the National Security Agency led by Kett Alexander blocked all his movements, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
However, it is necessary to clearly define all the conditions for his arrival. . .
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers are beginning to take action in response to the scandal surrounding U.S. spyware.
The Senate Intelligence Committee yesterday approved a bill imposing additional restrictions on the activities of the U.S. Department of electronic intelligence.
Air passengers can now use gadgets on planes (but not to call from a mobile phone)
Passengers will be able to use their electronic devices throughout the flight to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music, but not to speak on mobile phones, according to the long-awaited new guidelines published Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.
Passengers should not expect the changes to happen immediately.
How quickly such a change is being implemented will vary depending on the airline, FAU administrator Michael Huerta said at a press conference.
Airlines will have to show the FAA how their aircraft meet the new guidelines and that they update their training manuals for flight crew members and regulations to comply with the new guidelines.
The FAA said it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue were among the airlines that have already presented plans.
"Depending on the state of the plan, we could approve the expansion of the use of electronic devices very soon," - stated the FAU.
Currently, passengers are required to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the door of the aircraft closes.
They should not restart them until the plane reaches a height of 10,000 feet and the captain will not give them to "good."
Passengers should turn off their devices again when the plane is reduced to board, and do not turn them on until the aircraft is on the ground.
Under the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are adequately protected from electronic interference may allow passengers to use these devices during take-off, landing and steering, the FAA said.
Most new airliners and other aircraft modified so that passengers can use Wi-Fi at high altitudes are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Gleiding, president of the Association of Professional Flight Listeners, welcomed these changes.
"After the new policy is implemented safely (and we are going to work closely with the carrier to achieve this), it will be a win-win option.
We are frankly tired of feeling like school on duty when it comes to this question.
But an internet connection for surfing, email sharing, text messaging or data downloads would still be banned at an altitude of less than 10,000 feet, the agency said.
Passengers will be asked to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices to the aircraft mode.
Thus, there are still no "Trays" with friends of the intellectual Internet game, in which actor Alek Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011, when the acclaimed case occurred: the actor was removed from the plane of American Airlines for refusing to turn off the device at the time when the plane was at the exit to the landing.
And heavier devices, such as laptops, will still need to be placed in the luggage compartment, as they can injure someone if they fly around the cabin.
Calls from a mobile phone in flight will also be banned.
The regulatory powers on telephone calls belong to the Federal Communications Commission, not the FAA.
The FIA may lift the ban on some electronic devices during take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Council, the national safety expert at CBS News, said cell phones were still considered a risk.
"Cenotic phones are really a problem, not only because they can potentially interfere with navigation devices, but we know thanks to the FCS that they can interfere with cell phone towers when the plane is in the air," Rosenker said.
The industry advisory committee set up by the FAA to study the issue recommended last month that the government allow the wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, pressure has increased on the FAU to ease restrictions on their use.
Critics, such as Missouri Democratic Senator Claire McCusskill, argue that there is no good reason for security for the bans.
Respect for restrictions is also becoming increasingly difficult to ensure, as the use of devices has become ubiquitous.
Some studies show that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore instructions to turn off their devices.
The FAU began to restrict the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1966 in response to reports of interference for navigation and communication equipment, when passengers began to carry FM radio receivers - high-tech gadgets of the time.
The new airliners are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also being developed and approved by the FAA as resistant to electronic interference.
The airlines offer passengers the use of Wi-Fi at the cruiser's altitude for several years.
Aircraft modified for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of aircraft are adapted to the wider use of electronic devices under new guidelines, Huerta said.
Today's electronic devices typically emit radio signals much lower power than previous generations of devices.
Devices for reading e-books, for example, emit only minimal signals when turning pages.
But the signals become more powerful when the devices are downloaded or sent data.
Among those who sought to ease restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers was Amazon.com.
In 2011, the company's representatives downloaded a whole airliner with their devices for reading the electronic books Kindle and flew on it to check for problems, but did not find them.
The members of the FAU Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about whether the use of the devices posed any risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Air Passengers said that he considers the interference from the devices real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other committee members said there were only separate pilot reports confirming that the devices could interfere with the aircraft systems, and most of these messages are very old.
However, the committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to require passengers to disconnect the devices during landings on instruments in limited visibility.
A group of representatives of the tourism industry welcomed these changes, calling them a sensible step towards passengers who are now using many technological devices.
"We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that passenger comfort is not incompatible with safety and protection," said Roger Doe, Director General of the U.S. Travel Association.
Vilnius suspects Moscow in an attempt to slander Lithuanian president
Russia intends to carry out information provocations against high-ranking officials of Lithuania and the Eastern Partnership countries - such a statement was made by the BNS Agency in the Department of State Security of the Republic (DGB).
Information about this was published on the DELFI portal.
According to the report, in particular, Moscow is going to "speak" Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite and publish falsified documents allegedly found in the Russian State Archive, which relate to the facts from the biography of the Lithuanian leader.
According to the intelligence service, the preparation of the information attack is conducted by the Department of Analysis of the public processes of the administration of the President of Russia on interregional and cultural relations with foreign countries.
The structure is headed by Yevhen Umerenkov, who visited Lithuania more than once and took part in the congress of the Lithuanian People's Party.
Also, the participant of the operation is allegedly an employee of the department B. Smirnov.
According to the intelligence service, Smirnov under the cover of scientific work until the end of 2012 regularly came to Lithuania and contacted local politicians, political scientists and media representatives.
Now Smirnov is banned from entering the country.
On the eve of the Lithuanian President Grybauskaite said that she knows about the information that is being prepared for her.
In her opinion, the main reason is the successful presidency of Lithuania in the Council of the European Union and "the country's desire for energy independence."
The Lithuanian leader has repeatedly criticized the actions of the Russian authorities.
So she said that in the Kremlin, Lithuania is "not respectful enough."
In addition, Grybauskaite accused the head of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin of putting forward "only only demands" to Lithuania.
Recall that in September, Rospotrebnadzor suspended the import of Lithuanian "milk" to Russia.
It was reported that the quality of the products does not meet sanitary and epidemiological standards.
Then the Lithuanian leader said that if Russia does not lift the ban, the government of the country should prepare an appeal to the WTO.
New antinicotine vaccine could deprive the process of smoking pleasure
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could deprive the process of smoking cigarette pleasure.
One dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice from nicotine addiction for life.
Further tests are needed before the human trials, which will take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weil Cornell Medical College in New York said the first results are encouraging.
"We very much hope that such a vaccine strategy can finally help the millions of smokers who have tried to quit by trying to try all the methods on the market today, but found that their nicotine addiction is strong enough to overcome it with these modern means, Professor Cornell said.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been developed to carry genetic information for the production of antinicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then begin to produce a stable flow of antibodies.
Antibodies track track any nicotine molecules in the blood, neutralizing them before they reach the brain, preventing the smoker from getting nicotine.
In the tests, vaccinated mice, which were subsequently given nicotine, continued their normal activities.
And the mice that were not given the vaccine were relaxed, and this is a sign that nicotine reached their brains, the researchers say.
These experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines have failed because they contained antibodies.
To maintain a high level of antibodies, injections had to be done so often that they turned out to be expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be much lower because it turns liver cells into antibody factories.
Professor Crystal said that if the future human vaccine was completely safe, it could be given to children before they have a desire to try a cigarette, preventing nicotine addiction.
But it's more likely that it will be used by smokers to quit smoking.
They will know that if they start smoking again, they won't get this pleasure because of the nicotine vaccine, and it can help them get rid of this habit," he said.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but warned that more research was needed.
Pre-Winter hassle.

Frontier Airlines will charge a fee for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge passengers up to $100 for carrying hand luggage on board their flight.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $100 for hand luggage and $2 for coffee or soda, although their announcement on Wednesday said that passengers could keep the entire bank.
The new fee for hand luggage applies to bags in the upper luggage compartments, so the small bags placed under the seat will remain free.
Frontier said it would charge $25 if the fee is paid in advance, and $100 if travelers pay only when they're on board.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said $100 pay should make passengers take care of the payment in advance.
"We don't want to charge a fee for that," she said.
The airlines began charging for the first and second bags in the luggage in 2008.
Passengers trying to avoid these fees are filled as long as they can, in a hand luggage placed in the upper luggage compartments, which often lacks space in these compartments.
Fees are one way to get passengers to carry less on board.
O'Malley said that this new fee isn't really for making money.
The fact is that Frontier's most loyal customers say that finding a place in the upper luggage compartments is becoming more difficult.
Passengers who buy tickets on the airline's website will not have to pay.
This means that one passenger in the queue at the frontier flight can be able to carry the bag for free, while the next passenger in the queue can pay $100 for the same bag.
O'Malley said the procedure change on the website and at the Frontier check-in counters is designed to ensure that passengers will be aware of the fee before they get to the landing.
The new collection of the Frontier for hand luggage will not begin to be charged until the summer, although the date has not yet been set.
Passengers often complain about the payment for luggage and other charges, but airlines adore them.
They claim that the baggage handles the money, and the passengers who need this service must pay for it.
Many on Wall Street believe the addition of luggage charges is a sign that airlines charge enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of loss.
However, most of them did not concern the fees for hand luggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. introduced the first pick for the hand luggage three years ago, and another discounter Allegiant Air later followed suit.
The only other airline with such a fee is the Hungarian Wizz Air, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who is closely monitoring additional fees.
According to him, in a report of December 2011, the fee for hand luggage brings Spirit $50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines executive, recently flew a Spirit flight, and he was wondering that he would find him at the landing when passengers would face an unusual duty charge for hand luggage.
"The landing process was the smoothest I've seen in my career in the airlines," he said.
I was expecting to see the gnashing of the teeth and the appearance of a fight at the exit to the landing.
The plane was full, he said, and the landing was fast.
Frontier also follows the Spirit for $2 for a fee of $2 per coffee, tea, soda or juice.
Frontier said passengers who receive soda or juice can keep the entire jar and that the levization of coffee will be provided free of charge.
It will still be free to water.
US Airways tried to charge a drink for a short time, but abandoned it seven months later, after passengers began to complain and no other major airline followed suit.
The Frontier's hand luggage levying a baggage initiative when passengers don't buy tickets directly from the airline, this is its latest measure to attract customers to their website.
Airlines pay online ticket sellers, such as Orbitz, from $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This gave all airlines an incentive to encourage passengers to buy tickets directly from them, rather than to contact a travel online agency.
However, Frontier went the farthest in this area.
In September, she began giving half the bonus miles of a frequent fly passenger to customers who bought tickets through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, she cut the award of miles to 25 percent of the mile of the trip.
A 1,000-mile trip with Frontier, purchased from an online travel agency, would have allowed 250 miles.
In addition, passengers can choose a place in advance only if they buy tickets directly on the Frontier website.
Frontier has a base of loyal customers in her hometown of Denver, but her business is shrinking and losing.
Revenue fell by 9 percent, and flight capabilities fell by almost 13 percent in the first quarter, according to financial results published Wednesday by parent company Turkey Airlines.
The Republic is trying to correct Frontier's finances as part of the airline's sale.
Putin achieved impunity for his friend Assad
And now - news from across the ocean, namely from Syria, where, as we learned today, Israel struck Russian-made missiles, which reportedly were destined for Hezbollah.
Today, Syria has fulfilled an important condition - to destroy its production of chemical weapons by November 1.
This was done within the framework of the agreement reached with the assistance of Russia and allowed the United States not to conduct a military operation, which they came close this summer.
Our chief international correspondent, Richard Engel, will tell about the weapons and what all this means for the Syrian president.
Washington said the Assad regime would be punished for it.
More than 1,400 civilians, including hundreds of children, were killed in poison gas in August.
The punishment has come.
But not in the form of American bombings, but in the form of a deal that Assad's friend made - Vladimir Putin.
Syria will abandon its chemical weapons by the middle of next year.
Today is an important milestone.
A group of international experts reported that Syria had disabled the declared chemical weapons factories.
A longer-term and more difficult task is to destroy tons of chemical weapons and its components.
As we understand, it is about a thousand tons.
Washington used to say that Assad's days are numbered.
I think Assad should go.
The question is not whether it will happen, but when it will happen.
He is no longer legitimate and must leave.
But Assad is still there.
And he feels more confident.
His troops still use artillery, rockets and napalm.
His opponents are divided and poorly armed.
His people are forced to leave their homes, many are hungry.
Some have to eat leaves and cats.
Many believe that Bashar al-Assad escaped punishment for mass murder.
The agreement on chemical weapons is called the success of diplomacy, the inspectors were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and Assad himself made the impression of a person ready for cooperation.
Today in Washington, the U.S. Ambassador in Syria had to answer difficult questions.
When a child dies of starvation, his mother is hardly easier because he was not killed with chemical weapons.
Assad's still holding on.
It changes the gun to power.
Tomich will work 240 hours for an extremist video in the social network
The Leninsky district court of Tomsk sentenced to 240 hours of mandatory work of a resident of the city, who posted a video of an extremist nature on the social network, a representative of the press service of the regional court told RIA Novosti on Friday.
According to the court, in March 2013, the man posted on his page in the popular social network video, which is included in the federal list of extremist materials.
A criminal case was opened against him under the article of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation "Actions aimed at inciting hatred and hostility, as well as humiliating the dignity of a person committed publicly."
"The Leninsky district court considered this case in a special order and found the man guilty of committing the above crime, imposing a punishment in the form of 240 hours of mandatory work," - said the Agency.
She added that the man fully pleaded guilty.
Parents of intersex children can choose "undefined gender"
Germany was the first European country to recognize the third sex in children born to intermediate-type outdoor genitals.
Newborns will no longer be required to ascribe a male or female sex.
The new law does not require parents to name any sex of such children, allowing parents to indicate the sex as "indefinite" or uninstalled in their birth certificates.
The purpose of the law was to relieve pressure from parents who could make hasty decisions about the operation to assign sex to newborns and to counter discrimination against intersex people.
One intersex person, according to the BBC, said many years later: "I'm not a man or a woman."
I'll stay a patchwork created by doctors with bruises and scars.
About one in 2,000 children born annually is neither a boy nor a girl.
They have intersexuality, one of about 60 pathological conditions that are diagnosed with sexual developmental disorders - a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, gohnads (ovaries or testes) or unusually developed external genital organs.
Wallis Simpson was probably intersex.
Gender identification has not yet been sufficiently studied, but most experts in the U.S. say that if the gender cannot be determined, it is better to use all the available information and assign it than to wait for and track the psychological and physical development of the child before the operation, if at all.
A New York psychiatrist, Dr. Jack Dr. Dr. Dresher, who specializes in gender identity issues, said the new German law would sound like a good idea.
Intersex children create an ethical dilemma.
Some people have life-threatening disorders that require surgery, but most children do not have them.
You can assign the floor without surgery and then see how the personality develops.
The science of how a child will develop a gender identity is not too accurate.
No one can answer questions about why this is happening.
It's like a mystery about why people are gay.
The report, sent to the European Commission in 2011, describes intersex people as different from transsexual or transgender, since their condition is not related to gender, but to their biological structure, which does not correspond exclusively to the male or female sex, but is typical for both at the same time or not characteristic of any of them.
These characteristics can manifest in secondary sex traits, such as muscle mass, hair, breast and body content; primary sex traits such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in employment, as well as the level of harassment, cruelty and prejudice crimes.
Boys with gender disabilities now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal are already allowing adults to put the male, female or third half in their official documents.
In June, Australia's 52-year-old resident, Norrie May-Uelby, became the world's first recognized as a "sexual" to defend the right in court to maintain a "uncertain" sexual status for life.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, German passports will use the third designation in addition to M and F-X, i.e. intersex.
In neighboring France, gender issues still cause controversy, according to the news release on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of lawmakers from France, this prominent Catholic country, signed a petition to seize the gender theory from school textbooks.
The American website Catholic Online also expressed disagreement with the German law, writing that "in a situation where the world is drawn into a new state where the sex is a matter of choice, and sexual activity is not, we turn two more pillars of civilization.
One mother of a newborn baby from Maryland also told the Baby Zone website that she would prefer children to have a floor at birth.
"Sweeting the child is hard enough and without additional restrictions, especially if you don't know the sex of your child," she told the website for her parents.
Children need stability and confidence.
Historically, children born with masculine and female genital organs were called hermaphrodites, by the name of a beautiful Greek god who possessed signs of both sexes.
And just a decade ago, the medical community perceived gender as a sheet on which to erase everything, and then draw again.
But now many are challenging the ethical grounds for surgery, knowing that gender identity is complex, and doctors sometimes make the wrong choices, not knowing how the child will perceive the sex he has matured when he grows up.
In the mid-twentieth century, it was called an "emergency psychiatric case," Drescher said.
When these children were born, you didn't call a psychiatrist - you called the surgeon.
The dominant theory of how to treat children with intermediate-type genitals was suggested by Dr. John Mani of Johns Hopkins University, who believed that gender could easily be changed.
He coined the term "gender identity" and argued that environmental signals, including social ones, are how parents grow a child - interacting with the child's genes and hormones, determining whether a person would consider himself a man or a woman.
But in one case of 1966, known as John/John, his theories were in question.
He advised the boy's parents, whose penis was damaged during careless circumcision, to castrate the child completely, removing his testicles, and raising him as a girl.
"Mani presented the case as a successful example of a transition, but it wasn't," Drescher said.
When the boy was about 15 years old, he again became a boy and married a woman.
At the age of 38, he committed suicide.
Dresber said that some doctors are still applying this model.
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, people who survived these sex-change operations, declared themselves, "dissatisfied with the result."
This was the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana who was born with the men's XY chromosomes, but intermediate-type genitals.
The doctors could not determine exactly whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis, and were convinced that he would never be able to live a man's "full life."
Therefore, shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce's outer genital and testicles were surgically removed, and he was raised as a girl.
He was given female hormones at the age of 12.
I knew I wasn't a girl, he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he was given vaginoplastus.
But while depressed and realizing that something was wrong, he demanded medical documentation.
What he found out was terrible.
I was sterilized at birth, and no one ever told me about it.
Bruce was born with sexual impairment, which prevented his body from producing enough testosterone for the normal development of the genitals.
Learning the truth, he again became a man, getting shots of testosterone and removing his breasts.
The operation made him fruitless.
Today, he advocates for others in an organization called the Interface Project, trying to normalize the perception of people with intersexism.
But Anne Tamard-Mattis, executive director of the Californian Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that German law is encouraging labeling and stigma.
Many activists are concerned that the German law will encourage parents to make hasty decisions and give the child an "indefinite gender," she said.
We fear that he will facilitate the intervention.
We believe that it is better to assign a male or female gender, and then wait.
But we have not yet seen how this law will manifest itself, so all we can do is make assumptions.
Tamard-Mattis said her organization supported the Australian law, as hedged in an Australian law, as hedgehod adults to opt for the third sex.
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about formal gender," she says.
German law implies its attrition at birth.
It's a battle that young children shouldn't join at this stage.
When they grow up, they will be able to make decisions about their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a radio mammologist from Pittsburgh who has a daughter with sexual developmental disorders and that helps hundreds of other people in the support group, said that German law would support both parents and children.
Baratz's daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but she has a sexual impairment called "the syndrome of complete androgens" insensitivity.
Since her androgenic receptors are not working correctly, Katie has developed female signs.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and no ovaries.
Now, at the age of 29, Katie is married and residency in child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she is barren, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or gestational surrogacy.
"The law gives parents time not to make hasty decisions themselves," Baraz said.
It gives them time to do some tests and understand the situation, as well as the period of time before they write the male or female.
In this case, you are ok - raise a child, love the child.
You have a wonderful child and you feel joy.
We don't need to hastily do an operation that is irreversible.
It allows children to participate in the decision and eliminates the excitement that drives parents because they don't feel they're doing the right thing," she said.
In the end, the child will decide with which floor he or she is more comfortable, and that's great.
This gives children the opportunity to make a decision on their own.
US Secretary of State: intelligence agencies sometimes "go too far" when collecting data
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry admitted that when collecting data and wiretaps, American intelligence agencies sometimes "go too far," however, the politician noted that the information that appeared in the media about the wiretapping of 70 million people is not true.
I assure you that innocent people were not injured in this process, but there was an attempt to collect information.
Yes, in some cases, it went too far and was illegal.
I admit it, as the president admits... and we will ensure that this does not happen in the future," - quotes the Secretary of state of the AFP.
Experts of equestrian events coming to Cardiff to fight for the prize "Horse of the Year" knew that the competition would be very high.
But no one was ready for the appearance of three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Not even a schoolboy, just a few months before that, who took his first steps, this baby with his pet Shetland ponies Toffi rimmed through three rounds to easily take the main prize, leaving 30 adult rivals far behind.
This inseparable couple - the same height - has received high marks for the appearance, behavior and style at the annual competition, which is held by the Sunnibenk equestrian center in the city of Radri near Cardiff.
Having come out into the general review against the background of men and women in elegant hats-rings, he moved his cap and proudly spent a circle of two-year-old Toffy.
The judges praised Fenton for his not at least years developed innate abilities of handling horses.
And Toffy received the highest rating for the appearance and character.
Fentone was given to Toffy on his third birthday in March last year, and since then he has been engaged in a Shetland ponies every day.
His 30-year-old mother, Donna, said: "Fenton and Toffy make up a beautiful duo."
They had a lot of rivals, but the two left with a gold cup and a rose.
It was just his second performance with Toffey, and we were all thrilled when he won.
Completely unfamiliar people in the arena considered him so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
This boy from the village of Nantiloglo, near Abb Vale in South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howels, who has been carrying horses for more than 10 years.
Ms. Howels said: "The entire public was amazed, and everyone shouted the approving exclamations and clapped.
He ran down the sand along the entire length of the arena and, although he looked so tiny, he did his job well.
Fenton is crazy about animals - he loves horses, tractors, and farms, and he has two chickens he cares about.
Judging by the way he started, he will soon be participating in the "Hall of the Year" and I am sure that he will perform well.
A representative of this annual equestrian exhibition said: "Fenntau is only three years old, but he knows how to handle his pony.
Together they are a great team.
The judges noted Fenton and Toffy for their appearance and for how they presented themselves at the show ring.
They evaluate the coherence of the performances of the pony and the breeder - Fenton and Toffy were the best in the ring.
I am sure that Fenton was helped by his attractive outfit, he really looked good in his role.
A regular bus overturned in Altai.
In the Rubtsovsky district of the Altai Territory, a regular bus PAZ overturned.
As a result of the accident, according to the updated data, 13 people were injured, the regional department of the Ministry of Emergency Situations reported.
Earlier, law enforcement agencies of the region reported 10 victims.
According to the department, the accident occurred at about 9 a.m. local time on the road Novonikolaevka - Vishnevka, 1 kilometer from Novonikolaevka.
In the bus, which was going from Rubtsovsk to Vishnevka, there were 12 passengers and the driver, all suffered injuries of varying severity and were hospitalized.
Eleven of the victims were taken to the City Hospital No. 1 of Rubtsovsk, two people were hospitalized in the CRRB of Rubtsovsk.
The court suspended the enforcement of the decision on the practice of "stop-and-see" in the New York Police Department
On Thursday, the Federal District Court of Appeal suspended the execution of a court order requiring changes to the program to stop-and-see the New York Police Department, and removed the judge from the case.
The U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals said that the execution of Judge Shira Sheindlin's decisions would be suspended pending the results of the appeal filed by the city.
In August, the judge ruled that the city had violated the constitution in the way he carried out a program on street detentions and interrogations.
The city filed an appeal against its decision and rulings on corrective measures, including an order to appoint a controller to help the police station change the practice of work and the related training program.
On Thursday, the court of appeal heard the debate of the parties on the request for the suspension of the case.
The court of appeal stated the need to disqualify the judge because it violated the code of conduct of U.S. judges and did not consider it necessary to avoid a demonstration of bias, partly because of a series of interviews in the media and official statements containing a public response to criticism of the court.
The judge ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people, unreasonably appealing to blacks and Hispanics under the program to stop-and-find.
It appointed an external controller to oversee large-scale changes, which include policy, training and control reforms, and also decided to launch a pilot program to test tele-enclosed video cameras in those police stations where most of the detentions occur.
In August, New York decided to stop the practice of storing the names and addresses of people whose cases were discontinued after a police check.
The city's appeal is due after 14 March 2014.
The tactic was criticized by many civil rights lawyers to stop and search.
The search has been practiced in some form for decades, but the number of documented stops has increased dramatically under the administration of independent mayor Michael Bloomberg, reaching an absolute record of 684,330 people, most of them black and Hispanics.
In 2004, four people, all representatives of national minorities, filed a class action lawsuit.
Proponents of the change in the program to stop-and-to-finite at the New York Police Department say these changes will put an end to unfair practices, create a more reliable and effective police service, and may affect how other police departments implement the practice.
Opponents argue that the changes will reduce the morale of the police, not the level of crime, lead to unnecessary spending of money and will not solve the more global problem of difficult conditions in the police due to the reduction of the number of officers by several thousand over the past decade.
The judge noted that she was not discontinuing the practice of "stop-and-finding," which corresponds to the constitution, but changes the way the New York police stop people.
Azarov promised the Ukrainians the collapse of prices for goods after the signing of the association with the European Union
Prime Minister of Ukraine Mykola Azarov is convinced that prices in the country will decrease significantly after the country signs an association agreement with the European Union.
He said this in the course of communication with readers of his page on Facebook.
I can definitely say that prices are determined by a large number of factors, among which there are, including customs payments.
So, after the signing of the agreement and the entry into force of the provision on the Free Trade Zone, the level of customs duties on imports of goods from the EU will decrease significantly.
This will mean that prices should also fall.
"This is about goods that come from the EU countries," Azarov wrote.
As for other goods, the impact of the agreement on prices will not be so direct, it will be indirect.
However, there should not be a price increase either.
Therefore, reports on billboards, which have recently appeared quite a lot in our country, that the association with the EU is a rise in prices, this is not quite the case, or to be more precise to say - not at all the way," Azarov concluded.
$325 million rescue package for Tasmania's health care
The federal government insists that a $325 million rescue package for Tasmania's weakened health system will be supplemented by harsh conditions that ensure that the state government doesn't waste.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Pliberston announced that the Commonwealth is taking urgent measures to prevent the crisis caused by the aging of the population of this island state, a higher level of chronic disease and system restrictions.
The decision to finance for four years was made after consultations of the government with independent MP Tasmania Andrew Wilkie.
The government has proposed a package of emergency rescue measures, which, we believe, will solve the specific problems facing the state, - said today Mrs. Plibersek.
The $325 million package includes $31 million for the blitz campaign for planned operations.
Another 2,600 operations, including orthopedic and cataract removal operations, will help to overcome the lag.
There is also money for clinics taking patients without prior appointment, in Hobart and Lonestone, to improve the quality of care after the hospital, training medical professionals, mental health services and the introduction of personal electronic medical records systems in local hospitals.
"These investments will go on the ideas expressed by the advanced doctors on how to better help the Tasmania health system," Ms. Plibers said.
The Minister insisted that the government of Tasmania would work in strict accountability and responsibility.
The prison will need to maintain current levels of funding in order to receive Commonwealth cash, and report monthly on where it spends these additional funds.
A commission of three will be established to ensure that the staff provides services as efficiently and as efficient as possible.
Mr. Wilkie said today that $325 million will not solve anything if they are not followed by a genuine reform that will put Tasmania's health care system on a more sustainable basis.
However, he praised the Government for responding to his request for urgent assistance, which he first contacted the Prime Minister in early May.
"I hope that the federal aid package will greatly facilitate the removal of the state's health system from a critical state," Mr Wilkie said.
According to the state government, these additional selective procedures largely offset recent cuts.
But federal opposition health official Peter Dutton believes that today's statement is a "decision similar to the plaster."
The reason we're here is because the state's Labour government vomited $430 million from the health care system," he told ABC TV.
When the state government tears off nearly half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth invests $300 million, you can't pretend it's good news.
Mr. Dutton asked Ms. Plibers to ensure that no dollar from the rescue package would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
The cry of Obama's voter despair
I voted for President Obama twice, sharing hope for change.
He says that Obama has allowed Republican obstructionism to nullify a commendable effort.
Ostroktationism cannot justify problems with the website of the reformed health system of Obama, drone attacks
The memoirs of the 2008 Obama campaign are a sad reminder of what might have been
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year student at Harvard University School of Medicine.
I'm reading a terribly sad book these days.
I thought that this book would inspire me during a time of despondency in the second year of the medical faculty and revive a sense of hope in me.
It's called "The Bizarreness" is called "The Bolder" and it's the memoirs of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finish writing reports on my patients and going to bed tonight, this book brings me back to a time when the politician was inspiring millions of people and speaking.
The election victory was impressive, and the leading news programs paused to understand this historic moment.
My classmates were crying for joy, and my parents took care of all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of strategists was supposed to come to the White House, and the people were ready for change.
At the time of Obama's inauguration in 2008, his support level was 82 percent.
Then I close the book.
Return to the present is a rough awakening, like pulling out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember those days of optimism - they seem to be a distant memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I dropped my first ballot, the changes have indeed occurred.
It was something I couldn't even imagine.
I pay tribute to Obama for his great and varied achievements, from the passage of the Affordable Medical Care Act to the withdrawal of our military from Iraq, the repeal of the rule, don't tell me, the murder of Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that party obstructionism has blocked too many attempts to move our country forward: immigration reform, the possibility of choosing public health and closing the base in Guantanamo, among others.
But after countless times, when I was on the side of the Obama administration, defending it in front of colleagues and peers, I ran out of explanations that I can provide.
I reached a point of political despair.
Republican obstructionism cannot explain permission to wiretap foreign leaders or drone strikes on innocent children in other countries.
He cannot explain the collection of data on the private life of Americans by the National Security Agency or the prosecution of whistleblowers revealing government misconduct.
He cannot explain the murder of an American citizen Anwar al-Awlaki without trial or non-compliance with government funding and spending limits during presidential campaigns.
He cannot justify the findings of the report, which says that the efforts made by the White House to silence the media are the most aggressive... the time of the Nixon administration.
And recently, it can't justify what it hasn't been possible to develop a simple website for more than three years after the signing of the Affordable Care Act.
I don't know if I would expect that.
Should I understand at the age of 18 that leadership may contradict the political campaigns that precede it?
It is obvious that the work in an elected position is not a predictable program of action, since our public dialogue will be shaped by the opposition political party and such occasional events as the Newtown massacre.
However, according to all the examples listed by me above, it is clear that they were largely their own choice of the administration.
And that's what bothers me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was an incomprehensible and rough alternative, it seemed that he could not make a decision on his own policies or views.
I thought that in his second term, Obama, freed from the pressure of future elections, would live up to the hopes we had heard of for such a long time.
However, when Obama's rating dropped below 45 percent this week, it became much more difficult to return to 2008 through this book.
It makes me longing for many promises that have gone away.
This week I read the part of the book that describes how Clinton inflicted a deafening defeat in the Pennsylvania primary election.
At a meeting on the analysis of the reasons for the failure, he told his staff that they should go back to normal and remain true to their goal.
"I want us to get our appeal back," he said.
We must remember who we are.
Five years have passed, Mr. President, and I totally agree with you.

Egypt hosts first freely elected president
Mohammed Morsi takes the oath, but the day of his celebration is unlikely to mark the end of the political struggle in Egypt.
ISLAMIST Mohammed Morsi promised "New Egypt" when he took the oath, becoming the country's first freely elected president, replacing Hosni Mubarak, who was overthrown 16 months ago.
At his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and the fifth head of state in Egypt after the overthrow of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He took the oath before 18 judges in black robes in a courthouse on the banks of the Nile, built in the style of an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are aspire to a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic," Morsi said during a ceremony shown live on state television.
"Today, the Egyptian people laid the foundations for a new life - absolute freedom, true democracy and stability," said Morsi, a 60-year-old engineer with an American-based education from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that for most of its 84 years of existence was a banned organization that served as a target for the brutal actions of successive governments.
The building was guarded by hundreds of soldiers and policemen when Morsi arrived with a small tuple shortly after 11 a.m. local time.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered at the courthouse to welcome the new president, and, unlike the Mubarak-era presidential pump, the movement was stopped only for a short time to miss his convoy on a normally busy road connecting the city center with the southern suburbs.
Although Morsi was ridiculed as a non-charismatic "spare wheel" - Brothers, his personal prestige has grown sharply since his victory and Friday's performance, in which he tried to present himself as a candidate not only the Islamists, but also all those who want to bring to an end the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian Mubarak.
"Today, Egypt is a civilian, national, constitutional and modern state," said Morsi, dressed in a blue business suit with a red tie, to the judges in a wooden panel where he took the oath.
Morsi later went to Cairo University, where he was to give his inaugural speech.
He was given an official reception with the army orchestra, which performed the national anthem, during which he stood at the stand "Smirno."
There was a military officer Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi.
His arrival was greeted with the slogan "Army and the people" - one hand, which chanted hundreds of those gathered in the main lecture hall of the university.
Founded in 1908 as a basin of secular education, Cairo University in the 1970s became a stronghold of Islamist student groups.
Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, where an uprising was born that culminated in Mubarak's authoritarian rule last year, and promised to reclaim the powers of the president, whom his post was stripped of by the military council that accepted the cases from the deposed leader.
But having agreed to take the official oath before the court, and not before the parliament, as it is customary, he does the will of the military, and this is a sign that the struggle for power will continue.
Morsi's speech in Tahrir Square was filled with theatrical populist gestures.
Schools urged to pay more attention to mathematics, spelling and grammar
School courses in English literature will require students to study at least one Shakespearean play, a novel of the 19th century, romantic poetry, and modern British fiction since 1914.
The exam will also feature "non-program texts" to encourage more extensive reading.
The combined course of English literature and language will be abolished.
From 2015, students will be required to take a separate final exam in the language, with persistent recommendations for choosing English literature as a separate exam.
The Department of Education is due to release new curricula in English and Mathematics, the first subjects to be radically revised tomorrow.
It will make changes to other major items next year.
The regulatory body in the field of exams OFQUAL will present the revised structure of the final examinations of secondary school, with a new system of assessments and less program of work.
Speaking in the summer, Education Secretary Michael Gove said there was a broad consensus that we must reform our exam system to regain public confidence, insisting that school graduation exams would be more complex, more ambitious, and more stringent.
Studies show that English schools devote less time to math (116 hours a year, or three hours a week for a quarter) than in most countries.
Australian schools give an average of 143 hours a year, and in Singapore, students work for about 138 hours.
Although there will be no formal requirement to devote more time to the math schedule, coalition sources said that large-scale school graduation exams in mathematics combined with an increased ratio in the rating table are likely to serve as an incentive to provide schools with additional training on the subject.
In the curriculum, more attention will be paid to real-life tasks, including financial mathematics.
Is football the reason for discord?
In the state Duma within the framework of the "Open Tribune" politicians and experts talked about how to maintain national peace in Russia.
Among the proposals was this: to ban football in the North Caucasus, because from this game - only scandals and discord.
Speaker Sergei Naryshkin recalled the recent events in Biryulev and said that in order to reduce the "degree of tension in society," politicians and the media should be correct in statements.
Probably, he was referring to the recent scandal with Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who in one of the TV programs threatened to surround the Caucasus with barbed wire, if they do not want to limit the birth rate.
All the speakers spoke about measures to regulate migration from the CIS countries, and about measures to harmonize relations between the peoples inhabiting Russia, which gave the discussion turmoil.
Maxim Grigoriev said that the events in Biryulev are "a model conflict that could be predicted," but "we have too many people and instances answer these questions," and seven babysitters without the eye.
The concept of multiculturalism, which for a long time in relation to migrants, Europe, in the opinion of the public, has failed, and it is necessary to look for its way.
Historian Yuri Petrov had high hopes for a new unified history textbook.
"It is still necessary to create a manual on the history of the culture of the peoples of the country, so that schoolchildren in Tatarstan know that people live in Dagestan, and vice versa," he said.
Gennady Zyuganov proposed to introduce criminal liability for "calls to dismember Russia": "If in the United States to say on the radio that it is necessary to give Alaska to Russia, you will be arrested and given 20 years in prison!"
Vladimir Zhirinovsky tried very hard "not to kindle."
As usual, in everything, he accused journalists who bring sick and acute national problems to public discussion: "There is little to say in the heat of controversy!"
The leader of the faction "United Russia" Vladimir Vasilyev immediately advised journalists to conclude a "chart" and agree to talk on this topic carefully, and then the same obligations can be made on politicians.
We have adopted about 30 laws that regulate migration, and order is generally established, Mr. Vasiliev said.
As an example, he cited a law that holds the regional and municipal authorities responsible for interethnic peace on their territory.
But Lyudmila Andrichenko was not shared with enthusiasm about this law: it has "no clear ideas about the adaptation of migrants, about its mechanisms and limits.
So, the subjects will interpret differently the scope of these powers.
In addition, municipalities do not have the staff necessary to solve such complex issues, there are no means, and methodological recommendations that they can use, the center does not give them.
The head of the Duma Committee on Nationalities Gadzhimet Safaraliev proposed to create a special department with the formidable name "Ministry of National Security," which would deal with issues of national policy.
But Valery Tishkov, who in the 90s headed a similar department, abolished later, opposed.
It is enough to have at the federal level a special person, "man without a portfolio," which could be addressed if anything.
"We walk along the edge, the shells are torn nearby, it is very important for representatives of different ethnic groups and religions to oppose provocations together, and this work should receive decent information support," - said the representative of the ROC on relations with society Vsevolod Chaplin.
No neutrality of the state in relation to dangerous ideologies, including, in his opinion, should not be.
Here Oleg Nilov took the discussion in an unexpected course: "More talented people than in Chechnya or Dagestan, you still need to look for, but they are pushed on the wrong path, not on the road," he said.
"Not that road" is the development of football: "The football player is beaten by the whole crowd, then the flags are burned, then comrades throw each other's stones.
Maybe we don't need that kind of football.
There is another sport - rugby is called...
"They will not be in the world in this sport!" - I spoke hotly with right-handed.
No one will play in the rugby in the Caucasus! Mr. Zhirinovsky intervened.
You'll also offer curling to them!
It is necessary to know the national features, it is like to offer the Georgian "Zaporozhets."
In Yaroslavl, representatives of the Moscow club distinguished themselves with wild behavior in the stands - during the game with the local club.
Football will have to be banned across the country.
Recognitions of the National Security Agency strengthens the paranade corporations with regard to state surveillance
On a warm day in late August, a German police helicopter flew low over the US Consulate in Frankfurt, the German capital.
According to the instruction of the Federal Constitution Protection Service (BfV), the German Internal Intelligence Service, his mission was to photograph the roof of the U.S. office building, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media say that BfV hoped to find antennas of eavesdropping devices, and these actions led to talks between the US and the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin.
James Clapper, director of U.S. National Intelligence, again assured in September that the U.S. does not use the capabilities of foreign intelligence to steal foreign companies in the interests of U.S. companies to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits.
But since Edward Snowden, a contract employee who became a whistleblower, has begun publishing his treasury of U.S. intelligence secrets, European governments and company executives are no longer sure if the director can answer the director.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency monitored the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and gained access to data stored by U.S. cloud service providers, including Google and Yahoo, lifted the paratroop corporations caused by state surveillance to new heights.
The last straw was the news that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone was being tapped, perhaps for about ten years.
If the most influential person in Europe can become a target, then, of course, the potential targets are business leaders.
Snowden made the intensive cooperation between the U.S. intelligence services and companies obvious.
I think it's likely that this data is used with mutual benefit.
Germany must wake up, says Oliver Grun, president of BITMi, which represents Germany's small and medium-sized IT companies.
German companies are convinced that the U.S. now poses almost the same risk as China in industrial espionage and data theft, according to a study published in July by the EY consulting agency.
In all of the documents disclosed by Mr. Snowden, however, there has not yet been any evidence that the U.S. has passed on the trade secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
The politicians expressed concern that the EU lacked certain opportunities in the field of information technology and the Internet, and expressed the opinion that it should try to reduce its dependence on the United States.
Businesses are skeptical about this.
Someone in the German parliament says we should create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again.
"This is not an option," says Gasso Plattner, president of the German software company for SAP.
If there is a need for a powerful European IT industry, it was not worth allowing it to die more than 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany, from coal to cars and farmers.
Everything except the IT industry.
Nevertheless, the coverage and technical development of U.S. espionage agencies, which became known for Snowden's revelations, was a shock to some companies that used to think that China posed the greatest risk of surveillance.
A big shift is taking place in cloud technology, where European company executives have become more aware that the data stored in the U.S. is in the same jurisdiction and is therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a study conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, about 10 percent of its non-American members abandoned plans to use the services of a U.S. cloud provider after exposing the U.S. program for Prism data mining.
Jim Sneab, one of the executive directors of SAP, said: "We see consumers asking a new question that didn't come up a year ago, namely: where my data is stored and whether you can ensure that they will physically remain in this jurisdiction.
Many German leaders argue that the latest reports are merely confirmations of what they already knew: powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets, and therefore these data must be guarded at all costs.
What is happening is economic espionage is not surprising.
He always took place.
"This has been the subject of discussion for many years and hasn't changed significantly in the current controversy," said Kurt Bock, chief executive officer of BASF.
Americans are spying on us on a commercial and industrial level, and we spy on them too, because it is our national interests - to protect our businesses.
Corporate leaders usually don't like to brag about the retaliatory measures they have taken, as it can give an advantage to the enemy.
In large companies, the idea was learned for a long time that taking a free flash drive at the exhibition or leave a laptop unattended in the hotel room - it is at least inadvertent.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the board of directors of Audi's automotive company, says it's been a standard practice of assemble mobile phones before board meetings so they can't be used as eavesdropping devices for years.
The Federal Defense Service of the German Constitution recommends that company leaders consider the possibility of using simple prepaid mobile phones during foreign trips due to the vulnerability of smartphones.
Prepaid mobile phones are subsequently discarded.
However, there are concerns that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many such companies are the world market leaders in their particular niche.
Small and medium-sized companies often lack the expertise, employees, and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrecy from unauthorized access.
The U.S. warns its own companies of economic espionage from other countries.
The U.S. National Intelligence Report in February placed France along with Russia and Israel in the second row of violators who are hacking for economic intelligence, after China, according to The Washington Post.
A member of the board of directors of a prestigious German company confirmed that when it comes to economic espionage, the French are the worst.
Bernard Scarsini, a former head of the French internal intelligence agency DCRI, reportedly said in an interview this month: "The services are well aware that all countries, even when they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies.
Los Angeles International Airport was evacuated due to a shooting in one of the terminals.
An unknown man opened fire in the third terminal at 09.30 local time on Friday, November 1 (20.30 MSK).
Security evacuated the employees and passengers of the second and third terminals.
According to preliminary data, the man fired a high-power rifle.
Several people, including a U.S. Department of Transportation Security, were injured.
The police opened fire and detained the attacker.
He's been wounded easily.
Tripod denies that Obeid is influenced
Former New South Wales Labor Secretary Joe Tripodi will be a defendant in the investigation of the state's anti-corruption supervisory authority.
The former Minister of New South Wales Joe Tripodi refutes the changes to the lease of the seaside facilities at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who secretly owned a share in three real estate objects on state land.
The Independent Commission against Corruption (ICAC) on Friday expanded its investigation into whether Mr. Obeyd lobbied from several state ministers to extend the Sirkylar Ki leases, where the Obeid family own two restaurants and cafes, without passing the tender after their expiry in August 2005.
She is now investigating allegations that Mr. Tripodi knew of Mr. Obeid's secret involvement in real estate, following testimony from the testimony given by Mr. Tripod's Deputy Chief of Administration, Lynn Ashpole, on Thursday.
During the years of discussions that began in 2005, the government insisted that the lease be put in the open competition.
The tenants were against this, and also wanted longer rental terms.
In 2009, the leases of enterprises for Serkylar Key, which brought the Obeid family about $2.5 million a year, were extended without putting up for an open competition.
Mr. Tripodi, who served as Minister of Infrastructure and Transport from February 2006 to November 2009, initially advocated open competitions.
But he denied that the changes had been made at the request of Mr. Obeid, who, as Mr. Tripodi had admitted, strongly advised that changes should be made to the Government &apos; s rental policy.
The ICAC transcript of telephone conversations were given in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obeid, Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dan, a senior official who came to the Ministry of Ports after working under Mr. Obeyd's leadership in the Fisheries Division.
Was the issue discussed during these telephone conversations a question of the development of commercial rental policy? asked Assistant Commissioner Anthony Whea (Mr. Tripodi).
"No," replied Mr. Tripodi. OUR .
I can't remember what was discussed, but it was definitely not the same.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obaid.
UN to announce new goals to overcome poverty
The United Nations must immediately begin work on a new set of objectives to replace the Millennium Development Goals, which were formulated 12 years ago to overcome poverty around the world.
Australian diplomats have played a key role in advancing sustainable development goals to replace the MDGs, which will expire in 2015, before the UN summit on sustainable development, which began in Rio de Janeiro the night before.
They were included in the final version of the document, which will be signed by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told the summit participants the night before that it was time to become above national interests.
"I am pleased that the UN member states have agreed to launch and take control of the process of creating the universal goals of sustainable development - the SDGs," he said.
These SDGs will build on our progress in achieving the Millennium Development Goals, and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development concept.
I will make every effort to use the credentials given to me by member countries to embody our vision of sustainable development goals that are based on the successful implementation of the MDGs.
In the communal payments of the Voronezh people will be a new line of expenses - deductions for major repairs of the house.
According to the most approximate calculations for a standard two-room apartment from the new year will have to pay from 100 to 400 rubles per month.
The exact standard will be determined by the government of the region.
But when to paint the entrance, put in order the staircases or even replace the elevator - the residents themselves will decide.
Such a law was approved by the deputies of the regional Duma.
Vladimir Klyuchnikov, chairman of the Voronezh Regional Duma, said: "In this case, it is also necessary to restore order - to establish the order - to establish the order of overhaul of houses, to accumulate funds not in management companies - which we often register in Moscow, then in Orenburg, then somewhere else, it will be the establishment of state control over the use of funds that residents collect for the repair of apartment buildings."
Under the control of the state now and the share construction.
The law protecting against fraudsters is approved by the blessum in the final reading.
The document was not born in an empty place.
In our region, 4.5 thousand people were injured from dishonest developers.
The majority's problems were solved.
By the way, the new law prescribes the rights and obligations for all participants in shared construction.
Vladimir Klyuchnikov, chairman of the Voronezh Regional Duma, said: "It is no secret that in this area also began abuses associated with the fact that in the 98th year the shareholders got the same, and in the 2000s the same shareholders."
People began to earn on this to cover the loophole, including the two laws.
Under Voronezh, it was decided to build a temporary stay center for foreign citizens subject to deportation.
The regional parliament adopted such a law not only under the pressure of the federation.
Problems related to illegal migrants in the region at least dilute.
So, last year, a little more than 100 thousand foreigners got on the migration register.
But only one in five issued an official work permit.
Where others work and whether they pay taxes is a big question.
Vladimir Klyuchnikov, chairman of the Voronezh Regional Duma, said: "They violated the legislation, but they are not criminals."
There is no court, but it is necessary to deport - they need to be kept somewhere.
This decision was decided by the federation that such places should be equipped at the expense of regional funds.
In the Voronezh region, such a place is determined - this is the Old Olshanka of the Semiluki district.
Well, lastly, the regional parliament has given new benefits to parents with many children.
First, families where 5 or more children are raised are completely exempt from the transport tax.
The budget in this case loses 3.5 million - but the same savings and parents with many children.
Secondly, and this is the main thing, those who will adopt 3 or more babies, from the new year will be issued subsidies for housing.
For each member of the family, the new law provides for 18 square meters, at a price of 30 thousand per meter.
The family, for example, of 6 people - father, mother, kin child and 3 - adopted.
For them, according to the standards, the state acquires housing with an area of 108 square meters - for 3 million 300 thousand rubles.
For the left bank or the South-West microdistrict is quite an acceptable option.
Well, in the district center for this amount you can buy a whole cottage.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have issued recommendations for schools on allergies in children
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a list of recommendations on the control of food allergies in children in schools.
This is the first list of such recommendations released by the U.S. government, while the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies is on the rise.
Now one in 20 children in the United States has a food allergy.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the prevalence of food allergies among children increased by 18 percent from 1997 to 2007.
The guide provides information for schools on how to raise the awareness of teachers and service personnel about food allergies in children and how to help in the event of an allergic reaction.
It also recommends that schools keep adrenaline supplies - most often for injections, an automatic medical syringe EpiPen syringe is used to assist with potentially deadly anafilaxia.
State legislatures have recently amended regulations to allow schools to make adrenaline stocks with less difficulty.
The notice also contains a list of typical symptoms described by children who had an allergic reaction.
Children can say: "It feels like something is puggling in my tongue," it feels like I have a hair on my tongue or a pinch.
Kenyan press outraged by provocative media law
This is a terrible place, and there are grounds for the question: what can prevent the Parliament from destroying the independence of the judicial system in the future?
"This law is very harsh and punitive, and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, managing director of Capital Group, parent company of CapitalFM, which includes one of Kenya's most respected independent radio stations and a news site.
He said the new media judicial body will always be biased, as it is a continuation of the government and restrictions on content and affect Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope that the president will listen to us, and we appeal to him with a request to reject this bill and return it to the deputies," he said.
According to The Star, the new law will essentially allow the government to "take the media dead grip," and The Standard reported that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya had received a serious blow, and criticized the bill as a Dragon.
The bill is part of measures taken to strengthen national security following the September attack by Muslim terrorists at the Westgate shopping center.
Kenyan media angered authorities by broadcasting footage of surveillance cameras where troops that were sent to the site of the attack are allegedly robbing an expensive shopping mall.
The reaction of police chief David Kimayo was to call two journalists and a media official for questioning, although the call was canceled after mass media protests.
Under the new law, publishers can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings, and individual journalists can be fined up to one million with an additional risk of being excluded from the lists, that is, to be banned from obtaining official journalistic accreditation.
The court also has the right to confiscate the property of the offender if the fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, even one fine is enough to paralyze the work of most FM radio stations.
She also said that these measures could have a devastating effect on Kenya's so-called revived blogosphere.
Politicians understand that by silence the media, they will be able to do whatever they want, with impunity.
"No one will ever know," wrote Nation journalist Mutuma Matthew, describing the Kenyan media as a key source of restraining and balancing forces in public life.
The politicians who were provided for themselves will ravage the country and bring us back to the hunt and gather, he wrote.
Kenyan lawmakers have been the target of public anger in the past.
In May, they voted to cancel the cuts set by the national wage commission and to restore the size of their huge salary, amounting to about 532,000 shillings per month, which is one of the highest in the world.
Investigators check information about child abuse in Biysk
On October 29, the media published a report that the teacher of one of the kindergartens of the city of Biysk for educational purposes locked the child in the basement.
Currently, investigators are clarifying all the circumstances, as well as a legal assessment of the actions of kindergarten employees.
After the accusation of bad taste Evgeny Vasiliev spoke
Evgenia Vasiliev, whose person has been focused on the media for almost a year, has never commented on numerous publications in the press both about embezzlement in the Ministry of Defense and her personally - relations with former defense Minister Anatoly Serdyukov, her poetry and addiction to valuable things.
However, on November 1, the defendant in the case of "Oboronservis" violated silence.
In an interview with Life News, Vasilyeva said: "Initially, of course, the task was exactly one: to get any negative information from me in relation to the former defense minister."
There was blackmail for me to testify, or I would be put in jail.
To date, these threats have stopped.
We go to court, we will prove our innocence.
We are 100% sure of the victory.
At the same time, from the interview, we can conclude that, perhaps, most of all, Vasiliev was touched by the words that she does not have a taste.
Probably, we are talking about the statement of the official representative of the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation Vladimir Markin that in the collection of paintings, which was collected by the defendant in the case of "Oboronservis," there were fakes.
Among the arrested property there are a number of paintings that the mistress, confident in her deep knowledge of art, acquired as masterpieces of world painting.
However, the art expert examination appointed by investigators after the arrest of these paintings, found that they have no artistic value and, simply, are cheap fakes," - said Markin in early October.
Some paintings stolen from the Department of Defense...
Then they admitted that they were not stolen from the Ministry of Defense, while they said that I had a bad taste.
Who has the right to discuss my taste, to discuss some personal moments?
In my opinion, this is just a mess," - says Vasilyeva.
At the same time, when asked whether she admits her guilt in at least one of the 12 criminal episodes she is sane, Vasilyeva said: "Naturally, no.
There's nothing to admit at all.
Moreover, there is no damage to the Russian Federation in question.
They are just misleading the people, that's all.
In addition, in response to today's statement by the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation that Vasilyeva evades the study of the materials of the criminal case, the defendant's lawyer said that he and his client "the investigator does not allow to get acquainted with the materials of the case."
What caused the revelations of Vasilyeva, who is under house arrest, who has not yet communicated with the press?
Perhaps a woman she couldn't help but answer the accusation of bad taste?
Or are the journalists of Komsomolka who claimed a couple of days ago that she "had fallen into an even greater trance under house arrest" because of the news of the reconciliation of Anatoly Serdyukov and his wife and his return to the bosom of the family?
Famous military columnist "KP" Victor Baranets in his article "Hern again to his wife?" "The investigators do not rule out that after such a shock, it can become more talkative in interrogation."
Earlier, Vasilyeva some charges of illegal sale of immovable property of the Ministry of Defense took over.
The defender of "Juventus" Leonardo Bonucci will not help the team in the next match of the championship of Italy with "Parma."
According to Football Italia, the coaching staff decided not to include him in the application for the game in order to protect before the match of the 4th round of the group round of the Champions League with Real Madrid.
Also will not take part in the match with "Parma" Lichtsteiner, Vucinich and Pepe.
And forward Fabio Quallarella recovered from the injury and is ready to play.
The UK government has announced a study aimed at increasing the economic effect for Scotland from the project of the HS2 railway.
The HS2 project involves the opening of high-speed communication with Scotland and the north of England, with the beginning of the First Stage in 2026
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer noted that the project will unite the UK.
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was delighted with the prospect of working on a plan with the UK government.
The first phase will be to build a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.
When the Second Stage is completed, the lines will be lined to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government revised the estimated cost of building a high-speed line between London and north of England from 33.7 to 42.6 billion euros.
The UK government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has instructed HS2 Ltd to consider further improvements in the railway's capacity and reduced travel duration for North England and Scotland.
This should include the ability to travel from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London in three hours or less.
Baroness Kramer said: "Our goal is on HS2 to create a truly national network that will make the UK and its cities closer to each other.
We are developing HS2 because the benefits it will bring are huge.
Without it, we will face a capacity crisis in our rail network.
But we are also talking about the transport of cities with each other; across the UK, 18 cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, will receive a better message thanks to HS2.
Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael added: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
On behalf of the Scottish government, Keith Brown urged Mr. Carmichael to support Scotland's inclusion in the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: The high-speed railway has every chance of bringing huge economic benefits to Scotland, but also adds Scotland's economic weight to the general argument for high-speed rail across the UK.
Therefore, we are pleased to work in partnership with the UK government to consider options for building a high-speed railway in Scotland, creating benefits for everyone and continuing the Glasgow-Ecilow-Ecil railway line, which the Scottish government is already planning.
I look forward to considering the results of the study with the British ministers next year and the joint decision on the next steps.
U.S. cuts food aid for the poor
Food allowance for a family of four decreases by $36 per month
Since Friday, the U.S. has been declining financial security for food stamps known as "fudsttemps," as the corresponding state program ends.
For food allowance, a family of four will now be allocated $36 per month less than before, officials say.
This will affect the 47 million poorest Americans.
According to Reuters, in fiscal year 2012, the allowance per person was on average $133 per month.
Expenditures on food aid in the United States rose to $80 billion a year due to rising unemployment and food prices.
Roughly 14 percent of Americans rely on free food aid to "fudstemps" that bear the name since earlier, when they had the form of paper coupons.
When the current economic crisis began, the program was expanded to boost economic growth and help the poorest Americans.
However, Republicans in Congress are demanding further cuts to the funds allocated for the program, saying it should be aimed at helping those who need it more.
Food store owners across America are worried that cuts will reduce consumer spending.
U.S. congressmen continue to argue about how to further cut government funding.
Due to the new rules introduced by the Russian customs, hundreds of trucks have been in line on the border with Russia for almost a week.
Today, Donetsk officials promised to provide drivers with drinking water and install biotoilets
Hundreds of trucks have accumulated at the border points at the entrance to Russia.
This situation arose due to the change in the rules of customs clearance of goods.
Ukrainian border guards and customs officers confirm the queue: the Russian side creates, which did not warn about the innovations in advance.
Since October 28, the customs authorities of Russia began to apply additional measures to guarantee the delivery of goods, - said Deputy Head of the Eastern Customs Vladimir Denisov.
The new model document is applied in countries that have acceded to the Convention on International Carriage.
Checkpoints work in an enhanced mode.
The correspondent of "FACTOV" visited the border and talked with truckers who were held hostage to the situation.
Prices in the roadside shop-cafe at the checkpoint "Novoazovsk" are growing every day, as well as the queue of the trucks.
Trucks stand in several rows, stretching for about two kilometers.
Customs terminal Novoazovsk - Vesel-Voznesenka provides one of the most important transport destinations from the south of Ukraine on the international highway.
From here, cargoes are sent to the Stavropol Territory of Russia, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Armenia.
On Sunday, before midnight, they were still allowed, and then these rules were introduced, - complains trucker Alexei Golovanev (pictured), who is carrying cargo from Turkey to Kazakhstan and spends almost a week in his car.
Under the new rules, in order to cross the border, I need an additional package of documents and payment for cargo insurance.
The amount depends on the cost of the cargo and the distance to which it is carried.
The minimum insurance is 4.5-5 thousand rubles (about 1100-1300 hryvnia).
Those who go not far (say, to Georgia, Armenia) with a cargo worth up to 50 thousand dollars, pay about 15 thousand rubles (3800 hryvnias) and pass.
And the rest are stuck - because no one has such a lot of money with them!
Imagine if the driver is carrying a cargo for only four thousand dollars, but to Moscow, he needs 90 thousand rubles (almost 23 thousand hryvnias) to pay for the transit!
The conditions for survival on the border - no - complain truckers who have to eat near their cars.
In the border shops and cafes are always expensive, but prices like here, we have not met anywhere!
The sellers oriented and quickly raised them: 15 hryvnias cost a loaf, seven hryvnias - a cup of coffee, 25 hryvnias - a plate of soup.
And the cafe is one.
And there's no toilet.
We sleep in the steppe, we go to the toilet.
Neither wash nor shave...
I can't get out of the car for a week, my wife's on the road I've made it all.
For a week, - comforts another trucker Victor Skotarenko.
Will it be my car's turn in a week?
Why do you have one and a half liters of water? - we are interested in the only cross-border shop.
There are 11 and 15 hryvnias.
What, bottle crystal or water infuse on silver?
We have a cafe, not a shop.
Take something else, - parsed the seller.
After the situation began to be covered in the media, the plight of Ukrainian drivers drew the attention of the authorities of the region.
The leadership of the Amvrosiev and Novoazov district state administrations received an order to provide all those who are idle in line at the Ukrainian-Russian border with drinking water, - said the acting chairman of the Donetsk regional state administration Sergey Dergunov.
Ambulance brigades are now on duty at the checkpoints.
Also for the convenience of people will be installed biotoilets.
According to the official, the problem associated with the queues will be solved in the coming days.
According to the press service of the Donetsk regional state administration, as of October 31, 32 and 68 cars were idle at the international checkpoints "Uspenka" and Novoazovsk.
"Facts" will monitor the situation.
Sony expects lower annual profit
Japanese electronics manufacturer Sony, having completed the last quarter with a net loss of 19.3 billion yen, or $197 million, reduced the forecast for profit for the current fiscal year.
Sony's results for the period from July to September 2013 They were more depressing than expected, due to falling demand for televisions, video cameras and personal computers manufactured by the Japanese corporation.
Sony's television business, which in the second quarter brought the company's first operating profit in three years in three years, fell again to 9.3 billion eigent operational loss in the reporting period.
The Japanese consumer electronics market is going through hard times, especially due to reduced demand for TVs.
And while competitors are looking for a way out of a difficult situation, Sony continues to focus on the consumer segment.
For example, one of Sony's main rivals, Panasical Corporation, has recently shifted its focus to industrial components: here, the company's sales are growing at a high rate, especially due to automotive systems and environmentally friendly technologies.
As a result, by the end of the fiscal year, which will end in March 2014, Sony expects to receive 179 billion operating year profits against the previously expected 230 billion yen.
At the same time, according to Thomson Reuters, analysts assumed that this figure will be much higher and will amount to 221 billion yen.
Aiming to get out of the crisis, Sony is expanding the product line.
In the middle of this month, the start of sales of "smart" watches from the Japanese corporation, endowed with a number of fashionable functions, which will allow you to get rid of the need 100 times a day to get out of the pocket of the smartphone.
After Sony lowered its annual forecast for profit and revenue, the company's shares in the morning at the opening of torogs in Tokyo lost in the price of more than 11%, falling to the level of 1668 yen per share.
How much do the late celebrities earn - MK in the USA MK
The ranking of live celebrities with the highest income in 2013 was topped by Madonna, who earned $125 million.
But it was "overdue" by the late Michael Jackson, whose posthumous income from October 2012 to October 2013 was 160 million.
Notably behind him, other famous people who passed away, who last year "earned" several times less.
The second in the list of the most "wealthy" celebrities, compiled by Forbes magazine at the end of the year was Elvis Presley - 55 million for the year, and the line below the songwriter Peanuts Charles Schultz with 37 million.
In addition to them, the top five included Elizabeth Taylor, who was last year the leader (25 million), and musician Bob Marley (18 million).
The list also included Marilyn Monroe, John Lennon and Albert Einstein.
Eser proposes to equate to extremism insulting patriotic feelings
To legislatively protect the patriotic feelings of citizens from provocations and insults directed against Russia, "Fair Russia" proposes to equate an insult to patriotic feelings to extremist activities and to punish five years in prison.
According to the newspaper "Izvestia," such amendments to the legislation prepared by Deputy Chairman of the Duma Committee on Energy Oleg Mikheev, have already been sent to obtain a conclusion to the Supreme Court and the government.
Under the patriotic feelings of citizens, the author of the amendments proposes to understand the emotional connection of a person with a country, the citizen of which he is, characterized by love for this country, a responsible attitude to its fate, respect for its history and culture.
As Mikheev points out, in the domestic legislation there are sanctions for the abuse of formal signs of state power - the flag and the coat of arms.
At the same time, according to the parliamentarian, the protection of Russians whose feelings can be affected by both insults to state symbols and other manifestations of disrespect for our country is not sufficiently worked out in Russian legislation.
As an example, he cites discussions unfolding annually on the eve of Victory Day, when some media persons allow themselves to question the heroic feat of the people of the USSR in the fight against the fascists.
On the eve of the main national holiday - Victory Day on May 9 - a real bacchanalia unfolds every year.
Extending to wit and an "alternative look" at history, some publicists reach the argument that, it is a pity, the cultural Germans did not conquer the wild Soviet Union!
I consider this absolutely unacceptable in a country where pride in history remains the main "spiritual bond" of the nation," - resented Oleg Mikheev.
In addition, according to Mikheev, patriotic people in Russia are much more than religious, but the law punishes for insulting the feelings of believers, and insulting patriotic feelings can be almost with impunity.
According to the people's elect, it is necessary to equate the insult of patriotic feelings to extremist activities and prescribe in article 282 of the Criminal Code the corresponding punishment.
The bill provides for punishment for insulting patriotic feelings: from a hundred thousandth fine to 5 years of imprisonment.
In the new compositions of public monitoring commissions will increase the influence of jailers
Today, the Council of the Public Chamber (OP) can approve new compositions of public monitoring commissions (ONC) in 43 regions of Russia.
If the option put to the vote is adopted, the lobbyists of the security forces will increase their influence.
The ONC are public structures that control the conditions of detention in places of deprivation of liberty.
The cases of Sergei Magnitsky and Leonid Razvozzhaev, unrest in the Kupe colony - it is through the ONC that most of the high-profile incidents behind bars are publicized.
There is a struggle between human rights defenders and security lobbyists for the UNC.
At the meeting of the working group of the OP on the formation of the ONC, I proposed to make the selection criterion the experience of human rights activities.
"He was not accepted, and they formed lists, not developing criteria," says Valery Borshchev.
Borshchev is the current chairman of the Moscow Supervisory Commission and the Association of Independent Observers - the all-Russian structure of human rights defenders dealing with prison problems.
In his time as a deputy of the state Duma from "Yabloka" he developed a law regulating the activities of the ONC.
The OP Council should vote on the composition of the ONC in 43 regions of the country.
Less than a thousand applicants apply for 1,800 vacancies, and in Ingushetia and Kabardino-Balkaria, competitions were not able to organize due to the lack of candidates.
The OP promises to organize a donation for vacant places.
The ONC of Moscow is one of the few commissions with the competition, despite the fact that the new composition instead of 20 will be 40 participants.
According to Borshchev, in the current composition of the capital commission, there are 11 human rights defenders and 9 security forces, and in the version, which is on the vote in the OP, the ratio changes by 17 to 23.
At the same time, 30 human rights defenders wanted to get to the capital commission.
But the new composition may again enter the representative of the "Fight Brotherhood" Vyacheslav Kalinin.
He was a member of the OPC for three years, but never visited the prisoners.
Borshchev believes that the security forces, having appointed their chairman of the UNC, will be able to make the work of human rights defenders unbearable, so human rights defenders do not exclude the collective withdrawal from the commission.
In their opinion, the progress of the security forces is coordinated by the member of the UNC Anton Tsvetkov, who heads the "Officers of Russia" - an organization that defends the interests of law enforcement agencies.
"I do not eat babies for breakfast," Anton Tsvetkov told RBC daily.
He denies lobbying for the promotion of any lists and says that he is not going to prevent human rights defenders from visiting the arrested oppositionists.
According to Tsvetkov, he was not even interested in which list they are now voting in the OP.
The publication of Borschchev's information he considers a form of pressure.
The possible success of human rights defenders is a planned change of leadership of the Chelyabinsk ONC.
Its former leaders will be suspended because of last year's Copier unrest.
The Civic Chamber concluded that the leadership of the local commission ignored the problems of prisoners.
But the ONC of Rostov-on-Don can go from human rights defenders to security forces.
From the new lists "missing" the human rights defender-chair of the local commission, but was one of his opponents, despite the fact that in May 2013, the Federal Public Chamber excluded him for unethical behavior.
The lists of the Moscow and Rostov commissions Borshchev considers "the revenge for Kopeysk."
The revelations of Nadezhda Tolokonnikova did not affect the ONC Mordovia, which is considered "forceful": the new composition wanted to get only one human rights defender, and she did not even accept documents for the competition.
OP Council member Nikolay Svanidze told RBC daily that he voted against the proposed list, as he was outraged by the situation in Moscow and Rostov-on-Don.
He sent his position to the other members of the council.
His colleague on the OP, Pavel Gusev, says that he voted in favor, as he likes the proposed Moscow list.
Coordinated the compilation of the lists of the ONC Deputy Secretary of the OP Vladislav Grib, who is also an employee of the Research Institute of the Federal Penitentiary Service.
The mushroom told RBC daily that it is not correct to divide candidates into human rights defenders and security forces and does not agree that the chairmen of the commissions have enough powers to prevent the work of its members.
The mushroom does not predict the results of the voting of the OP Council.
If the proposed list is rejected today, a modified version will be put to the vote in the coming days.
Clive Palmer claims that MP Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest on parental leave.
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest on parental leave because his daughters can get pregnant and benefit from it.
This mining magnate, who has an unresolved $6 million carbon tax dispute, made the announcement at a time when he was trying to dismiss whether he had a conflict.
The Palmer United Party can control up to four Senate votes, which could be crucial in deciding to abolish carbon taxes and mining.
But Mr. Palmer argued that the conflict of interest could only be the ministers, and said that Mr. Abbott's daughters would personally benefit from political measures.
"He has a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because if any of these daughters get pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether they will be allowed on vacation or not," said Mr. Palmer.
Two months after the election, the election commission officially declared Mr. Palmer the winner in the fight for a seat from the Sunshine Coast of the Fairfax constituency with a 53-vote after recounting.
Mr. Palmer called for a review of the electoral counting procedure in order to expedite the process.
Daughters of Tony Abbot Frances and Bridget.
Should a decision on these elections be made two months after we voted?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why should we not have such a system that you can come, enter your data in the computer, immediately vote and get the result at 18:30 the same evening?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of pencils for the marks in the ballots.
Is that because they can erase the result if someone doesn't like it?
Using a pencil in our time seems strange.
The Electoral Commission was examining the possibilities for e-voting and had recently published a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.
Mr. Palmer, 59, said his program included an international airport for Sunshine Coast and would be very serious about his new work.
Public office involves serving the community.
"We do not seek any rewards, except for the gratitude of history, for the fact that at a critical moment we can serve this district," he said.
Against Google, Samsung, Huawei filed lawsuits on Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of former Nortel patents, filed on Thursday a series of patent lawsuits against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, the price of which it overwhelmed at the bankruptcy auction of Nortel.
The Rockstar consortium, which bought Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, filed patent infringement lawsuits with the U.S. District Court in Texas against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is charged with violating seven patents.
These patents cover technologies that help to match online search keywords with the corresponding advertising, the lawsuit says, which is the backbone of Google's search business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not available and did not comment.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC are making phones running on Google's Android operating system, which is fiercely competing with mobile products from Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011, Google offered the initial price of $900 million for Nortel patents.
Google has raised the proposed price several times, ultimately offering as much as $4.4 billion.
Having lost the Nortel patent case to Rockstar consortium, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, in this transaction, the determining factor was partly the Motorola patent library.
"Despite an unsuccessful attempt to purchase patents at auction that are the subject of the lawsuit, Google has violated and continues to violate them, "the lawsuit says.
Rockstar is demanding increased damages from Google, as it claims that Google's patent infringement is intentional, according to the claim.
The stadium in Yaroslavl is not ready for the reception of 22,000 spectators, police officers who were present today at the meeting of the RFU KDK noted.
The ticket program is overestimated, in their opinion, about twice.
During the match of the 1/16 finals of the Russian Cup with Spartak, only a thousand stewards were involved at a regulatory norm of nine thousand.
Spartak fans had 2,200 seats, that is, 10 percent of the capacity of the stadium, however, by agreement with the Moscow club, they were sold 5 thousand tickets.
These data were announced by the head of the KDK Arthur Grigoryants.
A bird transported by air to a safe place from a drilling rig in the North Sea, released back to the wild
A bird transported by air to the shore after being found in depleted condition on an oil vein in the North Sea was released back into the wild.
This water shepherd was placed in a helicopter heading for Aberdeen last month, and then was released by the Scottish branch of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) at the rescue center in Alloa.
The center's manager, Colin Seddon, said: "This water shepherd is most likely a winter migrant from Northern Europe that has hit a zone of strong winds over the North Sea.
It seems that the bird was exhausted and was able to find refuge on the oil tower.
He added: "She was not able to take off again, so we were asked for help.
The water shepherd was healthy and in good condition by the time it was released.
Fines for unauthorized street trade in Vologda will grow at times
According to the city authorities, the increase in the amount of fines will help restore order in Vologda and release the streets from natural tents and trays.
Most street vendors do not pay taxes, the products they sell often do not pass the appropriate sanitary control.
This means that the health of the Vologda residents is threatened.
So, the lower limit of the fine for citizens for unauthorized trade from November will increase six times - from 500 rubles to 3000 rubles, the press service of the Administration of Vologda reports.
In September, 600 people were dismissed from the Ford Automobile Plant in Vsevolozhsk.
As they say in the trade unions, all the dismissed received compensation.
However, the question of reducing industrial production in the region arises much more acute than the problems of workers.
Deputy of the regional ZakSa Alexey Etmanov at the meeting said that at the plant of the company "Ford" in Vsevolozhsk reduced about 600 people.
According to him, this happened in September: then under the program of voluntary dismissal, which was developed together with the trade union of the organization, about 600 people left the plant.
Workers who decided to resign from their own will were offered "golden parachutes" in the amount of several salaries.
Because of this, the vast majority left the jobs of their own free will.
However, according to Etmanov, such a number of people is a whole night shift.
I don't think that's the case.
However, the authorities in the next two years do not plan to accept any programs to support regional enterprises in a difficult situation," he explained, adding that when adopting the budget, the government does not take into account the stagnation of production in the region and large job cuts.
In Ford, this information is not denied or confirmed.
We are waiting for a response from the company, and as soon as it appears, we will publish it.
Talks about the reduction of workers at the Ford plant in Vsevolozhsk have been going on for a long time.
So, for example, the company's plans to fire 600 people became known in September.
Previously, the plant announced the suspension of the production of cars.
The reason at the plant was the fall in demand for Ford cars in Russia.
According to Petrostat, according to the results of nine months of 2013, the volume of industrial production in the Leningrad region decreased by 5.4%.
Production of vehicles and equipment decreased by 11.5%.
Dmitry Medvedev: the GDP growth rate of the Russian Federation is not enough for the development of the state
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev considers insufficient for the Russian Federation the growth rate of its GDP and is sure that the situation can be improved by simplifying the conditions of lending to the business and changing the structure of the Russian economy, focusing on innovation, Reuters reports.
We planned this year's GDP growth in the area of 3%, maybe even a little more.
It will be a little less than 2%.
Against the background of a recession in a number of European countries, it seems not very bad, but for us it is not enough, because the economic base is not as powerful as in a number of countries, and in general, in order to develop, there must be a higher pace.
Now it is very important that Russian companies, Russian businesses receive normal loans at a normal price - this is the first thing to do," - said the head of government.
Director of "Ugra" Andrey Belmach noted that it is difficult to say how long it will take to find a new head coach.
This post became vacant after the resignation of Sergei Shepelev.
The resignation took place only a few hours ago, so to say how long it will take to find a new coach, I am not ready, - quotes ITAR-TASS words Belmach.
Maybe a day.
Maybe a month.
We are studying all possible options.
Priority will be given to the Russian specialist.
I want not just to find some coach, but a person who will work in our club for several years and will achieve certain results with him.
Snowboarder for the Olympic bill was specially photographed
The Bank of Russia on Wednesday issued a commemorative banknote dedicated to the city of Sochi, where the Olympic Games will be held this winter.
The denomination of the bill is 100 rubles.
But in the network, bloggers are already actively ironic about the commemorative banknote.
After the presentation of the Olympic bill on October 30, they drew attention to the fact that the image of a snowboarder from the banknote can be found in photo banks.
In particular - in the free storage of photos StockExchange, where this photo is dated 2005.
The same photo is used in the Photoshop lesson published on the Russian website "Megaobzor" on January 18, 2011.
In addition, it has already been used in advertising smartphones RugGear.
The Olympic banknote is made in blue and blue.
On the one hand, a snowboarder flying over Sochi, on the other - a type of Olympic stadium and a firebird is depicted.
The author of the design of the banknote is Pavel Bushuev, who won the competition among students of the St. Petersburg Repin Academy of Arts.
At the presentation, it was noted that several sports were considered - ski, freestyle and jumping from the ski jump, but in the end they chose a snowboard, because it is a relatively young sport.
According to the source of "Izvestia," close to the Central Bank, the regulator is not indifferent to the opinion of the public about the widespread spread of the image of the snowboarder from the Olympic banknote and is now studying the situation.
But in Goznak are not too concerned about the hype around the Olympic banknote.
The head of the press service of the State Sign Natalia Nikiforova told Izvestia that all the arguments about plagiarism are ridiculous.
The snowboarder on the banknote will be turned to the right, in photos in the network - to the left, - said Nikiforova.
The man in the photo shoot to create the bill was removed from different points, then the final image was chosen, on it - a characteristic posture of a snowboarder.
She also noted that copyright laws do not apply to the Olympic banknote, as the artist received a salary for the work.
According to experts, the discussion around the image on the Olympic bill is positive.
Recognition of the image on the bill - plus for its promotion, - says the Executive Director of NP "RusBrand" Alexey Popovichev.
It is quite difficult to prove the 100% similarity of images on the bill and in photobanks, so lawsuits to challenge intellectual property on this image are unlikely to arrive.
The Olympic banknote first appeared in China - a commemorative 10 yuan banknote was issued for the 2008 Beijing Olympics.
Russia has decided to support this tradition.

The NSA blames the "internal error" and not hackers in the termination of the site
The covert National Security Agency said on Friday night that the shutdown of their site for several hours caused a technical failure, not hackers, as claimed on the network.
"NSA.gov was unavailable for hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during the planned update, the intelligence agency said in an official email.
The problem will be solved tonight.
The claims that the overfreation in the work was caused by a distributed attack of the type "rejection" [DDoS] are incorrect.
Earlier this evening, online server monitoring systems registered that the NSA's website had not worked for at least six hours, and the site was still unavailable to some users.
Earlier, a NSA spokesman told ABC News that the agency's internal secret network was not hacked.
No classified information is in danger, the representative said.
At least one online group of hackers-activists said it was responsible for disabling the NSA's website with a DDoS attack.
DDoS attacks are designed to overwhelm the target site with traffic until the servers are overloaded and the site fails.
The tactics of hackers are relatively simple, and attacks are not designed to infiltrate the internal network of the target system.
Previously, the NSA's super-secret NSA, once dubbed No. of Such an Agency, has been in the spotlight in recent months in public attention and fierce criticism after a series of revelations about its extensive surveillance programs abroad and at home - all this reaction to secret NSA files stolen from the agency and published by the frustrated former NSA employee Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy around the agency prompted the prediction that today's incident was the result of targeted actions by hackers.
The head of Gazprom Alexey Miller says that the pipeline in Bulgaria marks a new era in the gas sector
The start of construction of the gas pipeline "Southern flow" in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of the largest energy projects in Europe, said the head of Gazprom.
Today, a landmark event has taken place: the construction of the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the most large-scale and important project in Europe, began, Gazprom Chairman Alexei Miller said in a statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element of energy security throughout the European continent.
The South Stream is designed to diversify Russia's export routes through Europe.
The dispute over the contract between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which houses most of Russia's gas destined for Europe, increases the risk level for conventional routes, officials say.
Miller said that a direct connection with Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries have been eliminated.
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from the South at a reduced price as soon as the entire project starts in 2015.
Gazprom said construction should begin in other countries further located along the pipeline route by the end of the year.
The annual project capacity of the pipeline is 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
Agency "Rosbalt" deprived of the status of the media for the obscenity
On October 31, the Moscow City Court decided to invalidate the license for the registration of the agency "Rosbalt," - writes "Lenta."
Roskomnadzor insisted on the deprivation of the agency's status - for systematic and gross violations of the law on the media.
During the trial, an unpleasant precedent was created: the court considered it possible to close the media, in fact refusing to the publication the right to put forward counterarguments.
What is "Rosbalt"
CJSC "Rosbalt Information Agency" was established in St. Petersburg in 2000.
In the following years, the agency opened a second head office in Moscow and a number of regional units.
The agency also has offices in the countries of the former USSR.
Since 2001, Rosbalt has developed and functioned as a federal information and analytical agency.
By the mid-2000s, the agency was on the list of the most recognizable private online media in Russia.
At the same time, "Rosbalt" has always occupied a rather specific niche: the core of the exclusive publications of the agency was (and make up to date) notes with reference to sources in law enforcement agencies.
Talks about the proximity of the publication to the security structures continued throughout the existence of the agency.
Along with the fact that Rosbalt had an extensive database of sources in various departments, in favor of such assumptions, the fact that the project was headed by Natalia Chaplina - the wife of Viktor Cherkesov.
At the same time, Chaplina's role in the leadership of Rosbalt is not fully clear: it is often called the "head of the project."
The general director of the agency is Larisa Afonina, editor-in-chief - Nikolay Ulyanov.
Recently, "Rosbalt" did not appear in the ratings of the federal media - neither by citation nor by audience.
In October, the agency took the 25th place in the ranking of attendance of Russian media sites according to LiveInternet.
According to the same LiveInternet, the average daily audience of the site rosbalt.ru is about 150,000 unique visitors (and up to 500 thousand views), monthly - about three million unique visitors.
Among the most popular materials in the last five months are notes on the helplessness of the Kremlin in relations with Ukraine, the death of the soloist of the group "King and the jester," pogroms in the capital Biryulev.
The conflict between Rosbalt and Roskomnadzor began in July 2013, when amendments to the law on the media that banned journalists from seeking war, came into force.
The agency found a banned vocabulary in two videos published on the Agency's website ("Jigit from Krasnodar" and "Pussy Riot desecrated oil rigs").
The further sides describe differently.
Roskomnadzor, on the basis of the video materials, accused Rosbalt of gross and systematic violation of the law on the media and appealed to the court with a demand to remove the license from the Agency.
Rosbalt stated that the claims of the department are inappropriate: firstly, the videos were not editorial materials, secondly, the mother words in them were disguised, and, thirdly, immediately after the warning, the videos were removed from the site.
Representatives of the agency appealed Roskomnadzor's claims to the magistrate's court - and when the Moscow City Court accepted the claim of Roskomnadzor on October 22, 2013, the consideration of these complaints was still ongoing.
However, on the 25th of the magistrate, the judge made the decision not in favor of Rosbalt: the editor-in-chief Nikolai Ulyanov was found guilty of violating the code of administrative offenses and fined 20 thousand rubles - 10 thousand for each video.
Obviously, this predetermined the outcome of the hearing in the Moscow City Court - if you refuse to think that the outcome could be predetermined even earlier.
On October 31, the court decided to invalidate the certificate of registration of "Rosbalt," in fact depriving the agency of the status of the media.
It is impossible to say that "Rosbalt" in the course of this confrontation remained alone.
The Agency was supported by deputies of the state Duma (the statement to the head of Roskomnadzor Alexander Zharov was signed by 26 deputies on October 10; the document itself was filed at the initiative of the Communist Party).
The illegality of the closure of the publication was stated by the head of the Union of Journalists of Russia Vsevolod Bogdanov, Chairman of the Moscow Union of Journalists Pavel Gusev and the head of the presidential Council for human rights Mikhail Fedotov.
Moreover, according to Bogdanov, the leadership of Roskomnadzor even provided him with some guarantees that the revocation of the license will not come.
The trial of Rosbalt showed: under whose jurisdiction it is safer to be media in Russia today is a big question.
The gene of speech turned out to be a stimulator of the formation of synapses
Scientists from Johns Hopkins University and Mount Sinai School of Medicine have discovered a protein by which the "speech gene" Foxp2 performs its function, stimulating the formation of new connections between neurons.
The study is published in Science, on the website of the journal you can read its brief content.
The Foxp2 gene is the first known gene whose function is directly related to speech.
His role was established in 2001 thanks to the discovery of a family of several people who could not correctly pronounce the words and sometimes did not understand each other.
Scientists have found that family members were disrupted by the Foxp2 gene, but how it performs its function remained unknown.
In the new study, biologists have shown that at least part of their functions Foxp2 performs as a stimulator of the formation of new synapses in the brain region associated with the formation of speech.
It does this thanks to another gene, SRPX2.
The latter was found as a result of finding factors that stimulate the formation of synapses.
SRPX2 was one of the 10 similar genes found by the authors, while only Foxp2 creviates to its activity.
The fact that SRPX2 does affect vocalization, scientists confirmed in an experiment on mice.
When the animal's gene activity was artificially reduced, they screamed less when separated with the mother.
If the gene activity was restored, the frequency of the sounds produced was also restored.
Previously, mice also showed a link with the vocalization of Foxp2 itself.
Animals that were injected with a human copy of the gene were feeding more actively and at a lower frequency than normal mice.
So far, however, scientists do not know whether the work of Foxp2 and, accordingly, the SRPX2 managed by it is associated with purely "mechanical" properties of sound formation or more subtle processes.
Ponomarev left "Fair Russia"
Deputy of the State Duma from the party "Fair Russia," member of its branch in Novosibirsk Ilya Ponomarev filed an application for withdrawal from the political organization.
As the parliamentarian said, he submitted the application to the Novosibirsk regional branch of the party.
According to her charter, this automatically means that Ponomarev left the ranks of the "just Russians."
We're sitting, we're drinking tea...
"For some reason, many want to see the picture "Ilya Ponomarev puts a party ticket on the table," but there is nothing so epochal in this," the deputy commented on his decision.
Ponomarev noted that he maintains good relations with the regional branch of "esers."
Meanwhile, the mandate of State Duma Deputy Ilya Ponomarev does not refuse.
He explained that, despite his withdrawal from the party, he remains a member of the faction and by law cannot leave it.
Reports of Ilya Ponomarev's intention to leave the party "Fair Russia" appeared on October 30.
It was reported that together with him from the "SR" will be released Dmitry Gudkov and Valery Zubov, but the latter soon denied this information.
Do you want ice cream glowing in the dark?
A British entrepreneur created the world's first glowing ice cream in the dark with a jellyfish.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescent properties of a sea animal to develop glowing food.
He came to this idea after reading a scientific article about jellyfish, and convinced scientists in China to chemically recreate a luminous squirrel.
The ice cream reacts with the language of the one who eats it, raising the pH level in the protein and causing it to glow.
Chris says that since the ice cream starts to glow when it reacts to mouth warmth, it means that the more you lick, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, the founder of the ice cream company "Lice me, I'm delicious," says: "This is an incredible thing, but still at the very beginning, if we talk about production, so for 200 you will get about 2 g of substance.
The protein we use in ice cream reacts with your tongue with neutral pH.
Therefore, when your mouth warms the protein, it will increase the pH level and the ice cream will start glowing.
We've been testing it for the last few months, and it seemed like it would be perfect to present it in Halloween because it creates such a wonderful luminous effect.
This is perhaps the most expensive ice cream I've ever done because jellyfish luminosically more expensive than gold.
So every balloon costs me about 140.
But it tastes pretty nice.
Charlie's experimental company, located in Bristol, is famous for its unusual tastes, including beer, cheese, beef and the taste of gold leaf.
But his next creation should be even more ambitious.
He said, "I really want to develop an invisible ice cream."
This is by definition impossible because of the refraction caused by the ice crystals that make up ice, but I think we'll find a way to do that.
Ice cream uses fluorescent properties of jellyfish, synthesized by Chinese scientists
GM recalls a number of new pickups in the US to improve seat backs
General Motors Co is recalling nearly 19,000 new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups of the 2014 model to eliminate problems with manual adjustment of seat backspinning, according to a notice from U.S. security regulators in the field of motor vehicles.
On some of the pickups, the front seats may have a defect in the back tilt mechanism.
As a result, the seat back does not meet the federal safety standards of vehicles for head restraints.
When hit by the car from behind, the head restraint may not properly protect the driver and passengers, increasing the risk of injury, according to the notification posted on the website of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
The models were made in the period from August 1 to September 10.
The production of GM pickup trucks began in June and represents the most important launch of the car in mass production for the leading American automaker since its restructuring due to bankruptcy in 2009.
GM informed the owners of pickups about the defect in the first half of October.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration could not consider notifying the owners in connection with the 16-day cessation of the government, which reduced the growth in car sales in October.
Sales of Silverado and Sierra pickup trucks, which were upgraded for the 2014 model range, rose by about 20 percent during the first 10 months of this year, GM said on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado pickups and 16,503 Sierra pickup trucks.
GM shares on the New York Stock Exchange rose 1.4 percent to $37.47 on Friday.
In the area of the Tretyakov Gallery opened a pedestrian zone
A new pedestrian zone has appeared in Moscow.
It is located in the area of the Tretyakov Gallery and occupies a plot of two kilometers from the metro station "Novokuznetskaya" to Bolotnaya Square.
Street lamps, flower beds, benches, urns and toilets are installed throughout the entire length, deaf fences and illegal advertising have been removed.

Snowden is ready to cooperate with Germany on the issue of US intelligence
Edward Snowden, the U.S. intelligence whistleblower, said he was ready to go to Berlin to testify to the German parliament if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander could not answer questions about their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Strebele met with Mr. Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was granted asylum to discuss his testimony in Germany.
A letter from Mr. Snowden, which the MP presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, said: "While the result of my efforts was clearly positive, my government continues to treat dissent as treason and seeks to criminalize political statements with criminal charges that make no protection.
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Mr. Snowden said he believed that the support of the international community could persuade the U.S. government to renounce criminal charges against him.
The charges brought by the U.S. Department of Justice include espionage and theft of state property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, Germany's interior minister, told Zeit Online: "If Mr. Snowden is ready to speak to German officials, we will find ways to make this possible.
Relations between the United States and Germany became tense after allegations that the NSA was tapped by the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Opperman, a deputy who heads a parliamentary group overseeing the intelligence service, said that if there was an opportunity to listen to Mr. Snowden as a witness, I would not expose him to danger and without destroying relations with the United States fully, it should be used.
Mr. Strebele, a member of the Green Party of Germany, published his photo with Mr. Snowden on Twitter.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Strebele said that, according to a lawyer for a former NSA contractor, Mr. Snowden could not have returned to Russia if he had left.
If Mr. Snowden testified in Germany, he would need guarantees that he would be there security, the deputy said.
Mr. Snowden said in his letter that he had encountered a high-cost and constant campaign of persecution that forced him to leave his home.
He, however, said he was encouraged by the global reaction to his political statements.
Citizens around the world, as well as high-ranking officials - including the United States - found the exposure of an uncontrolled system of pervasive surveillance to be useful for society.
The letter contains a proposal to cooperate with the German authorities, "when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation will be resolved.
Foreign workers on subclass 457 visas may be tested on the "originality"
The 457 foreign visa workers is under consideration by the government as it plans to expand repressive measures.
This test, if adopted, will be applied according to criteria aimed at preventing the use of visas of the class 457 to fill unskilled posts or as a loophole for the movement of family and friends to Australia.
The paper submitted by the government for discussion was published today, while former Labour MP Maxin McKew criticized the government's rhetoric about foreign workers, saying it could offend Australia's neighbors.
The "favorite statements like "foreigners at the end of the queue" and "first work for Australians" represent a very unpleasant pullback to the times when trade unions demanded a secure labor market," she told the Institute "Australia - India."
Historically, this meant that white labor needed to be protected - and if some in the region saw the echoes of this historical artifact, I wouldn't be surprised.
The document contains 12 measures previously considered by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he meets with officials about smuggling people, has already made five of the recommended changes, and the rest are under consideration.
If the "agenity" criteria are accepted, the applicant for a visa can be investigated for whether the candidacy is genuine in conditions where the candidate is a relative or close acquaintance of the owner or person involved in the financing of the enterprise.
Enterprises may also be required to report on the number of subclass 457 visa holders, as earlier businesses intending to sponsor a small number of workers were then hired by hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker died allegedly from a heart attack after arriving by boat with refugees on Christmas Island this week.
The man's grief-stricken nine-year-old son accompanied him on his way to Australia, and since his father's death on Wednesday, he has been supported by a cousin who was also on board the ship.
Australian authorities hastily sent a man to the hospital of Christmas Island, where he died.
Head coach of "Colorado" Patrick Roy, explaining the decision to release goalkeeper Semyon Varlamov from the first minutes in Friday's match with "Dallas," expressed confidence that the recent night behind bars did not shake his confidence in the Russian, reports from Dallas sobkor "SE" Natalia Shmelev.
And what to expect, - said Rua after the morning rolling "Avalanche."
Of course, what has bothers us all, but we are confident in it and feel that it will be useful for him to go on the ice today.
We want him to go on the ice and show his usual level.
That is, you are completely sure that the situation did not affect the condition of the goalkeeper in any way?
We'll see you today.
Undoubtedly, our players will support Varley by the fact that they will help him protect the goal, as it was in the previous matches of this season.
The main thing is that no one in the team is going to draw any conclusions until the court is dealt with in this situation.
Baumgertner nominated to Uralkali Board of Directors
The current Board of Directors of Uralkali proposed the candidacy of the General Director Vladislav Baumgertner, arrested in Minsk, to the new board, according to the website of the Russian company.
Bumugertner was included in the list of 11 people nominated for the new board of directors.
This list was prepared for the extraordinary meeting of shareholders on November 29, at which the new composition of the board of directors will be determined by voting.
Baumgertner is currently under house arrest in Minsk.
During his detention in August of this year, he was charged with abuse of office.
Later, however, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko at a press conference said that the charges to Baumgertner were requalified for "theft."
EU prepares measures to support Ukraine in case of economic pressure from Russia
The European Union has a stand-in-time plan to provide Ukraine with gas, as well as to reach an agreement with the IMF on an emergency loan if Russia takes any measures in response to the possible signing of an association agreement between the EU and Ukraine at the Vilnius summit.
Negotiations are underway with the IMF on a stand-by loan, and another EU official directly involved in the negotiations, added that their goal is to conclude an agreement in the near future.
At the same time, in addition to a potential loan from the IMF, Ukraine can receive 610 million euros from the European Union itself.
Analysts polled by Reuters doubt that Ukraine and the IMF can overcome longstanding disagreements over the terms of financing.
They do not believe in the possibility of reforms needed to get assistance, and the international rating agency S&P, which lowered Ukraine's sovereign rating by one step on Friday - to "B" from "B."
However, EU officials say that the IMF can show flexibility in terms of lending, taking into account the circumstances of Ukraine.
In addition to the plan of financial support, the EU has a reserve option to provide Ukraine with gas, the majority of the supply of which is now coming from Russia.
Perhaps it will be gas from the "Nord stream" or the reverse from Slovakia.
The latter, according to officials, is the most possible and acceptable way if Russia "isolates" Ukraine.
Analysts believe that this method of reverse deliveries to Ukraine can only be used for several weeks, and is likely to lead to a decrease in supplies to other regions.
"Between the EU countries and Ukrainians are negotiating how to create favorable conditions so that Ukraine can import gas from other sources, not from Russia, or from the same source, but on other routes," the source added.

In the United States, it will be possible to use mobile during take-off and landing of the aircraft
The new rules for the safe use of mobile devices during the take-off and landing of the airliner have been approved in the United States, according to the BBC.
As expected, American airlines will allow passengers to use smartphones and tablets throughout the flight, the new rules will begin to operate by the end of 2013.
However, communication with the Internet for receiving and sending e-mail will be prohibited during flights at an altitude below 3 kilometers.
Due to the danger of interference with the aircraft's radio equipment, cellular voice will continue to be banned.
Thus, passengers of flights will be allowed to read e-books, play games on tablets and other gadgets and watch videos during domestic and international flights.
Before the rules are adopted, airlines will be required to check the safety of using electronic devices during the flight.
In addition, the airlines will have to convince the Federal Aviation Administration of the United States that they will be able to cope with the alleged impact of mobile on aircraft and aircraft control devices.
According to the source, according to the example of the United States, the current rules for the use of electronic devices in flights may also be revised in Britain.
Escaped on the field in the match "Shinnik"
Became known some details about the personality of the fan who ran out on the field during the match of the 1/16 finals of the Russian Cup between the Yaroslavl "Shinnik" and Moscow "Spartak."
As stated by the head of the KDK RFU Artur Grigoryants, referring to the data of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, this fan is a Muscovite.
He is currently in detention.
"In addition to this, Grigoryants told about how the fan managed to break through on the field: "It turned out that this, let's call it a spectator, went to the ambulance accompanied by two spectators, citing heart problems.
He went to the ambulance - this was confirmed to us by the ambulance doctor.
And then he pushed away two escorts and ran to the field.
He fled from the corner of the East and South tribune to the corner of the Eastern and North tribune.
He ran through the field.
The stewards are responsible for this.
Before the law on sports comes into force, this is a zone of action of stewards - the police can not interfere in what is on the field.
He ran to the podium, climbed over the East Tribune.
And at this time, riots began in the Eastern tribune and on the treadmills," - said the head of the KDK.
Recall that the decision of the KDK Moscow "Spartak" will hold without the audience the upcoming matches of the 15th round of the Russian championship against "Lokomotiv" and "Zenit," and will also pay a fine of 600 thousand rubles.

Americans eavesdropped Japanese high-ranking officials
On Friday, November 1, one of the US intelligence officials, who chose not to disclose his name, said that the United States eavesdropped on the telephone conversations of high-ranking officials in Japan.
This man confirmed that in the country of the rising sun there are several points designed for listening.
At the same time, he noted that the United States, Great Britain, Australia, Canada, New Zealand do not conduct intelligence activities against each other.
According to him, this happened during the Second World War, when these countries were allies.
But Japan, like Germany, despite allied relations with the Americans in the post-war period, are objects for intelligence activities, NHK reported.
Officially, none of the parties have yet to comment on this information.
We will remind, the news about the surveillance of the US intelligence services for the chancellor of Germany appeared last week.
According to German journalists, the NSA could have been tapping Merkel's phone over the past decade.
The Chancellor herself, according to some reports, took the news of his wiretapping very painfully.
She said that the allies, in her opinion, are Germany and the United States for decades, such a surveillance of the head of government is unacceptable.
Meanwhile, Edward Snowden said he was ready to share details about the wiretapping of Angela Merkel's phone conversations with the German prosecutor's office.
The German specially flew to Moscow to meet with a former CIA officer.
Scandalous video hit the police
Toronto CEO Rob Ford, known for his scandalous and frankly reckless antics, was caught smoking crack.
The police of the Canadian city said that they have an appropriate video and are ready to begin an investigation against the mayor.
He said that his post will not leave, according to CNN.
Information that the authorities have evidence of drug use by Rob Ford appeared on the Toronto police website.
The head of local law enforcement Bill Blair held a press conference on this issue.
The sheriff said that he was not authorized to share these cadres with the public, but he vouchs for their existence.
According to Blair, the compromising Rob Ford video was detected during an anti-drug raid conducted by guards in the summer of 2013.
Previously, the existence of this video has already been written by the Canadian press, but until recently there was no confirmation.
The mayor himself does not comment on this.
He only says that it is not his fault and is not going to resign.
The video detected by the police is one of the evidence in the case of 35-year-old friend Ford Alexander Lisi, who is accused of trafficking in light drugs, extortion, obtaining illegal proceeds, as well as criminal conspiracy.
Sometimes Lisi served as Rob Ford's driver.
Residents of the city have long demanded the resignation of their mayor.
He repeatedly fought journalists, appeared in public drunk, allowed himself racist and sexist statements.
Diana Arbenina Celebrates Halloween with Her Children
Diana Arbenina does not hide the great pleasure she receives from the upbringing of her children.
Despite the fact that it is now Arbenina who gives a lot of time to creativity and social activities, she still finds the opportunity to mess with Martha and Artem, and not only spends time on their training, but also entertains as much as it can.
Over the past week, Diana has twice reported to her fans about her pedagogical talents.
At first, she posted a photo on Facebook, which shows how she teaches children to read.
And yesterday I pampered the fans, showing how I dressed Artem and Martha on Halloween.
We're ready for the broom race! Our first halloween" - so called Diana a photo of her children, dressed in festive costumes.
Which is unwise, because they, like no other Russian boys and girls, are related to this holiday, because they were born in America.
An earthquake of magnitude 6.6 occurred on Thursday, October 31, in the area of the city of Coquimbo in central Chile, Reuters reports.
The earthquake was in the ocean at a depth of 10.7 kilometers and at a distance of 54 kilometers south-west of the city, according to the website of the US Geological Survey (USGS).
The tremors were recorded at 20:03 local time (3:03 on November 1 in Moscow).
The victims or the damage caused by the tremors have not yet been reported.
Recall that Chile is in one of the most seismic areas of the Earth, so earthquakes of different forces there are not uncommon.
One of the most serious happened in 2010.
Then an earthquake of magnitude 8.8 and the tsunami caused by it led to the death in Chile of more than 550 people and the destruction of 220 thousand buildings.
In addition, in Chile, the most powerful earthquake in recent history occurred: in 1960, there was recorded a magnitude of 9.5.
As a result of the disaster, more than five thousand people died.
OJSC "Rostovaeroinvest" recognized the German company Assmann Beraten + Planen as the winner of the tender for the selection of the general designer of the object.
The amount of the contract in "Rostovaeroinvest" is not disclosed.
According to the press service of OJSC, nine Russian and foreign companies participated in the competition, under the terms of the tender, the project should be prepared and sent to the state expertise in the spring of 2014.
The winner will have to design a new passenger terminal of the airport, as well as infrastructure facilities, internal roads and elements of the improvement of the airport complex.
At the first stage of construction, the internal area of the terminal will be 50 thousand. The sq.m. In the future, it may increase.
According to Rostovaeroinvest, the project documentation will take into account the prospects for the development of the airport complex: by 2025, the terminal will be able to serve about 5 million passengers, and by 2035 - 6 million passengers.
By the time of summing up the tender, the architectural concept of the airport complex "South," which was developed by the British company Twelve Architects, was determined.
The project of the building of the main terminal embodies the idea of an air bridge between Rostov-on-Don and other cities of the world.
Assmann Beraten + Planen has experience in the implementation of large projects, the company designed terminals C and E "International Sheremetyevo Airport" and a new airport complex at the international airport "Knevichi" in Vladivostok.
The international airport complex "Yuzhny" will be built in the Aksay district of the Rostov region and will replace the existing Rostov airport, which will be closed and in the future integrated into the urban development.
The construction of the airport complex is scheduled for 2014, the commissioning of all facilities - for 2017.
Italian workers with experience give way to young people
Italian unemployment is breaking records.
Published on Wednesday, the data showed that now 12.5% of the country's residents are unemployed.
It has been so bad since World War II.
Among the young, this figure is higher several times.
40.4% of the population aged 15 to 24 years are unemployed.
In the opinion of the Italian authorities, one of the solutions to this problem is the early retirement of elderly workers.
Such an experiment is already being carried out by the country's largest energy company, and the adopted laws allow the regional authorities to provide part of the early pension for workers with experience.
However, on the other hand, Italy is waiting for a common problem for Europe of the aging population.
And economists are not sure that the idea of a premature rotation of personnel will justify itself.
Syria Destroyed Equipment for Chemical Weapons
Syria destroyed all declared chemical weapons production facilities, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.
This first phase of disarmament was completed by Damascus the day before the deadline.
Until November 1, Syria was to destroy production and other auxiliary facilities designed to prepare combat poisonous substances for use.
The destruction of the stockpiles of toxic substances or their chemical components should be completed by mid-2014.
According to the OPCW representative, the poisonous substances are currently in sealed storage facilities.
International inspectors went to Syria after more than 1,400 people were killed in a chemical attack on the outskirts of Damascus on August 21.
The chief task of the inspectors was not to waste time - not to allow the Syrian authorities to produce more chemical weapons - and destroy the infrastructure for mixing chemicals and equipping ammunition.
These production facilities will now be closely monitored to prevent their repair.
The next milestone is mid-November: by this time the OPCW and the Syrians should agree on a detailed plan to destroy existing stockpiles of toxic substances.
There are a lot of questions here.
Where will they be destroyed?
Who will provide the equipment for this?
All Syrian statements will be carefully checked by Western intelligence agencies.
They will readily advise the inspectors on new facilities for inspection if they suspect that Damascus is not fully frank.
The United States believes that this shelling was carried out by regular troops.
Syria and Russia insist that this is the work of the Syrian rebels.
The world community demanded from the Syrian leadership - in accordance with the agreement reached with the mediation of Russia - to destroy or bring to the non-working state all the capacity for the production of shells, poisonous gases and liquids and to fill the shells with these substances.
Now that this stage has been completed, the next step should be the destruction of the chemical weapons already in place by the Syrian army.
It is expected that this arsenal may have more than 1,000 tons of nerve agents, skin-drilled mustard gas and other banned chemicals stored in several dozen different places.
For its destruction, it is necessary that the OPCW and the Syrian authorities first agree on a schedule of actions - this is allotted for two weeks.
OPCW field chief Jerry Smith told the BBC that his inspectors "personally watched the destruction of the equipment."
"They now do not have the ability to further produce or mix chemical weapons," he said.
In a statement, the OPCW said that the inspectors visited 21 of the 23 facilities in Syria and were convinced that the plants for the production of shells and poisonous substances were either destroyed or put in disrepair.
The remaining two facilities are too dangerous to conduct an inspection there, the document says, but the equipment was transported and inspected by OPCW specialists.
According to Smith, the process of destroying the infrastructure for the production of chemical weapons was "especially difficult," as it had to work in the context of the ongoing conflict.
In early October, the OPCW received the Nobel Peace Prize, but, according to Smith, there was no time to celebrate the inspectors - they were too busy with the work.
George Kerevan: the gap with Europe gives the Scots a choice
Another day, another horror story about independence.
This time, we are warned that an independent Scotland will have to join the European zone of free movement as a condition of EU membership.
It is a series of stories about passport control in Bervik and the border with barbed wire along the Adrianov shaft.
However, the Strathclyde newspaper pointed to the possible economic benefits of more free movement across the rest of Europe, although - which is predictable - it did not appear in the headlines.
No one has pointed out that EU member states spend a lot of time turning their formal rules in the way they are comfortable.
Since Scotland is not now part of the Schengen area, the continuation of non-compliance with the requirements will be a cheap concession for Brussels in return for what he really wanted from the Scots.
So it's not a noteworthy story.
And so old that it turned into a fossil: for the first time I heard a duck that "independence means passport control" at least 40 years ago.
And yet there is an interesting moment lost during the retelling of an old fairy tale.
Why should an independent Scotland comply with Europe's orders?
Why change London's yoke on the yoke of Brussels, especially now?
Here are the real European news: the great post-war plan to unite Europe has finally stalled.
With the eurocrisis project "Europe" is officially dead.
Throughout the European Union, parties opposing the EU or canceling the euro as a single currency are gaining in force.
Even in Germany, the Euroskeptic party, the Alternative for Germany - founded this year only - emerged out of nowhere and received almost five million votes in the September federal election, thus essentially ousting the Free Democrats (similar to our Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been an internal opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis was a turning point.
The austerity measures imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, and the shackles imposed on national economies through the preservation of the single currency, led many people to believe that the project has gone too far.
The euro crisis is not much due to the fact that national governments work with excessive budget deficits - this was true only for Greece.
In fact, the Eurosystem has blocked its members at exchange rates favorable to German exporters - that German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the national currency, southern Europe is in a pre-disputable position in terms of production opportunities in comparison with Germany.
The only means of saving is to cut salaries and government spending, which is actively supported by Berlin.
Behind the current problems of the budget and currency is the deeper problem of Europe's productive abilities.
As a result of the set of green energy measures introduced by Brussels, the cipher, which means subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of the consumer, the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas than in the United States.
It's paralyzingly unfavorable price conditions, as we've seen in Grangemouth.
No wage freeze in the world will stop the collapse of the cheap US shale gas victory over the European petrochemical industry.
As a result, a riot is brewing, especially in France, once the most ardent supporter of the EU.
After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a way to control Germany and put Paris on the same level as Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a means of obtaining political legitimacy, and has already imposed its own economic policies on Europe, leaving the devastated economy of France in distress.
The result is the right-wing, against the EU Marine Le Pen's party, the National Front, has just won the decisive additional elections, dropping the ruling party of socialists in third place.
The Front is now the most popular party in France, with 24 percent of the vote - a timely warning to British Labour that it is impossible to assume that the split among the right will automatically affect the left.
What makes Le Pen with his newfound popularity among the French working class?
It wants to use the EU elections next year to create a bloc in the European Parliament against the EU and against the single currency.
If - very likely - the parties opposed to the EU will receive support in these elections, such a bloc will be able to occupy a dominant position in the European Parliament for the first time.
Here's my opinion: the growing sentiment against the EU and against the single currency in Europe will merge together to destroy the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will again be something of a vague "Europe" (sovereign) nations that General de Gaulle liked.
Germany and several dependent economies can save the euro, but France and southern Europe will restore their own currencies.
I assume that the UK is distancing itself from this project, hoping to get closer to the United States.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific indicates the likelihood that Britain will be ignored in the cold of the Atlantic.
In what position does it leave Scotland?
We can choose to become a region of Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which means, among other things, to send Berlin and Brussels to hell.
I suspect that Scotland will be able to succeed in a more free European arrangement, provided that we retain our currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries will be easier in non-Federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider repeating Norway's experience and preserving our economic independence.
The Scottish National Party's government is, oddly enough, the most successful political movement in Europe directed against austerity measures, which received an impressive majority in 2011 thanks to objections to spending cuts proposed (and realized) by Labour Treasury Chancellor Alistair Darling and the later coalition of Tories and the later-off coalition of Tories.
Scotland would now be ridiculous to vote for independence only to take austerity measures imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Australian woman appeals against prison sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney, sentenced to 15 days in prison on Phuket Island for falsely claiming that she had been attacked by a taxi driver, appealed the sentence and was released on bail.
Stevie Roschel Bamford was initially found guilty on 15 June by the Phuket Provincial Court of filing a false lawsuit following a Thai police report that a local taxi driver had carried out the attack on the night of Sunday, while two other men held her.
However, the recordings of CCTV cameras later it was revealed that she returned safely to her hotel after breaking off relations with her Australian boyfriend.
Phuket police questioned Bamford for two days before she admitted that it had fabricated the story.
Before the trial, she was detained in local police cells.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence at the general detention centre on the outskirts of Phuket, not in a women's adult prison.
She is the daughter of former Australian League player Peter Tanks, who appealed to the Foreign Ministry in Canberra for help for his daughter.
Tanks told the Sydney Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was extremely concerned about their daughter's well-being and was waiting for her return to Australia.
"Obviously, it was an alarming time, but we hope that she will safely return home as soon as possible," Tanks said.
Bamford appealed against her sentence and was released on bail of 50,000 baht.
According to reports in Australia, she is currently spending her vacation in the Krabi resort area in southern Thailand.
Lawyers in Thailand reported that Bamford is currently represented by a local lawyer in Phuket, but warned that the appeal could lead to the court increasing her sentence for up to two years and forcing her serving her term in adult prison.
However, after the recent murder of Australian travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also seek to restore its eroded tourist image, leading to an acquittal.

Examinations for a driver's license will be accepted by private companies that have their own computerized circuit.
This is reported by "Kommersant" with reference to the draft resolution of the government "On admission to the management of vehicles."

Early puberty: aging earlier
African-American and Latin American girls tend to reach puberty before their white peers show.
Physical change does not mean that puberty is close
No evidence that hormones or other chemicals are to blame
Experts believe that the epidemic of obesity may be one of the trigger mechanisms of early puberty
The tendency to early puberty is not so pronounced in boys
A former CNN correspondent, Pat Etheridge, is a journalist specializing in children's health and family issues.
Should a mother be scared if her daughter begins to form the rudiments of the mammary gland and grow pubic hair at 7 or 8 years?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, children's endocrinologist Dr. Paul Caplavitz explained that these early physical changes are quite common among American girls and represent a new norm.
"I spend a lot of time calming my parents - usually that doesn't mean the rapid onset of total puberty," said Kaplavvitz.
Obvious signs of development, such as growing breasts, pubic and axillary hair and body odor, appear earlier in girls.
But there was only a slight shift in the age of menarche (the first menstruation) over the past four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years and decreased from 12.75 in 1970.
"After breasts begin to develop, it takes at least two to three years before menarche," said Caplavitz, who is also the author of the book "Early puberty in girls: how to cope with this common problem."
Time is the most accurate check on how puberty will progress.
A debate is ongoing on what constitutes the actual onset of puberty, but is considered "premature," when breast augmentation is accompanied by a sharp increase in growth to 8 years.
In most cases, the process will slow down or stop - this is something that the pediatrician can monitor carefully.
Faster progression may serve as the basis for endocrinologist tests to rule out serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are procedures to delay early menstruation and prevent another consequence: premature aging of the bones, which can eventually lead to slowing growth and low growth in adulthood.
Recommendations for drug or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child, the level of development, the rate of growth and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Caplavitz is cautious with medications, but admits that "pulling puberty can alleviate behavioral problems and feelings of girls that they are different from peers.
Another big problem is clear: parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have menstrual periods.
"They're worried about the risk of pregnancy or even how they'll handle hygiene issues," said Caplavitz.
It was a shock, - recalls one woman whose daughter began menstruation at the age of 10.
Although there were signs and we talked about menstruation, it wasn't emotionally ready.
She came home from the school, frightened and frustrated by the fact that she was the first among her friends.
There are many advertised theories about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no consistent evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media are to blame.
In boys, like girls, puberty occurs earlier.
Caplavitz argues that the premise that has the most weight is an obesity epidemic.
In 2001, he helped conduct a study of girls from 6 to 9 years old, which links the amount of fat in the body to the timing of puberty.
Other data confirm this finding, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, African-American and Latin American girls tend to reach puberty before their white peers.
There are various explanations.
Around the world, early puberty appears to be affected by everything from economic conditions and climate to genes.
Another mystery: although boys have facial and pubic hair appear at a younger age, the tendency to full early puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors attending the AAP conference confirmed the complexity of the topic.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common even in infants and children of toddler age.
"We need to be careful about how we define the true onset of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at the Gorieb Children's Hospital in G. Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not be embarrassed to receive instructions from the pediatrician about how to talk to their child.
"This may mean an earlier-needed-expected conversation," - explained Caplavitz.
If you remain calm, your child will usually react well.
Girls who flourish early need confirmation that even when this happens before that, this process is a normal part of life.
The head of Dagestan is heard in the anthem of the Kuban note of extremism
The football match between Anzhi and Kubanu resulted in a political conflict between the authorities of the Krasnodar Territory and Dagestan after the fans burned the Dagestan flag, and the anthem of the Kuban sounded differently.
The head of Dagestan, Ramazan Abdulatipov on Thursday, invited Republican parliamentarians to appeal to the court, because the anthem of the Krasnodar Territory allegedly appeals for ethnic hatred, in particular, calls for war with the "basurmans."
Take the anthem of the Krasnodar Territory, this in our time in 1995 approved this anthem.
It's a shame, and no one does it.
"Youre here, as the mother of the native, on the enemy, on the Basurmanin, we go to the death battle" - why such words to be recorded in the anthem, to poison some believers on others," - said the Chairman of the Parliament Hizri Shikhadashov.
RBS suspends two currency traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has temporarily suspended two traders in its foreign exchange operations division, according to two people familiar with the situation, which is another confirmation that the global audit of the proposed manipulation of the foreign exchange market is rapidly gaining momentum.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are collaborating with regulators in investigations related to the world's largest financial market, with a daily turnover of $5.3 trillion.
The two traders will be the first RBS employees to be detached in an unfolding investigation that echoes the scandal surrounding the manipulation of the LIBOR interbank rate.
Refusing to comment on the suspensions, the bank confirmed that this month it had received requests for information from regulators.
Our ongoing investigation into this issue is ongoing and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and our other regulators.
Last month, knowledgeable individuals said that RBS had handed over emails and instantaneous messages received and sent by his former trader, the UK's regulatory authority, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).
This trader, Richard Asher, left RBS in 2010 and, as far as is known, he was given a vacation to his current position as head of European spot currency trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trading at Citi, went on vacation this week, while Matt Gardiner, a former senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended from work by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have been charged with any violations.
Mr. Asher's instant messaging contact group included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, according to knowledgeable individuals.
UBS Bank said this week that it had taken action against some of its employees after Swiss regulator Finma said it was investigating alleged currency market manipulations in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six regulators in the world - the European Commission, Finma, Switzerland's Weko, FCA, the U.S. Department of Justice and Hong Kong's Monetary Authority - are considering claims that bankers have colluded to influence the foreign exchange market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also started internal inspections or received requests for information from regulators, the individuals familiar with the situation said.
Banks are viewing instant messages and emails in a few years in search of cases of offenses.
News of the audits stirred traders in the field of activity, which in recent years was one of the largest sources of income of trade divisions of investment banks, which this year, however, faced difficulties due to the fact that low currency volatility reduces favorable opportunities for dealers.
Some bankers have tried to downplay the seriousness of the situation by saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the vast and highly liquid currency market, but senior traders say that's not always true.
According to the senior trader, despite the huge volume of daily trading in the foreign exchange market, the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and the wider use of banks" internal platforms means that you can start influencing the market for a very small price.
The news came the same day that Credit Suisse announced that it had fired one of the traders of its London Stock Exchange this week after it caused nearly $6 million in losses late last year.
The Bank immediately notified the relevant authorities and cooperates with its regulators.
We are sure that the trader acted alone and that this issue was managed to localize, - Credit Suisse reported.

Venezuela to set exchange rate for tourists
Venezuela will introduce a special exchange rate of its national currency - bolivar - against the dollar for tourists.
This was reported by Bloomberg on November 1, citing a government decree.
Foreign travelers will be allowed to exchange amounts equivalent to ten thousand US dollars per year.
Venezuela will also allow tourists to sell up to 25 percent of the bolivars purchased in the country at the time of departure.
The specific rate of the bolivar against the dollar will be set later.
In February, Caracas was forced to devalue the local currency to 6.3 bolivars per dollar.
However, on the black market, one dollar is estimated at 57 bolivars.
Since the beginning of the year, the bolivar has lost almost 70 percent of its value.
In September, inflation in Venezuela was almost 50 percent.
Oil Industry Minister and Vice President for the Economy Rafael Ramirez said on October 18 that Venezuela has no plans to devalue the bolivar.
According to unofficial information provided by the agency, Caracas may still decide to depreciate the national currency after the municipal elections in December.
Policies to contain prices for products and consumer goods, as well as a high degree of overregulation of the Venezuelan economy, led to a shortage of a number of goods and the functioning of the black currency market.
In the spring of this year, the media wrote that there was a shortage of toilet paper in Venezuela.
John Kerry says in his unprecedented confession that U.S. espionage has come inappropriately far away
John Kerry demonstrated a mitigation of U.S. surveillance programs" protection tactics, making unprecedented recognition that in some cases U.S. espionage has come inappropriately far away.
The Secretary of State also admitted that he was guilty, along with Barack Obama, that he was a "autopilot" during the appearance of Edward Snowden's high-profile revelations about the NSA's espionage activities.
These leaks of information put the U.S. government at the center of a diplomatic scandal with their allies.
Speaking on video link at an open government conference in London, Mr. Kerry said: "There is no doubt that the president and I, as well as other members of the government, actually took some things happening on autopilot, because such an opportunity already existed - both during the Second World War and in the very difficult years of the Cold War, and of course, on September 11.
He then became the first senior member of the U.S. government to admit that U.S. espionage went too far, but stressed that no one had been violated.
He said, "In some cases, this has come insignuishably far away.
And the president is determined to shed light on this issue and explain to people, and is now conducting a thorough analysis so that no one has a sense of abuse.
I assure you, there is no abuse of innocent people in this process.
Mr. Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA had acted out of good motives and that his surveillance operations had saved many lives.
We are working in a new world where people are ready to blow themselves up.
There is radical extremism in the world, reckless and determined to kill people, blow people up and attack governments.
And if you were able to intercept it, stop it before it happens?
We actually prevented plane crashes, building bombings and killing people because we were able to learn about these plans in advance.
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers will head to Europe to help resolve issues related to alleged U.S. espionage abroad and convince Europeans of the need to continue joint anti-terrorist activities with the U.S., Senate Subcommittee Chairman on European Affairs said on Thursday.
Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy said he had spoken to members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorist organizations due to frustration over the surveillance of the National Security Agency.
"It is really important for the U.S. national security interests that the Europeans remain our supporters of our common anti-terrorist efforts," said Democrat Murphy, who is serving his first term and chairing the Senate subcommittee on European Affairs, in an interview with Washington.
And I'm going to Europe to let them know that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, despite their anger over these NSA programs.
News that the NSA has collected millions of phone records in Europe has worsened relations with some U.S. allies, although the agency's chief said this week it was inaccurate and reflected a misunderstanding of the metadata that NATO allies and that they shared with the U.S.
Other revelations included documents released by Snowden indicating that the NSA monitored German Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone, as well as phones of about 34 other world leaders.
National Intelligence Director James Klapper defended spying against allies as necessary and said it was a common case on both sides.
Against the backdrop of this hype, Murphy said that his office was organizing a trip of members of Congress, which was expected to take place this year, and that he hoped that the delegation would be composed of members of both parties and both chambers.
The names of other participating legislators should be announced in the coming days.
According to him, the program of the trip is still under development.
Although Murphy stated that the purpose of the trip was to promote better relationships, he said that some degree of hardness from the best motives would also be shown.
He said European leaders should be honest with their people in what espionage programs they themselves have been using for many years.
"While we can change our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also agree that we are not the only ones involved in intelligence," Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry should head this weekend to the Middle East and Poland to address the challenges of hostility to the U.S. strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as U.S. intelligence activities.
In the United States, the school's principal shot down teenagers.
The directors of one of the American high schools teenagers literally brought to despair.
The man, he said, had to take a gun and start shooting.
The incident occurred in the state of Tennessee.
As the New York Post writes, young hooligans threw the man's house with toilet paper.
Because of this, the headmaster of the school opened fire on teenagers, as a result of which several wounds in the leg and hand received a 15-year-old boy.
Since the hooligans were not on the territory of the director's property, he was charged with aggravated assault.
The man was released from prison on bail of $ 125,000.
It should be noted that the shooting of civilians in the United States is becoming a terrible regularity.
Literally on the eve of the man opened fire in the center of the city of Ridgecrest in the US state of California right on passers-by on the street.
After that, the criminal took two random passers-by hostage, hid them in the trunk of the car and tried to escape.
Earlier, a shooting was opened at Newtown's primary school in Newtown, Connecticut.
At school, Adam's mother worked, she was a teacher.
Shooting at American school: 14-year-old girl injured
Another shooting incident occurred on January 31 at an American school, this time in Anlant, Georgia.

The Chinese newspaper that published the call "will be reorganized"
The Chinese newspaper, which published on the front page a call for the release of the accused in the defamation of the reporter, should be reorganized, according to the press regulator.
The Guangzhou-based newspaper New Express made an unexpected public statement asking for journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he took bribes for writing false articles about the company with a share of state ownership.
Now the "New Express" must pass the process of complete correction of errors, as the regulator reports.
The order on "corrections" came from the Guangdong Department in the field of press and publications, radio, film and television.
A preliminary investigation found that the Yangcheng Evening News Group, the newspaper "New Express" published several false reports about the exchange-recorded company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
The management of the editorial board of the "New Express" was disoriented, - said in the statement of the regulator.
He reports that the decision was made to impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou in the form of the revocation of his reporter's license.
He also instructed the Yangcheng Evening News Group to make a complete correction of errors in the New Express and recommended that it investigate the situation-related authorities of the newspaper and immediately make changes to the leadership of the New Express.
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for the "New Express," in which he claimed financial violations in a construction company called Zoomlion.
After he was detained, his newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page, saying she supported his journalistic activities.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on state television acknowledging that he published false articles for money.
In this case, I have damaged Zoomlion, as well as the entire news media industry and its ability to trust the public, he told CCTV.
I did it mainly because I was eager for money and fame.
I realized my guilt.
After Mr. Chen's confessions, the New Express published an apology on the front page, saying the newspaper had failed to properly verify his reports.
Recently, several high-ranking suspects made a confession on television.
Experts say the practice of knocking out confessions in China is still ubiquitous, despite recent amendments to laws that prohibit authorities from forcing anyone to negotiate.

It was right in the middle of the steep slope - 50 feet to the top and to the ground.
She didn't move her muscle during the rescue, she completely froze.
But she's fine now.
Then she ate the cookies.
It was a very unusual challenge.
The fact that the dog was noticed is incredible.
Officer-specialist of the rescue squad Peter Lau said: "Ruby is very lucky that she was rescued.
It was likely that she could get a very serious injury or worse.

Ms Hall of Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "It was scary to observe salvation.
I couldn't believe she was there at all.
It was amazing when she was in our hands again.
The veterinarian said that if she had exhausted and lost consciousness, she would probably have fallen.
The firefighters were great.
It was very brave, what they did.
We are so grateful, and each of them was absolutely amazing.
Mr. Alderson of the city of Keetley added: "We were afraid that she could fall, but she stayed there.
The firefighters were astonishing.
I just can't believe she was there.
Do you think travel agents have been a thing of the past thanks to the Internet?
The Flight Centre seems to be in reverse.
The company has updated its full-year profit forecast and expects record revenues from holidaymakers in Australia and the UK.
This travel firm now expects its main full annual pre-tax profit to tax to $325 million, compared to the previous forecast in the range of $305 to $315 million.

This includes Australia and the United Kingdom, which usually bring us the largest profits.

"We will be sure to analyze the causes of the incident and draw our conclusions from this, but it is completely impossible to prevent such incidents," he said.
On November 1, Anonymous Ukraine posted an appeal on the network, in which it confirmed a hacker attack on the website of the Estonian Ministry of Defense and opposed the partnership between Ukraine and NATO.
We want the NATO leadership to hear our voice, the voice of the Ukrainian people.
We should not be NATO servants.
Ukrainians do not want to die for the interests of NATO member states.
Ukraine does not need a NATO bloc.
Ukraine does not need the European Union.
Ukraine does not need Russia.
Ukraine should not be anyone's slave.
We are in favour of an independent Ukraine.
"Hands off Ukraine," Anonymous said in a statement.
Earlier, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine reported that the company of the Marines of the Feodosia separate battalion of the Ukrainian Marine Corps will take part in the command and staff exercises of the NATO response force Steadfast Jazz-2013.
Japan will discuss with Russia the issue of concluding a peace treaty
Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kisida met Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov to discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty between the two countries.
"We would like to openly exchange views on the further development of the political dialogue, to discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty," Kisida said at the meeting.
The Japanese Foreign Minister recalled that after Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe visited Russia, relations between the countries became warmer and acquired a bilateral character.
The Russian Minister, in turn, noted that the Russian Federation will meet Japan in solving complex political issues, writes RIA Novosti.
The conclusion of a peace treaty between Japan and Russia implies a solution to the disputed Northern Territories.
In this regard, protests are being held in Tokyo today demanding the return of the land lost after World War II to the country.
Cars drive in the Japanese capital, from which the loudspeaker is reported: "Return the northern territories!"
The police do not stop the protesters, they ensure that the noise level is not exceeded.
Halloween 2013 in Numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, not to go to bed late and arrange a masquerade for our area.
Now I'm more in a garbage.
I haven't been called in the last two years to hand out candy in my apartment and probably won't be this year.
However, the statistics show that I am a white crow in Halloween.
According to the National Retail Federation, most Americans - namely 158 million - will celebrate Halloween this year and will spend a total of $6.9 billion on candy, suits and jewelry.
The only thing I'm waiting for every Halloween is the trends.
The National Retail Federation predicts that the costumes will take $1.2 billion out of the spent $ 6.9 billion.
This year, at the peak of fashion, sexual inanimate objects.
Women no longer need to be sex workers; they may also be sexy foods, such as pizzas, hamburgers or carrots.
As for the men, I think we'll see a lot of zombies thanks to the Walking Dead, and I'm sure that Daft Punk-style astronauts will get into our Instagram feathers this year.
According to Google, the costumes that are searched for most often are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
There is nothing wrong with the traditional approach.
We dressed our dogs last year and, to my surprise, we were not the only one.
Moreover, according to the National Retail Federation, Americans will spend $330 million this year on pet costumes.
It means a lot of funny hot dogs.
When it comes to candy, we don't get the little things.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion on them this year, according to Nielsen.
That's about 600 million pounds of Hershey chocolates, lollipops, milk Duds candy, Twizzlers chewing candies and Clark Bar bars.
According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, this is great news for the 41 million children who need candy, who are prepared to conquer our areas.
What's more, we're going to buy and I'm not going to fool ourselves, we're going to eat 90 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.
The only thing we don't want to eat is candy in the form of corn grains; and yet, according to the National Confectioners Association, they are sold under Halloween.
That's about 9 billion individual corn grains.
It's a mystery that I have yet to solve.
Nothing expresses the essence of Halloween as it is at home with ghosts.
They have amazing names, such as Horror behind the walls (which, by the way, is in a real prison), "Wovoy and scream," and "House of shock."
Moreover, according to the company America Haunts, in America there are 1200 officially recognized haunted houses generating about $500 million in income, as well as those stunning photos where you almost peed, which your friend posted on Facebook, and then the guy you like, sees this photo and leaves a comment like a classy.
And in conclusion, let's talk about pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to the Great Pumpkin when we were children, and cutting the plaid of Jack's lamp is like a Christmas tree decoration, what we've been doing since we were a kid.
Luckily for us, the fashion for a child in pumpkin began only last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up cutting out these pumpkins, not sitting in them.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins this year.
Jack's lamp slowly drying out on your porch probably arrived from Illinois, which has grown this year 542 million pounds of pumpkin.
If you want tasks more difficult, visit Tim and Susan Matisdon in Napa, California, and try cutting out something of their pumpkin weighing 2032 pounds.
Bayern defender David Alaba became the best athlete of Austria in 2013, according to the official website of the Bundesliga.
In this dispute, he was ahead of the representatives of winter sports, which traditionally become the best in the country.
The second place was taken by the skier Marcel Hirscher, and the third - a ski jumper from Gregor Schlirenzauer.
Last season, 21-year-old Austrian Filipino-Niggerian-born helped his team to win the Champions League, the German Cup and the UEFA Super Cup.
In Kineshma and the district, two men committed suicide
Previously, one of the hanged had already attempted suicide.
On October 30, at about 1-00, in the village of Lugovoy at his place of residence, a man born in 1947 committed suicide by hang.
It is known that he had already attempted suicide.
What prompted the man to such a step is unknown.
On October 31, at 11-50, a 41-year-old man, a resident of Kineshma, died of hanging at the place of residence.
Signs of violent death have not been found, the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs "Kineshemsky" reports.
Mick Jagger says he didn't flirt with Katy Perry when she was 18.
During an interview with an Australian radio show this week, the pop star said she was a backing vocalist for Jagger's 2004 Old habits hard.
Perry said she had dinner with a veteran rocker, and said: "He flirted with me when I was 18.
She added: "It was a long time ago, and he was very kind.
In a statement on Thursday, a spokesman for the seventy-year-old Jagger said he denies him that he had ever hit Katy Perry.
The representative added: "Maybe she confuses him with someone else."
Perry was among the performers who appeared as guests on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Her new album Prism debuted in first place this week.
Discovered U.S. Tunnel - Mexico for drug transport equipped with own rail
Found one of the most complex drug smuggling tunnels between the United States and Mexico, equipped with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail system.
The U.S. government has described the tunnel four by three feet wide as one of the most difficult secret moves they've ever discovered.
This tunnel, which is the length of almost six football fields, connects the warehouses near the city of Tijuana (Mexico) and San Diego (USA).
This area is filled with inconspicuous warehouses, which facilitates the hidden loading of drugs in trucks.
The tunnel was closed before any drugs were imperceptibly transferred through it, as the authorities said.
According to court documents, law enforcement officers confiscated eight and a half tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine when the tunnel was detected.
Three men, who, according to law enforcement officers, worked as drivers, were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine for distribution.
If convicted, they face prison sentences ranging from 10 years to life imprisonment.
In the city of Nogales, Arizona, smugglers use extensive underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passage found in San Diego since 2006.
Several of the largest tunnels were discovered in Central Mexico after a marijuana harvest in October, which posed to drug cartels the difficult task of delivering their products to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a passage of about 700 yards long, equipped with rail tracks, which went from the kitchen of one of the houses in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
The parents of a teenager from Georgia who died by "unscrupulous chance" believe that their son was killed
The parents of a teenager from Georgia, whose body was found inside a rolled-up sports mat in the gym of his high school, believe that their son was killed, the family's lawyer said on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from the city of Valdost, Georgia was found on January 11 in a vertically standing mat, leaned from behind to the stands in the gym of his high school.
Investigators in the Sheriff's Office of Lundes County concluded that Johnson died by tragic accident, but the family of the 17-year-old's family is challenging this.
They're absolutely sure that their son was killed," Benjamin Crump, a lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson told FoxNews.com.
They never believed he was killed the way the sheriff said.
"They believe that this is contrary to logic, the laws of physics, as well as common sense," said Kramp.
They think it's a cover for the protection of the person or the people responsible for the death of their son.
They sent their son to school with a school bag, and they brought him back in a bag for the corpses, he said.
American lawyer Michael Moore said on Thursday that he is conducting an official investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several key questions remain unanswered.
What caused death?
Was his death the result of a crime?
Moore made a statement at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I'll study all the facts wherever they go.
My goal is to know the truth.
I am of the opinion that there are sufficient grounds for an official investigation, he said.
Moore told reporters that the initial autopsy showed that Johnson had died as a result of "positional asphyxia."
However, the second autopsy, according to Moore, showed another cause of death.
"There are a few questions that should be resolved or clarified, he said.
Moore added that if he found enough evidence to require a criminal or civilian investigation into Johnson's death, he would ask the FBI to do so.
A spokesperson for the Sheriff's Office of Louundes County County was not available for comment when he was contacted on Thursday.
A South Georgia judge on Wednesday ordered authorities to publish all video footage of surveillance cameras that the investigators viewed.
The teenager's parents said they hoped the videos contained the key to unraveling how he died.
Pakistani authorities start talks with local Taliban
Pakistani authorities have begun negotiations with the Taliban.
This was reported by the country's embassy in the UK, where Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif is on a visit.
The head of the government of Pakistan made a statement on negotiations with Islamic extremists during a meeting with British Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, with whom he discussed the relations between Pakistan and India, the world energy market and economic reforms in Pakistan.
"The prime minister said that the dialogue with the Taliban had begun," the Pakistani embassy in London said in a statement.
"He said he hopes and prays that the dialogue will work in accordance with the Constitution of Pakistan," the diplomats added.
The Pakistani Taliban (Tehriqiq Pakistan) are allies of the Afghan movement of the same name, but operate independently in the north-western regions of the country bordering Afghanistan.
The Pakistani Taliban are seeking the creation of an Islamic state.
Earlier, the Islamabad government had attempted to start negotiations with local Taliban, but the movement refused dialogue.
It stated that it would go to negotiations only if the authorities took troops stationed in the areas where the Taliban were operating to permanent locations, as well as freed from prisons arrested Islamists.
Nawaz Sharif arrived in London for the World Islamic Economic Forum.
On Tuesday, October 29, British Prime Minister David Cameron, the head of the Pakistani government and Afghan President Hamid Karzai held a tripartite meeting in London to discuss the prospects for the peace process in Afghanistan.
Goalkeeper of "Neftekhimika" Matt Dalton refused to comment on the departure of Vladimir Krikunov from the post of mentor of Nizhnekamsk.
The goalkeeper believes that the acting head coach Dmitry Balmin enjoys great authority among the players and will cope with his duties.
Recall that today "Neftekhimik" resigned Krikunov.
To be honest, I would not like to comment on the dismissal of Vladimir Krikunov, - quotes Dalton RIA "Novosti."
I can only say that Dmitry Balmin will cope with the obligations imposed on him - I have no doubt about this.
In the team, he enjoys great authority, this young specialist is definitely waiting for a great future.
Pawnshop owners in Singapore are doing well, while the middle class is experiencing difficulties
In a pawnshop at the Bendemir shopping center in Singapore, Gianani Amirthalinga lays a gold bracelet, a ring and earring to pay for her daughter's schooling.
"My husband and I just bought a house, so all my money is invested there, says Ms. Amirthaling.
Although she earns a S$3000 ($2400) per month as an administrator and her husband also works, the monthly income of the family is not enough, she says.
Indeed, demand in various parts of Southeast Asia - where household debt is growing - is such that ValueMax, where it is carrying out its deal, became the third pawnshop listed on the Singapore stock exchange this week.
A handheld credit is not just a quick way to get money (S$1300 in the case of Ms. Amirthhalring), but it's almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
Usually, pawnshops in Singapore accrued an effective annual interest rate of 17 percent - just above 15.4 percent, offered at the United Overseas Bank branch, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping center.
However, pawnshops have the advantage that they do not require credit checks or salary evidence and can issue loans faster than banks.
Therefore, millions of people in the entire region are turning to pawnshops as families feel pressured by rising living costs and rapid growth in household debt and consumer debt.
After five years of sustained growth following the global financial crisis and the cheap loans fueled by free monetary policies in advanced economies, low- and middle-income families turn to plummetres to offset revenue decline as their economies slow down.
This week, Standard & Poor's, a rating agency, indicated an increase in family leverage, mainly due to the growth of the mortgage, as a risk factor for Asian banks" creditworthiness.
It stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest ratio of household debt to gross domestic product in Asia.
Malaysia topped this list with 80 percent of GDP compared to 60 percent in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high levels of consumer debt in Thailand, which barely emerged from a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed a continuing decline in exports and a weakening of consumer demand.
The point is that with prices rising, people at the middle and bottom of the income will look for ways to replenish their income where they can," said Song Seng Wong, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Record-high gold prices in the past two years have rushed with which people lay their personal belongings, as they use the opportunity to get money for their family jewelry.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the items laid in 200 pawnshops of the city-state are gold products.
People say that the price of gold looks good, let's lay the gold chain of the grandmother and get it back next month.
In Thailand, the largest pawnshop operator EasyMoney has seen an increase in the number of customers using its branches in recent months, up to 20 percent.
The growth in the pawnshop business is such that ValueMax, the operator of the branch in Bendemir and 15 others in Singapore, plans to expand not only in neighboring Malaysia, where it has four stores, but also outside Asia, says Yeach Lee Ching, CEO of ValueMax.
The company will fund the expansion, using 60 percent of the S$66 million raised this week as a result of the placement of shares on the Singapore stock exchange.
While some creditors have sparked fire from high interest rates, Ms. Yeah says that the pawnshop not only offers cheaper tariffs than other lenders, it also does not increase debt directly.
"Customers lay the items they already own, and the monetization of personal assets does not increase household debt, she says.
The mortgage is gaining increasing public recognition as a means to obtain short-term, secured funding.
And at the same time, pawnshops are used not only by those categories of people who are in a difficult financial situation.
Rich people in Singapore also use ValueMax branches, laying gold bars or Rolex watches that can give up to 60 percent of their cash purchase value.
We see clients from all walks of life.
They include wealthy individuals who need to borrow short-term money for commercial projects or investments, or small businesses that need to overcome temporary monetary difficulties.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Bashkiria can put grain for sale not earlier than early 2014
Bashkiria during public procurement interventions can put grain for auctions not earlier than the beginning of 2014, said Minister of Agriculture of the Republic Nikolai Kovalenko.
To date, market prices are such that they do not stimulate sales to the intervention fund.
So far, the price in the market is higher, and there is demand.
"Perhain the grain will be put up for auction, after the New Year," he said at yesterday's press conference.
The Minister recalled that this year, the crops for the harvest in 2013 amounted to 3.1 million hectares, including the area of grain crops - 1.7 million hectares, which is 3.3% more than last year.
Under the harvest of 2014 sown 550 thousand. ha (for 105 thousand. more than in 2012.
The area was increased for winter wheat and triticale, the rye remained at the same level.
In the Voronezh region detained a football fan, broke a window in the waiting room of the station
At nine o'clock in the evening on October 29 at the station Gryazhi-Voronezh, transport police officers removed from the passenger train two football fans - natives of the Moscow region.
Going to the game of their favorite team, the guys on the way staged a drunken debosh on the train.
The young people were taken to the duty part of the linear police station at the Grazhi station to draw up a protocol on an administrative offense.
There fans repented of their anti-social behavior.
The police issued them administrative material and released them.
Young people bought tickets for the next train and at the station station began to wait for his arrival.
In the first night, fans left the railway station building, but one of them, a 22-year-old boy, suddenly returned and kicked the front door in the waiting room.
On the ringing of the broken glass rushed rushed by an employee of the transport police and a security guard of the PSC "RZD."
They managed to apprehend the attacker who was trying to escape from the scene.
Employees of the South-Eastern LU of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia are checking.
The issue of initiating a criminal case is shaken, said the senior referent of the direction of information and public relations of the South-Eastern LU of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia on transport Sergey Olkhovik.
Russian security forces do not know anything about the group "Brother's Circle" - New Izvestia
This writes INTERFAX.RU with reference to an informed source in the law enforcement agencies of the Russian Federation.
"After the media there were reports of the US Treasury Department of Leps in the control lists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian criminal syndicate "Brother's Circle," we looked at all the databases, but such a group found no," - said the Agency interlocutor.
In his opinion, the dissemination of this information contributes to the maintenance of the myth of the so-called Russian mafia, which allegedly operates abroad.
As previously wrote "NI," yesterday the US Treasury Department published on its website a list of alleged members of the criminal group "Brother's Circle."
Among them was the Russian singer Grigory Leps.
He appears on the list as "Grish," posted the day before.
With the data of the popular Russian performer, they coincide.
The exact name is indicated - Grigory Lepsevridze, a creative pseudonym, place and date of birth.
In addition to Leps, there are five more people mentioned.
Two Russians, an Israeli citizen, a citizen of Uzbekistan and another native of the former USSR, whose citizenship is not specified.
The United States is confident that Grigory Leps, who lives on the island of Phuket, transported money for the bandits on their order.
A photo of the singer is attached to this message and all his data that are true.
Moreover, Leps really recently bought a house in Phuket.
The ministry noted that they intend to impose sanctions against Leps.
Putting a person on the blacklists of the American Ministry of Finance entails blocking his assets in the United States and banning business contacts with him of persons living in the United States.
Assistant Leps Maya Serikova said that no notifications to the singer were not received: "It is difficult to answer the question of whether this is Grigory, which everyone is talking about now in connection with the scandal in the United States."
All that Leps knows is media.
Officially, there were no notifications to him personally, although I do not know whether they are in such cases.
"And, of course, this is all, on the one hand, funny, and on the other - surprising and unexpected," she said.
According to her, Grigory Leps does not live in Phuket, but, according to the US Treasury, he really has a house on the Thai island.
She said that Leps is now on a long tour of the Far East and Siberia, and that the news found him during a flight to Blagoveshchensk.
Is the black box in your car?
While American road designers are trying to find money to repair the crumbling road system, many are beginning to see the solution in a small black box, neatly attached to the dashboard of your car.
These devices, which track every mile travelled by a motorist and transmit this information to officials, are at the center of a controversial attempt to modernize the outdated motorway financing system undertaken by Washington and the state's planned authorities.
Usually, the boring highway planning arena unexpectedly spawned intense debate and colorful alliances.
The libertarians joined the environmental groups in lobbying for the government to use small boxes to track the number of miles you travel, and perhaps where you're driving - and then using that information in tax bills.
The tea party movement is in shock.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also deeply concerned and raises a number of issues on privacy.
And although Congress can not yet agree whether to continue or not, several states are not going to wait.
They are wondering how, over the next decade, you can move to a system where drivers pay for every mile of the road they pass.
Thousands of motorists have already taken these black boxes for testing, some of which have satellite tracking function.
This is really necessary for our country.
"This is not the question that we may have the right to choose," said Hassan Ifrata, executive director of the Southern California Association, which is preparing plans to start tracking the miles of state by every California motorist by 2025.
There will be changes in how we pay these taxes.
There is already technology for that.
The need for this is exacerbated by the lack of funds from the Government Fund for the Construction of Highways, financed by taxes that Americans pay at gas stations.
Americans don't buy as much gasoline as they used to buy.
Cars travel more miles per gallon.
The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents per gallon, has not risen for 20 years.
Politicians do not want to raise the tax even by one cent at high prices for gasoline.
"The tax on gasoline is simply impossible to save," said Lee Mannich, a transport policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
His staff has recently installed 500 tracking devices for testing a mumps payment system.
"It will be the best alternative in the long term," he said.
Zanods call it a pivise custom board.
It is not surprising that this idea attracts urban liberals, because with the help of taxes it will be possible to change the nature of travel to reduce the congestion of roads and greenhouse gas emissions, for example.
Planned bodies in California are looking at this system in the development of strategies to meet targets set by the state's ambitious laws to combat global warming.
However, House Rep. Bill Schuster (Republican, Pennsylvania), chairman of the House Transport Committee, said he also sees the system as the most viable long-term alternative.
The free-market adherents in the fund are also thrilled to be forcing drivers to pay every mile.
"It's not just a tax that's going to go into a black hole," said Adrian Moore, vice president of political affairs at Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
This movement is also supported by two former U.S. transport ministers who in 2011 called on Congress to move towards a mump in payment.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year, which would involve about 10,000 vehicles.
However, House leaders rejected the proposal because of the fears of rural legislators representing voters who often have to travel miles in their daily lives to get to work or to the city.
Several states and cities, however, are on this path on their own.
The most enthusiastic is evident in the state of Oregon, where 5,000 drivers are involved in the largest experiment in the country.
These drivers will soon pay the state for miles of mile instead of a gasoline tax.
In Nevada, the pilot project has already been completed.
It is being considered in New York.
Illinois will test it on a limited basis with the participation of trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes the transport departments of the 17 states of the east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is studying how they can make these changes.
This concept has not been universally recognized.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer cars were recently equipped with these devices, drivers were concerned that the government could track their every move.
"The concern about the "big brother" and similar things is a big problem," said Alauddin Khan, head of strategy and efficiency management in the Nevada Department of Transportation.
It wasn't what people wanted.
When the tests were in full swing, the American Civil Liberties Union branch in Nevada warned on its website that it would be quite easy to turn these devices into full-scope tracking devices.
There is no need to create a huge, cumbersome technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to store records of the daily movements of individual citizens.
Nevada is one of several states where there is a difficult search for low-cost technology that would allow state authorities to keep track of miles by car, but without information about the place and time.
If you can do that, Khan said, the society will feel more calm.
The search for this technology has led some state agency to a small young company in California called True Mileage.
Initially, the company did not assist in the collection of state taxes.
She sought to enter the emerging car insurance market, in which drivers pay on the basis of mileage.
But the devices it's testing are attracting road designers because they don't use GPS and provide a limited amount of information that is periodically downloaded using a modem.
"People will be more inclined to do this unless you track their speed and track their location," said Ryan Morrison, True Mileage's chief executive.
There have been some big mistakes in some of the state's pilot programs.
There are much less expensive and less obsessive ways to do this.
In Oregon, designers are experimenting with providing drivers with different options.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they can completely abandon the device, deciding instead to pay a fixed fee based on the average number of miles that all residents of the state pass.
Elsewhere, they hope to sell the idea to the wary public, forcing the devices to do more, not less.
In New York, transport officials are eager to develop a tax device that will also accept parking meter payments, provide "pays" as you go insurance and collect a real-time speed pool from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffic jams.
The car drivers will be involved in the benefits that they will be offered, - said in the document of urban planning.
Some designers of transport systems, however, are thinking about whether all talk about minimal payment is simply a huge distraction.
In the city transport commission in the San Francisco Bay region, officials say that Congress could very simply overcome the bankruptcy of the trusted Road Construction Fund by raising taxes on gasoline.
An additional one-time or annual tax could be levied on drivers of hybrid cars and other people whose vehicles do not use a lot of gasoline so that they pay their fair share.
"There is no need for radical surgery when all you have to do is take aspirin," said Randy Rentschler, director of the Commission on Legislation and Social Relations.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about their privacy and a lot of other things.
Pope Francis to Name First Cardinals in February
Pope Francis will erect new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time in his service on February 22, as announced by the Vatican on Thursday.
The cardinals are the highest clergy in the Catholic Church after the pope, and it is they who elect the popes, so that Francis will appoint his first group of people who will eventually participate in the choice of his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, after reaching the age of 80, he can no longer take part in the election of the pope - this is the prerogative of the group of 120 cardinals-electors.
Announcing the news, Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said that before the ceremony of erecting to the ranks will be held a meeting of all current cardinals known as the consistory.
"Dad Francis decided to announce in advance his decision to convene a consistory in February in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings with cardinals from different parts of the world," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of the Catholic Voices organization said that by February the number of cardinals-electors is likely to decrease.
He said that the pope usually calls as many cardinals as necessary to bring the number of cardinals-electors to 120, as well as as many cardinals over the age of 80 as he wish.
The consistory will be of great importance next year because it will be the first since Francis' election in March this year, according to Valero.
At the moment, there is a kind of bias in favor of Europe and especially in favor of Italy.
It will be interesting to see if the new pope will appoint cardinals from other regions of the world to restore balance, he said.
South America is home to forty percent of Catholics, but they are represented by a small number of cardinals.
It will also be the first elected cardinals since the formation of the Francis Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world, tasked with finding ways to reform the church.
In the past, my dad decided everything on his own.
"Now Francis has chosen eight cardinals to help him," Valero said.
He said it was possible that Francis would turn to the cardinals for advice.
But we weren't in this situation before that - all for us for the first time.
Valero said the popes had usually elevated the post of cardinal bishops from the great parishes, but Francis Polunda surprises - so we don't know who he would name.

Tax for foreign property owners will cause the London bubble to burst
The Treasury has carried out a preliminary assessment of the capital gains tax measure, but expects a final decision from Mr. Osborne, who in the 2012 budget introduced a state duty rate of 7 percent for houses worth more than 2 million and annual payments for buyers who decide to own houses in the partnership, not as individuals.
At the moment, the state duty on residential real estate in the areas of Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea, which amounted to 708 million pounds in the 2012/13 fiscal year, already exceeds the total amount for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, north-east, north-west, Yorkshire and the Holber combined.
Mr. Cook said: "After the increase in the state duty on expensive homes and the introduction of the related anti-evasion legislation, it is very difficult to say that the taxation of expensive real estate is underestimated regardless of the influence of the outdated municipal tax system.
But this move could lead to the fact that some foreign investors will be reluctant to buy real estate in London or its current owners will not want to sell it.
The cost of first-class real estate is the top 5-10 percent of the housing market at a price in London's rich southwesterly belt, which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon, has risen by a record 11.8 percent over the past year.
According to a study by Savills, prices in central London continued to show a steady growth of 5.6 percent year-on-year, but they were eclipsed by an actively developing "tenering market" with a surge in prices in the southwest, in the north (7.4 percent) and in the east (6,5%) of the city.
The next meeting of the Association of Machine Builders of the Tyumen region was held on the basis of the Yalutorovsky Automobile Plant.
Within the framework of the event, a presentation of a new line for the production of electric welded pipes from steel was held.
According to the commercial director of the enterprise Denis Gribanov, in 2011 with the appearance of the new owner conducted a marketing study on the market for the sale of steel structures in the Tyumen region.
It turned out that the region consumes more than 50 thousand tons of electric welded pipes per month.
After that, it was decided to change the profile of the plant and install equipment for their production.
Already this year, more than 7 thousand tons of manufactured products were shipped.
Investments in the plant amounted to more than 120 million rubles, - said Denis Gribanov.
In October, a new camp was launched, which allows to increase the range.
The plant produces both a small profile of the pipe, which is used for thermal farming, small forms of construction and in the furniture industry, and large - for the construction industry.
We plan to reach the level of production of 50 thousand tons of products per year, which will be about 10 percent of its consumption in the Tyumen region.
Despite the transition to a different type of activity, the number of employees in the enterprise has not decreased - now it is 157 people, plans to purchase new equipment - an increase of more than 50 employees.
The company is retraining of personnel, and the necessary specialists are selected from the existing ones.
Next year, it is planned to introduce a new unit of longitudinal cutting of steel up to five millimeters thick, which will reduce the cost of products, as well as another mill, with the production speed of the pipe up to 47 meters per minute.
By the end of 2014, the company is going to master the production of pipes that are used in housing and communal services.
The company's management sets the task of closing up to 70 percent of the needs of the Tyumen region in these products.
Deputy Director of the Department of investment policy Leonid Ostroumov, addressing the heads of production, advised to pay more attention to the modernization of machine-building enterprises.
These are the forms of state support for industry, which include reimbursement of interest rates on loans for the purchase of new equipment and costs for its leasing.
This year, it is planned to allocate 150 million rubles for these purposes, two-thirds of this amount has already been spent.
The last commission, which will consider subsidy contracts, accepts documents from enterprises until November 15.
In addition, the budget reimburses the cost of participation of local producers in international fairs.
For the next year, the budget provides for funds in the amount of 150 million rubles, which can be used to compensate for leasing payments and loans for the purchase of new equipment.
5 million will be allocated for participation in fairs, 3 million - for energy saving programs.
Funds are reduced to 72 million rubles for reimbursement of ordered and paid equipment, which is produced in the south of the Tyumen region for the oil and gas complex.
According to Leonid Ostroumov, in the future, this form of support will stop, since the reason for its introduction was the compensation of the tax on the extraction of minerals, which oil companies paid to the regional budget.
At the moment, they do not and subsidies are becoming direct expenditure obligations of the region.
With this in mind, the government of the region considers the direct support of industrial enterprises, and not financing the oil industry through them, as a priority.
Budget assistance will be related to investment projects that will be implemented in the production.
Many business leaders expressed concern about the current situation in relations with oil workers.
The donation for the equipment they purchase is a competitive advantage of the industry in the south of the Tyumen region, and if it is canceled, it will be difficult to compete at a price with the middle strip of Russia, where cheaper labor.
In addition, the issue with the continuity of the new owner of TNK-BP - the company "Rosneft," which does not yet place its orders at Tyumen enterprises, is unclear.
The agreement on the implementation of the Uvat project expires in 2013, and no applications for its extension were received.
Currently, enterprises of the south of the region, which specialize in equipment for the oil and gas sector, can not form a portfolio of orders for the next year.
The question remains the question of whether taxes from the oil produced in the Uvatsky district will be received in the budget of the region or they will be paid at the place of registration of the new owner of the fields.
The 2nd Congress of the Peoples of the Southern Urals was held in Chelyabinsk.
The Forum is dedicated to the Day of National Unity, the 400th anniversary of the restoration of the Russian statehood and the 20th anniversary of the adoption of the Constitution of Russia.
The congress was attended by delegations from all cities and districts of the region, representatives of national and cultural associations, religious denominations, legislative and executive authorities - a total of about 350 people.
The course of the forum is aimed at strengthening interethnic consent.
We can set an example here not only for other regions, but also for other countries.
We have no differences or disagreements.
We live in full understanding," says Theophanes, Metropolitan of Chelyabinsk and Zlatoust.
During the meeting, a number of issues were considered, including the education of patriotism, cultural cooperation.
As a result of the congress, a resolution was adopted.
The informal part of the forum continued in the opera and ballet theater.
An exhibition of national and cultural associations of the Chelyabinsk region was opened here.
Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons manufacturing means, says the observation group
Syria destroyed the main equipment for the production of chemical weapons and ammunition with poison gas, an international observation group said on Thursday, while fierce clashes raged in the north of the country, near one of the sites where toxic substances are believed to be stored.
On Thursday, a Syrian group of activists said more than 120,000 people had been killed since the start of the country's civil war nearly three years ago.
The statement of the Organization on the prohibition of chemical weapons was made one day before
The deadline of 1 November, set by this Hague-based organization for Damascus to destroy or make all chemical weapons production facilities and mechanisms to mix chemicals to produce poison gas and fill it with ammunition.
Completing what is essentially the initial stage of destruction is an important milestone in an ambitious schedule that aims to destroy all of Damascus's chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of the equipment means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
Nevertheless, Damascus has yet to begin the destruction of existing weapons and stockpiles.
The country is believed to have about 1,000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and nerve gas.
This statement was made during the fierce fighting on Thursday in the city of Safira, which, according to experts, is home to a chemical weapons production facility, as well as its storage sites, according to the Syrian Center for Human Rights, based in Britain.
A group of activists who tracked casualties through a network of activists in Syria said on Thursday that 120,296 people had been killed.
Of this number, it is said that 61,067 are civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government's side, the group said, 29,954 people are members of President Bashar al-Assad's armed forces, 18,678 are pro-government fighters and 187 Lebanese fighters Hezbollah.
Also among the dead, as stated in the statement, were 2,202 military defectors and about 5375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.
According to the UN estimate of July 25, 100,000 have died in the conflict since March 2011.
This number has not been updated since then.
The conflict forced about 2 million people to flee the country.
Assad's troops fought rebels in Safire for weeks, many of whom are linked to al-Qaeda groups.
The center said there were casualties on Thursday on either side, but did not provide specific data.
The fighting underscored the danger faced by chemical weapons inspectors, driven by the tight deadlines of their mission to rid Syria of the toxic arsenal, in the midst of an ongoing civil war.
In a statement, the OPCW, which is working closely with the United Nations, said its team was now satisfied that it had tested and destroyed all critical means of production and equipment for mixing/refueling equipment.
She added that no additional inspection activities were currently planned.
Earlier this week, the inspectors said they had completed the first round of verification work, attending 21 of the 23 facilities claimed by Damascus.
They were unable to visit two places for security reasons, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPCW said both places were, according to Syria's statement, aband and... The chemical weapons programme items in them have been moved to other declared locations that have been checked.
It was not possible to find out immediately whether the object in Safire was one of the two places that the OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has unveiled a plan to completely destroy its chemical weapons, which is due to be approved next month by the OPCW Executive Committee.
"I welcome the courage and bravery that you have all demonstrated in the most difficult mission ever undertaken by this organization," said Ahmet Uzyumju, director general of the observation team, in a comment published by the OPCW.
For the third year, the civil war has confronted rebels, mostly Sunni Muslims, with the Assad government and his security forces, which are members of his Alawite sect, the dissent of Shia Islam.
As for other events, the center's head, Rami Abdurrahman, said there had been a strong explosion on Wednesday at an air defense facility in the coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion is unknown, he said.
Opportunion by Obama campaign considers Biden's exclusion in favor of Hillary Clinton
According to The New York Times, the closest advisers of President Barack Obama secretly considered the possibility of replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton's election list.
This discovery is the brightest sensation of all the anticipated book by Mark Galperin and John Heilemann on the 2012 campaign "Beats Doubled: The Game Changeed 2012."
The Times received a copy of the forthcoming book and reported on Thursday evening that the president's closest aides conducted "large-scale research in focus groups and opinion polls" at the end of 2011 to assess whether Biden's exception could help raise the fading hopes for Obama's re-election.
According to The Times political columnist Jonathan Martin, the book gives a detailed description of the attempt of senior election officials of the election headquarters and the White House, namely the former head of the White House administration Bill Daley, to assess what effect the appointment of former Secretary of State Clinton as Vice President.
The possible replacement was a secret, carefully guarded in the Chicago election headquarters and in the Oval Office.
Only six of the president's closest advisers, including Daly, former Obama campaign chief Jim Messin and former White House senior advisers David Axelrod and David Pluff, knew the replacement was being considered.
The book "Bet Doubled" claims that Daly was the initiator of an attempt to replace Biden despite their close personal relationship, but eventually abandoned this step when their data showed that Clinton's addition to the election list would not improve Obama's chances.
In an interview with Martin, Daly confirmed that the administration was indeed considering replacing Biden Clinton.
"I was actively in favor of examining a lot of things, and it was one of them," Daly told the paper.
You have to remember that the president was in terrible shape at the time, so we thought, "Oh my God, what are we going to do?"
Although Daley described the study as a necessary check, Martin told CNN spokesman Anderson Cooper that the campaign staff invested a lot in the study of whether this step would bring dividends in the vote.
"Electoral headquarters do not spend such amounts of money on surveys and focus groups if they don't take something seriously," Martin said in a 360 program.
It was unclear, however, whether Obama knew that his team was studying the possibility of replacement.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daly if his boss knew his then-boss about possible shuffling.
Although Daly said he didn't think the president was aware of a possible replacement, the former head of the administration admitted that, perhaps, Obama knew.
Martin added that the "beats are doubled" did not give a clear answer to the question whether the results of political sensing reached Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously believed that Obama was unaware of the study of the possibility of removing Biden from the electoral list.
Maybe, Martin replied.
The head of the control and disciplinary committee of the RFU, Artur Grigoryants, said that Kuban was fined 500 thousand rubles, the correspondent of "SE" Philip PAPENKOV reports from the Football House.
Such sanctions against the Krasnodar club were applied for the arson of the flag of Dagestan by fans on the podium during the home match of the 14th round against "Anzhi."
At the meeting there were representatives of both clubs, a man from the RFPL.
We have investigated all available materials.
For the illegal behavior of the audience "Kuban" fined 500 thousand rubles.
Legislative bans forced Russians to drink less beer
Russian brewers are in a bad mood.
According to their outlines, beer consumption in the country in the country will remain the same next year, and this is at best.
The businessmen initially counted on growth.
After all, this year is bad for them: sales fell by 7 percent.
All this was told by the head of one of the largest brewing companies in the country, Chairman of the Council of the Union of Russian Brewers Isaac Sheps at the III annual conference of the Adam Smith Institute "Goods of everyday demand in Russia," which has just ended in Moscow.
It discussed the state regulation of the market.
From 2008 to 2012, the Russian beer market has already decreased by 18 percent, as in recent years the country has seen a significant increase in regulation of the brewing industry in terms of the production and turnover of beer - a drink with a low alcohol content.
In no country in the world there is such a strict restriction of the beer market, the unpredictable introduction of new and new illogical bans, which are justified by the alleged fight against alcohol abuse.
The brewer complained that many legislative bans designed to reduce the level of alcohol abuse do not have much influence, however, new initiatives are constantly emerging.
The most painful of all the beer producers was hit by the ban on selling alcohol in kiosks introduced from this year.
"We lost 35,000 consumers at once," said Isaac Sheps.
For the next year, the brewers have two forecasts.
Optimistic - the one that Sheps spoke of: sales of the foam drink will remain at the same level.
Pessimistic - will fall by another 2-3 percent.
To preserve their profits, businessmen are forced to leave the varieties designed for the mass consumer in the class "premium": beer will become less, but it will cost more.
Meanwhile, the radical consequences of falling sales with a small amount of alcohol are not yet visible.
"According to my observations, the level of alcoholism diseases remains at about the same level," said the doctor-narcologist Alexei Sotnikov.
However, the proportion of patients who drink strong drinks, as well as those who "suffocated" to alcohol-containing tone drinks like the Jaguar, has grown, whereas ten years ago it was the "beer" alcoholism.
What will the construction of the TPU in Moscow lead to
Every year, the capital authorities promise to equip more and more transport and interchange hubs (TPU).
Until 2020. It is planned to put into operation 255 TPUs.
What really turns out to be the project, our correspondent understood.
A couple of months ago, a construction fence appeared near the metro "Smolenskaya" of the Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya line.
The inscription read that there was a construction of a transport and interchange hub.
All this was very strange, because next to the "Smolensk" no ground transport does not stop and, therefore, you can not switch to it.
To get to the nearest trolleybus stop on the Garden Ring, you need to overcome about 130 meters, including the ground crossing through the Karmanitsky lane.
Now the "Smolensk" is almost over.
The flower stall disappeared, the stand for newspapers was dismantled, and the asphalt in front of the entrance was replaced by paving stones.
That's the whole transport hub.
Transport and interchange hubs are flat and capital, - explained in the press service of the capital's transport department.
There are no capital TPUs yet.
And flats involve the construction of parking lots, the withdrawal of commercial facilities that interfere with the movement of passengers, the creation of small architectural forms and landscaping.
In fact, flat TPUs are not even engaged in transport workers, but professional beneficiaries from the Department of capital repair of the city of Moscow.
The transport hub is not necessarily a complex design, - explains the Director of the Institute of Transport Economics and Transport Policy of the Higher School of Economics Mikhail Blinkin.
Sometimes enough roof over the head and a scoreboard, notifying about the time of arrival of the transport.
Here, for example, the metro "Yasenevo" recently opened a fully full-fledged flat-shrinking unit.
Let without canopies, but with intercepting parking lots and a scoreboard indicating when the bus arrives.
But in the chase of the number, officials record everything in the TPU everything that gets.
Back in 2011, the mayor's office planned to build on all 151 knots, of which 59 with capital construction.
Now the plans until 2020 include as much as 255 TPUs.
Half a hundred and many promise to be handed over this year.
Although there is a TPU development program in the city, no qualitative criteria are indicated, - says Alexander Morozov, co-chair of the public organization "City and transport."
Report on the number of objects, but the quality of the transplant on each of them often worsens.
Criteria, according to the expert, should be two: firstly, a reduction in the time of transplantation, secondly, convenience.
First of all, the ability to change the type of transport without coming out in the rain.
In Moscow, when setting up the TPU, it is sometimes exactly the opposite.
A vivid example of the metro "VDNH."
Previously, suburban buses from the Yaroslavl highway came to the square in front of the main entrance to the VVC.
Now their stops were moved to the opposite side of Yaroslavka to the street Cosmonauts.
Further from the metro, much further from the monorail, but closer to residential buildings.
The gift that the residents did not want a bus station under the windows and complained to all possible authorities.
With the capital TPU in Moscow somehow did not immediately set.
The first of them began to build five years ago near the metro station "Planernaya."
The project was intended to be exemplary.
And indeed, it turned out a sample of how the transfer hub, given to investors, turns into a banal shopping center.
No, there are aprons for buses, a canopy not to go from the metro in the rain, and three floors of parking lots.
However, the Khimki trolleybuses No. 202 and No. 203 in the Moscow TPU were not given places in principle.
They were pushed away from the subway.
But there are more places left for trade.
There are 32 shops" clothes alone, and in general there is almost everything from pet products to the car dealership.
In fact, suddenly, who of the bus passengers will need to buy a new car on the road?
We, when they build a capital TPU, for some reason, always get a shopping center.
Recently, the situation has reached its logical conclusion, when part of the car park decided to give for the market.
Now on the third floor of the TPU "Planernaya" among the marked on the floor parking places is a brisk trade.
Vegetables, spices, Chinese jeans, non-Russian speech and guards, ugly looking at our photographer.
The transplant unit finally turned into a bazaar.
The fact is that earlier the metro "Planernaya" was the market, but it was demolished.
And in the prefecture, the merchants regretted and allowed to intercept the parking of the interchange hub.
Still, because of the high prices there is always empty.
The funny thing is that the market was demolished in order to build in its place. The new TPU flat.
That's the castling.
At the metro station "Kaluga" the distance of the approach from the lobby of the metro to the bus was 50 meters, - says Alexander Morozov.
After the construction of the shopping center, allegedly TPU, the distance increased to 170 meters.
To get on the bus, you need to go through the entire shopping center.
After 22 hours, when it is closed, you have to bypass it in the open air.
However, the constructions on the "Planer" and "Kaluga" will soon seem flowers.
In mid-September, the town-planning and land commission of the mayor's office approved planning decisions for the first eight capital TPUs.
Four of them will be 25-storey, not counting two or three underground tiers.
The main monster will grow near the metro station "Tushino," it will have 418.7 thousand square meters. meters of the square.
Representatives of the Directorate of Railway Stations of the Russian Railways, responsible for the construction of the TPU near the metro, have already told reporters: in future high-rise buildings will be located shops, hotels and apartments.
At the same time, officials assure that multi-tiered parking lots will take from a third to half of the area.
Let's take the example of "people's" garages.
For example, a 258 car-seat garage, which was recently built on International Street, has an area of 8015 square meters. The meters.
So, for parking for 2.6 thousand cars, "Petrovsko-Razumovskaya" will need about 80 thousand "squares."
That's less than a third of the machina that's going to be built there.
Let one or two floors go to all sorts of aprons for buses.
There are at least 150,000 square meters. meters of commercial real estate.
And this, for a minute, almost two GUMs.
If the capital TPUs at the stations and stations are built by railway workers, then the rest of the sites will be mastered by metropolitans.
They also promised that there would be many "functional facilities," including hotels, offices and even gymnasiums.
By the way, the department of property of the city of Moscow recently told journalists that they are developing a draft resolution according to which investors will be able to apply for the receipt of the site for TPU to officials directly.
Without any contests.
Therefore, they say that transport issues for the city are a priority.
The ideal TPU is, for example, the station "Harvard" in Boston or "Spaturna" in Toronto, - Alexander Morozov is sure.
There, trolleybuses and trams descend to the ground to the metro level and the distance of the approach from the metro car to the tram is only 50 meters without access to the street.
There is no extra trade around.
But Moscow officials are throwing at extremes.
Either we will not build anything, or we will not bend down 25 floors with offices and apartments.
Oil fell in price to $96 per barrel.
The price of oil continued to fall on Friday, when concerns about the formation of large reserves eclipsed a message showing that China's energy-intensive manufacturing sector is gaining momentum.
The U.S. standard oil in December fell by 14 cents, and its price was $96.24 per barrel later than European time in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
On Thursday, the contract fell by 39 cents, which in total amounted to a fall in the price for October by 5.8 percent.
Wealthy oil reserves have affected its value in recent weeks.
The Department of Energy said U.S. inventories had increased by 4.1 million barrels in the past week.
In five weeks, the reserves were replenished by more than 25 million barrels.
But on Friday, there was an indication of a possible increase in demand, according to two reports of Chinese industry, which showed a surge in its activity.
This indicates that China's economic recovery could continue to gain momentum after the growth rate in the third quarter rose to 7.8 percent after a 20-year low in the previous quarter.
Brent oil - the benchmark grade of international oil used by U.S. refineries - fell by 26 cents to $108.58 per barrel on the Intercontinental Exchange in London.
In Yekaterinburg, the perpetrator killed two sisters and burned their bodies.
In Yekaterinburg, the police are looking for a criminal who brutally killed two sisters.
After the murder, their bodies were burned.
As reported to the "New Region" in the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation in the Sverdlovsk region, on the eve of the day in the Kirov district of the Ural capital after extinguishing a fire in a three-room apartment located in a residential building on Uralskaya Street, the bodies of two women with signs of violent death were found.
The identity of the victims was soon established.
It turned out that these are sisters, one of them is a resident of Yekaterinburg 44 years old, the second is a 33-year-old resident of the Orenburg region.
They rented an apartment a few days ago.
His investigation was taken under the personal control of the chief police officer of the region Mikhail Borodin.
The internal affairs bodies work out various versions of the murder, check the alibi of previously convicted citizens and persons prone to such acts.
In addition, it establishes for what purpose the women rented the apartment, and where they lived before, what they did, with whom they maintained relations.

The coach of "Avangard" Vladimir Chebaturkin, speaking about the preparation of his team for the match of the regular championship of the KHL against "Salavat," noted that the omichs conducted a thorough analysis of the defeat from the Magnitogorsk "Metallurg."
The expert stressed that Avangard should be given increased attention to the game in defense.
We watched the video of the match against the Magnitogorsk "Metallurg," - quotes the official website of "Avangard" words Chebkatkin.
- We missed a lot of pucks, not a very pleasant moment.
Missed because of their mistakes, because of the failure to perform the game task.
We knew that the opponent had performers.
According to statistics, they had five attacks on the move - three goals we scored.
Very good implementation.
These mistakes were taken into account in the preparation for today's game?
We and the guys carefully analyze each match, talk after the game, prepare for a new opponent.
The main thing is that the installation is carried out.
Everyone saw the first period of the match against Metallurg.
The game task was performed, and the score was 2:0.
Missed the goal "in the locker room" - and in the third period began to be mistaken.
Given how hard the game was, I saw no sense in connecting the defenders.
You have to fight the whole team.
Now Avangard have a long home series, matches are going in a day - the team has accumulated fatigue?
All teams are in the same conditions.
The main thing now is the implementation of your moments and the performance of the game task.
Hockey is an emotional game, if you do the installation - everything is not so difficult.
Bombardier's profits are declining with supply drops and number of plane orders
Bombardier, a Canadian aircraft and train maker, reported a 15 percent reduction in net profit on Thursday under the impact of reduced aircraft orders and deliveries in the third quarter and contract problems in its railway division.
The Montreal-based Bombardier also did not publish any data on the flight tests of its newest CSeries aircraft and did not provide new information on whether ambitious plans to put the aircraft into commercial operation by the next September.
After the first flight of the prototype of the aircraft, which took place about a month and a half ago, it flew only three times, which raises questions about whether the stage of testing is on schedule.
The results did not meet the forecasts and led to a fall in shares by more than 8 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerkesen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, lowered his estimate on Thursday from the average market to the "average" because of the belief that the growth of shares is limited in the next quarter or two.
"While the decline in aircraft shipments was generally predictable, we are certainly disappointed by the transport department's earnings," Doercsen said in a stock market review.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for CSeries as the flight test program continues.
However, unless new orders are announced in the coming months, we assume that the market will become more skeptical about the program.
Bombardier hopes that the family of CSeries aircraft will allow it to win a place in the lower price segment of the market, which is now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first prototype of the aircraft was presented in March and for the first time made a flight in September after several months of delay.
However, firm orders for the CSeries are not yet too many - 177, as potential buyers are waiting for flight test results to check the company's claims about the fuel efficiency and the potential cost-effectiveness of the new liner.
There are 403 orders and agreements with 15 customers and operators.
Chief Executive Officer Pierre Bodouhan was confident that Bombardier would reach its target of 300 solid orders by the time the first aircraft was put into commercial operation.
On Thursday, the leaders also assured analysts and the media that the program is moving forward on the plan.
The aircraft's test model did not stay on the ground longer than expected, Bodouhan said during the conference, adding that ground-based testing and software updates were planned for the time of downtime.
All manufacturers plan different tests.
We decided to have the first flight and take a break for the upgrade, so we did.
This will happen throughout the flight test program.
The second of the five test samples is due to fly in the coming weeks and all the others will follow it shortly, the company said.
And yet analysts are skeptical about the statement that the first customer will be able to start operating the CSeries aircraft 12 months after his first flight.
Bombardier said it was assessing the commissioning and providing new information in the next few months.
This slow pace of flight tests - though, apparently, corresponds to the internal schedule of the Bombardier - reinforces our view that the commissioning will be postponed to the first quarter of 2015," said Doerksen.
In the third quarter, which ended on September 30, Bombardier's net income fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share, last year.
Adjusted earnings per share remained the same as 9 cents.
Gross income fell slightly from $4.2 to $4.7 billion.
Analysts expected a profit of 10 cents per share and gross income of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world's fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer said it had delivered 45 aircraft in a quarter, down less than 57.
The total number of orders fell from 83 to 26 aircraft.
The portfolio of orders of the aerospace department amounted to $ 32.9 billion on September 30, not changing from December 31.
In the aerospace, the results were in line with our goals, but the small number of orders incoming and the general market conditions became an unpleasant factor, Boduan said.
Gross revenue in the aerospace direction fell by 13 percent to $ 2 billion.
Bombardier, the world's largest train producer, said gross revenue in the sector grew by almost 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
The portfolio of orders in the transport division amounted to $ 32.6 billion on September 30, which is slightly higher than the figure of December 31.
The revenues of the transport division were negatively affected by problems with the execution of several large contracts.
The leadership said a new development plan would be presented in the fourth quarter.
The shares of Bombardier, which also announced that Google's chief financial officer Patrick Pichett will be on the board, fell by 8.5 percent to $4.83 at mid-Rouge auctions.
Brazilian company Embraer SA, the world's third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and closest competitor Bombardier, reported a 10 percent reduction in quarterly revenue.
The chairman of the Krasnoyarsk court abducted the ID, hitting him on the head

According to a senior official, Israeli warplanes are attacking targets inside Syria
A senior administration official in an interview with Fox News confirmed that Israeli warplanes struck targets in the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday evening.
The official did not specify what the target was, but said at least one.
The associated press reports that the target was a Russian-made SA-125.
At least twice this year, Israel carried out airstrikes on cargo with missiles inside Syria.
Is Tory a new hope for nuclear energy?
Governments around the world continue to think about how to provide energy needs.
Burning hydrocarbons (where they are) has a negative impact on the climate.
Renewable energy requires large areas to generate.
The nuclear power is without another, but it leaves a lot of expensive waste in the disposal of waste.
Recently, scientists drew attention to the thorium - another radioactive element of the Mendeleev system.
It is found around the world, and, according to experts, its cleavage does not leave the waste that must be stored for centuries.
New machines will appear in the Moscow metro.
But they will sell tickets to passengers not for the money, but for squats.
One trip worth 30 rubles will cost a potential passenger in 30 squats.
The number of squats will count a special device with the help of modern technologies, ITAR-TASS reports, citing the press service of the Russian Olympic Committee.
The first device will be installed at the station "Exhibition" on November 8, 2013.
In the presentation of new ticket amusement athletes will be welcomed by the President of the Russian Olympic Committee Alexander Zhukov and Olympic champions gymnasts Alexey Nemov and Elena Zamolodchikova.

Two YMCA employees charged with sexual offenses even before accusations against Jonathan Lord, as reported by the Royal Commission
Two YMCA NSW employees were charged with sexual offenses against children prior to charges in 2011 against a childcare worker in Caringbach Jonathan Lord, the Royal Commission on Sexual Violence against Children reported.
But in an introductory statement, the commission said that she had never dealt with cases of sexual abuse of children within her organization.
Chief Executive Officer Philip Hare was asked about one case when a YMCA employee was charged with child pornography crimes and another case where a gym instructor at YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted of sexual offenses against children under his supervision in 1991.
Mr. Hayer told Gail Ferness, a lawyer providing the commission's assistance, that he knew about the first case, but did not know about the second.
He admitted that the YMCA in the opening speech for the commission also allowed inaccuracy, arguing that there were external YMCA checks that YMCA was in the forefront of the safety of children.
The commission's evidence suggests that the YMCA has been notified that it has received a second of four possible assessments from the results of an audit of the quality of the Department of Education and Communities in August this year.
Mr. Hare, who joined YMCA when he was 21, acknowledged that he and the lower leadership had made a mistake by hiring the Lord, and had not been able to ensure that staff had clearly understood their obligations regarding reporting violations of children's safety policies.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual offenses against 12 boys during two years of his work at YMCA.
He was imprisoned for at least six years.
But Mr. Hayr has rejected the suggestion that YMCA's corporate ethics prevented employees from reporting Lord's violations in the field of children's safety.
The staff testified that they had observed the violations, including the fact that the Lord was alone with the children, personally caring for them, putting them on his knees, saying that he loved one of them and allowed them to play with his mobile phone.
Daniel Oakwell, who was under the Lord's leadership and asked to teach her to protect her children because she was concerned about his behavior, testified that she had found Jackie Barnath, the child custody manager of the YMCA office in Caringbach, who was the Lord's leader, "very intimidating and often inaccessible."
The executive director said he did not accept the staff's explanation that they were embarrassed to report the situation to their superiors.
Rather, according to him, their friendship with the Lord led them away from the thought of having to report it.
Mr. Heir said that he had presented to the Board of the YMCA of New South Wales his view that the lesson for the organization of the incident with Jonathan Lord did not respond to the provision of information by the staff, and the council agreed with him.
Mr. Hayer said that the decision to force employees to sign confidentiality agreements shortly after the charges were made by YMCA's child custody director, Liam Whitley, YMCA.
He said that this was intended to prevent damage to the evidence, but it was overdosed and this decision was poorly implemented.
The YMCA of New South Wales was not a child-friendly organization while Jonathan Lord was working in the period 2009-2011, said the commission's expert on child molestation, Professor Steven Smallbone of the University of Griffith.
He said there were serious problems in recruiting, selecting, instructing, training and controlling staff.
The hearings were postponed until December 20.
The film adaptation by Guillais of Nickle's novel by Denis Diderot boasts exceptional production and historical details, but it is also more difficult to perceive than it should be.
The film, which takes place in France in the 1760s, tells the dark story of Suzanne, a young aristocrat sent to the monastery by his family.
When she begins to rebel, she experiences extreme cruelty at the hands of the abbot's sadist and becomes the object of erotic fantasies for others.
The film never sinks to vulgar or sensation - and that's the whole problem.
Because of its serious solemnity, the narrative risks becoming a test like a vose and for the audience.
U.S. Special Services Listening to Pope's Personal Phone
The Vatican's activities are under the vigilance of the US intelligence services.
New documents from the collection of Edward Snowden indicate that the US intelligence conducted an audition of all the negotiations of the previous Pope Benedict, and now closely cares for Pope Francis.
His phone began to be tapped before he became the head of the Vatican.
The election of the new pope was also under surveillance.
What in the United States was of particular importance.
The special service connected to the cell phones of cardinals, who gathered in Rome to choose another Pope.
The telephones of the residence, where the members of the conclave lived, were also heard.
American spies listened to all the main contenders for the papal throne to prevent the appearance of an undesirable figure for Washington.
The magazine "Panorama" writes that the "great ear of the United States" continued to intercept the conversations of the prelates until the very end of the conclave on March 12.
It is alleged that the United States has been singled out in the United States since 2005 by the Argentine Archbishop Bergolio as the future of the Pope.
U.S. intelligence has also run by talks related to the election of the new president of the Vatican Bank.
The Italian magazine writes that a secret group of CIA and NSA operatives continuing to work at the U.S. Embassy, extracting information on politicians and financial flows.
In turn, the Vatican has conciliated that he does not care about the American "interception," even if it happens.
The U.S. leadership has no secrets from the U.S. leadership.
Ben Greenman: The Tenth Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
We can safely say that New York is the birthplace of stand-top comedy in America: almost a hundred years ago, pop artist Frank Fey, who worked as an entertainer at the Palace Theatre theater on Broadway, began to tell jokes directly to the public in a conversational manner.
The innovation of Fei over time was picked up by others, most recently - the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and supervised by Caroline Hersh, founder of the Stand Up Club Carolines, the festival celebrates this year its tenth anniversary, with more than sixty shows in small clubs and big theaters.
Most of these headliners started at Carolines, and then achieved more success, reached a level where they are already too famous to play at the club," said Hersh.
We created this festival as a way to continue working with them.
This year's year's performances include the performances of Wanda Sykes, Katie Griffin and Bill Mar, as well as the Hero's Standards for Heroes' annual music and comedy charity concert for military veterans in Madison Square Garden, where Bruce Springsteen, John Stewart, Roger Waterers and Bill Cosby will appear among others.
With the expansion of the festival, the world of comedy has also expanded.
Several comedians participating in this year's festival have gained popularity in an unconventional route, for example, thanks to shows on small TV channels like Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll became famous for his role in the comedy series on a little-known cable TV channel (detailed scabric "FXX" league on the theme of fantasy football), and now hosts his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate joined the cast both on Saturday night live and in "Parks and recreation areas," although she is best known for a series of viral videos, Marseille - a shell in boots.
Both Kroll and Slate, like other young comedians with a distinctive style (surlatically pessimistic Anthony Jesselnik, a sly focus on the racial theme of Kamau Bell), is the result of a decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the highlights of the festival will be an interview with David Steinberg with Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but then became a successful director on television and in film, as well as an unofficial historian of comedy.
From 2005 to 2007, he was the host of the TV Land show, Sit Down Comedy, with David Steinberg.
The meeting will take place at Town Hall in downtown Manhattan.
"This city is definitely the central element of all of Larry's work," said Steinberg.
He told me that when he came here, he sometimes walks on some street between two houses and thinks: "That's if I'm left without money, maybe I'll live here.
