This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is already a widely held theory, but also provides details not normally available from fossils, such as color and three-dimensional structure.
Scientists say that the plumage of this animal was chestnut-brown above, and below - either pale or had carotenoid pigmentation.
The find also allows you to get acquainted with the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed shaft called rachis, but still have other distinctive features - beards and beards - the researchers concluded that rachis most likely appeared later through the evolutionary development of other distinctive features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation and display. The researchers suggested that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the adult plumage is represented in the sample, and not chicken fluff.
The researchers hypothesized that despite being the tail of a young dinosaur, this specimen has the plumage of an adult, not the feathers of a chick.

Uki&#39;s weapon malfunctioned when it was aimed at the head of the fifth man. Schneider is in constant pain, blind in one eye, part of his skull is missing, and his face has been reconstructed with titanium.
Schneider testified via video link from a US Air Force base in his home country.
In addition to Wednesday&#39;s events, Carpendo competed in two individual events at the championships.
Her first competition was a slalom, in the first race of which she did not reach the finish line. 36 out of 116 participants had the same result in that race.
In another race, this time in the giant slalom, she finished tenth in the women&#39;s sitting position with a combined time of 4:41.30. 2:11.60 minutes slower than first-placed Austrian Claudia Lesch and 1:09.02 minutes slower than ninth-placed Hungarian Diengy Dani.
Four skiers in the women&#39;s sit-down group failed to complete their heats and 45 out of 117 skiers in the giant slalom failed to place in the race.
The Madhya Pradesh State Police returned the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General DK Arya said: &quot;We arrested five people who raped a Swiss woman and returned her mobile phone and laptop.&quot;
The accused are named Baba Kanjar, Bhuta Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the defendants were presented before the judges with their faces covered.
Although there were three people inside the building when the car crashed into it, no one was hurt.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services released the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Subsequently, he was transferred to Addenbrooke&#39;s Hospital in Cambridge.
Subsequently, Adekoye was charged with the murder of her son by the Edinburgh Sheriff&#39;s Court.
She is in custody pending her indictment and trial, however any testimony could be distorted as her popularity has been widely exploited by the media.
This is common practice in other parts of the UK, but Scottish justice works differently and the courts have found posting photos potentially damaging.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that &quot;journalists do seem to be walking a dangerous line in publishing photographs and other information about suspects.&quot;
The Crown Prosecution Service, which is generally responsible for the prosecution, told reporters that no further comment would be made, at least until a guilty verdict is reached.
The document, according to the leak, will deal with a dispute over the borders that Palestine wants to establish based on those that existed before the start of the Six-Day War in 1967.
Other topics covered reportedly include the future state of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of the agreement, while the PNA agrees to maintain such a presence for only five years.
Shooters participating in the supplemental pest control test were required to be closely monitored by rangers as the test was monitored and evaluated for effectiveness.
As part of a partnership between the NPWS and the Australian Sport Shooting Association (NSW), qualified volunteers have been recruited through the Sport Shooting Association&#39;s hunting program.
According to Mick O&#39;Flynn, acting director of parks and heritage conservation for the Wildlife and National Park Service, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive training and safety briefings.
Yesterday, Marteilly swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (VEC), consisting of nine members.
This is Martella&#39;s fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended that the previous Provisional Electoral Council resign as part of a package to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelli&#39;s response to the mass protests against the state regime that began in October.
These sometimes violent protests were sparked by the failure to hold elections, some of which were due as early as 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheating of defective iPods were received, resulting in six fires and four people suffering minor burns.
Japan&#39;s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 incidents involving the devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Labor and Industry announced that Apple had informed it of 34 additional cases of overheating, which the company called &quot;not serious&quot;.
In response, the ministry called the delay in Apple&#39;s report &quot;very unfortunate.&quot;
At 07:19 am local time (21:19 GMT on Friday), an earthquake hit Mariana.
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Authority said there were no reports of damage in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer hijacked a tour bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, and took Hong Kong tourists hostage.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, and at least six have been presumed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
Later, the photographers took the place of an elderly woman, as she went to the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father&#39;s footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He was trained as an obstetrician and gynecologist and began working at the Auckland National Women&#39;s Hospital in 1959.
When Liggins worked at the hospital, he began investigating preterm births in his spare time.
His research showed that if the hormone was administered, it would enhance the maturation of the baby&#39;s lungs during fetal development.
On Wednesday, state investigators found two flight recorders, or &quot;black boxes,&quot; according to Xinhua.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Here&#39;s what Tommy Dreamer said: &quot;Luna became the first Queen of Extreme. She was my first manager. Luna passed away on the night of two moons. This is such a unique event, like herself. A strong woman.&quot;
Dustin &quot;Goldust&quot; Runnels said, &quot;Luna was just as freaky as me...Maybe even freakier...Love her and will miss her...I hope she&#39;s in a better place.&quot;
Of the 1,400 people polled ahead of the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic have risen 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard during the 2010 federal election campaign opined that Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34% of respondents share this point of view and want Queen Elizabeth II to become the last monarch of Australia.
The survey showed the following: 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and 31 percent believe that it does not need this form of government.
The Olympic gold medalist was due to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but because of his complaints, his fitness is now in doubt.
He was unable to take the drugs needed to relieve the pain, as they are prohibited in the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number known to date on January 25.
On Tuesday, it was announced that by early February, several people had confirmed the discovery using various hardware and software.
Perhaps comets were the source of water delivery to Earth, as well as a source of organic substances that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, since comets have been hitting Earth for a very long time.
Cuomo, 53, began his term as governor earlier this year and signed a bill to legalize same-sex marriage last month.
He called these rumors &quot;political chatter and stupidity.&quot;
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the US Federal Aviation Administration says will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel and carbon emissions each year.
It uses satellite technology instead of older ground-based radar technology, which will allow air traffic controllers to more accurately determine the position of aircraft and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport has been launched to Wembley, ground trains will not stop there, in addition, there are no parking lots and intercepting parking lots on the surface.
Concerns about the lack of transportation have led to speculation that the game may have to be played behind closed doors without fans.
A description of the study, published Thursday in the journal Science, talks about the emergence of a new bird species in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University (USA) and Uppsala University (Sweden) reported that due to the mating of the endemic Darwin&#39;s finch (Geospiza fortes) with the migrating cactus finch (Geospiza conirostris), the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was believed that this process will take much more time.
Gold can be given any shape. It can be rolled into very small shapes.
It can be drawn into a thin wire that can be woven and plated. It can be hammered or rolled up.
It can be made very thin and attached to another metal. It can be made so thin that it has sometimes been used to decorate hand-painted illustrations in books - the so-called &quot;front manuscript&quot;.
This is called the pH of the chemical. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH value is determined by the degree of saturation with hydrogen ions (H in pH) of the chemical compound under study.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons are separated (hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Get a new mixture by mixing two dry powders in one container, and then form a ball from this mixture with clean, damp hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the top layer, which will be unusual, then a kind of shell will form.
Almost every house in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro had a flush toilet connected to a complex sewer system.
Surviving fragments of sewer systems have been discovered in the houses of Minoan cities on the islands of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets were also in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women washed together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you are using satellite.
A satellite in space receives a call and almost instantly reflects it back down.
The satellite was delivered into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth&#39;s atmosphere distorts our light and view to some extent.
To launch a satellite or a telescope into space, you need a giant rocket over 100 feet high.
The wheel has changed our world in incredible ways. The most important thing the wheel did for us was that it gave us much easier and faster transportation.
It gave us the train, the car, and many other means of transport.
Below them are a larger number of medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey from rabbits to antelope and deer.
Finally, many small cats (including walking house cats) eat and prey on many more small animals such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success lies in the concept of a niche, a specific job that each type of cat does that keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups called prides.
The pride consists of one to three adult males that are related, as well as females and cubs, the number of which can reach up to thirty.
Females are usually related to each other and make up a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave very much like packs of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar in habits to lions (but not other big cats) and are also very dangerous for their victims.
A well-rounded athlete, the tiger can climb trees (though not very well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with the strength of five strong men.
The tiger belongs to the same genus (Panthers) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones with the ability to growl.
The tiger roar is not like the full-sounding roar of a lion, but more like shouting out sentences from unintelligible words.
Ocelots love to eat small animals. If the opportunity presents itself, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than him.
Scientists believe that ocelots follow the trail of animals and find prey by smell, tracking its movement on the ground with the help of smell.
They are able to see perfectly in the dark with the help of night vision and move almost imperceptibly. Ocelots track prey by blending in with their surroundings and then pounce on the prey.
When a small group of living organisms (small population) separates from the main population from which they originated (for example, if they cross a mountain range or river, or if they move to a new island from which they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in an environment that is different from the one in which they were previously.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or changes than it had before in order to become a strong competitor.
The original population has not changed at all - it still needs the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, it becomes less and less like the rest of the population.
Over time, over thousands or even millions of years, these two populations will look so different that it will not be possible to say that they are the same species.
We call this process the formation of species, that is, the emergence of new species. The formation of species is a necessary consequence and an extremely essential part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe and absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants get their food from the sun through photosynthesis. In addition, they cast a shadow.
We build our houses and make clothes from plants. Most of our food is plants. Without plants, animals would not be able to survive.
Mosasaurus was the most formidable predator of its time, so it was not afraid of anyone except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were studded with more than 70 sharp teeth, in addition, there was an additional row in the palate, so that there was no escape for those who met on its way.
We do not know for sure, but it is possible that his tongue was forked. He ate turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and could be a cannibal.
He also attacked everything that entered the water; even a gigantic dinosaur like a Tyrannosaurus rex would not compare to it.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans still had their own strange and unusual dishes served during feasts. For example, a wild boar, a peacock, snails and a kind of rodent like a dormouse.
There was another difference: while the poor people and the woman ate sitting on chairs, the rich liked to arrange joint feasts, during which they ate lying on their side.
The diet of the ancient Romans could not include foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in subsequent centuries.
In particular, they had neither corn, nor tomatoes, nor potatoes, nor cocoa, and not a single ancient Roman tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built each of the gods on the main sanctuary, which was considered the dwelling of the god.
People made sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to please the desires of the gods at ceremonies and festivities.
Each temple had an open temple court and an inner sanctuary that only priests could enter.
Sometimes, as elements of the temple, special towers were built in the form of pyramids called &quot;ziggurats&quot;.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was of little importance.
Most of the life of the Jewish family took place outdoors.
The women were cooking in the yard; the shops were open stalls facing the street. Stone was used to build houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so timber was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. The Scandinavian sagas tell that Eric the Red was expelled from Iceland for murder, and moving further west, he discovered Greenland and gave it a name.
But regardless of its discovery, the Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although each of the countries was Scandinavian, there were many differences between the peoples, rulers, traditions and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you&#39;ve seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that the back of the Declaration of Independence was a treasure map.
However, this is not true. Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the reverse side of the Declaration of Independence is written: &quot;This Declaration of Independence was signed on July 4, 1776.&quot; The text is written at the bottom of the document and upside down.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in its existence, this large parchment document (measuring 29¾ by 24½ inches) was folded for easier storage.
Thus, it is likely that the entry was added simply as a flag.
As a result of Operation Neptune and subsequent battles, the north of France was liberated, but the south was still not liberated.
It was under the control of the &quot;Vichy&quot; French. These French made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked alongside the invaders instead of opposing them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France. The invasion was called Operation Dragoon.
In just 2 weeks, Free French forces and the Americans liberated southern France and headed towards Germany.
Civilization is a separate culture, the carriers of which are a sufficiently large group of people living and working together, a society.
The word &quot;civilization&quot; comes from the Latin civilis meaning &quot;civil&quot; and is a cognate of the Latin words civis meaning &quot;citizen&quot; and civitas meaning &quot;city&quot; or &quot;city-state&quot;, and it also expresses in a certain way the size of a society.
City-states are the forerunners of nations. A civilizational culture implies the transmission of knowledge through several generations, an uninterrupted cultural presence and an acceptable spread.
Smaller cultures often disappear without adequate historical evidence, and therefore cannot be recognized as genuine civilizations.
During the American Revolutionary War, thirteen states, in accordance with the Articles of Confederation, for the first time formed a weak central government, the only body of which was Congress.
Congress lacked any power to impose taxes, and since there was no nationwide executive or judicial power, it relied on state governments that were often uncooperative and unwilling to enforce all of its acts.
It also lacked the power to override state tax laws and tariffs.
Amendments under the Articles required the unanimous approval of all the states, but the states treated the central government so irresponsibly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian football team, along with the German one, is the second most successful team in the world and in 2006 won the FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions. Residents of Italy from these regions participate in international competitions and the Olympics.
There are approximately 7,000 islands in Japan (the largest of which is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
By virtue of belonging to a cluster / group of islands, Japan is often referred to geographically as an archipelago.
Taiwan has its origins many years ago, in the 15th century, when European sailors passing by recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, or &quot;beautiful island&quot;.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company establishes a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating the transformation of native grain production methods and hiring Chinese laborers to work their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of Taiwan&#39;s western and northern coastal regions and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded the rights to Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Room of Three Windows.
Most of the buildings along the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu had been restored. Restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the world&#39;s most common still photograph format is 35 mm, and it was this size that was the dominant film size at the end of the analog era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio was inherited by the image sizes of digital cameras.
The 35mm format is actually somewhat confusing, being 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get a ratio with small whole numbers) is therefore taken to be 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS family of formats) are equal to or close to these proportions.
The overused and often ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple rule of thumb that creates dynamism while maintaining a certain amount of order in an image.
It says that it is best to place the main object at the intersection of lines that divide the image into three parts vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, came under intense scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity united the European states despite differences in languages and traditions.
Her all-pervading power touched everyone - from the king to the commoner.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the money of the church exists for this very purpose.
The center of ecclesiastical power was based in Rome for more than a thousand years, and this concentration of power and wealth led many to doubt whether this dogma was observed.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain set up a naval blockade of Germany.
This strategy has proven effective by cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, even though the blockade violated universally accepted international laws set out in several international agreements over the past two hundred years.
Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from entering entire sectors of the oceans, endangering even neutral ships.
Since the reaction to this tactic was restrained, Germany expected a similar reaction to her unhindered submarine warfare.
Among the majority of citizens and peoples in the 1920s, sentiments such as pacifism and isolation prevailed.
Having known the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, the states wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America, and accepted an offer to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
He came to the US with four cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor, who had been his boss at a previous job, to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China used a unique way of referring to periods of time; each stage of China, or each family in power, was a distinct dynasty.
In addition, fragmentation and instability reigned between the reigns of each dynasty. The most famous was the Three Kingdoms era, which lasted 60 years during the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, fierce hostilities took place between many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms era was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died fighting for a place on the throne in the great palace in Xi&#39;an.
There are many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Also, after the Revolution, job opportunities opened up to all men, allowing the most ambitious and talented to succeed.
The same applies to the army, because the ranks have become based on qualities, and not depending on the origin.
The French Revolution also inspired many other repressed members of the working class in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in topics not related to worldly life. He often visited the cave that became known as &quot;Hira&quot; on Mount &quot;Nur&quot; (light) for meditation.
Well, the cave, which has survived to this day, very clearly gives us an idea of the spiritual aspirations of Muhammad.
The cave is located on top of a mountain north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
It is very difficult to detect even for those who know about its existence. In a cave, a person finds himself in complete isolation.
You can&#39;t see anything but a clear beautiful sky above your head and many surrounding mountains. From the depths of the cave you can see and hear only a very small part of this world.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders of the world that still exists today.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the third century BC and is one of many large pyramidal structures built to commemorate the pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or Giza Necropolis, in Egypt&#39;s Valley of the Dead, includes several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid of Giza is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Cheops, and many smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built in honor of the wives of Cheops and his relatives.
The sign of the bow movement up looks like a V, and the bow movement down looks like a bracket or a square without a bottom side.
&quot;Up&quot; means you should start at the tip and pull the bow forward, and &quot;down&quot; means you should start where your hand is holding the bow and pull it back.
An upward movement of the bow usually produces a softer sound, while a downward movement of the bow tends to produce a stronger and more assertive sound.
You can draw your own shading, but remember that shading is printed for musical reasons and is usually worth following.
On October 6, 1789, an angry crowd of women from the market forced the horrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two small children (11-year-old Marie-Therese and 4-year-old Louis) to return to Paris from Versailles. Charles) and the king&#39;s sister, Madame Elizabeth.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people who shouted threats to the king and queen.
The crowd of people forced the King and Queen to open the windows wide.
At one point, one member of this crowd waved the head of a royal guard who was killed at Versailles in front of a frightened queen.
The military expenses of US imperialism for the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime in order to pay most of the expenses and interest on bonds moved on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking.
Of course, the super-profits generated by the long exploitation of the Filipinos were the main income of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led them to create the order.
The era in which these events took place is usually called the High Middle Ages, a period of European history affecting the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages replaced the earlier Middle Ages and preceded the Late Middle Ages, which, according to the accepted view, ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that covers a wide range of practical ideas, from technological progress or the technological imperative to the strict view that people&#39;s fates are driven by an underlying logic related to the laws of science and their manifestation in technology.
Most views on technological determinism share two common ideas: that the direction of technology development is largely immune to cultural or political influence, and that, in turn, the &quot;impact&quot; of technologies on society is due to their own properties, and not to society.
For example, one could say that the automobile is the indispensable cause of the development of roads.
However, the nationwide road network is not economically viable for only a small group of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Massive car ownership also leads to an increase in the number of road accidents, which leads to the invention in public health of new methods of treating injuries.
Romanticism incorporated much of the cultural determinism drawn from such writers as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of romanticism, geography shaped people, and over time, customs and cultures associated with it arose that, being in harmony with the place where a given society lived, were better than arbitrary laws imposed.
Just as Paris is called the fashion capital of the modern world, so Constantinople was considered the fashion capital during the days of feudal Europe.
The fame of it as a center of luxury went around 400 AD. e. and continued until about 1100 AD. e.
Its status declined throughout the twelfth century, mainly because the crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued more than the goods offered in the Byzantine markets.
At this moment, the title of the Capital of Fashion was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style flourished between the 10th and 11th centuries. and XIV century.
At first, clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to slow communication channels, styles in the west can lag behind by 25-30 years.
Own styles began to develop in Western Europe towards the end of the Middle Ages. One of the biggest achievements of the time, thanks to the Crusades, was the use of buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture carried out to produce enough food to meet the needs of only the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic, farming system that uses the seeds of plants native to an ecosystem, along with crop rotation and other relatively simple methods to increase yields.
Historically, most farmers farmed for subsistence, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel violated by the standards of society, and allow such people to define for themselves who they are.
There may be differences between subcultures due to age, nationality, social status, place of residence and / or gender of the people of which it consists.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a particular subculture often make themselves known through distinctive and symbolic use of style, including fashion, mannerisms, and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to illustrate several unfortunate cases where children, due to lack of attention, unfortunate circumstances, or intentional abuse, did not have contact with adults during their growing up.
Such children are called &quot;feral&quot; or &quot;wild&quot;. Some feral children have been isolated by people (usually their own parents). In some cases, this rejection of one&#39;s child was the result of parents&#39; rejection of their severe intellectual or physical disability.
Children living on the streets may have experienced severe forms of abuse or trauma before running away or being abandoned.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some of them lived in the wild on their own.
If raised entirely by animals instead of humans, the feral child exhibits habits (within physical limits) that are almost identical in every way to the particular animal that raised him, such as his fear of or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should be easier and more fun, scaffolding is ahead of many technologies.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a form of helping those who are going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is Skrepysh in Microsoft Office.
A virtual learning aid scaffold is built into the software and is designed to remind, explain and ask questions about procedures that the learner might find too difficult to handle alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, from homelessness to abuse and even extortion.
Children should never grow up in an environment where care, upbringing and education are not provided, but they grow up.
We consider foster care to be safe for children.
Our guardianship system must provide safe housing, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
Patronage education should provide for all the needs that were lacking in the house from which they were previously taken.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communications.
The idiosyncrasies of the Internet lead to additional scale in terms of approach to use and satisfaction.
Thus, it has been suggested that &quot;learning&quot; and &quot;socialization&quot; are important motivating factors for using the Internet (James et al., 1995)
&quot;Personal engagement&quot; and &quot;long-term contact&quot; were also cited by Ammie and McCord (1998) as new facets of motivation when they studied how people respond to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions - facial movements lasting several milliseconds.
In particular, it is argued that it is possible to determine whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting his microexpressions.
In &quot;The President&#39;s Speech,&quot; Oliver Sachs described how people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage can still correctly judge a speaker&#39;s sincerity.
According to his assumption, animals, such as domestic dogs, may have similar abilities to interpret human behavior.
Studies that were conducted in the twentieth century showed that there are two types of genetic variation: latent and pronounced.
Mutation introduces a new genetic variation, while selection removes it from the set of manifested variations.
Segregation and recombination shuffle the variation between the two pools with each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for primates with human digestive systems to meet their amino acid requirements from available plant resources.
Moreover, failure to do so will lead to such serious consequences as stunted growth, malnutrition and, ultimately, death.
The most readily available plant resources would be proteins found in leaves and legumes, but these are poorly digested by primates like us if not cooked.
On the contrary, food of animal origin (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible, but also a rich source of proteins containing all the essential amino acids.
Given all of the above, it is not surprising that our ancestors solved the &quot;protein problem&quot; in much the same way that chimpanzees in the savannah solve it to this day.
Sleep interruption is the process of purposefully waking up during normal sleep and falling asleep again after a short time (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done with a relatively quiet alarm clock to wake you up without completely waking you up.
If you find yourself resetting your alarm in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other variations that rely on biological rhythms include drinking large amounts of fluids (particularly water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before bed, which causes the person to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace of a person is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in his body and soul.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force present in you. Each person is potentially given to find absolute peace and a sense of satisfaction.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own tension and negative attitude.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha but has been complemented by the Mahayana path of love and many Indian yoga techniques.
The principle of Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-consuming love.
The kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) in kundalini yoga is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
Deity Yoga is considered the heart of Tibetan meditation. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are launched, and enlightenment of consciousness is achieved.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. After the end of the war, contradictions regarding the system, process and culture led to discord between countries.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
She was to last for the next 40 years. It was fought for real, using proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places in the world.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defenses had already been breached, and the only hope was a retreat and reorganization along the Romanian foothold.
However, these plans became irrelevant almost overnight, when about 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army formed the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after the capture of the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga peace agreement, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, and other international agreements, bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
The job of seafarers has traditionally been to ensure a country&#39;s ability to move its people and goods, while simultaneously hindering the enemy&#39;s ability to move its people and goods.
One of the most noteworthy recent examples of this was the North Atlantic Company during World War II. The Americans tried to transport men and materials across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly its submarines, tried to stop this movement.
If the anti-Hitler coalition had failed, Germany would most likely have been able to conquer Britain in the same way as the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in Iran&#39;s Zagros mountains.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for themselves in order to have milk, wool, meat and skins on hand.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills or other pasture areas, often looked after by goat herders, who were usually children or teenagers, similar to the more common activity of a shepherd. These grazing methods are still used today.
Wagon roads were built in England in the 16th century.
Although horse-drawn roads were just blocks of wood placed parallel to each other, they gave horses the ability to carry larger loads and at higher speeds over them than on the slightly bumpier roads of the time.
Sleepers have been around for a long time to keep rails in place. However, later it became clear that the tracks were more efficient with a strip of iron on top.
This became common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Over time, wooden wheels were replaced with iron ones. In 1767, the first rails made entirely of iron appeared.
The first known form of transportation was walking, people began to walk upright two million years ago with the advent of Homo erectus (meaning straight man).
For their Australopithecus ancestors, upright posture was not so familiar.
Bipedal specializations are found in Australopithecus remains from 4.2–3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as 7 million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly. We can become members of the environmental movement and even be activists to alleviate further suffering a little.
Typically, this is similar to treating the symptoms. If we need more than just a temporary solution, then we need to find the root of the problem and fix it.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed a lot under the influence of the scientific and technological progress of mankind, and due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of people, the problems have become larger.
After passing by Congress on July 4, the handwritten draft, signed by Congressional Chairman John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap&#39;s print shop.
150–200 copies were made overnight, now known as the &quot;Dunlap Flyers&quot;.
The first public reading of this document was given by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on 8 July.
On July 6, one copy was sent to George Washington, who on July 9 had it read to his troops in New York. A copy arrived in London on 10 August.
The 25 Dunlap leaflets currently known are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not come down to us.
Today, many paleontologists believe that one of the groups of dinosaurs survived and survived to this day. We call them birds.
They are often not considered dinosaurs because they have feathers and are capable of flight.
But there&#39;s still a lot to be said for birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have scaled and clawed feet, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on processing information that is encoded as binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, that is, 0 or 1. These numbers are called &quot;binary digits&quot; - or &quot;bits&quot; in computer jargon.
It can be difficult to immediately identify oral poisoning. Symptoms such as vomiting are too common for a quick diagnosis.
The best sign of internal poisoning may be an open container of medicine or a toxic household chemical.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for this particular poison.
The term beetle is used formally by entomologists to refer to a group of insects.
This concept comes from bed bugs known since ancient times - insects that are perfectly adapted to parasitize on humans.
Both predators and bed bugs are nesting species adapted to live in the nest or dwelling of their host.
Approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) have been identified in the United States, making multiple sclerosis the leading neurological disease of young and middle-aged people.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies have shown that multiple sclerosis affects twice as many women as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their or their child&#39;s best interests to raise a child.
These couples may choose to create an adoption plan for their child.
In adoption or adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can adopt the child.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works by applying the scientific method. This method actually underlies most scientific research.
He is, however, not the only one. Scientific research is also guided by experimentation (an experiment is a test used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses), asking questions, and making observations.
Naturalists and philosophers have focused their attention on ancient texts and especially on the Latin Bible.
In all scientific matters, including psychology, the views of Aristotle were accepted.
As knowledge of the Greek language deteriorated, the West found itself cut off from its philosophical and scientific Greek roots.
Many of the observed rhythms in physiology and behavior are often heavily dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through the biological clock.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply a response to external periodic stimuli, have been recorded in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
The biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillator that will continue to cycle autonomously over a period of time, even in the absence of external stimuli.
Hershey and Chase&#39;s experiment was one of the first suggestions that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase implanted their DNA into bacteria using phages, i.e. viruses.
They conducted two experiments, labeling phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus and phage proteins with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can cause a wide variety of outcomes, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the mutated cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism is interesting for those who like to travel to nature to enjoy the landscape, including wild animals and plants.
Examples of outdoor activities at the site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and learning about the ecosystem.
An example would be visiting, photographing and studying orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning people leave small towns in the countryside to go to their place of work, and they are passed by those whose place of work is in the place they just left.
In this active transport movement, everyone is connected in one way or another to the transport system based on personal cars and supports it.
Science now indicates that the vast hydrocarbon economy has affected one of the stable states of the biosphere that has supported human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone is a member of society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about these systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear such complaints about water quality or falling bridges.
Why are there so many complaints about transport systems, why do they break down every day? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is there a more fundamental reason for this?
The study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interaction with each other is carried out as part of the study of traffic flows.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study the intensity of traffic, because it is impossible to predict the behavior of the driver with absolute certainty.
Fortunately, driver behavior is often quite systematic; thus, traffic flows in general have some regularity and can be approximately described mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between three basic quantities: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships assist in the planning, design, and operation of railway facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly made it easier for them to elude enemies and find food and mates.
Most insects have the ability to fold their wings along their body, which gives them an advantage.
This provides them with more hiding places in which to hide from predators.
Dragonflies and mayflies are the only insects that cannot fold their wings back.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Many believed that he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
This seems like a smart idea because we don&#39;t feel like the Earth is moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the first largest river in the world. It carries more than 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on earth, sometimes as wide as six miles.
As much as 20 percent of the water that flows from our planet&#39;s rivers into the oceans flows from the Amazon.
The main Amazon river is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long. Thousands of small rivers flow into it.
Despite the fact that the construction of pyramids of stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size and technical perfection of the pyramids at Giza could not be surpassed.
In the new kingdom, the ancient Egyptians admired the monuments created by their predecessors over a thousand years ago.
The population of the Vatican is about 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world and also the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican uses Italian in legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language for most people working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican are Catholics.
Since ancient times, people have known the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper, since they can all be found in nature in their pure form and are relatively easy to extract using primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle believed that everything is a mixture of one or more of the four elements. They were earth, water, air and fire.
They were similar to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, although he also assumed that they pass into a new state to get what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Keep in mind that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
It is also possible to make alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that trillions of them could fit in the dot at the end of this sentence.
So the pencil became a good friend to many people when it came out.
It is sad that when new ways of writing appeared, the pencil lost its former status and became less used.
Now people write messages on computer screens and they never have to deal with a sharpener.
One can only guess what will happen to the keyboard, with the advent of newer technologies.
The atomic bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to have many protons and neutrons in one nucleus.
Like pushing a heavy cart up a hill. Then the repeated fission of the nucleus releases some of this energy.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, which means they tend to decay with little or no impact.
The surface of the moon is made up of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust is about 70 km under the oceans and 100 km under the continents.
It is thinner under the lunar seas and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more lunar seas on the visible side because the crust is thinner there. It was easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what makes people act or might interest them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that build up internally as they grow up.
These theories address what makes particular people want to do what they do and what their environment makes them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow&#39;s Pyramid of Needs and Herzberg&#39;s Two Factor Theory of Motivation.
As a rule, two types of behavior can appear when managers begin to lead people who were previously equal in status. One extreme of the spectrum is trying to be &quot;my boyfriend&quot; (or girlfriend).
It is difficult for such managers to make unpopular decisions, disciplinary measures, evaluate performance, distribute responsibilities and hold employees accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, the person turns into an unrecognizable individual who feels like they have to change everything the team did and take it for themselves.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to conflicts between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams adhere to the same standards of excellence as regular teams, but there are slight differences.
Virtual team members often act as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They are usually more autonomous than employees from traditional teams, because their teams can meet according to different time zones, which local management may not always understand.
Having a true &quot;invisible team&quot; (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of the virtual team.
The &quot;invisible team&quot; is the leadership team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization go through the time-consuming process of building a learning organization? One of the goals of applying the concepts of learning organizations in practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively across all functional units of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, the united work of the organization in order to overcome the obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that will serve the interests of the client.
Before an organization can be innovative, leaders must create a culture of innovation, knowledge sharing, and learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neuroscience data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of consciousness. Thus narrowing the scope of the study, and it becomes much more accurate.
The relationship between brain pathology and behavior is used by scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of injuries, injuries, lesions and tumors of the brain affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The advent of new technologies allows us to see and explore previously unseen structures and processes of the brain.
This provides us with a large amount of data and materials to create simulation models that help us understand the processes taking place in our minds.
Although strongly associated with science fiction, AI forms a very important branch of computer science, looking at the behavior and learning of machines and &quot;inculcating&quot; intelligence in them.
AI research involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Some of the examples that can be given are: control, planning and scheduling, response to diagnoses and customer questions, and face, handwriting and voice recognition.
Such questions are separated into separate disciplines, the purpose of which is to solve the problems that we face in everyday life.
At present, the AI system is often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, being embedded in some software applications for home computers and video games.
Study trips are very important for any class. Very often, teachers want to take their students to places where the bus cannot be reached.
Technology offers a solution through virtual tours. Students can view museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or enjoy beautiful art while sitting with their class.
Putting the tour online for everyone to see is also a great way to brush up on the tour and share what you&#39;ve learned with future classes.
For example, every year students at Bennett School in North Carolina create a website about their visit to the state capital, and every year this website is updated, but access to older versions is still preserved - they serve as a commemorative album.
Blogging can also improve students&#39; writing skills. While students often start their blog with sloppy grammar and spelling, this tends to change due to the presence of the audience.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins to strive to improve his writing in order to avoid criticism.
Also, blogging, &quot;students begin to better understand the world around them.&quot; Students are inspired to be smart and interesting by capturing the attention of readers (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a collaborative tool, and it motivates students to expand the learning process far beyond the traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs can enable students to become more analytical and critical. By actively responding to online materials, students can position themselves in the context of other people&#39;s work, as well as express their own views on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada&#39;s charming bilingual capital, with a plethora of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada&#39;s past and present.
Further south is Niagara Falls, while north is home to the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and the surrounding areas.
All this and more makes Ontario something truly Canadian in the eyes of foreigners.
Large areas further north are fairly sparsely populated, and some of them are virtually uninhabited wilderness.
An amazing population comparison: There are more African Americans in the US than citizens in Canada.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is much larger than the others and is a continent of its own when it comes to wildlife.
Almost all of the smaller islands are independent states or associated with France and are known as chic beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the region, especially in Comoros and Mayotte.
The spread of European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco de Gama opened the way through the Cape of Good Hope from Europe to India.
The region is bordered by the Sahel to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
For women: all travelers are encouraged to state that they are married, regardless of their current marital status.
It is also useful to wear a ring (just not too expensive to look at).
Women should be aware that due to cultural differences, they may feel that they are being harassed, women are often harassed, taken by the hand, and so on.
Firmly refuse men and don&#39;t be afraid to stand your ground (this is unacceptable regardless of cultural differences!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC. e. It was used by the Romans, Phoenicians and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name of Casa Branca, but abandoned it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city under the name of Ad-Dar el-Beyda, and the Spanish traders who created trading bases here called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
It&#39;s easy to find places around the old medina selling traditional Moroccan goods like tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs and a whole range of knick-knacks, but it&#39;s all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the very east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, on the border with Rwanda.
In 2002, the city of Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city streets under it, especially the central part of the city.
Although Goma is a fairly safe place, you should check in advance about any travel outside of Goma in order to understand the state of the fighting in the province of North Kivu.
This city is also the starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, and here you can see mountain gorillas in the wild at one of the cheapest prices in Africa.
You can get around Goma by boda-boda (motorcycle taxi). The usual (local) price is 500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Due to its relative inaccessibility, &quot;Timbuktu&quot; has become a metaphor for an exotic distant land.
Today, Timbuktu is an impoverished city, but its reputation attracts tourists and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage in Danger due to the danger from the desert sands.
When filming Henry Louis Gates&#39; &quot;Wonders of the African World&quot; on PBS, one of the most important stops was made here.
This city is very different from other cities in the country, as it is dominated by Arabic flavor, and not African.
Kruger National Park is located in the northeast of South Africa, along the border with Mozambique in the east, with Zimbabwe in the north, its southern border is the Crocodile River.
The area of the park is 19,500 km²; it identifies 14 different ecozones, each of which is a habitat for different wild animals.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the leading among the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, this park has a daily fee for its protection and visitation.
It can also be beneficial to buy a Wild Card, which allows you to visit the national parks of South Africa, either selectively or all.
The territory of Hong Kong was named after Hong Kong Island, a place that many tourists consider the main object of their attention.
The row of buildings that form the Hong Kong skyline has been likened to a glittering bar chart highlighted by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To see the most picturesque places in Hong Kong, you should leave the island and head to the coast of the Kowloon Peninsula, which is opposite.
Most of Hong Kong Island&#39;s urban development areas are closely concentrated on reclaimed land on the north shore.
This is the place that the British colonizers took over, and if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of the territory, then this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt, extending from the coast 80 km (50 miles) inland into Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Part of the forest within Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
These forests are not just mangrove swamps - they also include some of the last remaining mighty jungle that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
The Sundarban covers an area of 3850 sq. km, of which about a third is covered by water or swamps.
The Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966 and is estimated to be home to 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses leave from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since inter-district buses are often overcrowded, it is advisable to purchase a ticket a few days in advance.
Most areas are served by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and reliable.
The minibus is a quick and convenient way to get to nearby places like Paro (150 ngultrum) and Punakha (200 ngultrum).
The bridge across the Oyapok River is a cable-stayed bridge. It extends across the Oyapoc River and connects the cities of Oyapocque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l&#39;Ayapoc in French Guiana.
These two towers are 83 meters high, while the bridge itself is 378 meters long and has two traffic lanes 3.5 meters wide.
The height of the bridge clearance is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011 and was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to become fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarini were the most significant indigenous group inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay, they lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to various groups of local tribes, such as the Guaicurus and Payagua, who survived by hunting, gathering and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, which was previously called the &quot;huge province of the East Indies,&quot; arose as a result of a clash between the Spanish conquerors and local indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asuncion in 1537, Paraguay has largely managed to retain much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best teams as well as the best players in the world in the sport of polo.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be watched here at other times of the year.
For news about polo matches and where to buy tickets for them, check out the website of the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falklands pound (FKP), which is equivalent in value to one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on these islands, which is located on Port Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
As a rule, British pounds will be accepted throughout the islands. Stanley also frequently accepts credit cards and US dollars.
On the outlying islands, credit cards may not be accepted, although British and American currency may be accepted; Check with the owners in advance which payment method is acceptable.
The currency of the Falkland Islands is almost impossible to exchange outside of the Falkland Islands, so exchange money before you leave the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics. During the summer months, air temperatures above +30°C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity makes the weather feel colder than what the thermometer reads.
There are no particularly &quot;rainy&quot; and &quot;dry&quot; seasons: the amount of precipitation is approximately the same all year round.
Although many animals in the park are accustomed to seeing people, nature is still wild, so there is no need to feed or disturb the animals.
The park administration warns: do not approach more than 100 yards/meters to bears and wolves, and also more than 25 yards/meters to all other wild animals!
No matter how quiet they look, bison, elk, bears, and just about any large animal can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not keep the required distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so respect their privacy.
Also, be aware that bears and other wildlife are attracted to smells, so avoid cooking or carrying smelly foods, and keep camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The bay was the site of an infamous naval confrontation in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the US and Britain refused to leave the bay.
All ships sank except for one British cruiser. About 200 American and German sailors were killed.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful assembly in the city led to the assassination of Tupua paramount chief Tamses Lealofi III.
There are many beaches here, since Auckland is located on the banks of two harbors. The most popular beaches are located in three areas.
The beaches of the North Shore (near North Harbor) are washed by the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of these beaches are sandy with safe swimming, and many of them are shady thanks to trees like the pohutukawa.
In downtown Auckland, where the prestigious residential suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Heliers lie in Waitemata Bay, the beaches of Tamaki Drive stretch.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good selection of shops along the shore. Swim safely.
The most popular local beer is &quot;Number One&quot;, it has a simple, pleasant and refreshing taste. Another local beer is called &quot;Manta&quot;.
There are plenty of French wines to drink, however New Zealand and Australian wines may be better transported.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you&#39;re still worried, it&#39;s not hard to find bottled water.
Australians don&#39;t understand the idea of a &quot;flat white&quot;. &quot;Little Black&quot; is espresso, they serve cappuccino with a high layer of whipped cream (not frothy), and tea without milk.
Hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Although fruit juices are expensive, they are of excellent quality.
There is a high number of trips to the reef throughout the year, and injuries from any of these causes are rare on the reef.
However, follow the recommendations of the authorities, obey all signs and pay close attention to safety warnings.
The box jellyfish is found near beaches and river mouths north of 1770 from October to April. Sometimes they can be found outside this period.
Sharks do exist, but rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and swim away.
Salted crocodiles do not lead an active life in the ocean, and their main habitat is the estuaries of rivers north of Rockhampton.
Advance booking allows the traveler not to worry about where to spend the night upon arrival at their destination.
Travel agents often deal with specific hotels, but you can book through a travel agent and other forms of accommodation, such as campsites.
Travel agents usually sell packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, or even combined packages that include flights and hotel stays.
They may also save your booking if you need time to consider an offer or obtain other documents for your destination (such as a visa).
Any changes or requests must first be sent to the travel agency and not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, the vast majority of participants spend the night right on the festival grounds, and most of them consider this a mandatory part of the program.
If you want to be close to the stage, you will need to arrive early to find a campsite close to the music.
Remember that even if the music on the main stages may already be over, there may be areas at the festival that will continue to play music until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the northern part of the Baltic Sea in winter, inquire about the location of the cabin, as crossing the ice leads to quite an eerie noise that can disturb the sleep of the most sensitive people.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include walks around the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Usually, casinos make every effort to ensure that visitors spend as much time as possible and spend as much money as possible in the establishment. There are no windows or clocks, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually offer special food, drinks and entertainment to keep guests in a good mood and not leave the establishments.
Some establishments offer free alcohol. However, drunkenness can cloud your mind, and all good players know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone intending to ride in high latitude or mountain passes should be aware of the possibility of snow, ice or frost.
On an icy and snowy road, the friction is low and you won&#39;t be able to drive the same way as you would on regular asphalt.
During a blizzard, enough snow to get stuck can fall in a very short amount of time.
Visibility may also be limited due to snowfall, snowstorms, condensation or ice on the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, weather conditions with snow and ice are normal in many countries, and traffic continues almost without interruption all year round.
Safaris are probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and a top event for many travelers.
The term &quot;safari&quot; in everyday use means a land trip to see the amazing wildlife of Africa, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants or giraffes, often come close to the cars, so you can get a good view even with normal equipment.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes wary and you can see them better with binoculars.

Tokyo will be the only city in Asia to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice. They first took place here in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies may vary, but as of the end of March, most of the coronavirus-related policies do not apply to July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
Most event tickets are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with the standard ticket price around 7,000 yen.
Ironing wet clothes helps them dry. Many hotels provide iron and ironing board rentals, even if they are not in the room.
If you don&#39;t have an iron handy or don&#39;t like the idea of wearing ironed socks, you can try a hair dryer if you have one.
Do not expose the fabric to too high a temperature (which may cause shrinkage or, in very rare cases, burn).
There are different ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some places it is enough to boil the water for a minute, in others it will take several minutes.
Filters are effective in many ways, and when in doubt, you should consider purchasing sealed bottled water from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pest animals that they have not seen in their homelands.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or worse, cause allergic reactions, release poison, or transmit infection.

Duty free shopping is an opportunity to buy goods at certain points without taxes and excises.
Travelers heading to high-tax countries can sometimes save a significant amount, especially on items such as liquor and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fermont has the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, often passing through isolated backwoods and woodland.
If you are not used to driving on rural roads, be on the lookout: steep slopes, narrow lanes and sharp turns predominate.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than in previous and subsequent sections - typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and strict adherence to them is even more important than anything else.
However, oddly enough, mobile phone service is much better here than on many other sections of the route, such as in the Pennsylvania Wilds.
The German confectionery is quite good. In Bavaria, it is very plentiful and varied and is similar to the pastries of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common, apple pastries are year-round, and cherries and plums appear in the summer.
German baked goods often use almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. Often popular cakes go well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want small but hearty flour confections, try what, depending on the region, are called pancakes or stuffed donuts.

Stirrups are the footholds of the rider hanging from both sides of the saddle.
They provide the rider with better stability, but there can be safety issues as there is a possibility of the foot getting stuck.
If the horse has thrown the rider, but his leg is stuck in the stirrup, the running horse can drag him along. To minimize this risk, a number of precautions can be taken.
First, most riders wear heeled riding boots, which have a smooth and fairly thin sole.
In addition, some saddles, especially English ones, are equipped with safety bows, by which the leather stirrup falls off the saddle if it is pulled back by a falling rider.
The Cochamo Valley is Chile&#39;s premier mountaineering destination. It is known as the Yosmith of South America and has a large number of large granite walls and rocks.
At the top you can enjoy stunning mountain scenery. Climbers from all over the world are constantly creating new routes in its great mountaineering potential.
Alpine winter sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve skiing or snowboarding down snow-covered terrain.
Alpine skiing is a major tourist destination for many ski enthusiasts (sometimes referred to as &quot;ski bums&quot;) who plan their holiday entirely around skiing at a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old: rock carvings depicting skiers date back as far as 5000 BC. uh!
Skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861 the Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Ski touringThis activity is also called backcountry, ski touring or ski hiking.
This is related to, but usually does not include, hiking to the top and then descending unprepared slopes, as snow skiing requires stiffer skis and boots.
Imagine that a ski route is a walking route.
Under good conditions you will be able to cover somewhat greater distances than when traveling on foot, but you can develop such speed on cross-country skis only in extremely rare cases when you do not have a heavy backpack and there is a paved track.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has many independent states. Under normal circumstances, traveling through many countries would mean applying for a visa and going through passport control multiple times.
But the Schengen zone in this regard functions as a single country.
While in this zone, you can usually cross the border without going through passport control again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa to each of the Schengen countries separately, which will save you time and money, as well as paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what manufactured items are antiques. Some tax authorities define goods that are over 100 years old as antiques.
This concept has geographical variations in which the age limit in places like North America may be smaller than in Europe.
Handicrafts can be defined as antiques, despite the fact that they are younger than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer herding is an important source of livelihood for the Saami people, and the culture surrounding this activity is also important for many other professions.
Although this is a tradition, not all Sámi people were engaged in mass reindeer herding; they lived by fishing, hunting and other similar trades, using deer mainly as beasts of burden.
Today, many Sámi are employed in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in the Sami region of Lapland.

Anyone planning to visit a country that could be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
An internet search for &quot;hostile environment security course&quot; might turn up the address of a local company.
The course usually covers all the topics covered here in much more detail, most often with learning by doing.
The course usually lasts 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing situations, a lot of first aid information and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines that talk about survival in the wild are common, but there are few publications about war zones.
People planning to undergo sex reassignment surgery abroad should make sure they have valid travel documents with them.
The willingness of governments to issue passports without specifying the gender (X) or documents updated with the desired name and gender varies from place to place.
The readiness of foreign governments to fulfill their obligations under these documents is also very different.
The searches at checkpoints also became much more intense after the events of September 11, 2001.
Transgender people preparing for surgery should not expect to be able to get through the scanners without their privacy and dignity being affected.
Rip current - a current created by waves that break on the shore, or sometimes on a reef or something similar.
The reverse flow is concentrated in several deeper areas, where a fast current can be formed, going to great depths, due to such underwater topology.
Most deaths occur as a result of fatigue while attempting to swim back upstream, which may not be possible.
Once you get out of the current, swimming back will be no more difficult than usual.
Try heading somewhere where you won&#39;t be caught again, or depending on your skills and whether you&#39;ve been spotted, you might be worth waiting for a rescue.
The shock of returning to the home country comes earlier than the culture shock (there is a shorter romantic period), lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travelers who adapt easily to a new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to re-adjust to their native culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have adapted to the new culture and lost some of the habits of your native culture.
When you first went abroad, people most likely treated you with patience and understanding, knowing that travelers need to adapt to a new country.
It may come as a surprise to people that patience and understanding must also be shown to travelers who have returned home.
The sound and light show with the pyramid in the background is one of the most interesting activities in this area for children.
The pyramids can be seen in the dark and you can also see them in silence before the show starts.
Usually there is always noise from tourists and vendors. The history of sound and light is like a book of stories.
The Sphinx acts as the backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are shown on the pyramids and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries. These islands have the most bases and sixteen were active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 kilometers from the peninsula. The largest island bears the name of King George with the settlement of Villa las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception, where the submerged caldera of a hitherto active volcano provides an impressive natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is an area south of the Antarctic Peninsula bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of this peninsula here merge with the plateau, and then rise again and form the 360-kilometer Ellsworth mountain system, divided by the Minnesota glacier into two parts.
In the northern part, that is, on the Sentinel Ridge, there are the highest mountains of Antarctica - the Vinson Massif, the highest point of which reaches 4892 m and is called Vinson Peak.
In remote locations out of mobile coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
In general, a satellite phone is not a replacement for a mobile phone because you need to be outdoors with a line of sight from the satellite to make a call.
The service is often used in shipping, including pleasure craft and speedboats, where there is a need for remote data and voice communications.
You will usually be able to get more information about activating this service by contacting your local telephone service provider.
An option that is becoming more and more popular for those planning to take an academic year is to travel and study.
This is especially popular with high school graduates, allowing them to take a year off before going to university without compromising their education.

As a rule, tuition fees are charged for admission to such educational programs.
Finland is a great place for boat tourism. The &quot;land of a thousand lakes&quot; also has thousands of islands in lakes and coastal archipelagos.
Exploring the archipelagos or visiting the lakes, you can easily do without a yacht.
While the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes can indeed accommodate any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak leave a completely different experience.
Boating is the national form of leisure in Finland. In particular, there is one boat for seven or eight people.
The situation is similar in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but in other cases it is quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands, the value is from one to forty).
Most of the selected Baltic cruises include an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can spend several full days in this historic city, and spend the night returning to the ship.
If you go ashore only as a boat excursion, you will not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some cruise brochures feature Berlin, Germany. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is far from the sea and the visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Air travel can be intimidating for a person of any age and social status, especially if this is their first flight in their life or if they have had some kind of traumatic event in the past.
There is no need to be ashamed of this: it is no different from personal dislike and fear of other things that so many people have.
Understanding how an airplane works and what happens during a flight can help overcome the fear that comes from being unknown or not being able to control the process.
Delivery companies are well paid for delivering quickly. Often the speed of delivery of commercial documents, goods or spare parts for urgent repairs is very important.
On some routes, larger companies have their own aircraft, but for other routes and smaller companies, this has been a problem.
If they shipped anything as air cargo, on some routes it could take several days to unload and clear customs.
The only way to deal with it faster is to send it as checked baggage. The airline&#39;s regulations do not allow you to send baggage without a passenger, so your participation is needed here.
The most obvious way to fly in first or business class is to shell out for the privilege (or, better, get your company to pay for you).
However, this is not cheap at all - in a rough approximation, you will pay four times more than a regular economy class for business and eleven times more for first class!
As a rule, there is no point in even looking for discounts on business class or first class for direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain core group of passengers who are willing to pay a tidy sum for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, which is why they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multinational republic that has become a victim of an ethnic conflict.

The unfriendly appearance of the Parisians will immediately evaporate if you show a little elementary courtesy.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, mostly beech, spruce and fir, and is a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Due to the combination of microclimates, different soils and elevation differences, it presents a particularly wide variety of plant communities.

However, people who know a bit of Spanish may quickly conclude that Portuguese is similar enough not to be taught separately.
Ancient observatories are generally considered obsolete today and serve as museums or educational institutions.
Because light pollution in their heyday was not as much of an issue as it is today, they are usually located in cities or on campuses that are easier to reach than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge structures in remote locations with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The contemplation of cherry blossoms, called &quot;hanami&quot;, entered Japanese culture as early as the 8th century.
This idea came from China, where plum blossom was the favorite flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom celebrations were arranged by the emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy at the imperial court.
Plants look best in their natural habitat, so don&#39;t be tempted to pick up just one.
When visiting an officially organized garden, collecting &quot;samples&quot; will also result in you being kicked out without a word.
Singapore is generally a very safe place where it is easy to navigate and almost everything can be bought upon arrival.
But, being in the &quot;deep tropics&quot; only a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to cope with both heat (constantly) and strong sun (with cloudless skies, less often).
There are also several buses heading north to Hebron, the legendary burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and their wives.

All the animals that originally came to these islands got here by swimming, flying in, or washed up by the current.
Due to the great distance from the continent, mammals could not get there, making the giant tortoise the main herbivore in the Galápagos.
Since the arrival of man, many mammals have been introduced to the Galapagos Islands, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic in winter, you will know what the polar night is like when the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This presents a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights because the sky will be more or less dark around the clock.
Since these areas are sparsely populated and, as a result, light pollution is often not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
