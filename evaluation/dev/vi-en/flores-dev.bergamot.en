The stars emit light and heat because energy is generated when the atoms merge (or) to make heavier elements.
Scientists are studying to create a reactor that can generate energy this way.
However, this is a very difficult problem and it will take years to see useful fusion plants built.
Steel is on the surface due to surface tension.
Surface tension occurs due to gravity between water molecules on the surface of water above the gravity of the gravity with gas molecules above them.
The water molecule produces invisible skin on the surface of the water that allows things like the needle can float on the water surface.
The blade of modern ice skating shoes is the tongue and has a shallow line in the middle. The knife helps the shoes stick to the ice better, even at the angle.
Due to the bottom of the light blade, when the blade tilts to one side or on the other, the side of the contact with the tape is also curved.
This makes ice people change direction. If the slippage to the right, the skating will turn over the right, and if the slipper is left, the ice skator will cross the left.
Back to the initial energy level they must remove excess energy they are from light.
- Do this by releasing small light matter particles called ?
Scientists call this process a stimulating radiation because the atoms are stimulated by light, creating the emission of light photon particles, and light is a kind of radiation.
The next picture shows that the nucleus is releasing photons. Of course, in reality photon is much smaller than in the picture.
Phosphorus is even smaller than those that form atoms!
- Hundreds of hours of light bulbs are finally burned and bulbs are not bright.
The lights then need replacement. Be careful to replace the lamp.
First must turn off the lighting device switch or cable.

From the heart in the pipes called the artery and heart flow in the pipes called veins. The smallest tube is called the store.
The teeth of the three-horned dinosaurs can only crush leaves but also branches and trees.
Some scientists believe that the Triceratop dinosaurs eat trees, a plant that has a lot in the white age.
These trees look like a small palm tree with sharp foliage.
Triceratops can use its hard mine to clean up leaves before eating.
Other scientists suggest that these plants are very strong toxicity, so it is unlikely to eat, although today, lazy and other animals such as parrots (a descendant of dinosaurs) can eat leaves or poisons.
How can the force of the satellite draw? You're on the surface of the satellite, you'll be lighter than on Earth.
A person weighing 200 pao (90kg) on Earth will weigh about 36 pounds (16kg) on Io. So, of course, gravity will less impact you.
The sun does not have a shell like Earth that we can set up. The entire sun is made up of gas, fire and plasma.
At the depths of the sun, the more it is.
The outside that we see when we look at the Sun called the optics, meaning "light sphere."
About three thousand years later, in 1610, Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei used a telescope that observed Venus had moon-like cycles.
It occurs because there is only one side of the sun (or the moon) opposite the sun. The phase of Venus has contributed to the theory of Copernicus that planets orbit the sun.
A few years later, in 1639, Jeremiah Horrocks, an English astronomer, observed the path of Venus.

When the French battle ended, Germany began preparing to invade Britain.
Germany named this attack as the Marine Lion. Most of the British Army's heavy weapons and supplies were lost when they evacuated from Dunkkirk, so their troops were weak.
But the Royal Navy remained much stronger than the German Navy and may have destroyed any invasion fleet that moved through the British Strait.
However, very few Royal Navy warships were built on routes that could be invaded because the admirals were concerned that their ships would be sunk by German air forces.
Let's start with an explanation of the plan. It's basically German and Japanese.
There were weaker troops and navy, although it only built four new ships before the war began.
The main goals are countries in Africa. To win these countries, they will need to have a base of troops so that their troops can cross the Mediterranean and invade Africa.
So they need to remove British bases and warships in Egypt. These missions, Italian warships have no other role.
Now consider Japan. Japan is a country, like Britain.
Submarine is ships designed to run below the water and continuously operate there for long periods of time.
It was used during World War I and World War II. They're very slow and have limited range.
At the beginning of the war, most of them traveled on the sea, but when multi-compressed machines began to grow and become more accurate, submarines were forced to go under water to avoid detection.
The German submarine is called U-Boat. The Germans were very good at driving and operating their submarines.
With their success on submarines, after the German war was not trusted to own multiple submarines.

How to create interactive media requires standard and traditional skills, as well as skilled tools in interactive classes (the plots, editing audio and video, storytelling, etc.).
interactive design requires you to re-evaluating your assumptions about media production and learning how to think in nonlinear ways.
interactive design requires components of the project to be connected to each other, but also means as a separate entity.
The downside of the zoom lens is the complexity of the focal focal and the amount of the lens details needed to achieve the range of the focal length greater than the lens a focal.
This becomes increasingly simple when the lens manufacturer achieves higher standards in lens production.
This allows the amplifier lens to create images with quality that can be comparable to images created by a fixed focal lens.
Another disadvantage of the telescopic lens is the maximum lens (photon speed) usually low.
This makes it difficult for cheap lenses to be used under light conditions without lights.
One of the common problems when trying to switch the film to DVD is to scan.
Most TVs are designed in the direction of public satisfaction.
For the above reason, what you see on television has cut lines above, below and both sides.
This to make sure the image can cover the screen. It's called an incubation.

The medieval castle has long been creative inspiration, evoke the image of the fights, the feasts and knights under the King Arthur.
Even when standing between thousands of years old, you can still easily feel the sound and smell of the wars that have long ended, almost hearing the claw on the rock and smelling fear from hell.
Is our imagination in reality? Why did people initially build the castle? How is the castle designed and built?
A typical example of this stage, Kirby Muxloe Castle resembles a house reinforced and room rather than a real castle.
Large glass windows and fragile walls will not be able to withstand long before a strong attack.
In the 1480s, when it was built by King Hastings, the country was fairly peaceful and just guarded against small stoles.
Power balances are a system in which European countries seek to maintain national sovereignty of all European states.
The idea is that all European countries must seek to prevent a country from becoming too strong and so national governments often change allies to maintain balance.
The Spanish War marked the first war that the central issue was the balance of power.
This marks an important change because the European powers will no longer be religious war. Thus, the Thirty Years' War would be the last war to be held by religious war.

- can be adjusted to create ease for reading and less colors according to will.
A neuroscient syndrome is characterized by a trio of syndromes including impulsive, concentration, increased or energy-indulging.
It's not a learning disability but a learning disorder; it affects 3 to 5% of the total children, which can be up to 2 million American children.
Children with attention-depression disorder (ADD) are difficult to focus on things like school exercises, but they can focus on what they like, like playing games, watching favorite cartoons, or writing without a dot.
These children tend to engage in trouble, as they are involved in dangerous behaviors, fight and challenge the person in power to stimulate their brains, because their brains cannot be stimulated by conventional methods.
Reduced attention affects relationships with friends because other children can't understand why this child behaves like that, why it sounds like that or how much of their maturity is different.
When the ability to receive knowledge and learning change in the above way, the fundamental speed of knowledge acquisition will also change.
The approach to getting information is different. There is pressure to recover individually, but the ability to recover text becomes more focused.
In essence, the Renaissance made a major change in how research and spread knowledge.
For other primates, the figure no longer uses their hands to move or support body weight or to sneez on trees.
The hands and feet of the chimpanzee are equal in size and length, reflecting the use of the hand to lift the body when walking in the tactic to the ground.
His hands are shorter than feet, and have more straight burns.
The two to three million years old, shows the change in the culture of the hand from moving to operation.
Some people believe that experiencing many dreams awakens due to human impact is usually enough to cause fatigue.
The main cause for this phenomenon is the result of dream that extends the time between REM states.
With REM less than every night, the state in which you experience real sleep and your body recovers becomes less likely to become a problem.
It's as exhaustive as if you have to wake up every twenty or thirty minutes to watch TV.
The impact depends on your brain's frequency of effort to dream every night.
From the beginning, things weren't good for the Italians in North Africa. Within a week of the Italian declaration of war on 10 June 1940, the British 11th regiment seized Capuzzo Fort in Libya.

Realizing this move, the Jews also call for reinforcement.
The reinforcements for outposts including regiments 1 and 3 New York had 200 soldiers, under the command of Colonel John Stark and James Reed (both of them went to general).
Stark enters the defensive position along the fence north of the colonial side.
When tides open up a gap along the mysterious river flowing through the northeast of the peninsula, they quickly expanded the fence with a short stone wall to the north stretching to the edge of water on a small beach.
Gridley or Stark buried a pile in front of a fence of about 100 feet (30 m) and ordered no one to be shot until the enemy passed through it.
The U.S. plan is to launch coordinated attacks from three different directions.
General John Cadwalder will launch a suspected attack against British troops in Bordentown, to stop any reinforcements.
General James Ewing will take 700 troops across the river in Benon, occupying the bridge over Assunpink and blocking the enemy escape.
The main strike force consists of 2,400 people who will cross the nine-mile river north of Trenton, and then split into two teams, one under Greene's command and one under the command of Sullivan, to conduct an attack on dawn.
With a change from 1 to 1 to 1 to 1 mile running, speed becomes much less important and endurance becomes a precondition.
Of course, a first-class athlete on a half-mile track, who can reach the destination before two minutes, must own a huge speed, but endurance must be cultivated at all dangerous challenges.
The best way to prepare for the running season is to run across the country in winter, combined with the upper body training.
Applying reasonable nutrition mode cannot create an excellent performance, but it can significantly impact overall health for young athletes.
Maintaining healthy energy balance, effective drinking habits and understanding all aspects of additional training can help athletes improve their achievements and increase their sports love.
Average distance is a relatively cheap sport. There are now many misinterpretation of the necessary devices for joining this subject.

The vision, or the ability to see depends on sensory organs in the visual or eye system.
There are many different types of structures of the eye, with complexity depending on the needs of organisms.
Different structures have different possibilities that have their own sensitivity to different wavelengths that have different crystals. These structures also require different processing processes for meaningful input information as well as different numbers, for optimal operation.
A population is a collection of many organisms of a specific species in a certain geographic area.

Cells are the basic unit in living entities, and all organs are made up of one or more cells.
Cells are fundamental and essential objects to study life, so they are often referred to as "the bricks that build life."
The Neuroscientists maintain intrinsic balance by transmitting nerve impulses across the body to ensure the blood flow is not clogged.
These neural forces can be transmitted quickly throughout the body that keeps the body safe from the potential danger.
Compared to other intense storms, tornadoes attack a smaller area but can destroy everything on their way of moving.
The cysts pop up the tree, tear the sign on the buildings, and pick up the cars up the sky. Two percent of the most intense tornado can last up to more than three hours.
These terrible storms have winds up to 480 km/h (133 m/m; 300 miles/h).
Humans have created and used magnification lenses for thousands of years.

Hopefully, most people will recognize the best long-term choice for them to cooperate with others.
Many people dream of coming to the day when humans can go to another star and discover other worlds, some say there is something out there and some believe that aliens or other living forms can exist in another planet.
This happens, it won't happen for a long time. The stars spread so far that there are stars called neighbors, thousands of miles away.
"Where is one day, your granddaughter will stand on a mountain in an alien world and wonder about their ancient ancestors?
Animals are made of cells. Eat food and digest the food inside. Most animals can move.
Animals have brains (although not all animals have brains; for example, no brain).
Animals live on earth. They are in the ground, swim under the ocean and fly in the sky.
Cells are the smallest functional and structural unit in the body (life).
The word cell comes from the word cella in the Latin meaning small room.
If you observe organisms that live under a microscope, you'll see that they are made up of squares or small spheres.
Robert Hooke, an English biologist, sees small squares in the twilight when observed under a microscope.
They look like rooms. The first to observe the cell.
Factors and compounds that can be transferred from one state to another without change.
The nitrogen is of the same properties as the liquid. The liquidity is more dense, but the molecule is the same.
Water is another example. Water compounds are made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.
It has the same molecular structure in the atmosphere, solid, or liquid.
