Florida adopted the "winner takes all" principle and awarded all fifty delegates to Romney, who became the frontrunner for the Republican Party nomination.
According to the organizers of the protest, around 100,000 people were present in German cities such as Berlin, Cologne, Hamburg and Hanover.
There were an estimated 6500 protesters in Berlin, according to police.
There were also protests in Paris, in the Bulgarian capital Sofia, the Lithuanian capital Vilnius, the Maltese capital Valetta, the Estonian capital Tallinn and the Scottish cities of Edinburgh and Glasgow.
In London, a protest of about 200 people took place at several offices of copyright holders.
When Poland signed ACTA last month, large protests broke out, leading the Polish government not to ratify the agreement for the time being.
Latvia and Slovakia have both postponed the process of joining ACTA.
Animal Liberation and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) are once again pushing for the hanging of CCTV cameras in all Australian slaughterhouses.
David O'Shannessy is superintendent of RSPCA New South Wales and he told the ABC that supervision and controls of slaughterhouses in Australia should be a normal procedure.
'The surveillance cameras make it clear to the people who work with animals that the welfare of the animals is a top priority.'
The international earthquake map used by the United States Geological Survey did not show earthquakes in Iceland in the previous week.
The Meteorological Institute of Iceland reported no seismic activity in the last 48 hours in Hekla.
The large amount of earthquakes that caused a phase transition occurred on March 10 on the northeast side of the volcano's upper caldera.
Dark clouds that had nothing to do with volcanic activity were observed at the foot of the mountain.
The clouds caused confusion as to whether the volcano had really erupted.
There was 120-160 cubic meters of fuel aboard the Luno when the ship suffered engine problems and was pushed against the breakwater by the strong winds and waves.
The twelve crew members were brought to safety by helicopter, with the only injuries being a broken nose.
The 100-meter-long ship was on its way to pick up the usual cargo of fertilizer. At first, authorities feared that the vessel carrying the cargo might leak.
In 2011, both parts of Congress voted in favor of the proposed amendment.
This legislative session was amended when the second sentence was first deleted by the House of Representatives and then passed by the Senate in a similar form on Monday.
Failure to comply with the second judgment, which states that same-sex cohabitants are not allowed, could lead to this being allowed in the future.
HJR-3 will be reviewed by the next elected legislature in 2015 or 2016 according to the procedure.
The director Vautier will also be remembered for his hunger strike in 1973 against, in his own words, political censorship.
French law has changed. He was already an activist at the age of 15, when he decided to join the French Resistance in World War II.
He captured himself in a book in 1998.
In the 60s he went back to newly independent Algeria to teach film directing.
Winner of two Olympic gold medals, Japanese judoka Hitoshi Saito, has died at the age of 54.
It was reported that the cause of death was bile duct cancer.
He died tuesday in Osaka.
Saito was not only the former Olympic and world champion at the time of his death, but also the chairman of the training committee of the All Japan Judo Federation.
There were at least 100 people attending the party celebrating the first wedding day of a couple who married last year.
A formal birthday event was scheduled for a later date, according to the officials.
The couple married a year ago in Texas and celebrated in Buffalo with friends and family.
The 30-year-old husband was born in Buffalo and one of four people killed in the shooting, but his wife was not injured.
Karno is a well-known but controversial English teacher who taught under Modern Education and King's Glory. He claimed to have 9,000 students at the height of his career.
In his notes, he used words that offended some parents and allegedly used blasphemy in class.
Modern Education accused him of sticking large advertisements on buses without permission and of posing as the main English teacher.
He was previously accused of copyright infringement, but he has not been prosecuted for this.
One former student said he "used slang in class, taught dating skills in notes and was like a friend of the students."
Over the past three decades, despite the fact that it is still officially a communist state, China has developed a market economy.
Thus, under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping, the first economic changes were implemented.
Since then, China's economy has increased 90 times in size.
Last year, China exported more cars than Germany and even the US for the first time, making it the largest market in the industry.
China's GDP could be larger than that of the United States within two decades.
The fourth tropical storm over the Atlantic Ocean in the 2010 season, named Danielle, formed in the eastern ocean.
The storm, which is located about 3,000 miles from Miami, Florida, has a maximum sustained wind speed of 40 mph (64 km/h).
The National Hurricane Center scientists predict Danielle will reach hurricane strength around Wednesday.
Since the storm is far from over, it remains difficult to estimate the possible consequences for the United States or the Caribbean.
Bobek, born in Zagreb (the capital of Croatia), became famous when he played for the club Partizan Belgrade.
He joined them in 1945 and continued to play for them until 1958.
During his time with the team, he scored 403 goals in 468 games.
No one else has ever appeared or scored more goals for the club than Bobek.
He was voted the best player in Partisan history in 1995.
The festivities kicked off with a special show by the world-famous group Cirque du Soleil.
This was followed by the Istanbul State Symphony Orchestra, a Janissary band and singers Fatih Erkoç and Müslüm Gürses.
Then the Whirling Dervishes took the stage.
Turkish diva Sezen Aksu shared the stage with Italian tenor Alessandro Safina and Greek singer Haris Alexiou.
To conclude, the show 'Troy' was performed by the Turkish dance group Fire of Anatolia.
After an accident at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, thirteen-year-old motorcycle racer Peter Lenz was killed.
During his warm-up lap, Lenz fell off his bike, and was hit by fellow rider Xavier Zayat.
He was immediately treated by the medical staff present and transported to a local hospital, where he later died.
Zayat was not injured in the accident.
Zapatero continued that, given the global financial situation, "the financial system is an essential part of the economy.
We have been in a financial crisis for a year that has peaked in the last two months, and I expect the financial market to start recovering now.'
Last week, Naked News announced that it will drastically expand international coverage with three new broadcasts in different languages.
The global organization already reports in English and Japanese, but now also launches programs in Spanish, Italian and Korean for TV, internet and mobile devices.
Fortunately, nothing happened to me, but I saw a terrifying spectacle: people tried to break windows to get out.
People banged chairs against the windows, but the windows were unbreakable.
"One of the windows broke and they started climbing out through the window," survivor Franciszek Kowal said.
Due to the energy released when hydrogen atoms merge (or merge) to form heavier elements, the stars emit light and heat.
Scientists are developing a reactor that can generate energy in this way.
However, this problem is difficult to solve. It will be many years before usable nuclear reactors are built.
The steel needle floats on the water thanks to the surface tension.
The surface tension is created because the water molecules on the surface of the water react more strongly to each other than they react to the air molecules that are above it.
On the water mirror surface, the water molecules make a kind of skin layer that cannot be seen, so that objects such as needles float on it.
The irons of modern skates have a double edge with a hollow void between them. The two edges provide more grip on the ice, even when making turns.
Because the bottom of the knife is slightly curved and the blade tilts to either side, the edge that comes into contact with the ice will also be curved.
This will make the skater turn. If the skates are tilted to the right, the skater turns clockwise, and if they are tilted to the left, the skater turns counterclockwise.
They have to get rid of the extra energy that is extracted from the light to get back to the previous energy level.
They do this by emitting a small particle of light called a 'photon'.
Scientists call this process a "stimulated emission of radiation," because the bright light stimulates the atoms, causing a photon's emission of light, and light is a type of radiation.
The following photo shows atoms emitting photons. In reality, photons are of course a lot smaller than in the photo.
Photons are even smaller than the particles that atoms are made of!
After hundreds of burning hours, the filament in the lamp will eventually burn out, after which the light bulb will no longer work.
The pear must then be replaced. Be careful when replacing the pear.
First of all, the switch of the light fixture must be turned off or the cable pulled out of the outlet.
This is because the electricity flowing into the outlet where the metal part of the lamp is located can cause a severe electric shock if you touch the inside of the socket or the metal base of the lamp if it is still partly in the socket.
The main organ of the vascular system is the heart that pumps the blood.
Blood leaves the heart through a kind of tubes called arteries, and comes back to the heart through other tubes, veins. The smallest tubes are called capillaries.
With its teeth, a Triceratops could have shattered not only leaves, but even very tough branches and roots.
Some scientists think that the triceratops ate cycads. This is a type of plant that was common during the Cretaceous era.
These plants resemble a small palm tree with a crown of sharp, prickly leaves.
With its strong beak, a Triceratops could have removed the leaves from the trunk before eating the trunk.
According to other scientists, these plants are highly poisonous and were not eaten by dinosaurs. Even though some animals that live today can, for example, sloths and parrots (descendants of the dinosaurs) eat leaves or fruits that are poisonous.
What effect does Io's gravity have on me? On the surface of Io you weigh less than on earth.
A person who weighs 90 kg on Earth would weigh about 16 kg on Io. That means gravity pulls you less hard.
The sun does not have a tangible outer layer like the earth's crust, but consists entirely of fire, gases and plasma.
As you get further from the sun's core, the gas becomes thinner.
When you look at the sun, the outer part you see is the photosphere, or 'ball of light'.
About three thousand years later, the Italian astronomer used a telescope in 1610 and discovered that Venus, like the moon, exhibits phases.
If only the side of Venus (or of the moon) to the sun is illuminated, then phases arise. Copernicus' theory that the planets orbit the sun is supported by the phases of Venus.
The transit of Venus was observed a few years later, in the year 1639, by Jeremiah Horrocks, an astronomer from England.
After the Danelaw was recaptured, it was long peace in England.
In 991, Ethelred came face to face with a Viking fleet that was a lot larger than Guthrum's a century earlier.
The fleet leader was Olaf Trygvassion, a Norwegian who wanted to recapture his land from the Danes.
After a number of military setbacks, Ethelred and Olaf managed to reach an agreement. Ethelred returned to Norway to reclaim his kingdom with varying degrees of success.
The only deliberately designed alphabet that is still in daily use is Hangul. It was designed in 1444 under King Sejong (1418-1450).
King Sejong was the fourth and one of the most esteemed kings of the Joseon Dynasty.
He initially called the Hangeul alphabet Hunmin Jeongeum. That means 'the right sounds to instruct the people'.
There are many theories about the origin of Sanskrit. One is about the migration of Aryans from the west to India, who brought their own language.
Sanskrit is an ancient language and is similar to the Latin language spoken in Europe.
The world's oldest known book is in Sanskrit, which was outcompeted after the Upanishads were drafted.
Sanskrit has been the source for a large number of modern Indian languages and is a very complex and comprehensive language. For European languages such as French and Spanish, Latin was the source.
When the battle for France was over, Germany was getting ready for the invasion of the island of Britain.
Germany codenamed the attack 'Operation Seelöwe'. Most of the British Army's heavy weapons and supplies had been lost during the evacuation from Dunkirk, severely weakening the army.
However, the Royal Navy was still stronger than the German Navy ('Kriegsmarine'). They could have destroyed any invasion fleet that would cross the English Channel.
However, there were few royal naval vessels that were close to logical attack routes, because the admirals were afraid that they would be sunk in a German air raid.
First we are going to talk about the plans of Italy, the little one versus "big brothers" Germany and Japan.
Both his army and fleet were weaker, despite the fact that four new ships had been manufactured just before the war.
Italy's main goals were African countries. To conquer these countries, they needed a strategic opening for their troops so that these troops could penetrate Africa across the Mediterranean.
For this they had to get rid of the British bases and ships in Egypt. In addition to these actions, the battleships of Italy were not allowed to do anything else.
And then we have Japan. Like Britain, Japan was an island nation.
Submarines are ships that are specially designed to sail underwater for a longer period of time.
Submarines were used in World War I and World War II. At the time, they were very slow and their weapons had a limited range.
In the first phase of the war, they often moved afloat, but when radar developments led to greater accuracy, the submarines had to dive to remain unseen.
German submarines were called U-boats. The Germans were very adept at the control and navigation of their submarines.
Germans had great successes with submarines and therefore after the war they are not familiar with too many submarines.
Yes! King Tutankhamun is today one of the most famous kings of ancient Egypt.
However, in ancient times he was not considered important and he is not included in most lists of ancient kings.
The discovery of his tomb in 1922 made him a celebrity. Although many old tombs have been robbed, his tomb remained virtually untouched.
Most of the objects buried together with Tutankhamun are well preserved, including many artifacts made of precious metals and rare stones.
Thanks to the invention of the wire wheel, Assyria's chariots became lighter, faster and therefore better equipped for evading soldiers and other chariots.
Arrows shot with the deadly crossbows could penetrate the armor of enemy soldiers. The first calvary was introduced by the Assyrians around 1000 BC.
A cavalry is an army that fights on horseback. Because the saddle had not yet been invented, the Assyrian cavalry fought on the bare backs of their horses.
We are familiar with many Greek politicians, scientists and artists. Homer is probably the most famous Greek person: the legendary blind poet who wrote two Greek literary ones: the poems Iliad and Odyssey.
Sophocles and Aristophanes are still popular playwrights and their plays are counted among the top of world literature.
Another well-known Greek mathematician is Pythagoras. He is known for his famous thesis about the relationship between the different sides of right triangles.
Estimates of the number of speakers of Hindi range from the second to the fourth most spoken language worldwide.
It depends on whether or not the very closely related dialects are counted, how many native speakers there are.
It is estimated that there are 340 million to 500 million speakers. About 800 million people can understand the language.
As for vocabulary, Hindi and Urdu are similar, but the writing differs; Speakers of both languages can usually understand each other in everyday conversations.
Around the fifteenth century, the north of Estonia was strongly culturally influenced by Germany.
Some German monks wanted to bring the original population into contact with God and therefore developed the Estonian letter language.
It was based on the German alphabet and one character 'Õ/õ' was added.
Over time, many German loanwords were merged. This was the beginning of enlightenment.
According to tradition, the heir to the throne would immediately join the army after completing school.
However, Charles attended Trinity College, Cambridge, where he obtained a 2:2 (lower, second-class degree) by studying anthropology, archaeology and later history.
Charles was the first member of the British royal family to receive a diploma.
The European part of Turkey (Eastern Thrace or Rumelia in the Balkans) covers 3% of the land area.
The Turkish territory covers more than 1,600 km (1,000 mi) in length and 800 km (500 mi) in width and has a bit of the shape of a rectangle.
Turkey's area, including lakes, is about 783,562 km² (300,948 mi2), of which about 755,688 km² (291,773 mi2) is in Southwest Asia and some 23,764 km² (9174 mi2) in Europe.
Turkey is the 37th largest country in the world and is about the size of metropolitan France and the United Kingdom combined.
Turkey borders a sea on three sides: the Aegean Sea on the west side, the Black Sea on the north side and the Mediterranean Sea on the south.
Luxembourg has a long history, but has only been independent since 1839.
Parts of present-day Belgium used to be part of Luxembourg and came into Belgian hands after the Belgian Revolution in the 30s of the 19th century.
Luxembourg has always tried to remain neutral, but was occupied by Germany in both the First and Second World Wars.
Luxembourg co-founded the organisation we know today as the European Union in 1957.
The Drukgyal Dzong is a dilapidated fortress and Buddhist monastery at the top of paro district (in the village of Phondey).
According to tradition, the fortress was created in the year 1649 by Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel in memory of his victory over the Tibetan-Mongol forces.
After a fire in 1951, only a few relics of Drukgyal Dzong remain, including the effigy of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal.
The fort was preserved and protected after the fire. It also remained one of Bhutan's most spectacular sights.
In the 18th century, Cambodia was surrounded by two powerful neighboring countries: Thailand and Vietnam.
In the 18th century, Cambodia was invaded several times by the Thai. In 1772 Phnom Phen was destroyed.
In the last years of the 18th century, the Vietnamese also invaded Cambodia.
Eighteen percent of the Venezuelan population is unemployed. Most people who do have a job are employed in the informal economy.
Two-thirds of Venezuelans work in the service sector, of which a quarter work in the industrial sector and a fifth in agriculture.
Oil is an important industry for Venezuelans, as the country is a net exporter; Yet only one percent of the population works in the oil industry.
In the early years of the country's independence, experts from Singapore's botanical gardens helped turn the island into a tropical city garden.
In 1981, Vanda Miss Joaquim, a cross of orchids, was chosen as the national flower.
Around October, nearly 1.5 million herbivores migrate from the northern hills to the southern flat areas every year because it rains there. In doing so, they cross the Mara River.
And after the April rains, head north again via the west, again through the Mara River.
The Serengeti region includes the Serengeti National Park, the Ngorongoro Nature Reserve, the Maswa Game Reserve in Tanzania and the Masai Mara National Nature Reserve in Kenya.
To create interactive media, you need to master conventional and traditional techniques and be able to handle tools in interactive training (storyboards, audio and video editing, story techniques, etc.)
Interactive design requires you to rethink your assumptions about media production and learn to think non-linearly.
In an interactive design, parts of the project are interconnected, but they can also be understood on their own.
The disadvantage of zoom lenses is that you need much more focal complexity and lens parts than for prime lenses to achieve a number of focal lengths.
Now that lens manufacturers are applying an increasingly higher standard when manufacturing lenses, this is becoming less and less of a problem.
As a result, zoom lenses delivered a similar photo quality as lenses with a fixed focal length.
Zoom lenses also have the disadvantage that the maximum aperture (the speed) of the lens is usually lower.
This makes cheap zoom lenses difficult to use when there is low light and no flash is used.
One of the most common problems when you try to convert a movie to DVD format is the overscan.
TVs are usually made to please the general public.
That's why you can see on TV that often the edges on the top and bottom and on the sides are cut off.
This is made so that the image covers the entire screen. That's called overscan.
Unfortunately, if you make a DVD, the edges are also cut off. If the subtitles of the video are placed too close to the bottom edge, it will not be displayed in its entirety.
The traditional medieval castle has long captured the imagination and evokes images of knightly games, banquets and knighthood like Arthur's.
Even standing among the millennial ruins, it's easy to imagine the sounds and smells of battles long gone. You can almost hear the clatter of the hooves on the paving stones and smell how the fear increases in the dungeons.
The question is whether our imagination is based on reality. Why did we start building castles at some point? How were they designed and built?
The Kirby Muxloe Castle is more of a fortified mansion than a real castle, which is characteristic of this time.
With its large windows and thin walls, it would not have withstood a serious attack for long.
In the 1480s, when Lord Hastings began construction, it was relatively peaceful in the country and only small groups of wandering poachers posed a danger.
The balance of power was a system by which European countries wanted to preserve the national sovereignty of all European states.
The concept meant that all European countries had to prevent one country from becoming too powerful. National governments regularly had to form new alliances to maintain balance.
The War of the Spanish Succession was the first war in which the balance of power was central.
This was an important change, as the European powers would no longer have a pretext for waging religious wars. As a result, the Thirty Years' War could be labeled as the last religious war.
The temple of Artemis at Ephesus was set on fire by Herostratus on July 21, 356 BC, and destroyed in the process.
According to the story, he was driven by fame at all costs. The Ephesians were outraged and said that Herostratus' name would never be recorded.
The name was later mentioned by the Greek historian Strabo, so we still know it today. The temple was destroyed on the night of Alexander the Great's birth.
During his reign, Alexander was willing to pay for a rebuild, but this was rejected. After his death, the temple was rebuilt in 323 BC.
Try to hit all the notes with as little tension as possible and unnecessary movements with your hand.
That way you don't get so tired. Remember that you don't have to hit the keys with a lot of force for extra volume like on the piano.
To make more noise with the accordion, you have to compress the bellows harder or faster.
Mysticism is believing in, identifying with, or consciousness of an ultimate reality, divinity, spiritual truth, or God.
The churchgoer strives for a direct sensation, intuition or insight into divine reality.
Followers pursue a certain way of life or want to gain experiences that give them that same feeling.
Unlike other religious beliefs and worship, mysticism emphasizes the direct personal experience of a unique state of consciousness, especially of a peaceful, insightful, blissful, or ecstatic nature.
Sikhism is a religion from the Indian subcontinent. It arose in the 15th century from a sectarian split within the Hindu tradition in the Punjab region.
The faith is seen by Sikhs as a separate religion, although the origin and tradition of Hinduism is recognized.
They call the religion of the Sikhs 'gurmat', Punjabi for 'the path of the guru'. Gurus play a fundamental role in all religions in India, but in particular are at the heart of the beliefs of Sikhism.
Guru Nanak (1469-1539) founded the religion in the 15th century. This was followed successively by nine more gurus.
But Khrushchev's promises were put to the test in June 1956. Then riots in Poland, in which workers demonstrated against food shortages and wage cuts, turned into a general protest against communism.
Eventually, Krushchev sent tanks to restore order. He gave in to a number of economic demands and agreed to appoint the popular Wladyslaw Gomulka as the new prime minister.
The Bronze Age Indus civilization was located in the northwest of the Indian subcontinent and included most of modern-day Pakistan, some regions in northwestern India, and northeastern Afghanistan.
Civilization flourished in the basins of the Indus and also owes its name to this river.
While some scholars suspect that "Indus Civilization" is the appropriate name for the civilization that lived in the basin of the dried-up Sarasvati River, others call it the Harappan civilization after Harappa, the first excavation site from the 20s.
Thanks to the militaristic nature of the Roman Empire, medical advances could be developed.
Emperor Augustus recruited doctors who also formed the first Roman medical corps, intended to be deployed after wars.
Surgeons knew of several sedatives, including morphine from poppy seed extracts and scopolamine from bilzewort.
They became amputation experts with the goal of saving patients from gangrene and were also adept at applying turnstiles and artery clamps to stop bleeding.
The Roman Empire has been very successful in the field of medicine for many centuries and is responsible for much of the knowledge we have today.
Pureland origami is origami where only one fold at a time is allowed. More complex ways of folding, such as folding, are not allowed, and only straight forward folding is allowed.
John Smith designed this in the 70s, to support inexperienced folders or folders with limited motor skills.
Children develop an awareness of race and racial stereotypes at an early age, and these can influence their behavior.
For example, children who identify with a racial minority who, according to the stereotype, are not doing well in school tend to confirm this assumption once they know that the stereotype is associated with their race.
MySpace is the third most popular website used in the United States and currently contains 54 million profiles.
These websites have attracted a lot of attention, which mainly comes from education.
These websites have positive aspects, such as being able to easily set up a class page that can contain blogs, videos, photos, and other features.
Access to this page is easy by providing only one web address, making it easy to remember and easy to type in by students who have trouble spelling or using a keyboard.
It can be customized to make it easy to read with as much or little color as one desires.
Attention deficit disorder (ADD) is a neurological syndrome that manifests itself in a combination of three classic characteristic symptoms, such as impulsivity, distraction and hyperactivity or too much energy.
It is a learning disability and not a learning disability. It affects 3 to 5 percent of all children and up to 2 million children from America."
Children with ADD have trouble focusing on things like schoolwork. However, they can focus on things they enjoy, such as games, their favorite cartoons, or writing sentences without punctuation.
These children often work their way into the nests because they "engage in risky behavior, argue, and challenge authorities." They do this to stimulate their brains, because their brains cannot be stimulated with normal methods.
ADD affects relationships with peers. Other children often don't understand why the ADD'er reacts in a certain way or spells words differently. There may also be too big a difference in maturity.
The basic pace at which knowledge was acquired changed, as the ability to acquire and learn knowledge in the way described above changed.
The approach to obtaining information was different. There was no longer any pressure within the individual recall, but the focus became more on the ability to recall text.
In essence, the Renaissance caused a major change in the way of learning and the spread of knowledge.
Unlike other primates, hominids no longer use their hands to propel around, carry or swing through the trees.
The hand and foot of the chimpanzee have a similar size and length and reflect the use of the hand for carrying the weight when walking on the knuckles.
The hand of homo sapiens is shorter than the foot, and has straighter phalanges.
Petrified hand bones of about two to three million years old show this shift from locomotion to manipulation in the specialization of the hand.
There are also those who think that if you often experience artificially induced lucid dreaming, it can be very tiring.
The main reason for this phenomenon is that lucid dreaming extends the time between the different REM sleep states.
If you don't get enough REM sleep every night, your body won't recover fast enough, so it becomes a problem at some point.
This is as tiring as if you woke up every twenty or thirty minutes to watch television.
The effect depends on the number of times your brain tries to dream clearly each night.
Things did not go well with the Italians in North Africa from the beginning. After Italy declared war on June 10, 1940, Fort Capuzzo in Libya was seized within a week by the British 11th Hussars.
During an ambush east of Bardia, the British captured General Lastucci, the Italian tenth engineer of the army.
On June 28, Marshal Italo Balbo, Libya's Libyan governor-general and intended successor to Mussolini, was killed by friendly fire in Tobruk when they landed there.
Modern fencing is played at all levels, from students learning it at university to Olympic level.
The sport is mainly played in duels, where two fencers duel with each other.
Golf is a game where players have to hit balls with a club in a hole.
Eighteen holes are played in a regular round. Players basically start on the first hole of the course and end at the eighteenth.
The player who needs the fewest turns or strokes with the club to complete the course is the winner.
It is played on grass, which is mowed shorter around the hole (the green).
Perhaps the most common form of tourism is what almost everyone associates with travel: recreational tourism.
This happens when people go to a place that is different from their daily environment and relax and enjoy there.
Tourists often seek out beaches, amusement parks and campsites for recreation.
If someone visits a specific place for the purpose of learning something about the history and culture of that place, we call this cultural tourism.
Tourists can visit different sights of a particular country or they can explore a specific area.
The settlers had also called in auxiliary troops.
New Hampshire's first and third regiments, consisting of 200 men under the command of Colonel John Stark and James Reed (both were later promoted to generals), were part of the troops tasked with strengthening the forward position.
Stark's men took up positions along the fence far north of where the settler was located.
When space arose along the Mystic River and the northeastern part of the peninsula during low tide, they quickly extended the fence with a short, stone wall heading north to the waterfront on a small beach.
Gridley of Stark placed a pole about 100 feet (30 meters) in front of the fence and ordered everyone to wait to fire until the regular troops had passed.
The U.S. plan involved coordinated attacks from three different directions.
According to this plan, General John Cadwalder would attack the British garrison at Bordentown as a distraction to stop reinforcements.
General James Ewing crossed the river at Trenton Ferry with 700 of his militiamen, captured the bridge that ran over the Assunpink River, and prevented enemy troops from escaping.
The largest attack force of 2400 men crossed the river, some 9 miles above Trenton, and split into two groups, one led by Greene, and one led by Sullivan, in order to attack before dawn.
Now that the run is not a quarter mile, but half a mile, it is less about speed and much more about endurance.
Of course, a first-class half-miler, or a person with a time of less than two minutes, must have decent speed, although endurance must be protected at all times.
It is best prepared for the running season with some cross-country running in the winter in combination with chest training in the gym.
A good diet alone is not enough to perform at the highest level, but is very important for the general well-being of young athletes.
By maintaining a healthy energy balance, putting effective hydration habits into practice, and understanding the various aspects of supplements, athletes can improve their performance and enjoy the sport more.
Medium-distance running is less expensive compared to other sports. However, there are many misunderstandings about the few pieces of equipment required for participation.
Products can be purchased as needed, but most products have little to no real impact on performance.
Athletes may feel preferred to a product, even if that product has no real benefits.
The atom is seen as a fundamental building block for all matter.
It is a complex whole that, according to the simplified Bohr model, consists of a central nucleus surrounded by electrons, similar to planets orbiting the Sun - see Figure 1.1.
The nucleus consists of two parts: neutrons and protons.
Protons have a positive electric charge and neutrons have no charge. The electrons have a negative electric charge.
In order to investigate the victim, you must first check the environment to ensure your own safety.
You should pay attention to the victim's position and any alarm signals when approaching him or her.
If you get hurt while trying to help, you may only make it worse.
This research showed that the link between lower back pain and disability is based on depression, anxiety and fear of catastrophes.
The regular weekly structured PA sessions only had an effect on catastrophic thinking and not on depression and anxiety.
Participants in the regular activity needed more support in terms of negative pain perception, which made the difference between chronic pain and discomfort and normal physical movement clear.
Vision, or the ability to see, depends on senses of the visual system or eyes.
There is a large number of deviating constructions of eyes. These differ in complexity depending on the needs of the organism.
The different constructions have different possibilities, are sensitive to different wavelengths and have different sharpness levels. In addition, they require different processing to be able to make sense of the input and different figures to work optimally.
The term population refers to a group of organisms belonging to the same specific species that are located within a specific geographical region.
In the PALM trial, ZMapp served as a control, meaning scientists used it as a baseline and compared the three other treatments to it. If all individuals in a population have the same phenotypic traits, they are known to be monomorphic.
If, on the other hand, they show different variants of a particular characteristic, it is called polymorphism.
Colonies of predatory ants also march and reproduce in different stages.
Predatory ants move in the nomadic phase at night, and they stop during the day to rest.
When the available food sources decrease, the colony lives as a nomadic species for a certain period of time. During this period, they make a temporary nest every day in a different place.
All these nomadic stampedes or marches last about 17 days.
What is a cell? The Latin word 'cella' is the origin of the word, which means 'small space'. The word was first coined by a microscopist who studied the structure of cork.
Every living being is made up of one or more cells: they form the basis of life.
When you study life, cells are so fundamental and crucial that they are often called "the building blocks of life."
By sending nerve impulses through the body, the nervous system maintains homeostasis and blood flow can continue undisturbed.
The nerve impulses pass through the body very quickly. This promotes the safety of the body in the event of potential danger.
Compared to other severe storms, the affected area in tornadoes is relatively small. In contrast, everything that comes their way is destroyed.
The damage from tornadoes includes uprooted trees, destroyed walls and high-pitched cars. They can last up to three hours for the two percent most violent tornadoes.
Such monster storms can have winds of up to 480 km/h (133 m/s; 300 mph).
Humans have been making and using lenses to magnify things for thousands of years.
However, the first real telescopes were made in Europe towards the end of the 16th century.
By combining two lenses, objects in these telescopes appear both closer and larger.
Man will always remain greedy and selfish and in cooperation it is always the case that if the majority benefits from something, they benefit more in the short term from acting selfishly.
It is to be hoped that most people realize that in the long run it is best to work with others.
Many people dream of the day when we can travel to another star and discover other worlds. Some people wonder what can be found in space and some believe that aliens or other forms of life can be found on another planet.
But if this is ever going to happen, it won't be until a very long time from now. The stars are so far apart that there are trillions of miles between stars that are considered 'neighbors'.
Maybe one day your great-grandchildren will be on top of an alien world and wondering how their ancestors are doing?
Animals consist of many cells. They eat things and digest this food in their stomachs. Most animals can move sight.
Only animals have brains (although not all of them do; jellyfish, for example, have no brains).
You can find animals everywhere on earth. They dig in the ground, swim in the oceans and fly in the air.
A cell is the smallest part of a living being or organism with its structural and functional properties.
The word 'cell' is derived from the word 'cella' from Latin, which is a small room.
If you look at living things with a microscope, you will see that they consist of small squares or balls.
Robert Hooke, a biologist from England, discovered small squares in cork with a microscope.
They looked like rooms. He was the first person to observe dead cells.
Elements and compositions can be brought from one state to another without changing.
As a gas, nitrogen has the same properties as liquid nitrogen. The liquid state has a higher density, but the molecules are still the same.
Another example is water. Its composition is two hydrogen atoms and an oxygen atom.
Regardless of whether it is a gas, liquid or solid, its molecular structure is the same.
The chemical state remains the same, even though the physical state may change.
Time is all around us, affects everything we do, yet remains something elusive.
Religious, philosophical, and scientific scholars have been studying time for thousands of years.
We experience time as a series of events that go from the future through the present to the past.
Time also compares the duration (length) of events.
If you observe the reoccurrence of a cyclical event, you can mark the passage of time yourself. A cyclic event is an event that occurs over and over again with regularity.
People today use computers to edit photos and videos.
Complex animations can be created on the computer, and this type of animation is increasingly used on television and in movies.
Advanced computers are often used to record music for the purpose of processing and mixing sounds.
For much of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, it was believed that New Zealand's earliest inhabitants were the Maori, who hunted huge birds called moas.
The theory led to the idea that the Maori people came from Polynesia in a large fleet and conquered New Zealand from the Moriori, after which an agrarian society was formed.
However, there is new evidence that the Moriori were a group of Maoris on the mainland who moved from New Zealand to the islands of Chatham and built a personal, peaceful community there.
Another tribe in the Catham Islands were Maori who emigrated from New Zealand.
They called themselves the Moriori and after a few skirmishes and the Moriori were eventually wiped out
People with decades of experience helped us assess our strengths and passions, while candidly assessing the difficulties and even the mistakes.
Listening to individuals sharing their stories about themselves, their families, or the organization brought us valuable insights about the past and about the individuals who influenced corporate culture in any way.
While understanding one's past is not the same as understanding the culture, it at least helps people get a sense of where they are in the organization's history.
While evaluating success and becoming aware of mistakes, one finds out together with all participants what the values, mission and driving force of the organization are.
In these circumstances, it was very useful to look at previous examples of entrepreneurial behavior and the successes that resulted from it. This made people receptive to new changes and a new direction for the local church.
Thanks to such success stories, the fear of change has been reduced and at the same time people are becoming more positive about changes in the future.
With thinking patterns that converge, you can come to a solution by combining different concepts or areas.
The emphasis in this mindset is on speed, logical thinking and accuracy, as well as determining facts, reapplying existing techniques and collecting information.
In this way of thinking, the most important thing is that there is only one correct answer. There are only two answer options: right or wrong.
This way of thinking fits in with certain scientific or standard procedures.
People with this type of thinking can think logically, are able to remember patterns, solve problems and work on scientific research.
Humanity as a species is by far the best at reading one's intentions.
This means that we can predict what other people perceive, mean, believe, know or desire.
It is important to understand the intention of others. This allows us to remove possible ambiguities of physical actions.
For example, if you see someone smashing the window of a car, you're probably assuming they're trying to steal a stranger's car.
If he tried to break into his own car because he lost his keys, he should be judged in a different way.
The physical phenomenon behind MRI is called nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and was discovered in the 30s by Felix Bloch (at Stanford University) and Edward Purcell (at Harvard University).
Thanks to the magnetic field and radio waves, atoms in this resonance emit tiny radio signals.
Raymond Damadian is a physician and research scientist who made a discovery in 1970: he came across the basis for the use of magnetic resonance imaging as a tool for medical diagnoses.
Four years later, a patent was granted, the world's first MRI patent.
In 1977, dr. Damadian the first MRI scanner for the 'whole body'. He called the scanner the "irrepressible."
Asynchronous communication gives time for reflection and to respond to others.
This allows students to decide for themselves how fast they work and receive instructions.
Moreover, there are fewer time constraints now that it is possible to have flexible working hours (Bremer, 1998).
The use of the Internet and the world wide web offers students the opportunity to always have access to information.
Instead of waiting for the next face-to-face appointment, students can ask questions to their supervisors at any time of the day and get answers fairly quickly.
The postmodernist approach offers absolute freedom. There is no right way to learn.
In fact, there is no one good way to learn. Learning takes place in the experience between the one who learns and the one who transfers the knowledge.
This point is reflected in all educational and do-it-yourself programs.
Many of us watch television shows about situations or experiences that we will never experience, and that we will never do anything with.
We will never refurbish a car, build a fountain in our backyard, travel to Peru to see ancient ruins, or renovate our neighbors' house.
Greenland has good connections to Europe thanks to submarine fibre optic cable connections to Europe and broadband satellite. Thanks to these connections, 93% of the population has internet access.
Your hotel or host family (if you are staying in a private house or guest house) probably has wi-fi or a pc with internet and in all places there is an internet café or a location with public wi-fi.
As mentioned earlier, the word "Eskimo" is considered derogatory by many non-American Arctic populations, especially in Canada. However, in the US, the use is still accepted.
You may have heard of the term Greenlandic Natives, but this word should be avoided by foreigners.
In Greenland, the indigenous people call themselves Inuit when they are in Canada, and Kalaalleq (plural Kalaallit), which means a Greenlander, when they are in Greenland.
Crime, and generally malice towards outsiders, is rare in Greenland. Even in villages there is no 'dangerous area'.
Cold is probably the only real danger for someone unprepared.
When you visit Greenland in the cold season (assuming it gets colder the more you go north) it is very important to bring enough warm clothes.
The long days in the summer can make it difficult to get enough sleep and can lead to related health problems.
Also watch out for the Norwegian mosquitoes during the summer months. Although they do not transmit diseases, they can be irritating.
While San Francisco's economy is tied to its status as a world-class tourist attraction, its economy is diverse.
The largest employment is created by professional services, government, the financial sector, trade and tourism.
The frequent interpretation in films, music, literature and popular culture has led to the city and its monuments being famous all over the world.
San Francisco has a large tourist infrastructure with numerous hotels, restaurants and top facilities for conferences.
For Oriental cuisine (Korean, Thai, Indian and Japanese) it is best to go to San Francisco.
A trip to Walt Disney World is a big milestone for many American families.
A "typical" visit includes a flight to Orlando International Airport, a bus ride to a Disney hotel on site, a week-long stay without leaving Disney's premises, and the way back home.
Although there are infinite variants, most people really mean this when they say that they are 'going to Disneyland'.
Many tickets sold online on auction sites such as eBay or Craigslist are partly used multi-day Park-Hopper tickets.
Despite this being common, it is prohibited by Disney: tickets are not transferable.
You need a permit to camp under the rim of the Grand Canyon.
The permits remain limited to protect the mountain gorge and are made available on the 1st day of the month, four months in advance.
A backcountry permit with a May start date is therefore available on January 1.
In the most popular places, the available seats can quickly run out, for example the Bright Angel Campground near Phantom Ranch, which is generally already filled on the first available reservation day.
A limited number of permits are available for walk-in requests on a first-come, first-served basis.
If you want to see all the beauty of the south of Africa well, it is best to go there by car. You will also get to places where the regular tourist routes do not go.
This can be done in a regular car if you plan it well, but a 4x4 is recommended; Many locations are only accessible with a 4x4 with high wheelbase.
When planning, keep in mind that although the situation in southern Africa is stable, this does not apply to all neighboring countries.
The costs and requirements for a visa vary by country and are determined by the country of origin.
Each country has unique rules regarding which emergency items must be present in a car.
Victoria Falls is a city in western Zimbabwe, just across the border from Livingstone, Zambia and near Botswana.
The place is right next to the waterfalls. These are the biggest tourist attraction, but this popular tourist destination has plenty of opportunities for both adventurers and standard tourists to offer for a longer stay.
The amount of water is greater in the rainy season (November to March) and the waterfalls are a lot more spectacular.
If you venture to the bridge or the winding paths along the falls, you will certainly not come back dry.
In addition, the enormous volume of water ensures that you can see the waterfalls less well.
Tomb of Tutankhamun (KV62). It could well be that KV62 is the most famous tomb in the valley. Moreover, this is the place where Howard Carters discovered the almost intact royal tomb of the young king in 1922.
The tomb of Tutankhamun, compared to the other royal tombs, is hardly worth a visit because it is smaller and has only minimal decorations.
You can only see the mummy's head and shoulders, so you don't see any of the damage done when an attempt was made to remove him from the coffin.
The magnificent treasures have been transferred to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo and are no longer in the tomb.
Visitors who are short on time are better off going somewhere else.
Phnom Krom, 12 km away in a southwesterly direction from Siem Reap. This temple was built on a hill at the end of the 9th century under King Yasovarman.
Climbing the hill is worthwhile because of the moody atmosphere of the temple and the view over Lake Tonlé Sap.
A visit to this place can easily be combined with a cruise on the lake.
To enter the temple you need an Angkor Pass, so don't forget to bring your passport when you go to Tonle Sap.
Although many other countries and the United Nations do not recognize the city as Israel's capital, Jerusalem is both Israel's capital and largest city.
The ancient city in the Judean Mountains has a fascinating history that is thousands of years old.
For Judaism, Christianity and Islam, the holy city is a spiritual, religious and cultural center.
Jerusalem, which is important for religions, is one of Israel's most popular tourist destinations due to its many sights in its old core.
In Jerusalem you will find a wide variety of historical, archaeological and cultural sights. In addition, you will also find lively and busy shopping centers, cafes and eateries.
Ecuador requires Cuban citizens to be able to show an invitation before entering Ecuador through international airports or border posts.
Ecuador's Ministry of Foreign Affairs must legalize the letter and it must meet certain requirements.
In order to enable an organised migration flow between the two countries, these requirements have been drawn up.
Cuban citizens who have a Green Card in the U.S. must go to an Ecuadorian consulate to get an exemption from this requirement.
Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months from the date of travel. A return ticket is required to prove the duration of your stay.
Tour prices are lower for groups with more people, so if you're one or two, you can try to form a group of four to six with others for a lower price per person.
However, you don't have to worry about that, as tourists are often shoved back and forth to fill cars.
Rather, it seems to be a way to make people think that a larger payment needs to be made.
High above the northernmost tip of Machu Picchu towers this steep mountain. Often this mountain is used as a background for the many photos of the ruins.
It looks rather exciting from below, because it is a steep and difficult climb, but in principle it should be possible for fit people in 45 minutes.
Stone stairs can be found along most of the path and steel cables have been placed as handrails for the steeper parts.
Nevertheless, it is very tiring and you should pay close attention to the steeper sections, as they can be especially dangerous in wetness.
Near the top is a small cave that you have to go through. It is quite low and narrow.
The best way to see the Galapagos Islands and the wildlife that lives there is by boat, just like Charles Darwin did in 1835.
In the waters around the Galapagos Islands, more than 60 cruise ships sail that can accommodate 8 to 100 passengers.
The boats are usually full in high season and therefore most people book their place well in advance.
Make sure you book with a Galapagos expert with a lot of knowledge of the wide variety of ships.
This ensures that your specific interests and/or limitations are matched with the ship that best suits them.
Before the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century, northern Chile was under the rule of the Incas, while the middle and south of Chile was inhabited by the indigenous Araucans (Mapuche).
The Mapuche was one of the last independent groups of Native Americans. They were not absorbed into Spanish-speaking rule until after Chile's independence.
Although Chile declared independence in 1810 (in the midst of the Napoleonic Wars that left Spain without a functioning central government for a few years), it was not until 1818 that the decisive victory over the Spanish was achieved.
The Dominican Republic (Spanish: República Dominica) is a Caribbean country. It consists of the eastern half of the island of Hispaniola. Haiti forms the other part of the island
The country is home not only to white sandy beaches and mountain landscapes, but also to the oldest European city in America, which has since been merged into Santo Domingo.
First, the island was inhabited by the Taínos and the Caribbean. The Caribbean were an Arawakan-speaking people who had settled here around 10,000 BC.
After the explorers arrived from Europe, the population of Tainos was considerably thinned by the Spanish conquerors after only a few years.
The conquerors from Spain killed around 100,000 Taínos from 1492 to 1498, according to Fray Bartolomé de las Casas (Tratado de las Indias)
Jardín de la Unión. This space used to be the atrium of a 17th-century monastery, the Templo de San Diego is the only building that still exists.
It is now used as a central square and there is plenty to do day and night.
There are several restaurants near the garden. In the afternoon and evening, free concerts are given in the centrally located gazebo.
Callejon del Beso (Alley of the Kiss). Two balconies that are 69 centimeters apart are the starting point of an old love legend.
Give them some money and some kids will tell you the story.
Bowen Island is a popular destination for a day trip or a weekend trip. Have fun with activities such as kayaking, long walks, shopping and restaurants.
This authentic community can be found in Howe Sound, located just outside Vancouver. It's easily accessible by regular departing water taxis from Granville Island in downtown Vancouver.
If you like outdoor activities, don't miss a trip on the Sea to Sky Corridor.
Whistler (1.5 hours by car from Vancouver) is pricey, but is known from the 2010 Winter Olympics.
In winter this is one of the best North American ski locations and in summer you can enjoy authentic mountain biking.
You must have reserved a permit in advance. You must be in possession of a permit to spend the night at Sirena.
Sirena is the only ranger station where you can not only camp, but where you can also have a hot meal and spend the night in a dormitory. In La Leona, San Pedrillo and Los Patos you can only camp, but no meals are served.
You can buy parking permits directly at the Ranger Station in Puerto Jiménez, although they do not accept credit cards here.
No park permits will be issued by the Park Service (MINAE) if the scheduled arrival lasts more than a month.
At CafeNet El Sol, you can reserve a day ticket for a fee of $30 or $10; the details are on their Corcovado page.
The Cook Islands is a country of islands in free association with New Zealand. The islands are located in Polynesia, in the middle of the South Pacific Ocean.
The archipelago consists of 15 islands that spread over an ocean surface of 2.2 million km2.
The islands are sometimes called 'Hawaii down under', because of the equal time zone with Hawaii.
It may be smaller, but it reminds some older visitors of Hawaii before it became a state, without all the major tourist hotels and other developments.
There are no cities on the Cook Islands, but they consist of fifteen different islands. The most famous islands are Rarotonga and Aitutaki.
Luxurious bed and breakfasts offered in rich countries have become a form of art today.
In the top segment, B&Bs naturally compete mainly on two important points: the bed and breakfast.
In the most beautiful establishments you will often find the most luxurious bedding, or perhaps a handmade bedspread or an antique bed.
At breakfast you can get seasonal delicacies, or the specialty of the house.
It may be in an antique furnished historic building with a manicured garden and swimming pool.
Getting in your own car and taking a long tour has an intrinsic appeal because it's so simple.
You're probably already used to driving your own car and you know its limitations, unlike larger vehicles.
Pitching a tent on private property or in a place of arbitrary size can result in unwanted attention.
In short: your car is ideal for a road trip, but is rarely useful for 'camping'.
Camping in your car is possible if you have a large van, SUV, sedan or station wagon where the seats can be folded down.
There are hotels whose history dates back to the 19th and early 20th centuries (or the golden age of steam trains and ocean liners), even before WWII.
These hotels housed the rich and the celebrities, and they often offered sophisticated dining and nightlife.
Also characteristic are the old-fashioned decoration, the lack of modern facilities and a kind of elegant age.
They are usually owned by a private individual, but sometimes visiting heads of state and other dignitaries are accommodated there.
A traveler with enough money may consider a flight around the world that is divided into staying in numerous of these hotels.
Travelers are put in touch with the local residents in the cities they are going to through the hospitality exchange network.
Usually you just have to fill out an online form to join such a network; already provide or require additional authentication.
A paper or online list of available host families is then provided, sometimes along with references and reviews from other travellers.
In January 2004, computer programmer Casey Fenton booked a cheap flight to Iceland, but had no place to spend the night: couchsurfing was a fact.
He sent students at the local university emails and got heaps of offers for free accommodation.
The typical guest for a hostel is relatively young, in his twenties, but there are also older visitors.
Families with children are few and far between, but some hostels do offer private rooms for families.
The city of Beijing in China will be the host city for the 2022 Winter Olympics. This will be the first city to host both the summer and winter games.
Beijing will host the opening and closing ceremonies and the events at the indoor ice rink.
Other ski events take place at the Taizicheng ski resort in Zhangjiakou, which is located about 220 km (140 mi) away from Beijing.
Most of the temples have an annual festival from late November to mid-May, but that varies by temple and calendar.
Most temple festivals are part of a temple's jubilee or that of the temple's deity or other major events related to the temple.
The temple festivals of Kerala are very interesting to attend and there are regular parades of decorated elephants, temple orchestra and other festivities.
A world exhibition (usually called World Exposition or simply Expo) is a major international art and science festival.
Participating countries set up artistic and educational exhibitions in national pavilions to show the world problems or the culture and history of their country.
International horticultural exhibitions are events for connoisseurs with flora exhibitions, botanical gardens and other plant-related matters.
In theory, these can take place annually (if in other countries), but in reality this is not the case.
These events usually last between three and six months and take place in places of at least 50 hectares.
Over the years, many different film formats were used. The standard film of 35 mm (negative of 36 by 24 mm) is much more common.
Normally, it can be easily refilled when it's up and offers a resolution more or less equivalent to a current DSLR.
For some medium format cameras, 6 by 6 cm is used or, more precisely, a negative of 56 by 56 mm.
This results in a resolution almost four times greater than the resolution of a negative of 35 mm (3136 mm2 versus 864).
One of the most challenging subjects for a photographer is wild animals and this requires a combination of patience, luck, experience and good equipment.
Nature photography may often be taken for granted, but just like photography in general, a photo is worth a thousand words.
Wildlife photography often requires a long telephoto lens, although, for example, a group of birds or a small animal requires a different lens.
It can often be difficult to see exotic animals and in parks there are sometimes rules for commercial photography.
Wild animals are either reluctant or hostile. The environment can be cold, hot or otherwise hostile.
There are more than 5000 languages worldwide, of which more than twenty have at least 50 million speakers.
Words on paper are also often easier to understand than spoken words. This is especially true for addresses, which are often difficult to pronounce properly.
In many countries, the entire population speaks fluent English, and in even more countries you can expect at least a limited knowledge of English, especially among the younger generations.
Imagine a person from Manchester, from Boston, from Jamaica and from Sydney eating out together at a restaurant in Toronto.
They tell each other stories about their hometown, told in their distinctive accents and local jargon.
Buying food at the grocery store is probably the cheapest way to get food. However, without the ability to cook, the possibilities are limited to ready meals.
More and more supermarkets are expanding their range of ready-to-eat food. Some even have a microwave or other device to heat up the food on the spot.
In some countries or certain shops you will find at least one restaurant. Often it has an informal atmosphere and you can eat cheaply.
Make a copy of your policy and your insurer's contact information and keep it with you.
This must contain the insurer's e-mail addresses and international telephone numbers for advice/authorisation and claiming.
Make sure you have another copy in your luggage and online (send yourself an email with attachment, or save it to the cloud).
If you are traveling with a laptop or tablet, it is useful to keep a copy of the memory or disk (where it can be accessed without internet).
Provide the travel companies, but also friends and family at home who want to help, with a copy of your insurance details.
Moose are not normally aggressive, but can defend themselves if they feel threatened.
If you think you are not in danger with a moose, you can get too close and that can just go wrong.
Drink alcohol in moderation. Alcohol affects everyone in a different way and it's important to know your own limits.
Excessive drinking can lead to health problems such as liver damage and even blindness or death in the long term. Consuming illegally produced alcohol carries an even higher risk.
Illegal spirits can contain various dangerous impurities, such as methanol. These can cause blindness or death, even in small amounts.
Glasses may be cheaper abroad, especially in low-income countries with lower labor costs.
Imagine that you have an eye test done at home, which is also reimbursed by the insurance, and that you then submit it somewhere else.
There are two problems with expensive branded frames available in such places: some are fake frames, and the real ones are more expensive than they are at home.
Worldwide, coffee is one of the most traded substances. You will also find many different varieties in your own region.
Nevertheless, there are many different ways of drinking coffee worldwide that are worth trying.
Canyoning (or: caynoneering) means that you go to the bottom of a canyon that is dry or full of water.
Canyoning combines elements of swimming, climbing and jumping. You need relatively little training or physical condition to be able to start (compared to, for example, mountain climbing, diving or alpine skiing).
Hiking is an outdoor activity where you walk in a natural environment, usually on hiking trails.
A day hike can consist of a walk of less than a mile to longer hikes that can be walked in one day.
A day's hike along an easy route requires few preparations and anyone with an average fitness level can enjoy it.
Families with small children may need to prepare more, but a day outdoors is perfectly possible, even with babies and toddlers.
There are nearly 200 running tour organizations active worldwide, most of them independent.
Go Running, the successor to the Global Running Tours, consists of a network of dozens of providers of 'sightrunning' spread over four continents.
It started in the Running Tours Barcelona and Running Copenhagen (Copenhagen), followed by Running Tours Prague (Prague).
There are many things you need to think about before you and when you travel somewhere.
Don't expect things to be "just like home" when you're traveling. Manners, rules, food, traffic, your stay, customs and the language - it will all be different to some extent than you are used to.
You should always keep this in mind, to avoid disappointments or even aversion to local ways of doing things.
Travel agencies have been around since the 19th century. You can ask a travel agency for help when you are going to make a type of trip that you do not yet have experience in when it comes to nature, culture, language or when you go to low-income countries.
Most agencies take the most common bookings, but many agents specialize in certain types of travel, budgets, or destinations.
It may be better to use a tour operator who more often books trips similar to yours.
Take a look at which trips the agent is promoting, on a website or in the shop window.
If you want to travel around the world without spending a lot of money, out of necessity or because of your lifestyle or a challenge, there are some ways to do it.
They basically fall into two categories: working while you travel or trying to limit your expenses. This article will focus on the latter.
If you're willing to sacrifice comfort, time, and predictability to keep spending as low as possible, look at traveling on a minimum budget.
It is taken for granted that tourists do not commit offenses such as stealing, illegally entering, participating in the black market, begging or otherwise exploiting people.
An immigration point is usually the first stop when you leave a plane, boat or other vehicle.
On some international train journeys, train inspections are carried out en route and you must therefore have a valid identity document with you.
On some night train journeys, the conductor collects the passports so you can stay the night.
Registration is an additional requirement for the visa procedure. In some countries, you must report your presence and your address to the local authorities.
This may require you to fill out a form with the local police or go to an immigration office.
In many countries with such legislation, local hotels regulate registration (ask for this).
In all other cases, only persons staying outside the tourist accommodations need to register. However, this makes the legislation a lot more vague, so check in advance.
Architecture revolves around the design and construction of buildings. Tourists often come to architecture alone.
Many buildings are quite beautiful to see and the view from a tall building or a well-placed window can be beautiful.
In many ways, architecture overlaps with other areas. Think of planning, civil engineering, decorative arts, interior design and landscape design.
Many of the pueblos are hugely remote, so you're not going to find much nightlife if you don't travel to Albuquerque or Santa Fe.
Nevertheless, drinks are served in almost all the casinos mentioned above. Some casinos even offer branded entertainment (especially the large casinos in the immediate vicinity of Albuquerque and Santa Fe).
Please note: for visitors from another state, it is not always wise to visit the bars in the villages.
In northern New Mexico, for example, there are major problems with drunk driving. The concentration of drunk drivers is highest near bars in villages.
Unwanted murals or scribbles are also called graffiti.
While it is certainly not a modern phenomenon, it is usually associated with young people defacing public and private property with spray paint.
Now there are also established graffiti artists, graffiti events and 'legal' walls. As a result, graffiti paintings often look more like works of art than illegible scribble.
Many tourists are eager to learn the popular boomerang throwing.
If you want to learn how to throw a boomerang so that it comes back, make sure you have a suitable returning boomerang.
Most boomerang available in Australia don't even fly back. It's best for beginners not to try to throw in windy
In a hot pit in the ground, a Hagi meal is prepared.
The pit is heated with hot stones from the fire or there are places where geothermal heat naturally warms the ground.
The hangi is used to prepare a traditional roasted meal.
Geothermal hangi is offered in several places in Rotorua. Other forms of hangi can be tried in Christchurch, Wellington and other places.
MetroRail offers two classes in the commuter trains around Cape Town: MetroPlus (also known as first class) and Metro (known as third class).
MetroPlus is more comfortable and with less crowds, but more expensive, although still cheaper than normal metro tickets in Europe.
In each train there are cars from both Metro and MetroPlus, the latter of which is always located at the end of the train closest to Cape Town.
Transport for others: never lose sight of your suitcases, especially when you travel internationally.
It can happen that you are deployed as a drug smuggler without realizing it yourself. As a result, you get into a lot of trouble.
This includes waiting in line, as drug dogs can be used at any time without notice.
In some countries, extremely severe penalties apply, even for the first offence; These can include prison sentences of more than 10 years or even the death penalty.
If you leave your bags unattended, you can become a victim of theft and, in addition, they can stand out to the authorities who are afraid of bomb threats.
Chances are that you are already immune to these bacteria at home due to the constant exposure to the local germs.
But in other parts of the world, where bacteriological fauna is new to you, you are much more at risk.
Bacteria also grow faster in warmer climates and can survive longer outside the body.
And so you have to deal with a 'Delhi Belly', the curse of the pharaoh, the revenge of Montezuma or one of the other nicknames of the disease.
Just as many people suffer from breathing problems in colder climates, people in warm climates have more intestinal problems. In most cases, this is very disturbing, but not very dangerous.
Always consider the potentially large cultural differences when traveling to a third world country for the first time, or somewhere in the world you haven't been to before.
Traveling in an unknown developing country can easily become overwhelming due to all the small cultural differences that quickly pile up.
It may be wise to use western-style hotels, food and services, especially in the beginning, until you are acclimatized.
Make sure you are aware of the local fauna before sleeping on a mattress or mat on the floor.
If you go camping, you should bring a camping bed or hammock so that no snakes, scorpions and the like come near you.
Fill your home in the morning with the rich smell of coffee and in the evening with relaxing chamomile tea.
During a staycation you have time to pamper yourself and to prepare something special.
If you're in an adventurous mood, grab the chance to squeeze or mix smoothies:
You might discover a simple drink that you can make for breakfast when you return to your daily routine.
If you live in a city with a diverse drinking culture, you can go to bars or bars in neighborhoods you don't visit often.
For those who have little knowledge of medical jargon: there is a difference between the English words 'infectious' and 'contagious'.
An infectious disease is a disease caused by a pathogen, such as a virus, bacteria, fungus or other parasite.
A disease is contagious when it can be easily transmitted to someone else near the infected person.
Many governments require visitors entering their country or residents leaving their country to be vaccinated against various diseases.
These requirements usually depend on the countries that the traveler has previously visited or is going to visit.
One of Charlotte's strengths in North Carolina is that there are many and high-quality opportunities for families.
Residents from other areas often cite family friendliness as a major reason for moving there, and visitors with children can often have a good time in the city.
Over the past 20 years, the number of child-friendly opportunities in downtown Charlotte has grown explosively.
Families in Charlotte generally don't use taxis, but in some cases they can be useful.
A surcharge will be charged for more than 2 passengers, which can make this option unnecessarily expensive.
Antarctica surrounds the South Pole and is the coldest place in the world.
Tourist visits are pricey, require a good physical condition, are only possible in summer (from November to February) and are limited to the peninsula, islands and the Ross Sea.
In the summer, a few thousand staff members live here at about fifty bases, mainly in those areas. Only a small number of staff members also hibernate there.
The Antarctic interior consists of a barren plain under a layer of ice 2-3 km thick.
Occasionally, special flights go further inland, mainly for mountaineering or to go to the pole where a large base is located.
The South Pole Traverse (or Highway) is a 1600 km long route that runs from the McMurdo base station on the Ross Sea to the South Pole.
It is compressed snow with crevices filled and marked with flags. You can only drive here with specialized tractors and sledges with fuel and supplies.
These are not very agile, so the hiking trail runs with a large detour around the Transantarctic Mountains to get to the plateau.
In winter, slippery roads, sidewalks and especially stairs cause the most accidents.
In any case, you should have shoes with good soles. With summer footwear, ice and snow are often very slippery. Some winter shoes aren't even good enough here.
It should be a pattern with a minimum depth of 5 mm (1/5 inch) and if it is cold, the material should remain soft enough.
There are also models with studs and special attachments are available for when it is slippery: fits most boots and shoes, the heels and / or the sole.
You have to have heels that are low and wide. Sand, gravel or salt (calcium chloride) is often sprinkled on roads or paths to get a better grip.
Avalanches are not a strange phenomenon; steep slopes can only handle a certain amount of snow and the excess snow comes down in an avalanche.
The problem is that the snow is sticky. Something is needed for it to come down and snow that comes down can carry the rest of the snow with it.
Sometimes the original reason is the snow warmed by the sun, sometimes it is due to more snowfall and sometimes to other natural events, but often there is a human cause.
A tornado consists of a rotating air funnel of very low pressure, through which the outside air is sucked in and up.
They generate high winds (often 100-200 mph) and can lift heavy objects into the air that are carried away as the tornado moves.
First, they come down from storm clouds like air chutes. Once on the ground, they are called 'tornadoes'.
Personal VPN (virtual private network) providers offer a good way to evade political censorship and commercial IP geofiltering.
For a few reasons, they are better than web proxies: instead of just http, they redirect all internet traffic.
Normally, they offer higher bandwidth and better quality service. They are encrypted, making it harder to keep an eye on them.
Media companies regularly lie about the purpose of this and say they want to prevent piracy.
Actually, region codes have no effect at all on making illegal copies; A bit-by-bit copy of a DVD will do just as well on all devices as the original copy.
The real goal is for such companies to gain more control over their markets; After all, money has to roll.
Because calls are routed over the Internet, you don't have to use a phone company located where you live or where you're going.
You also don't have to apply for a local number at the municipality where you live; for example, you can use a satellite internet connection in the wilderness of Chicken in Alaska and choose a number that indicates that you are in sunny Arizona.
Often you have to buy an international number separately so that you can get calls from PSTN phones. Where the number is registered is important for the people who call you.
Real-time text translation apps: Applications that are able to automatically translate entire segments of a text from one language to another.
Some apps in this category can even translate texts on boards or other objects into other languages when the user holds his or her smartphone in front of the object.
Translation machines have improved tremendously and now deliver more or less correct translations (and less often gibberish), although some care should be provided, as it is still possible that they are wrong.
In this category, one of the most prominent apps is Google Translate, which allows you to translate offline if you've downloaded the language data you want.
When you're not in your own country, GPS navigation apps on your smartphone are the easiest and most convenient way to get around.
You save money because you no longer have to buy new maps or buy or rent a separate GPS device from a car rental company.
If you don't have a data connection for your phone, or if it runs out, it won't work or only to a limited extent.
Each convenience store is filled with a confusing assortment of prepaid phone cards that can be used in phone booths or for regular phones.
Although you can call anywhere with almost all cards, some providers specialize in offering favorable calling rates for certain groups or countries.
These services can usually be reached via a free phone number that can be reached free of charge from many phones.
Rules for regular photography also apply to video recordings. These rules may apply even more to this.
If it is forbidden to take a photo of something, you should not make a video of it at all.
When using a drone, you should check in advance what you are allowed to film and what permissions and additional licenses are required.
Flying a drone over an airport or crowds of people is almost always a bad idea, even when it's not prohibited in your neighborhood.
Today, prices are almost always compared before booking, rather than booking directly with the airline.
It sometimes happens that you pay completely different prices for the same flight with different airlines and it can be worthwhile to compare the search results before booking and also look at the website of the airline itself.
Although you do not need a visa for a short tourist or business visit to certain countries, as a student you often stay longer than a normal tourist.
In general, you must apply for a visa in advance if you want to stay abroad for a longer period of time.
Student visas generally have different requirements and application procedures than ordinary tourist and business visas.
In many countries, the desired research institute must provide you with an offer letter and you must demonstrate that you have sufficient finances for the first year of study.
Ask the institution or immigration department of the country where you want to study for more details about the requirements.
Unless you are a diplomat, if you work abroad, you typically have to file income tax in the country where you are located.
In each country, income tax is structured differently, which means that tax rates and scales can vary greatly from country to country.
In certain federal countries, including the U.S. and Canada, income tax is levied at both the federal and local levels. As a result, the applicable rates and tiers can vary greatly between regions.
While there is normally no immigration control or it is just a formality when you arrive in your home country, the check at customs can be quite a hassle.
Make sure you know what you can and cannot enter and declare everything that exceeds the legal limits.
A good first step in the world of travel reports is writing for an existing travel blog website.
If you master formatting and editing on the web, you can create your own website later.
You can really make a difference if you volunteer while traveling, but it's not just about giving.
If you want to get acquainted with a new culture, make new contacts and develop yourself, actually living in another country and volunteering is a good option.
It can also be a good way to stretch your budget a bit and be able to stay a little longer, since a lot of volunteering offers a room and food and some even offer you a small salary.
The Normans reached the Black Sea and Caspian Sea via waterways in Russia. Part of this route is still usable. You may need a hard-to-obtain special permit.
The White Sea-Baltic Canal connects the Arctic ocean mainly via rivers and lakes to the Baltic Sea via Lake Onega, Lake Ladoga and St. Petersburg.
Lake Onega is also connected to the Volga. So it is still possible to pass through the Caspian Sea Russia.
Once in the marinas, everything is self-explanatory. Here you will find other boat lifters who will inform you.
In fact, you hang up notes offering help, polar bear through the harbor, approach people to ask if you can clean their yacht, try to connect with sailors at the bar, etc.
Try to chat with as many people as possible. After a while, everyone will recognize you and give you tips on which ship is looking for someone.
Think carefully when you make your choice for a frequent flyer airline in an alliance.
While you may think it's best to join an airline you use the most, you should be aware that the benefits offered are often different and that one airline may be more generous with frequent flyer points than another, even if they are in the same alliance.
Airlines Qatar Airways, Turkish Airlines, Etihad Airways and Emirates are greatly expanding the number of flights to the African continent and flying at more competitive prices than airlines from Europe to many major destinations in Africa.
Turkish Airlines has been flying to 39 destinations in 30 African countries since 2014.
If you still have time left during your trip, you can see how your total quote to Africa compares to a quote for a world trip.
Don't forget to include the extra costs of extra visas, departure tax, ground transport, etc. for all those places outside Africa.
If you want to fly all the way around the world in the southern hemisphere, the choice of flights and destinations is limited by a lack of transoceanic flights.
There is no airline alliance that handles all three ocean crossings in the Southern Hemisphere (and SkyTeam does not provide any crossings).
All except the eastern South Pacific from Santiago de Chile to Tahiti is covered by the services of Star Alliance. This is a LATAM Oneworld flight.
You can't just cross the South Pacific and the South American west coast with this flight. (see below)
The ethnic Armenian region of Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan waged war against the Azerbaijanis in 1994.
A new republic was established with the help of the Armenians. However, there is not a single recognized nation (not even Armenia) that officially recognizes this state.
Diplomatic disagreements over the area remain an obstacle in relations between Azerbaijan and Armenia.
The Grachtengordel is the famous 17th-century district around the city center of Amsterdam.
The entire area is a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its unique cultural and historical value. House prices are nowhere else in the country so high.
Cinque Terre, or Five Countries, consists of five coastal villages named Riomaggiore, Manarola, Corniglia, Vernazza and Monterosso and is located in Liguria, an Italian region.
UNESCO has included them on the World Heritage List.
In recent centuries, terraces have been carefully built, from the rugged, steep landscape to the cliffs overlooking the sea.
Part of the charm is because there is hardly any business development to be seen. Paths, trains and boats are used to connect the villages and cars from outside the villages have no access.
The different forms of French spoken in Belgium and Switzerland are slightly different from the French spoken in France, although they are similar enough to be understood by both parties.
In particular, the numbering system in the French-speaking part of Belgium and Switzerland contains some particularities that differ from the French used in France and some words are pronounced differently.
Still, all French-speaking Belgians and Swiss would have learned Standard French in school so that they could understand you even if you used the Standard French numbering system.
In many places in the world, waving means a friendly greeting.
However, in Malaysia, at least in rural areas, it means "come along," similar to a curved index finger facing the body, a gesture used in certain Western countries, and should only be used in this way.
A British traveler in Spain may wave similarly to say hello, with the palm facing the waver (rather than toward the person being waved), mistaken for the gesture to come back.
Supporting languages are artificial or composite languages with the aim of facilitating communication between people who would otherwise have difficulty communicating.
They differ from lingua francas. Lingua francas are languages that originated naturally or organically and for whatever reason have become the dominant form of communication between people with other mother tongues.
At the hottest time of day, travelers may start to see mirages, which make them think they see water (or other objects).
If the traveler moves towards the mirage, it can be dangerous because precious energy and the remaining water is consumed.
At night it can also get particularly cool in very hot deserts. The risk of becoming hypothermic is significant if you don't wear clothes that keep you warm.
When you go hiking through the rainforest, you have to watch out for mosquitoes, especially in the summer.
As you drive through the subtropical rainforest, you only have to keep the doors open for a few seconds as you get in and the mosquitoes are already in your car.
Both birds and mammals can become infected with bird flu.
Fewer than a thousand cases were detected in humans; In some cases, this was fatal.
People who work with poultry are most often involved in these cases, but birdwatchers are also at risk.
Characteristic of Norway are steep fjords and valleys that are followed by an almost even plateau
These plains are also called 'vidde', or a vast space without trees or borders.
In Rogaland and Agder they are generally called 'heath'. This means that it is a treeless heathland that is covered with heather.
The glaciers are not stable, but flow down from the mountain. This creates cracks and crevices that may be covered by snow.
The walls and ceilings of ice caves can collapse and fissures can be closed.
At the edge of the glaciers, large blocks of ice break loose, which fall down and can ricochet or roll over the edge.
The tourist season for the hill stations usually peaks in late summer.
In winter, however, they possess a different, but equally charming beauty. Many mountain stations get a good layer of snow, so you can ski and snowboard there.
Only a few airlines still offer funeral fares, which means that the cost of last-minute funeral trips is slightly lower.
These are available from airlines such as WestJet, Air Canada, Delta Air Lines and, for flights from the US or Canada, Lufthansa.
In all cases, you book with the airline by phone.
