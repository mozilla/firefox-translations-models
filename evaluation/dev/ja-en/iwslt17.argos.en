This is how we get knowledge
The main role of the story is this woman Natalia Liptinsky
It is specialized in di  ancient dead carcasses with old breeders
Natalia Liptinsky: People call him “Dr. De s”
Ratif Nasa: I thought it was especially interesting because the掘avation site is a tundra zone in Canada, far north of Arctic.
A summer day in 2006 she was in the掘avation site called File's Reef Bed There is no la  to the magnetic arctic
Natalia: You might think it’s boring because you just need to walk around all day while picking up the fossil threshold.
Ratif: When she noticed something
Natalia: old red-brown with palms
I had fallen on the ground
Ratif: At first I thought it was just a piece of wood, because the fragments of ancient plants were found well in Files Reef Beds
Back to the Night Camp
Natalia: Take out the loupe a little more look good見て no year
The more you see it —
Bone
Ratif: She has more than 4 years since then visited this point many times and finally collected 30 pieces of same bone fragments most are very small
Natalia: No number is so much that it fits in a small plastic bag
Ratif: I tried to combine a chip like a puzzle
Very hard work
Natalia: I tried to use sand and putty because it was broken and powdered, but it does not work
So after all, I used 3D scanner
Ratif: Amazing! Natalia: Right?
Ratif: It is much easier to work on the screen
Natalia: I was imp ed when I combined all.
Ratif: How much is the confidence that the assembly is correct?
How to make a different way of assemble?
Natalia: No error
Ratif: She discovered that it was a bone of the legs, and it was an even bite.
This bone was not supposed to be cow or sheep
More
Natalia: It was a large size animal.
Ratif: What kind of animal is it?
 gged she showed one of the bones to a coworker of the , and it was timely
Natalia: When we cut the eye on the edge of the bone with a saw we have a characteristic smell
Ratif: with a scent like a burnt meat
When Natalia cuts the skull bone, it was the same smell as olfactory collagen.
Collagen plays a role in keeping bone structure
Normally it is decom  if the older men passed
In this case, the climate of the Arctic was saved as a natural refrigerator
After 1-2 years, Natalia participated in the conference in Bristol, and his fellow fellow Mic Buckley had a demonstration of the new treatment method called “collagen appraisal”
Each animal has a little different structure of collagen. If you know the characteristics of unknown bone collagen, you can compare it with the one of the already known animals.
So I sent one bone piece by courier
Natalia: I wanted to track it because it is important
Ratif: He treats bone fragments and measures 37 modern mammals
Find matching animals
Nathalia掘avated in the Arctic region of high la .
It was camel
Natalia: I thought “Well?” If it’s true, it’s amazing
Ratif: I tested many bone fragments, but all results were the same
However, I thought from the size of the bone I discovered, this camel was more than 30% larger than the current one.
The height of the back was about 2.7m — weight was about 1 ton
Comment
Natalia was a huge Arctic camel
I heard that everyone camel, I thought that I will live in East and Central Asia
The image of the picture postcard in the head will surely be the one who loves the desert生きature This is such as the Middle East and the Sahara desert Living in a high temperature desert On the back of the big hang of the desert蓄umulates water for long journeys of the desert with a wide range of feet and walks through the sand dunes
Why did these animals reach the Northern Canada?
Actually, scientists have been knowing from before Natalia discoveries are actually the origin of camels in the United States
It was born here
After the camel appeared, it has been about 45 million years, but it was almost 40 million years.
Ratif: What is the difference when all are arranged?
Natalia: Yes, the size of the body is in town
There was a long type of neck.
Ratif: Like a crocodile, some faced
Natalia:ウサギ The primitive camel was very small and it was about a rabbit
Ratif: Yeah? Is it a rabbit-size camel?
Natalia: Initial type
I don't know what to see
Ratif: I want to keep rabbit camels
Natalia: Yeah, I'm sure the best
Ratif: After 3 to 7 million years ago, the crowd of camels descended to South America. Rama and Alpaca became another type crossed the Bering Bridge to Asia and Africa.
Around the end of the previous河cial period North America camel was extinct
It is not possible to fully explain what was discovered in the north so far.
For example, because the Sahara desert is the opposite of the temperature
Indeed, the temperature of 350,000 years ago was average 22 degrees higher than the modern
So the coniferous forest is spreading and may be similar to the current Yukon river basin or Siberian
However, the   will be frozen for 6 months in winter
Blizzard
The darkness of the city may last 24 hours
Total
How did this Sahara desert superstar survive the Arctic climate?
Natalia and fellow s believe to answer
It is a stunning answer
To adapt to a place like the Sahara desert, what is the characteristics of camel that we have thought about in fact evolved to ride the winter?
The wide legs are not for walking on the sand, but for walking on the snow.
I don’t know what to do on my back — I’m surprised, but I’m packed with fat instead of water. It’s a little bit of food and it’s helpful to ride a half-year winter?
After that, I went beyond the bridge for a while. What is the characteristic of winter?
For example, it may be useful even in hot weather. If you store whole body fat in one place like a rucks, you will not need to cover the body with fat that plays the role of insulation.
It makes it easy to escape heat
This 方endous idea is to think of the typical evidence of adapting to the desert. In fact, it can be evidence that lived in the High La  Arctic Area.
This is not my first time
Through this story, others have revealed the surprisingness of evolutionary life and have been clarified of future climate change
But I love this story.
For me, this is my own story. It is a story of how it changes the world and how it changes.
I have been teaching as a historian
The most part of scientists are historians.
They also try to understand the past
Talk about the history of life in the universe, planets, and the earth
And as a historian about the development of the story.
Natalia: We make a story and stick to it, such as desert camel
A very good story. The camel adapts perfectly
I'm in the desert
Ratif: But someday you might find a small evidence
By understanding small things, you might be able to assemble everything you believe
In this case, there is a fossil like a piece of wood found by one scientist. It seems to come out to the picture book of Dr. Sus. The reason why this animal is like this is a completely new hypo  beyond common sense.
My thoughts on camels have changed
It can only be adapted to a certain environment such as a desert. It is sometimes in the Sahara desert, but it is true that it is an animal that can live anywhere.
(Applause)
Hello!
Restaurant
AZURI is usually on Radio City Music Hall
No 
It is a living evidence that the story about our world is dynamic.
We must reassemble the story and reimagin
That’s right?
A new view of the world is on the other side of the bones of a single piece.
Thank you very much
Modern computers are too good and we don’t notice the cruelty of that.
Today I'd like to talk about this problem and this - "repairing" in neuroscience
2011 De st Harム's scent that night gave me a deep shock
I learned computer science and neuroscience at a bar outside of the University of Colombia, when I talked about the power of holograms, which would replace my computer someday.
When the conversations of the members were upset to the highest tide, so his smartphone was shining
He pulled out his phone and turned to this type
And when I look up with my eyes, I said, “I’ll continue listening.”
But of course his gaze was視ed and the meaning of that time was lost
On the other side of the bar, another student has a smartphone
They were laughing while swipe their pictures
I started thinking about what they feel happy even though I feel frustration with the same technology
As I thought, "Mother" is not the digital information itself, but simply the display device is separating me from a friend, and I realized that I connected them.
They tied around something. It’s like a ancestry that developed social awareness, talking about the story around the fire. I think this tool is for that.
should be an extension of body functions
The opposite thing is happening on the computer of Konnichi.
When you send an e-mail to your wife, when you are com  a めphony, or when you are comforting your friend, you are taking exactly the same action.
操作e icons and menu buttons that are displayed squarely like this while flexing
I think this is wrong I think I can start using more "natural machine"
You should use a machine that pulls these tasks back to the real world
By applying the principle of neuroscience, you should use machines that extend rather than limiting perception
Now we have a machine
This is "Meta 2"
Try it out
You can see your hand in front of you now
Let’s go to 3, 2, and 1 immersive hologram experience A veryリアル hologram is in front of the main building - Now it is floating in front of the headset in the wearing
Of course what you’re looking at is the product you’re shopping. You’ll be learning materials and you can use your hands to control them precisely and move them well.
Ianman will be proud
This will also show you soon
(Applause) If you want to think like a partner, think about what’s going on with such a technology, and think about its potential, let’s look at some
ビル's mother is an itect, so I thought it was to draw a design drawing of a building in a three-dimensional space instead of a two-dimensional drawing.
Mother is now touching the video and choosing the interior
This is all taken through the head gear using the GoPro camera
This is a very personal example of the “Glass Brain” project by Professor Adam Gary, who is a student at University of California, San Francisco.
As a student of brain neuroscience, I always dreamed of learning and memorizing using machines that can be operated by touching this diverse and complex brain structure.
Now it’s augmented reality, but it’s a more important concept – it’s part of the concept of extending instead of limiting physical capacity by digital devices.

人類ing the next few years, we believe that humanity will be changing
All digital information begins to be expressed in real world
A little Imagine this is the story telling part of the story. Painter Brain Surgeon Interior Designer and – what do we mean here?
What we should do as a social community is to imagine how we can build a new reality that extends human experience, just to game the reality or to make digital information – not to be a gochagocha
I am passionate about this
Let's take a little secret
Within about 5 years, this is not a small device, but within about 5 years these are all holograms like thin glasses
When we choose a smartphone, we don’t care about the hardware itself, but we value the basic software, but we always dream of creating a “hearted iOS” if you say it as a neuroscientist.
Properly making this is very important because we can spend the window screen interface and at least as long periods with such systems
I don’t know about you, but it’s cool to go inside Windows
The most intuitive interface of all possibilities is the basis of the design of neuroscience. Instead of fighting discussions with designers in boardrooms.
The principle of this center is "minimum resistance nervous pathway"
iOSly connecting "hearted iOS" with human brain - the first human brain controls that iOS
In other words, you need to learn how to make a computer
The user knows how to use the system naturally.
Here are the three main features of the brand new design guidelines used by ユーザー.
The most important thing is that the user is OS.
The system  of conventional files is complex and abstract, so you can understand it first
It performs the reverse of "minimum resistance nerve pathway"
However, in the augmented reality, if you put a hologram TED panel on the opposite side of the desk, the spatial memory ability can be adjusted to this, and you can extract information by extending your hands.
You can view all your holograms from the car you want to buy to the car you are looking for.
Your brain remembered how to retrieve information
The second guideline of the interface is “see and touch”.
What should I do first if my baby sees something interesting?
Stretch your hands and touch them.
“Natural machine” should work like this
Visual system receives basic stimulation from a unique receptor sense. This is a feeling that occurs in the depth of the body
By directly contacting the work, you can not only control it better, but also understand it deeper.
That’s why I see it.
However, this is not enough to experience
Human being is a spiritual life that is a social life
The third guide from which is - the hologram version of the example fire at the beginning is guided
Mirror neuron subsystem of primates indicates that you can see each other’s face and hands in 3D, and you can work together.
Watch the video behind this page Two Meta users deal with the same holograms without distracting the device and crossing the eye through this object
Let’s try this again with neuroscience in mind
Our Favorites: iOS in Mind
Let’s go ahead Take this headset and place it next to the desk
This moment we are connected with you
空間's spatial memory works When you grab the headset and touch it, you will notice that you are OS.
And if my unique receptor is not working, I will disassemble this headset into thousands of parts - touch the sensor to scan your hands
However, it is insufficient to see this alone, so now the co-founder Ray will call you 3D soon - Ray?
(called sound) Hey ray?
He sees in three dimensions right in front of you
Have a real taste like a photo
Thank you
ミラー mirror neurons system suggests that this will replace the phone sooner
How about Ray tone?
It’s a live conversation.
(Applause) Ray I've seen the hologram brain in my video before
You will not only change the phone, but also change the way we work together.
Thank you very much

(Chris Anderson) I would like to hear about it - I have been doing a demo of augmented reality several times over the past few years
There are also discussions between engineers, “Do you see real things on large screens?”
There was a point in regard to the field of view. It is noted that if you wear the actual headset, you can draw a wide field in the demo.
What is the actual video?
Of course, it's really good.
In addition to that, I took photos over the lens of the GoPro camera especially when I make a video introduced.
I wanted to see you through the headgear because I wanted to have a real experience as it is.
Thank you for your introduction
Thank you very much
My hometown is the most free, tolerant and progressive place in the US — Seattle, Washington
Awesome Seattle  Family
My mother is an artist and my father is a university professor. I am very grateful for my own environment because I have decided on my way of life without worrying.
I didn’t follow the path as my parents thought
19 years old How can I leave or leave?
And as a professional Horn player, I started to travel around Aichi. I had been dreaming of
While playing chamber music, I worked with Charlie Bird, a great jazz guitar player for several years.
At the end of his 20s he became a member of Barcelona Symphony Orchestra in Spain
It's a good life
Parents should complain even once
Thank you for your support.
It was not their ideal
“The son is the middle of the gap year — about 10 years.”
But— Let’s talk about my way of life because there was only one conversation.
I was home from Barcelona at the age of 27 at Christmas vacation and I was home with my mother and kitchen.
My mother is insufficient.
I thought something was wrong
"What do you think?"
Mother said, “We are so worried about you.”
What do you think?
“I’m sure to answer to my honesty—I don’t vote for the ist?”
Well, the real thing I was just Horn player who is not interested in politics
It was a little conf  to the parents who felt it.
I am a keen supporter of capitalism.
I have been interested since ancient times. I am surprisingly "poverty"
In Seattle, I remember the first time I saw genuine poverty.
Our family was a low middle class, but it is not true poverty.
It was far from
I was 6 years old or 7 years old
It was a fun experience that everyone experienced.
A photo on National Geographic I was a child who was about me in East Africa.
It was obvious that I could not do anything.
Some people remember that photo instead of the same photo.
It is a photograph that depicts the appearance of poverty that continues to suffer from the world
The picture was成長 to the eyes, growing, going to school, re学ing, or having a home, I was not forgotten.
I was wondering how the child was
People like children around the world
I was looking for the answer though I was not a university at that time.
What was worse? How did you improve?
And the answer was changed. I will talk to you.
Well — most of the Americans believe that poverty has worsed childhood—I think it would have worsened compared to the time of that photograph.
If the U.S. people ask whether the poverty of the world has worsened or improved, 70% will answer that er has worsened since the early 70s
Let’s teach the truth
This is how to change my worldview
People living in人口er state in the world from 1970 to today — people living in less than 1 dollar per day — of course, adjusting the inflation rate — the proportion of people occupied by 80% decreased
The world's 世界 poverty decreased by 80% compared to my childhood
Sorry, this entry is only available in 日本語.
This is a mir 
What to be pleased
This is the best 業 in human history.
(Applause) When I knew this, I was wondering what was this accomplished?
If you don’t know why, you can’t reproduce it.
If you want to recreate this and save more than 20 billion people from poverty, it is the main subject. Our brothers and sisters are getting out of poverty
I want to know to save 20 billion people
So I started to answer
Politics did not relate to the answer What was good for me
Not interested
The best answer from the mainstream economists was wanted. Right, left, and middle class
Let’s say the answer
5 success factors
Our brothers and sisters in the world.
First Globalization
2nd Free Trade
Third, Property Rights
4th Legalism
5th
Since the 1970s, the world has become a free enterprise system. Since the 1970s, the world has become a free enterprise system.
I'm not simple
We believe that free companies are not perfect, and to build a better world, we know that there is something other than a free company.
But it's amazing
Politics
What I learned
The significance of capitalism is not the umulation of wealth
The best aspect of capitalism is that there is a ambition. Many people talk about the ambition on this altar. In other words, it is a desire to be born from a desire.
You have to spread more
Now let’s talk about the second gourd here. It’s related to the first gourd, not just around the world, but also to this city where it’s now.
I've ever heard of the word of people, but I've talked about the idea of poverty relief is the most successful thing. "No system that created wealth in human history as the free market"
We saved billions of people from poverty.
Who is the word?
Milton Friedman andナルald Reガン
Close
President Barak Obama
Why?
Because I was told directly
Believe
I came out from my mouth.
In addition to that, I thought that it would be a great opportunity.
What do you think about?
May 2015 This theme is at Georgetown University during the event
What do you think this is the biggest problem that America faces?
It is to reach out to people who need the most under the idea that the free market solves poverty, regardless of the liberal or maintenance.
You know that the crisis is happening in the United States and around the world because of the bipolarization of politics
Now I have reached the crisis situation of Giligiri
Unpleasant situation This is not
Last year, a paper was published in the American Academy of Sciences. It is a scientific journal with the highest authority in the Western market.
In the 2014 paper, the theme was “a称metry of political s”
This is something in the definition of a psychologist. Ideology is born from love, but the world of the enemy is born from hatred.
World Disputes
This is a phenomenon seen betweenイスラエルナians and Israeli people.
The authors of this paper have found something in the United States that the党ists and Democratic Party have become a “a政治metry of political s”
I believe that the majority of people who are passionate about politics are moving with love.
I think
Most people’s thoughts are “My ideology is based on the basic tolerance of people who want help but others are evil who are trying to fall me.”
As long as these species are a性metric, we will not proceed as a society
Not possible
What is the solution?
First, let’s be honest.
Not to underestimate the differences
There are many excellent studies about this
Jonathan Heit, a veteran TED speaker and friend
Professor of psychology at New York University
We study the differences between ideology, values and morals of various people.
According to him, for example, conservatives and liberal people seem to be quite different what to see
For example, if you have a poverty problem in the liberal, it is more than 59% more than those who care for economic freedom
People who are serious about economic freedom in the conservatives seem to have 28% more than those who have poverty problems
This difference seems to be condensed
Is it wrong?
This is diversity and we have our strengths here.
Something that saved poverty
The poverty problem was spread around the world with a means of free economy
In other words, we need each other to save the next 20 billion people from poverty if you want to help people
No other roads
Close
How can I achieve it?
It is difficult
Innovative thinking is required
There are many on this altar
Social entrepreneurship — yes no doubt the best
Sustainable, 倫理ical, moral, and responsible overseas investment
That’s it! But what do you really need?
A new world with flexible ideology
More surprising
What?
What do you feel that your ideology has come to shape?
What is it?
I think I’m listening to people who have the same opinion.
Why is this dangerous?
If you talk about the economy in this country, there is a conservative on the right side, and we are talking about tax and regulation.
There is a liberal on the left side, and when talking about the economy, it is always about the impairment of income
Both are positive, but it’s really important for me and you
Today, suffering from ry and people who need help become a story of rescue from poverty
We are free to use the highest level of tools under the best way to alleviate poverty. It is for conservatives that obsessions to the people ofベラeral and their poverty problems are forベラeral and it is necessary for conservative people and their freedom market.
This diversity is one of the strengths of the United States.
How can we achieve this?
You need a list of activity items. Not only you, but also me.
No.1— The first item should be not enough to tolerate people with different opinions.
It is not enough
It is necessary for people who don’t agree with them. You should be aware of it by our diversity. Because there are still people waiting for these tools
What should I do?
Where to start
We are all in this room
I am blessed with people who listen
リーダーシップ and leadership
You may be able to listen even if you talk about ideology that you do not want
Prog  may start there
The second is the first
I want you to become a person I want to become a person, especially those who can change the border to ambiguous things. I want you to become a person who is difficult to type.
If you are a conservative, you should always have a moral obligation to fight for poor.
For liberal, to solve our problems is to be responsible for the goodness of the free market.
Two things are realized
First, you can work on the next 20 billion people’s re es. You can work on the solutions you need in the past.
The second dinosaur is experiencing under this country The horribleの戦い ideology fight can be transformed into a competition of ideas based on a sense of unity and respect for each other
If you do, you will notice that the big difference is not so big.
Thank you very much
The University had to write a lot of reports on major political
If a regular student writes a report, the amount of work will be distributed like this
That’s it — the first time is slow, but the first week is enough to proceed, and the second half of the order is maintained even if the load is slightly higher
I want to do it like that.
Schedule
I'm going to take it right away, but if I'm going to do a report, I'm going to do it.
I'm going to do this every time
Then I got to write a90 of 90 pages over a year
I know that the usual way is not used
The scale is too large
I decided to make a plan like this
1 year plan
First, light up a little in the middle and sprinkle on the end of the stairs like it is
Go up this stairs
Not difficult
Sorry, this entry is only available in 日本語.
First months
Sorry, this entry is only available in 日本語.
That’s why the plan is changed:
Then — I went past the middle period, but I couldn’t do it.
More than 2 months will be one month and it will be another 2 weeks
One morning when I   up, I have only three days to write one word yet, and I have no room to write 90 pages of paper in 72 hours. I have never been able to do that, but I ran through the campus with full force and the time changes to slow motion. I submitted it at the moment of photography
That’s it all.
1 week after phone call from university
What is Tim Urban?  
Yes
"I have a talk about the submitted paper"
」
That’s why I’ve never seen such a wonderful論.
Nothing happened
It was a tough paper
I just wanted to say “This person is genius?”

Now I write
 it But Why
2 years ago, I decided to write about "development"
What is happening in the head of the predecessor because my behavior was always puzzled by people around us
I wanted to explain to people who are not the predecessor of the world. I think that the brain of the predecessor and the person who is not will surely have a difference
In order to confirm that my brain is not a predecessor, I found a place that will take care of a certain person's brain.
Today has the results
I want you to see the difference
If you are not a brain expert, it is difficult to understand.
This is the brain of a person who is not a predecessor
[Priority decision] for this
My brain
This is the difference between the two
Both brains have a “logical will deter ”, but in the case of the brain of the predecessor, there is a “sal that you want to praise right away” in addition to that.
How is it involved?
It's in good condition.
"I want to work a little" "Yadane" The rational will deter  is to do something productive, but the monkey doesn't care about it, so I'll cross the rudder and say " That's because I remembered that there was such a thing to read キ articles about Nancy Keligan and Toña Harding incidents
Then — you need to check if you have changed something 10 minutes ago
After that, Richard Fineman is waiting for the YouTube スパイラル to see the interview of the mother of Justin Bieber after he started with a video about the magnet.
That's why it's a cup of hand, so it's bad today
I don't have enough time to work.
What is happening?
Sal is not a partner
Live only at the moment
The memory of the past is not knowledgeable about the future Just two things that are easy and fun
There is no problem if the animal world is
If you’re a dog, you’ll have a lot of fun and fun.
For monkeys, humans are just a kind of animal
Eat well, sleep well, and eat the next generation.
It is not a primitive life now
We are in a civilization society, but we do not know what it is
The other person in the brain is “a rational decision-maker” because it gives the ability not to other animals
We imagine the future
View Large Locations
Long-term planning
rational will deter  takes into account all
Let’s do what you should do for yourself
It makes sense to do things that are easy and fun. Time of childbirth, sleep, leisure time, etc.
There are overlapping parts for both
There are also opinions
However, it may be reasonable to do things that are difficult and not very fun as a major judgment
In such a case, confrontation occurs
If you are a predecessor, this confrontation always tends to end up with a certain result. You will spend a lot of time in the part shown in orange. It is not reasonable to do, it is easy and fun.
I’m calling this area as a “black playground”
Playground in darkness — where people know well
If you are playing, it is a place to play
The fun in the dark playground is actually not fun it should not be fun in enjoying guilty scared anxiety self-harassment of familiar feelings of pro  
The problem is that in the situation where the monkey is ruded, the procra  is how the blue area is inferior to the comfort, but it is really important to move to the place where the
In fact, there is a guardian angel in the predecessor, and I always watch it. It is also called "Panic Monster"
[Panic Monster] Panic Monsters are sleeping in most cases, but you will lose your eyes when the horrible ending is approaching suddenly   up
What is important is that it is the only fear of monkeys
Thank you very much. I had to talk about TED.
Of course, I answered "I will do"
It was my dream to be able to say "I have done TED talks"
[I have done TED talk] In this excitement, the intelligent decision-maker is aware of another thing
What do you know?
Do you know what will happen in the future?
Let’s take care of your hips now!
Sal answers it " I’m very grateful, but I can’t go to Google Earth. Imagine the underside of India up to 60m above ground and scroll for two and a half hours and go to the upper edge. I wonder if I can catch the image of India well.”
That day has been that
6 Months Become 4 Months Become 2 Months Become 1 Month TED has published a list of 
When I open the page, I saw my face there
Who woke up?
Panic monsters become scaven and the entire system quickly became conf 
Remember that monkeys fear panic monsters, so flee on the tree
Now finally, the rational will deter  is ruded and I was taken to prepare for the lecture
Panic monsters broke out the trajectory of the predecessor You can also explain the behavior of the report over two weeks. One line of the report was not written, but it is a mir -like strong labor  ics that  s up to eight pages overnight.
This is the system of the predecessor who has three characters.
Not clean, but ultimately works
This is a blog 2 years ago
I wrote about the reaction to the blog was amazing
 thousands of emails from all over the world
Nurse Banker Painter Engineer and Indeed many  students
Everyone was writing together " I have the same problem.
However, the lightness of the blog post The weight of the received email was contrasting
It was written with strong irritation on the influence that pro sion has spread to their life. What is the eye of the monkey?
I saw it. How do I make the system work?
Why are they in such a dark state?
The reason is that there are two types of predecessor.
In my example, there was a reply
If there is a trekking, the influence of pro sion will appear in panic monsters for a short period
But there is another type of predecessor, there is no problem
Like an individual venture or an artist In the case of entrepreneurial work In the beginning there is no   because it does not happen anything until it runs on a track
In addition, there are many things that are not useful for things that are important to work.
There is a problem that the mechanism for which the predecessor is difficult to do is only Panic Monster because Panic Monster does not appear in the situation where there is no problem
There is no one to a n, and the influence of pro sion is not limited, and it will continue to pro de forever
Such a long-term predecessor is a short-term prosperity predecessor that is not visible Not to be spoken normally alone will be irritated
Long-term and large misfortune and regret
This is the reason why people wrote an email, and I thought it is the reason for such a bad situation.
Not being canned in any project
Long-term pro   makes your life feel like a viewer
Their irritation is not something that can’t realize a dream, it’s something that can’t even start chasing a dream
I’m reading such a mail, and I’m sure I don’t have anyone who is not a predecessor.
It’s a place where everyone is waiting.
Even if I don’t like mechakucha, I may have a healthy relationship with you, but I don’t mind that the problem of monkeys is the most harassed when you don’t have it.
One last thing you want to show
Life Calendar
Each box is for 90 years of life.
That's not a lot, but we're using it quite a lot.
I think we should try this calendar carefully.
What do you really want to be pronounced? That’s because anyone should be pronounced
You need to be aware of the monkeys you want to compliment immediately
This is our work for everyone
Given that there aren’t so many boxes, this job should be started today
It's not just today
If possible
Not far away
Thank you very much
At that time I was waiting for the last moment of life in the church of Texas, which is spiritual and physical
This is exactly the venue covered with a red rag cloth. Sit shallowly on a broken wooden chair, organ on the left and the saint on the back.
No change
Feelings of s ing tensions Wi  to salvation Sweating palms and sitting behind people who are less interested
December 31, 1999 The night of Christ reign is when I believe that the world ends
That year I was exactly 12 years old.
However, I wanted to complain that the world will end is not unfair, but it is no longer a later festival I was forced to think about future things
Change your mind to the church as far as possible
I forgot the passage of time I prayed for the poor God gave my unfamiliar eyes so that it was no longer desperate
In addition, I was reading and fishing the book that was popular at that time.
I found it in a time sentence when it is fate, if there is a lack of faith, I think that more tragedy is waiting
The challenge im  to me is to control all desires and beat the devil and laziness to win your own unfaith
Let’s believe that it can be difficult for 12 years old
The time is coming soon
23:50
10 minutes left: The clock hands collect us in front of the altar to greet with deep prayer.
All sects meet together
The Holy Squadron remains in the seat and the abdomen - if not, the Bourjoa members will be in the front of the altar
As you know, in the United States, even in the recession of Christ is the VIP seat
(Applause) Right behind the VIP is the elderly people who have been working in the cotton field in the sunshine of East Texas. Their back of their young days is the skin without wrinkles and sunburn, but the earth itself is the people who have been backed with such a dream as if they walked in another life.
They are the main role for me
They have devoted all of their lives to this moment, and the predecessors of the refugees were looking forward to the arrival of the end of the day, starting at 4 o'clock.
Like my grandmother that grandmother also heads in front of the altar Her back I was convinced that the grandmother always goes to heaven
If you hold her hand during prayer, I thought that it would be like to be with you.
Hands Close Eyes Clear Ear Prayer
Your voice is rough
Prayer to respond to it will be shouted to the church
The mel  of the keyboard increases the momentum
The enthusiasm of the church
Don't leave your grandmother's hands again once
Before the fear of fate escaped to the darkness of the back of the eyelid
And then, the voice of the “Amen”
Close
Clock Needle
Already past the time of fate
The savior didn’t appear and I saw their things that would be disappointed while swimming in the eyes, because they closed their eyes too deep and long.
I was so painful in my chest
They were deceived and I was one of them
I've been praying, I don't neglect my efforts to be supreme
I believed that I had experience twice as much as once again.
That's true
Peter Jennings celebrates the opening of the new century. The news was flowing around the world.
The bizarre thoughts of the time revives the back of the brain.
This flash was too bad and cruel
But still I didn’t stop doing what I believe
The answer is not one faith
My answer was wrong the problem itself was wrong is the belief that it faces the absurd
“Faith” is a frozen winter mountain with no movements, with a new sunshine.
I’m looking back to the night that the savior didn’t come to me. I’m looking back at the moment I’ve lost something that I believed in, even if it wasn’t a lie, it’s not true.
There are many people who celebrated the moment of 2000 in a totally different way, and there will be a place at the end of the course similar to that I followed.
I stretched my hands to grab something that can be believed
18 years old I enrolled in Yale University and it was seen in Brooklyn Oak Cliff and was a great opportunity to deter  all the dark past and lost dreams and hopes that I thought at that time
But during the winter vacation I was in the state of depression on the floor of the house. Both hands were tied backward and the 盗ef was on my head and I finally noticed that education is not able to save me
2008 I was a company called Lehman Brothers, seeking for the next salvation
Previously   rushed to call the house no more money
However, even the central part of the financial, I had a sound in front of me. Even the business I had seen
I don’t give up my work as a youth staff in Washington. I’ll hear the voice from the state of Illinois shouted to the voice. “Time comes” “Changes are coming to America.”
However, parliament was conf . The state drew hope rather, and the "change" became aク that could not laugh. Even if the politics were relapsed, nothing happened.
I was named American Dream. In that altar, I certainly sweared Loyalty. I got to the god of capitalism.
日付 the changing of the date at that time I have opened my eyes and really did not have God
That night and I decided to face again rather than brave, but I had no longer left to me if I believe or believe that I would die
Then I walked to the next holy placeビジネス Business School because I knew that it was not sweet at this time for a soundly stretched relief
It is not enough effort.
The winter of theケン Cambridge was still awkward, but it was a buzzing party with three friends in the corner where the excitement is not rising. If it is young people, it was a young, deceased topic that everyone has experience.
I didn’t have to decide where to go
But in the novel of Jacques Kelak, I was taken out of the “get off at night” to know what is happening in this country we left
There were many voices that were unob sive, and the voice was very good.
The summer of 2013 The 8000 miles of the American tour began. Montana’s meadow, the ruins of Detroit and the New Orleans swamps.
It was rather innovative to me who was trained in the highest school of capitalism
MBAs Across America
How greedy our generation is for purposes and meaning
We noticed that the wave of the waves. We need a little more support for many entrepreneurs who have not seen people.
We finally noticed, and honestly, another important thing is that I made an effort to make waves.
One of the social enterprises is the s ing comfort of the country that seems to be broken. One can stand up again. There was a certain idea that even one person seems to be.
But this journey of evangelism led me to a new gospel and that is why I am here today
About a year ago from now is an evening event I was at the New York Museum of Natural History andビジネス Business School that is a gathering of students
Under the 身ale Rep  suspended on the ceiling, we were able to comm rate the spirit of social contribution and the時代の of the window.
It was a prideful space where people gather there and their assets exceed $50 billion.
See the results we have accomplished
But that’s not the end of that two days later I went to Harム area and used to be a place where it was used to sit in a corner of the farm and come to the farm every day to talk about children from a man called Tony
It is a story of such children who live a life lowering the poverty line
It’s because they’re not stealing at homeless shelter
"Har  Grown" Tony's program named so, the child will come to seek one meal in a day
After 20 years of taxi driver, Tony started its program with a breakdown of を
He does not pay because he was in trouble with money while the activity spreads
He said he is going toが any straw
And I decided to be that straw
Returning path The dull sound in the back of the chest just tears flowed
It was too unknown under the roof that the  ale replica floated $50 billion people gather 2 days after aブロックaction of 50 blocks under the sky in the north, a man was forced to prepare a child's meal for a child
It's not 平ed by 平ptom. It's not 憐憫ptom to子er or homeless child.
I was just a king country with kidney disease before the fact that I was a diを device
My story tells me that even if you don’t have a shoe, it’s for those who don’t want to walk around. I’ve ever seen Harム, Apalachia and New Orleans to deliver effective assistance to the affected areas. My voice was a schoolless and solid voice that I had to deliver.
I was completely embarrassed and remembered Peter Jennings' new century is repeatedly deceived
Comment
But this time I myself was a false savior. I believed that the world was over, and the night I had gone far away from that altar. The thing that suffered was compensated to God, and the word of God is all. The verse is true.
From the world that I believed, after a long way, it stands at the start point
The age of our lives is not the age of unfaith. We believe that we don’t take the past rather
Brené Brown may have found her word Tony Robins
“The New Yorker”ビジネス Business Review
There should be people who believe in them. But now at the church of TED we want to believe that we don’t give prayer.
We want our leaders to solve all the challenges.
It is believed that suffering is necessary in God called capitalism.
However, when you neglect to suspect a single element of the foundation that is believed is feared of揺king from the foundation, the human sacrifice that occurs is overlooked
If something you should not accept is your obstruction, it is time to stop and redo
Creativity and innovation The Gospel that is responsible for society, environment and economy is not my area
You are not trying to spread the gospel with something in fact
The existence of the gospel of doubt I am here
This gospel is not saying to stop believing. Just ask a new attitude. The answer is not one thought
Accepting errors so far The question itself is also a mistake that leave a place to acknowledge the negligence
This gospel of doubt suggests that you could be mistaken in this space
The question of why is the gospel
What is the need for people to suffer at all?
MBAs Across America
Reduce organizational staff, stop new adoption and share our new business model so that people who need it can be used freely
The question of why asked me that people im  the role of the rescuer was abandoned because our life is too short
This gospel of doubt gives you hope even when it seems to be disappointed. You should illuminate the future. Even if you are suffering and  cy, the blind-purpose faith is not drowning in the stopping thinking—the inner voice of the question is small and slight, but the light shines dark.
Screaming or just simplicity to make a voice "There should be another way"
Thank you very much

I have read the writings that I have written here and started this study
1st – The young labor force, water, land and the future were not in Japanese agriculture. At that time, I was headed to [South Soma] in the north of Fukushima.
Because the land has been contaminated, children have moved to Sendai and Tokyo Japan has already been relying on importing 70% of food.
Food problems are not limited to Japan
The population involved in agriculture is 2%
2% of all countries are limited
50% of African population is under 18 years old
80% of them don’t want to be farmers
Because agriculture is heavy labor

So how can you build a platform that stimulates youth?
New tractor introduction!
This is the combine that I gave
How many years ago I went to daily necessities stores and DIY stores
I started to make something strange. I tried to dance to the plant. When I connected the plant to the computer, I was all dead.
I couldn't wither.
One of the most intimate relationships in my life is that it began to understand the word of the plant
I want to grow more
They said, “Ooy!
There is only an old electric laboratory where no one enters here
What do you think?
I built a farm in MIT Media Lab with my colleagues. This place has been known as a digital life research laboratory, not just in the past
This space of about 6 square meters produced enough food for three hundred people per month
There are many interesting technologies that are introduced.
What is the most interesting thing?
Beautiful white root dark green vegetables and monthly mowing
Is this a new type of cafe?
New Retail Experience
New Grocery Store
One thing that can be said is that it is the first case to pick something from the root in the media lab.
There are salads in the bag, but there is no problem.
But what happens if you think that there is an expert data scientist in image processing and a researcher in robots and picks something from the roots.
Before we bring the plant outside, we first try to put it in the lab. Why don’t we don’t want to throw it away?
My tongue has changed – I try it first. I don’t want people to eat until I see it is a decent food.
Lettuce pH can be understood by error within 0.1.
“Oh, it’s PH6.1. I can’t eat it today.”
Today's lettuce was really sweet
The plant is exposed to stress, and it is very sweet because the chemical reaction occurs internally. “I don’t want to die.”
The scream of such a plant is my favorite very sweet taste
Science and technology trans ed to plant physiology...
I thought I would like to experiment with this experiment.
What's produced is an interest so I thought about a lab that can be delivered anywhere
I made it first
There is my lab on the front side of the media lab. About 30センサー per plant are installed
If you know about genome and genetic engineering, this is the so-called ノーome
Origin of the word "現象omena"
For example, "Mexico strawberry is like" is actually a strawberry that grows under the climate that grows up to your taste.
So, if you create the climate with a program, programming is a combination of carbon dioxide and oxygen as a recipe, such as plant flavor,分rition size, shape, color and gum.
This requires data and has a lot ofセンサー to know the situation. I think about indoor horticulture plants. I’m very sad to know this. “Why do you die? Talk to me.”
Farmers predict growth of plants Greatest Eyes Flowering around the late 60s to 70s

I don’t think people are indifferent at least because that’s why
I think that vision is missing to politicians. It is a vision that adapts to the changing global era of international policy made over 50 years ago.
So I would like to throw two very fundamental questions.
Why is the current system not working?
How can I redo this?
The modern 制度 system was created by the people during World War II.
The purpose of the first is to give people a place where they can live safely with dignity until return.
It was made to prepare for the situation as seen in Syria today
International agreement signed between governments in 147 countries In 1951, “Convention on the Status of Contemporary Art” and “International Organization” were accepted through the United Nations Civil Engineering High Commissioner’s Office.
But today this system is not working
Theoretically, you have the right to ask for a dead
In reality, our immigration policy is blocking safety
Theoretically, you have the right to ask for an assimilation to the evacuation destination.
In reality, it is almost  and it is stuck
Theory is responsible for the global environment.
In reality, the country acent to the conflict area is attracting the overwhelming majority of global business models
The system is not working because the rule is not
It is necessary to rethink it because it does not apply properly to the changing world
What is the actual system of the current program?
Let's explain a little
However, not the top-down point of view from the system side
First imagine a Syrian woman
Contact Us
A woman who symbolizes a lot of people in the region
Amirah is the world’s 25% of the city’s dinosaurs are women with children because the city’s living is like this. As you can see, the city of Amirah Homs was once a beautiful and historical city, but now it is buried in bles.
It is not a situation to return
However, there is no way to reside in the third country because it is like a lottery, and only 1% of the world's cultural heritage
So Amiramira and his family are almost obsessed with an impossible choice
There are only three basic options
First of all, take the family and enter the camp
There is no support in the future of Amirami and his family.
Spring camp is a wilderness and unhaired land—many are in the desert
At night at night at the Catalina camp, you can hear the sound of bullets at the border with Syria.
Economic activities have経済s
The quality of education is not good
And around the world About 80% of the camping camping収容s are at least 5 years
That’s why it’s only 9%.
Next, there are options to aim for the urban area, such as Amman and Bay Route in neighboring countries
This is the choice of Syrian refugees
However, there is also a big challenge
  usually does not have labor rights in such urban areas
I can't receive assistance
In this case Amirah and his family had to save up to that, and almost nothing left there.
Third Choice—Syrians choose this
For the family seeking a handful of hope to bet a life, it is a phenomenon that is seen in Europe today aiming at another country for a very dangerous journey
This is one of the most difficult choices around the world. There are only three choices for camping, urban poverty and dangerous travel.
For you, this is an international business model.
But I think this is only a illusion
I think there is a room for rethinking
道 is limited to these options, but it’s a mistake because there’s only one way to choose the alphabet in our head
The politicians believe that problems are “zero-sam”—that is, if something is for you, it will be burdened by citizens
We tend to think that it is a burden of society as a common premise
Conversely, there is a way to contribute to society
What I want to say is that there is a way for everyone to benefit while spreading the width of the choice of the country of acceptance and community our society and ourselves
I think that you can change the way of thinking about your business in four ways to talk from now
This is a method that uses globalization, liquidity, and opportunities for the market to influence all four.
The first idea is the environmental development for your business. It starts with basic recognition. It is the same human as everyone, and it is just placed in an unusual situation.
I started investigating in Uganda with my colleague at Oxford University
I chose Uganda because it is the world's leading country of acceptance.
It is because we have a very good policy
 other countries around the world Uganda gave economic opportunities to Jordan
I gave you the right to work and freedom of movement
This is a surprising outcome for both your business and your residence.
In the capital city of Kampala, 21% of the   had a business hired workers 40% of the people hired were the citizens of the country of acceptance
In other words, you have hired the people of the country that you accept
A great example of an active personal business was found even in a recent camp
For example, in the residence of Nakivale, Congo people are involved in buying and selling digital music
One Rwanda business launched was to provide computer games for adolescents with recycled機 and TV
In spite of the toughest environment, innovative initiatives will be carried out. This photo is Demoky’s Congo
When I arrived in the residence district, I had almost no sentences, but I was interested in video creators
He opened a community radio station with friends and colleagues and borrowed a video camera to make video.
Two documentary films were co-pro  by my team and succeeded in business with a small original
We should decide our response to your business by reflecting this case.
You need to provide opportunities to be influenced as humans rather than inevitably depending on humanitarian support.
Of course, clothing, duvet, sleeping places, food, etc. are all important in emergency situations, but you need to look ahead
Opportunities such as communication, power, education, labor rights and access to capital and banks
You must provide the benefits of the world economy is common for you and you should be able to do so
The second is an idea about the economic zone
Unfortunately, not all of the world’s countries accept policies like Uganda
Most countries don’t welcome you in a way like Uganda
However, the practical application that can be adopted is important
Last April I went to Portland with a co-worker development economist Paul Corier during my stay and discussed with international communities and emerging governments in a manner in line with the domestic development strategy of Jordan
I thought about how to give Syria a job in an idea about the economy area I was looking for the possibility to do with the リア of the リア of the リア of the   of the   of the   of the   of the  
83,000 people live from Zatari Creek camp in just 15 minutes Economic area King Hussein Bin Tarall Development area
The government of the city invests more than 1 million dollars and connects this area to the power supply network and the road network, but two missing labor force and in-house investment
Where can I work? I don’t  ped into camps. I want to feed my family through vocational training, and then return to Syria.
This is because it is necessary to develop domestic manufacturing as a medium-income country.
It is also beneficial for you, but it also contributes to Syria reconstruction after a dispute. Both have built Syria and become the best human resource— It is based on recognition that it is necessary to protect and protect your skin.
This proposal was published in the political magazine "Forrin Afairs"
The Eyes of King Abdra
2 weeks ago at the Syria Support Conference held in London this summer has been announced
(Applause) The third idea that you want to propose is a matching system between the country and the country. It is a good result such as this photograph, Syrian singer is selfie with Prime Minister Angela Merkel
It is impossible to get everyone even while listening to the voice of the singer.
The concept of matching theory developed by ALBIN ROTH is to determine the final combination by the selection of parties
Will Jones and Alex Titerboim, colleagues, have explored how to apply this concept to your business. They are the way to find the destination you want to visit in the desired order. At the same time, they are also the type of orientation that you want to accept in the country.
Of course, you should also consider elements such as diversity and vulnerability to the conditions of the acceptance frame, but it should be considered as a way to increase the matching rate.
The concept of matching is well- , for example, for students, for college acceptance, for kidney donors and patients. It also contains algorithms used on dating sites.
How do you incorporate this to expand your choice?
One of the major challenges that can be used on a domestic scale is to convince the local community to accept it.
Currently, for example, in my country, I often do a 鹿ian to send a farmer to the city.
If you match the market, you can meet the desires of both parties and hear the needs and requests from the residents of the recipient.
The fourth idea is a humanitarian visa
Most of the tragedy and confusion occurring in Europe is completely avoidable
In order to become a dead in Europe, it is necessary to arrive without pre-preparation on the dangerous journey of the example, but why do you need such a trip?
The current era where cheap airlines and consular services are enriched. This trip should be completely unnecessary, but more than 3,000 people died last year.
A simple story If you are allowed to travel normally to Europe and become a dead person, it is avoided. The way to do this is called a humanitarian visa at the embassy or consulate of the neighboring country, you can receive a visa and simply leave your travel expenses on your own and you can travel to Europe by ferry or plane.
1,000 Euro to the islands of Greece
Cheap flights from Bodrum to Frankfurt are €200
It has a great advantage to free such a choice during pregnancy
A lot of life has been lost in the world's sm ling industry itself. Merchant sales are becoming more and more like the Greek islands. Confusion disappears from Europe's first line.
It is not a reasonable measure, but a policy.
This idea is actually in 
Brazil pioneered this approach with more than 2,000 Syrians who got a humanitarian visa and entered Brazil and arrived at the same time they got their status
All Syrian people who use this system have earned their status and have been officially certified.
Historical examples
旅ween 1922 and 1942, Nansen Travel Pass was used as an international  . 450,000 Ascilias, Turkishs, and Chechen moved to Europe and applied for   in other countries in Europe.

The four ideas we talked about now are all the ways to increase the choice of Amir
It’s a way to expand your choice. This is why you don’t have to be limited to the three things you first talked about, so you can get others.
In conclusion, you need to cut a new vision that you do not need to be burdened while expanding your business options.
The idea that the   is inevitably burdened is wrong
Although it is humanitarian obligations,   is a technology, talent and ambitious human. If you provide opportunities, you have the power to contribute to society
In the future, the people who move to the world will not be able to continue
What is happening in Europe lasts for years
  continues to move, and continues to seek a place.に対処するing this situation, we should look for ways to use, rather than a way based on an old theory of humanitarian support or a way of .
I want everyone and politicians to sue this challenge
Thank you very much
I have longed from children to the sea
It’s a wonderful place filled with colors and life like aliens.
Imagine where large sharks dominate food chains, and I thought that graceful turtles swim over coral reefs
I have been devoted to finding a magical place that I dreamed of when I was small, because I moved from a marine biologist to a photographer
As you can see I’ve been exploring the water from a pretty small time
But the first time I dived in the water was about 10 years old.
I remember that I was still s ing now. I tried to touch the old cannon on a shallow coral.
And finally I saw the colorful fish that I was in love with the sea
Thomas Peschuck protective activity photographer 40 years I have been living on the earth and I have received a valuable opportunity to explore the wonderful sea for the National Geographic and Save Our Seas Foundation
I’ve been taking anything from a large shark to a cute one that fits in the palm of my hand
A cold Canadian Great Bear Rainforest off the coast, where a very fresh smell of s pted sato whales meet in a place to feed in just 30 cm.
In addition, I have been meeting the place of the auミ turtle in Mozambique 峡it
All people and the sea on the earth have been influenced
And when I was a child, the sea of untouched is becoming more and more difficult to find
  chased and threatened
We have continued to be the main catcher on the earth, but I have gradually witnessed the impact of it.
I got shocked with shocked photos and I had a long time
I’ve come back to the original point though there are advantages in this initiative.
The best way to cause change is to appeal to love
I may be a kind of middleman as a photographer I have hidden under the sea to reveal the entire animal and ecosystem blessed with valuable opportunities
If you don’t know it, you can’t keep it.
It is the power of the photograph of protection activities to reveal the hidden appearance
I visited hundreds of seawater areas, but there are some things that were particularly deeply imp ed
It was about 10 years ago when I first experienced such excitement.
Every June and July A huge group of Iwashi will move to the north Sardin Run
There is a good reason for this
It is because the fast catcher勢ry is sm ly勢ed
In general, dolphins are sorted by multiples, and some eagles are separated from the flock to create a s ical flock called bait ball
I chase fish up to the surface of the sea. This is a living treat.
There is a shark right behind
Many believe that dolphins and sharks are the enemy, but they are actually coexisting in Sardin Run
カ helps sharks feed efficiently
Bate balls without dolphins are more dispersed sharks are included in the so-called sardine donuts full of mouth and nothing
Well I also experience stimulating moments with sharks at Sardin Run and know that they are not baiting me
But in this rough banquet, like any other fish, you can hit or hit with a leek
Moving from the coast of Africa to the east and crossing the vast Indian Ocean, you will be able to reach the Maldives
At the time of the intense southwest Monsoon, Onito Makie comes to a very small place of the Baa Atoll called Hanifal. Most of the crustaceans are smaller than the eyes of the man.
If there is a mura in the place of Plankton, Onito Makii will be feeding alone and again and again to make the back air return that way chasing his tail is similar to the puppies
However, if the plankton is concentrated in one place, the rays are in series and make a long chain for the bait. Even if the rays near the beginning miss a little plankton, then the rays will be sw ed.
As the value of Plankton increases, Ay swims to be closer to each other This unique action is called a 行動 feeding
A is a solid braid that turns into a c  of several hierarchies. We make a plankton vortex and collect it into a cave-like mouth.
A group of hundreds of Ai diving experience is really something you want to forget
When taken for the first time in Hanifal, it was protected and threatened by development
By working with NGOs like Manta Trust, my photos have finally helped Hanifal become a marine protected area
The fishermen of neighboring islands used to make traditional drums with the skin of A.
Now they have more enthusiasm protection than anyone else, thanks to Ay, at Maldives $8 million annually
I always went back to the past and I wanted to go to the times that the map was almost blank or "there is a   here"
It was the most close to the sea of such times as the west side of the Indian Ocean.
A short distance away from the sea traffic route and the fishing fleet. If you dive into such a sea, you can feel the past sea.
Most people have never heard of the small coral reefs of the Mozambique 峡it called Bappa da India
The coral reef is a wall-proofed reef lake inside has become a living place for galapagos sharks
This shark is not very timid even during the day
I had a lot of thought that I would be more bold when I was at night
Have you ever encountered so many sharks in one coral dewhead?
By capturing and sharing such moments, I will remember why I have progressed to this road.
This year’s work of “National Geographic” at Baha California Peninsula
サンed half of the Pacific side of the peninsula, there is San Iナcio Church, which is important as a habitat of Kokujira
This coast is a huge kill for 100 years where more than 20,000 coke whales were killed and only hundreds survived
Now, the descendants of the whales push their children to the sea and play and interact with us.
This species really made a remarkable revival
On the other side of the peninsula there is a quiet fisherman town called Cabo Pulmo
There were decades of turbulence in the state of collapse
In 1995, local fishermen complained to specify the sea as marine reserve
What happened after that was a mir 
In 2005, the number of employees has been recovered unheardly even though it has only been 10 years since it started protection
Let's go with your own eyes
Suck the breath and dive deep into the most d  waters I have encountered Let's swim
Everyone can make hope
I want to tell you that it is not too late to protect our sea through my photos
I want to focus on natural resilience, especially when I had 73 billion people
My wish is to take a picture that is like a sampling that shows coexistence with the sea.
I hope that it will be a daily event
In order to survive in my profession, I must be aしようten house that I can not do
I always work under the assumption that a wonderful photo like a change is just around the corners of it or beyond the corals there.
I moved to Harare 1985 The core of the medical policy of Zimbabwe was social justice
In the end of the long independent war, the new government immediately政策d social policy and became free of basic medical services, primary education, etc.
A significant increase in regional medical facilities, and approximately 80% of the people reached medical facilities within a 2-minute walk.
In 1980, the vaccination rate of children in Japan was 25%.
Only 10 years after 1990 reached 80%
I really enjoyed what is involved in this big reform
The excitement and bonds of people were visible
Local very competent Scientists, doctors, activists and shoulders I felt part of the public health exercise that goes the tip of the world as well as the independent movement of Africa
But there was a horrible problem
Year I arrived   Zimbabwe first AIDS cases reported
In the early 80s, I had a training doctor, but I had a few AIDS patients at the Harム General Hospital, but I didn’t imagine anything about what was going on to Africa.
About 2% of HIV infection rate
It was a situation in which one of the four adults was in ed by me 17 years away from Harare
Until the mid 90s, I announced that it is HIV-positive to hundreds of people who work
Experience death of colleagues and friends The death of students and patients was also noticed
I started a所 with my colleagues.
How to use condom
性 sexual education in schools and workplaces
We conduct case studies, and coach in ious partners to prevent them.
It was hard to know that I was doing my best at that time.
I was going to do excellent treatment. It was rough if it seems now
However, there was no activity to ask for structural reform
Mr. Kofi Anang, former Secretary-General of the United Nations, re tantly his own defence to slaughter Rwanda
He was the Secretary-General of UN PKO in 1994
In the 10th anniversary of slaughter, I looked back at the time. “I was convinced that I was doing my best at that time, but I noticed that slaughter was happening and I realized that there was something to do more that I could do. I heard that I had to hear a bell and get cooperation.”
Aids’ epidemic was ignored in the medical world and in the world Health Organization’s predictions, it is not only me that I have been regretting that 3,900 million people had lost their lives in AIDS.
However, while staying in Zimbabwe, I did not think of myself in a position or political position to advocate change
As a ian and as an epidemiological researcher,
In my heart, my role is to look at the patient’s troubles and investigate the patterns of infection of the residents. I thought it would be better to understand the spread of this virus.
Aids development and death biased to the social weakness
60% of pregnant women were HIV-positive in the garden of the enclosed era than any modern company organization.
Because of in ed, it is not true that the person is not true. Rather, I taught that the culture of male superiority, forced seasonal labor and colonial products
The white layer had almost no damage
As a medical professional we were so painless to use condom to alter individual behavior and to reduce opponents with sexual negotiating and only to appeal
The rate of infection was just rising. The薬eutic drug was developed in the West — the most effective AIDS treatment nowadays, but it was not reachable for any public sector in Africa.
I was silent, the drug that saves life was not able to get equal, but also the underlying of AIDS-style system of politics and economics — there was nothing to say about the mechanism that caused massive infections so far
I justified my silence, saying to myself, “I am not the residents of this country and I can’t be able to do a good job that can be left out of the country if I ring a bell, and the patient will not be able to see the necessary research will be impossible.”
So it was silenced not to mention the policy of the time on the government's AIDS
I didn’t claim my concern enough
I think many doctors and healthcare professionals didn’t have a degradation to me
Promise with doctors and patients The oath of Hippocrates and its separate edition defines the関係 of relationships between doctors and patients.
I did whatever I can do to myself I did not leave alone for my patients
However, I noticed that this trend reflects the distortion of society. Not only does it depend on the biological cause, but it was understood that the weakness is pronounced as a habit of alienating and discriminating and discriminating.
Aids apply to this
It was the scent of the tree
The humanitarians call this “structured  ence” because the inequality is embedded in the political and economic structure of our society, because it is often invisible to people with privileges and power. Death, suffering, and disease in young age are  ent
If you want to be a little more useful for the patient, you must not be neglected by such social complaints.
Calling attention is the first step to function public health. By doing so, we collect collaborators and open the road together to make a true change.
So I'm not silent
I'm talking about a lot of things. Even if the listener feels uncomfortable, I'm talking even when I'm not curious.
In many cases, it should be no longer possible in this country, such as personality disparities and systematic personality discri . Things
Because it exists, as a substitute, people have lost their lives without fulfilling their lifetime
So you should ring a bell—a type of human discri  in medical care in the United States, which is currently underway, institutional and interpersonal  ence—in the 色ence that people of colored people have left a painful legacy in the United States 250 years saddle system, 90 years gym 奴隷 system, and 60 years of imper ed equality, which is the center of my mission as the Department of Health.
In New York City, young men under 65 are 50% higher than white men
In 2012, fertility m ality in black women had more than 10 times of white women
The infant survival rate has been dramatically improved, but black infants still have a risk of dying in the first year of life near three times of white infants
New York
Similar statistics are found anywhere in the US
According to the analysis of the Brooklyn New York Times, a total of 1.5 million black men are not enough.
According to the article Today 25 to 54 years old black men more than one person per 6 seems to have disappeared from everyday whether they died during prison or young
There is a serious insufficiency that is happening only in young black men #BlackLivesMatter is a  ence that is the subject of protest
However, it should be remembered that the incidence of common diseases and their endings – heart disease, cancer, diabetes, AIDS, etc. It is a disease that leads to slow death. In the youth caused by these diseases, black is even lost.
#BlackLivesMatter exercise began when I remembered repentance and a  because in the medical world it has been avoided even using the word “humanized discri ” in children and work
Every time I use this word, I was thinking about it.
I have been obsessed with the corpse of white clothing, and most people in the medical field were intercepted without anything. I still have a discri  of the disease and the m ality.
In today’s trend toward individualized medicine and precision medicine, we seek more personalized treatments and pursue biological and hereditary research to see the overall picture of the world, and the environment of the global environment—the environment of people living, growing, working, and love is the most impact on people’s health.
As a health care professional, we are witnessing unfairness even in診療s and implants in daily work. Homeless people can’t do as directed by doctors because they have more priority. Transgender young people think of suicide is because of less emotional society. Single mothers take responsibility for the health of children.
The doctor’s role as a health care professional is not only to visit patients, but also to call attention to become a leading person seeking change
The doctor is justified thanks to its social status There is a considerable weight in the speech should not waste it
I repented that I did not raise my voice in Zimbabwe I sweared myself as a Director of the City Health Bureau of New York. I use the opportunity as much as possible to alert you and call cooperation in improving medical disparities
We also stand against humanity discri . Please lend your hand when you stand against gender discri . I will also force you any other form of imbalance.
It is time to raise voice as a group for structural impairment.
No need to know all the answers to call a change
Just need 
The health and well-being of our patients
I'd like to ask for a message. Is there a person who has canceled my friend on Facebook? This is because of the reason that someone has made some unpleasant statements about politics, religion, parenting and food.
If you don’t want to talk, do you have at least one person to avoid?
In the past, it was good to talk about the weather and health according to the words of Professor Guins of My Fair Lady.
In this page, there are climate change and anti-vaccination — it is no longer a safe topic
There is a possibility of developing any conversation in the world we live in the controversy The politician can not talk to each other Even a really trivial problem  endously, there are people who discuss the opposite
The study of 10,000 American adults has now seen that people are confronted in the past.
We don’t try to聞く and don’t have ears
And we are determined based on what we already believe in where we live and who we are married and who we are friends.
This also means you don’t have ears to hear
I need a balance of speaking and listening, but we lost that balance somewhere
Technology Development
Your mobile phone is still in hand.
According to the Pyu Research Institute, one- rd of teenagers send more than 100 messages per day
Most of them are more likely to beメッセed rather than talking to face
Magazine "Atlantic"
Paul Bernwell has an interesting article written by high school teachers
He gave students a communication issue
I wanted to teach how to talk about specific subjects without using notes
He writes this “I noticed—”
"The ability of conversation is the teacher teaches, and the most overlooked skill is
The students are interacting with ideas and others through the screen for hours, but there are few opportunities to スキル interpersonal skills
It may sound strange, but we should ask ourselves. In the 21st century, there will be something important than the ability to speak confidently in the skill.
I'm talking to work Nobel Prizewinners Truck Drivers Millionaires Kindergarten Teachers National首
Talk to people who like and don’t like
Personally speaking with people who have no opinion at all
You can still have great conversations with them
We will tell you how to talk and how to hear in the next 10 minutes
I have heard a lot about the secrets of the conversation. Looking at the opponent's eyes, or thinking about the topic of interest in the previous one. I look at the opponent and hit the hammer, smile or repeat the opponent's words or summarize it.
Don’t forget about it.
Not useful
You don’t have to learn how to show it to the wind you hear. If you hear it, you should
(Applause) I use the skills as a professional interviewer as it is, even in everyday life
We will teach you the technology of the interview, but it will help you to improve your conversation. Don’t waste time with each other and don’t boring Learn how to talk that won’t hurt your opponent
Everyone has a wonderful conversation
Know what you like
It is a conversation that you feel when you get a sense of understanding that you can have a real connection with someone who is in ring to talk
There is no reason why most of the conversation should not be such
Let’s look at the basic rules of 10 conversations together, even one of them will be able to enjoy better conversations
Part 1: Don’t “do”
Not only does it stop the key of your phone, tablet, or car
It is that you and your mind are there
I want to be at that moment
Don’t think about the theory with the boss
Don’t think what to eat
If you want to get out of the conversation, please go out, but don’t join only half.
Part 2: Never Talk One-Stop
If you want to claim your opinions without reactions, discussions, rebellions, or growth opportunities, write a blog
It is because I don’t want to go out to my program because I don’t want to stop
If you are conservative, you don’t like obama, foodstamp or abortion
If you are aベラeral family, you will be disliked by large banks, petroleum companies and Dick Cheiny.
I know what to say
I don't want to be like that.
You need to face conversations with the attitude that you should learn something
The famous Theピist M. Scott Peck says, “I need to put myself on a side to really hear.”
This means you need to put your opinion on the side when
“I feel that it is accepted, I don’t feel that the speaker is unprotected, so I can show it to the depth of my mind.”
Repetition Let's learn
Bill Nai says: “Everyone who meets knows what they don’t know”
My name is “ Anyone Professional
Part 3: Asking questions for free answers
Find journalists
When/Where/Who/What/Why/How to ask questions
Simply return a simple answer even if you have a complex question
If you are afraid of it,
respond to the most impressive words in the question. In this case, the answer is "Yes" or "No"
“I was angry?”
Let's explain to the other person because it is beyond know
“What was it?”
How did you feel?
That way, the opponent must stand and think and will return much interesting answers
Part 4: Making the Flow
The thoughts on the head must be left out
Well, you’ve heard of this interview. After a few minutes of talking to a guest, it’s like you’ve answered the question you’re looking for.
The moderator has stopped listening two minutes ago. I decided to think of something みな questions.
We do the same thing at all
When I sit with someone, I remember that I came to the actor Hue Jackman at a coffee shop
and stop listening
Talks and ideas can float on your head
Let's make it disappear with just floating
“If you don’t know, let’s say you don’t know.”
People who appear on the radio, especially in the case of NPR, I know that the story remains in the record, so I will be careful when I say that I am a specialist of something.
Please be careful.
Don't worry about talking
Part 6: Don’t see your opponent’s experience as you like?
When the other party is talking about the family, it is not to bring out the story that he died
When the other party is talking about troubles in the company, it is not to say what your work is
Your experience is completely different
All experience is individual
What’s more important is that you don’t know about yourself
On that occasion how wonderful you have to show how hard you are
Steveon Hawking asked IQ and answered this question: “Now I’m proud of my IQ.”
Conversation is self-promotion not an opportunity [Conversation in the 21st century]
“How about today’s tone?” “Let’s look at the blog!” Part 7 “What do you say about the same thing over and over?”
It is good to wear, but everyone is good to do
In particular, in conversations with children in the workplace, the word is changed and repeated to show that their claims are correct.
do not
Part 8: “I don’t know the fine things.”
Saying frankly, the opponent does not care about the fine details like the year, name, and date.
The other party is not interested about you
What is the common thing for you?
So let's forget the details
That 9 This is not the last but the most important thing
"Listening"
I don’t know how many 人がs I said this point, but listening is the most important skill that anyone can stretch.
The word of the Buddha is a little rephrasing, but "when the mouth is open, I can't learn anything."
President Karvin Kurridge, who is unfamiliar, says, “There are no people who have heard of it.”
  Do you want to hear each other?
One is to talk rather than listening
If you are talking, you have the right to lead
You don't have to ask
Attention
Enhance your identity
However, there are other reasons to be careful
話すaking speed is 225 words per minute but we can hear up to 500 words per minute
Our consciousness is to fill 275 words of extra power
Be careful with your opponents is sure you need an effort and energy, but if you can’t do that, you shouldn’t be talking
Just screaming unrelated words in the same place
I have to ask each other
Writer Steven Kovie speaks splendid
"Many people do not listen to understand
I'm asking to answer
There is another rule that #10 is “concise”
[My sister said, "Good conversation is like a mini skirt that is short enough to be interested, but it should be as long as possible to cover the eagerness"] (Applause) You can summarize everything that has been stated to one thing "What is interested in opponents"
I grew up with my grandfather very famous, and I'm a deter  at my home
Talking with my grandparents, I heard that after many people come back, my mother said, “Who are you?”
She became American
That person Sacramento
She has won the Puriー Prize and he is a Russian ballet dancer
That’s why I have something hidden by anyone.
Believe This is what I think is a good host
I hope that I can close my mouth as much as I can. I have never done so.
Please do the same thing
Talking with people, listening, and what’s more important is to be sensible
Thank you for your hearing
Hello!
Matthew Williams
The medal of the 3rd sports competition is held in the national tournament of Canada.
(Applause) 5 days a weekバスケットボール and speed skating exercises top class coaches and advisors of スケート performances support the best in the game
By the way this is all the special Olympics
Do you hear it and see my results?
The world doesn’t necessarily mean a champion
People who want to try until recently were evacuated.
In 1968, the special Olympics changed greatly, but in many cases, people with intellectual disabilities are invisible to the wide world
I don’t think it’s bad to use different  in front of you.
I use the word "wisdom delay" congratulationally
That’s why we don’t think about how much your business or your friends can hurt.
Please do not think that you are here as a subject of sorrow
This is because there is still a serious problem for the intellectual disability.
Did you know that there was a world tournament this year?
This page was one of the six hundred people with intellectual disabilities. Players from 165 countries came to LA and competed.
More than 60,000 audiences were watching the opening ceremony TSN and ESPN were broadcast live
I didn’t know the tournament.
What do you think when you see someone you like?
Is it a challenge to everyone?
Special Olympics transforms the values of all those who watch and self identity of athletes with intellectual disabilities
For those who don’t know what special Olympics is for athletes with intellectual disabilities
Paralympic and Olympic are different
High-level sports are held for intellectual disabilities throughout the year.
This has changed the life of many people.
The eyes of the world have changed.
This page is born of epile  and intellectual disorders
I had a hockey from a young age to 12
As you grow, it was difficult to go about everyone.
I was completely away from the sport for a while and my friends were not too much and I felt left behind
People with intellectual disabilities were hidden from society
I didn’t think no one is a valuable member of society.
In the 1960s Dr. Frank Hayden, a scientist at the University of Toronto, expressed the influence of regular exercise on intellectual disabilities
The conclusion that Dr. Hayden and other researchers have given by strictly scientific methods is: “It is only because there is a lack of opportunity to participate in exercise that is low in physical disabilities.”
For people with intellectual disabilities, it is beneficial to participate in sports programs and sports
The believers were not too much, but the pioneers – Dr Hayden and the founder of the Special Olympics – Yunis Kennedy Shriver did not give up and the players also proved that they were right.
(Applause) I was anxious before participating in the Special Olympics because I was young and I was not confident and I was not a friend
But when I went, everyone encouraged me and supported me, so I did not care about the eyes of people and I was like myself.
Now I am a basketball and speed skater. I have participated in the state and national competitions and I participated in the summer world tournament in LA LA. Buske Team
(Applause)話を is one of the world’s more than 450,000 athletes who have heard a lot of similar stories
Being a Special Olympics player makes us proud and dignity
Special Olympics meets important health needs for athletes
According to this page, the average life span of men with intellectual disabilities is 13 years shorter than normal women 20 years shorter
But you can keep your health by moving your body with special Olympics.
Also, coaches will teach you about rition and health
Special Olympics offers free medical checkups. It is difficult to communicate with doctors or difficult to reach medical care.
Team Canada played against Nigerian busque team at the 2015 Summer World Congress
On the day before the game, the Nigeria team received a health check-up conducted at the venue 7 of the 10 members listened to the hearing aids for free, so the first time I was born I heard the ear clearly.
(Applause) A change occurred to the players.
More live and enjoy the game I was confident that I was able to communicate with the coach and voice
Feelings were also emphasized because the sound of the ball came to be heard and the cheer of the whistle and the fan standing on the stand. It is a sound of nature for everyone.
Special Olympics players
Life outside the stadium will also change
According to the results of this survey, almost half of American adults have no intellectual disabilities. The Americans have 44% of them.
In addition, the number of discri  use of examples is evidence that intellectual disability is still invisible to many people.
Everyone uses it as a casual expression or an unrestricted word
The number of 知恵s last year is over 9 million times, but it is a word that hurts  450s and all over the world - 4 million athletes.
Everyone is not affected by in ts.
John’s fellow Global Messenger John Franklin Stevez wrote a public letter to a political critic who has been discriminating in an example.
If you can't move your mind, please try it.
(Applause) In the summer of 2015, people will see the last day of the weightlifting competition, which is   up for hours.
All Teammates in Standing Up Jackie Barrett "Newfoundland deer" lifted 297kg with a dead lift up 277kg with aスクat - (Applause) Greatly updated the highest record in Special Olympics
Jackie is a record holder of weightlifting in Newfoundland. Not limited to special Olympics.
In LA, he became a big star and ESPN Bureau 記録ed his new record lively, I was imp ed by Jackie's results
50 years ago almost no one thought that intellectual disability can do that
This year 60,000 spectators filled the famous LA Memorial Coliseum to watch the opening ceremony of the world tournament and to support players from 165 countries around the world.
We have been praised for the hidden existence.
Special Olympics teaches athletes to have confidence and pride
For the people of the world, intellectual disability will pay respect and will teach you
(Applause) Now you have a track record and dream in the competition Blessed with a great coach with respect and dignity Aiming for health and personal trainers than before
(Applause) I’m not already hidden or s rated now I’m doing TED talk
(Applause) The world has changed thanks to the special Olympics, but still the road is far
If you see someone with intellectual disabilities then you want to see the ability of that person
If you look at people who use differentiated words, please tell me how bad words are.
And I want to think about the special Olympics
(Applause) Finally I say only one word
Nelsonラela said “Sports has the power to change the world”
Special Olympics is changing the world. 450,000 athletes are reborn, have confidence, make friends, can not be seen in the eyes of prejudice, taste the mood of the champion, and become a champion.
Thank you very much
Can you hear the name of Alah in Nigeria?
This is the rarest place for me
In the hospital where nurses, doctors, and scientists have been fighting for many years as one of the most horrible human enemies
Lassa virus is similar to Ebola virus
Causes high heat, sometimes deprived of life
But they keep their lives in danger every day and protect their community.
But the most amazing thing I visited there for years ago was that they started singing every day at the歌 first line every morning
Everyone gathers and expresses joy
It shows vitality
For years, we have visited each other and we gather together to make sings. We are really fun to pursue science.
As the situation changes, I think that it will become a very important thing indispensable
March 2014 It changed greatly when Guinea's epidemic was proclaimed
This was the first outbreak in West Africa that occurred near the border of Sierra Leone andベeria
We are afraid
Rassa and Tesla have been more in ed than thought, and I thought it might be possible to reach Kenema someday.
So my team members joined the team of Dr. Hummer Khan. So we prepared a highly sensitive virus RNA detection device, and the Tesla crossed the border to detect when they reach Sierra Leone.
I already used this device for Lassavirus, so I knew the method and the team was very excellent.
They just had to provide a tool and location to inspect Tesla
Sorry, this entry is only available in 日本語.
May 23, 2014 A woman entered the hospital's obstetrics ward and confirmed the first cases of cerola hemorrhage fever in Sierra Leone where the team conducted a viral RNA examination
Their work was派
Imのately determines this case and treats the patient safely.
It may have been stopped to spread infection early
However, the outbreak has already been a few months
Hundreds of cases症 outbreaks before it
When I reached Sierra Leone, I was pushed like a tsunami rather than one case.
We partnered with international communities and health ministry and Kenema’s offices for this in ious disease because there are 31 cases in the next week and 92, then 147 cases – all patients flowed into the マ.
We did 24 hours as much as we can do our best to save our patients, alerts and other simple things
The blood sample of the patient was taken to detect the kerala, of course it was good to dispose.
Instead, the virus was in活d by chemicals and the blood sample was packed into a box.
My team was sent to Boston
And quickly analyzed 99 coronavirus dinom while working on the night and night
Virus Genome is a blue photo
Ginom is for anyone
All the properties of what we make up include a huge amount of information
The result of such work is simple but very powerful
This 99 virus was observed compared compared to the three dinomes previously announced in Guinea and it was cleared that the outbreak began in Guinea months ago. First of all, after in ed with humans, then the infection spreads through humans.
This is a very important thing to clarify how to intervent, but then it is a contact tracking investigation
Virus has confirmed that it is mutated as in ed among humans
It is very important to observe the mutations of this one because diagnostic equipment and vac  treatments are all basically made based on the genome array
International health experts need to implement measures and adjust all previous outcomes
At that time I was working as a scientist. First, I蓄積umulate data in the laboratory for several months and months to carefully analyze data and to announce the papers that were written carefully.
This is the current state of the study of scientists
But you didn’t do that?
My friends were in front and I needed help. And I needed a lot of help.
So what I did first was that after the dynom array has read it soon published on the website
I just sent the data to the world as it is, and said, "Please rent the power"
Help
I was surprised to see that the data was published.
The world’s leading virus tracking team suddenly becomes our companion
I started working with virtually Continued phone and email interaction I thought how to track virus in minutes and stop infection expansion
There are various ways to create a community for those reasons.
When outbreaks begin to spread on a global scale, everyone actively investigated and tried to lend their power
I want everyone to be involved
The ability of people around the world is really wonderful and the Internet connects us.
Imagine more than to avoid seeing each other with threats.
“Let’s solve this together”
The problem was that the data we used was only searched online and it was very limited.
There are so many possibilities in this situation.
In the early days of the in ious diseases of Venema, 106 cartes were gathering, and they decided to release them all over the world.
In our laboratory, we have proven that we can predict the pro   of patients with Tesla with almost 100% accuracy.
I made an app to provide it but the app is effective enough to demonstrate it
106 results were waiting for more data to be released
But I didn't come the data.
Everyone was looking forward to researching each other, but I didn’t use the power of cooperation with silos.
But this is not possible.
Do you think? I think you are
Our lives
Actually a lot of life lost Healthcare affiliates 5 of my important work associates Dr. Bar Fo , Dr. Alex Mogboy, Alice Koboma and Mohamed Fuller
They are five of the many medical professionals who died around Kenema and their surroundings. At that time, the world was waiting for us to work silently and rose.
Ebola bleeding heat is also the same as other human threats.
When we make the wall between each other and fight the virus increases forces
But unlike other natural threats, the fight against Tesla is equal to all of us
We are fighting together
If a person is involved in Tesla, you can not know whether to be transmitted to someone else immediately.
We hope that our lives are equally vulnerable and have the same power of life.
One of the trained病院 students read the book about Sierra Leone. There is a hospital that we work. The name of the city “Kenema” actually means “a river-like clarity that reflects on anyone’s eyes.”
Before knowing it, we always respect the people of Kenema because we shared information and tried to work together in an open environment
It is important
When the outbreak occurred because it is necessary to share information without hiding to both the outside and the surroundings in order to fight it together
This is never the first Ebola epidemic, but not the end. Other than that, there are still many microorganisms, such as Lassa virus, for example.
And then when the epidemic of infection occurs in large cities where millions live
Air-in ed virus may
Willingly the virus may be scattered
This is very horrible, of course, but at the same time, what we have taught us is that we have the technology to beat it and also the ability to respond to it that we win the fight against the virus infection and make it a superior
But it will be possible as far as we work, and let’s do it with joy
In the fight against in ious diseases, Dr. Karn who died and those who lost their lives on the front line they were fighting with us all the time. Let us do this fight with them all the time.
Let the world shine through the world with the cooperation of billions of warm hearts and caring, so that the world is not sprinkled with one virus.
Thank you very much
