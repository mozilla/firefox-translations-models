(Laughter)
The main story is about this woman, Nathalia Repsinski.
He's an paleontologist. He specializes in digging dead bodies of age.
It's called "The Dead Doctor."
(Applause) Latif Nasser:
One day in the summer of 2006, she was at the site of a excavation called the Filessaf Bed.
You might think it's boring, because you just carry your backpack, carry your GPS and your notebook, pick up what looks like fossils, and walk around all day.
(Laughter)
(Laughter)
It was on the ground.
(Laughter)
But then I went back to camp that night...
(Laughter)
Maybe it's because of the preservation, but the more you look at it, the more you look at it, the more you look at it, the more you look at it, the more you look at it.
It was bone.
She's been at this point for over four years, and eventually she's collected 30 pieces of the same bone, most of which are very small.
(Laughter)
(Laughter)
(Laughter)
(Laughter)
(Laughter)
(Laughter)
(Laughter)
(Laughter)
(Laughter)
What if we had a different way of putting things together, different ways to make them different?
(Laughter)
What she found was the phalanx, or leg bone, and it was an even hoof.
But this bone couldn't be a cow or a sheep.
It was too big.
(Laughter)
(Laughter)
She was stuck, and she showed one piece of bone to a colleague in Colorado.
(Laughter)
(Laughter)
It was the same smell that Natalya smelled when she cut off her skull in the creepy autopsy room.
The corrogen plays a role in the bone structure.
It's usually broken down over the years.
And in this case, the climate of the Arctic was stored as a natural refrigerator.
A year or two later, when Natalya attended a school meeting in Brisbane, a colleague of mine, Mike Buckley, was doing a demonstration of a new process called "coragen testing."
Now, if you look at the structure of each animal, each animal has a slightly different structure, and if you can see the features of the missing bone corlagen, you might be able to identify it.
That's why I sent you a piece of bone by delivery.
It's very important. &gt;&gt;Narrator:
(Laughter)
We found a match.
And this is what Natari discovered in the Arctic Circle at an altitude of three and a half million years ago.
It was a camel.
(Laughter)
(Laughter)
But given the size of the bones we found, this camel was 30 percent larger than what it is today.
He was about two and a half feet tall, and he weighed about one ton.
Yes, sir.
Natari found it. It was a giant Arctic camel.
I'm going to talk to you today about the camel, and I'm going to talk about the camel, and I'm going to talk about the camel that lives in East and Central Asia.
And I'm going to show you a picture of a dove in your head, and I'm sure it's a dove camel in the desert -- in the hot desert, in the Middle East, in the Sahara desert -- and you're going to store water in the big backs, and you're going to walk through the dunes on a big, broad foot.
Why did they get to the Arctic Circle in northern Canada?
And I'm going to tell you a little bit about this, but actually, scientists have known this for a long time, even before Natari's discovery.
This is where I was born.
It's been about 45 million years since the advent of the camel, and it's been spread only in North America for almost 40,000 years, and it's probably more than 20 species.
(Laughter)
(Laughter)
Some of them were very long- necked.
(Laughter)
It's about the size of a rabbit, and the early primitive camels were very small and about the size of a rabbit.
It's a rabbit-sized camel, isn't it?
(Laughter)
You wouldn't even recognize it.
I'm going to have a rabbit camel, and I'm going to have a rabbit camel, and I'm going to have a rabbit camel, and I'm going to have a rabbit camel, and I'm going to have a rabbit camel, and I'm going to have a rabbit, and I'm going to have a rabbit, and I'm going to have a camel, and I'm going to have a rabbit, and I'm going to have a rabbit, and I'm going to have a camel, and I'm going to have a rabbit, and I'm going to have a rabbit, and I'm going to have a rabbit, and I'm going to have a rabbit, and I'm going to have a rabbit, and I'm going to have a rabbit, and I'm going to have a camel.
(Laughter)
And then three to seven million years ago, a herd of camels went down into South America, into Rama and Alpaca.
By the end of the last ice age, the North American camel was extinct.
And that's what we've discovered so far, although we can't fully explain what was discovered in the north.
It's the opposite of the Sahara Desert, for example, when it comes to temperature.
It's true, three-and-a-half million years ago, the average temperature was 22 degrees higher than it is today.
And that's why the coniferous forest is spreading, and it might be similar to the Yukon currents and Siberia today.
But even then, the pond would have been frozen for six months in the winter.
There's also a blithe.
There were times when the darkness of night lasted 24 hours.
So, what the hell is the matter with you?
How could a superstar in this Sahara desert survive the Arctic climate?
I think Natari and her fellow scholars have found the answer.
And that's an excellent answer.
What if the characteristics of the camel that we've been thinking of as adapting to places like the Sahara are actually evolved to survive the winter?
What if the broad legs were not meant to walk on the sand, but to walk on the snow like a duck?
I'm surprised I didn't know it, but what if it was helping me survive a half year of low-food winter?
And what if, after a while after crossing the bridge, they were able to use their winter features to create a hot desert environment?
And if you're going to do that, for example, if you're in hot weather, if you store all your fat in one backpack, you don't have to cover the whole body with the fat that acts as insulation.
It'll help you get rid of the fever.
And what was considered to be typical evidence of adapting to the desert by this extraordinary idea is actually evidence that we used to live in the Arctic Circle.
I'm not the first person to tell this story.
And I'm going to tell you a little bit about this, and I'm going to tell you a little bit about this story, and I'm going to tell you a little bit about the wonders of evolutionary biology, and I'm going to tell you a little bit about what's going on here, and I'm going to tell you a little bit about what's going on here, and I'm going to tell you a little bit about what's going on here, and I'm going to tell you a little bit about what's going on here, and I'm going to tell you a little bit about what's going to show you a little bit about what's going on.
But it's not why I like this story.
And I'm going to tell you a little bit about this, because to me, this is my story, and it's my worldview, and it's how it's going to change, and it's going to change, and it's going to change, and it's going to change, and it's going to change, and it's going to change, and it's going to change, and it's going to change, and it's going to change, and it's going to change, and it's going to change, and it's going to change, and it's going to change, and it's going to change, and it's going to change, and it's going to change, and it's going to change.
I've been educated as a historian.
And we've come to realize that most of us are historians.
They're trying to understand the past.
I'm going to talk about the history of the universe, of the planets, of life on Earth.
And as a historian, you start by thinking about the development of stories.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this story, and we're going to build a story, and we're going to stick to it.
It's a story that's been really exciting for me for a long time.
We've been in the desert for a long time.
(Laughter)
And I think that by understanding small things, you might be able to reassemble all that you believed in.
So again, in this case, a piece of wood-like fossil found by one scientist led to a theory that went beyond all new norms about why this animal appeared in Dr. Sous's book.
(Laughter)
And it changed from the view of a very special animal that only adapts to a particular environment, a desert, to the view of an animal that happens to be in the Sahara desert, but is actually able to live anywhere in the world.
(Laughter) (Applause)
Hello, Azuri. Hello.
Here, eat.
(Laughter)
It's not a joke.
Now, this Azuri is living proof that the story about our world is dynamic.
We have to reimagine the story.
Isn't that right, Azuri?
There's a new perspective on the world beyond a single piece of bone.
Thank you very much.
The computers of our time are so good that we don't even realize how terrible they can be.
Today, I'd like to talk about this problem and about the "repairing" of neuroscientists.
In 2011, the night of the frosty harem, it was a profound shock to me.
It was when I was sitting in a bar outside Columbia where I was studying computer science and neuroscientists, and I was talking to a fellow student about the power of holograms that would eventually replace computers.
When our conversation was climaxing, yes, his phone was lit.
He took out his phone and started typing it.
And he looked up at me with his eyes, and he said, "I'm listening."
But, of course, his gaze was blurry, and the meaning of that time was lost.
Then, on the other side of the bar, another student had a phone and put it on a group of friends.
And I was sitting there, and I was doing some pictures of Instagram, and they were laughing at me, and I was like, "Oh my God, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
And I started to think about how happy they were, even though they were dissatisfied with the same technology.
And as I thought about that, I realized that the bad guy wasn't just digital information, it was just a display device that kept me away from my friends and connected them to me.
They were connected around something, like the ancestors who told stories around the fire and developed social perception.
It should be an extension of the body's function.
The opposite is happening on your computer today.
When you're texting your wife, when you're writing a symphony, when you're comforting your friends, you're acting exactly the same way.
I'm going to show you what I'm doing, and I'm going to show you how I'm going to do it, and I'm going to do it, and I'm going to do it, and I'm going to do it, and I'm going to do it, and I'm going to do it, and I'm going to do it, and I'm going to do it, and I'm going to do it, and I'm going to do it, and I'm going to do it, and I'm going to do it, and I'm going to do it, and I'm going to do it, and I'm going to do it, and I'm going to do it, and I'm going to do it, and I'm going to do it.
And I think it's wrong, because I think we're going to be able to start using more natural machines.
We should be using machines that bring us back to the real world.
We should not limit our perception by applying the principles of neuroscientists, but we should use machines that extend.
(Laughter)
I'm going to give you an example of what I'm going to do.
Let's try it out.
I can see you right in front of me right now, and I can see my hands.
So I'm going to show you three, two, one, I'm going to show you an incoming hologram, and a very real hologram is right in front of me, right now in front of my headset.
If you're looking at something, of course, what you're looking at may be something that you're shopping for, or it may be something that you're learning, and you can use your hand to control it and move it well.
Iron Man will be proud of you.
I'll show you this in a little bit later.
(Laughter) (Applause)
My mother is an architect, so what I came up with was, instead of a two-dimensional diagram, what I thought was, instead of a three-dimensional diagram,
I'm going to show you what I'm going to show you.
I'm going to show you an example of how this works.
The next example I'm going to show you is a very personal one, and I'm going to show you a project by Professor Adam Garsley from the University of California, San Francisco.
As a neuroscientist student, I've always dreamed of learning by using machines that can touch and manipulate this diverse and complex structure of the brain.
Now, what I'm looking at is an extension reality, but this is part of a much more important idea, a concept that instead of restricting our physical capacity, we're going to be able to use digital devices to do that.
I don't know.
And I think we're going to have a change in the next few years.
And that's when all digital information begins to be expressed in the real world.
Just imagine what that means for the stories, for the stories, for the artists, for the brain surgeons, for the interior designers, and for us here.
So what we need to do as a community is imagine how we can create a new reality that will extend human experience, but we need to make sure that we don't play reality with digital information.
I'm very passionate about this.
Well, I'll let you in on a little secret.
In about five years, it's not a small device, but within about five years, it's all like a thin pair of glasses projecting a hologram.
When we choose a phone, we don't really care much about the hardware itself, but as a neuroscientist, I've always dreamed of creating the "iOS of the mind."
It's very important to make this right because we might be spending at least as much time with this system as we do with the interface on the window screen.
I don't know if you guys have any idea, but it's kind of cool to live in a window.
We've made neuroscience the basis of design to bring the most intuitive interface out of all possible possibilities instead of letting designers argue in the board meeting room.
And that's what I'm going to talk about. I'm going to talk about this in a second.
The brain of the human body is constantly connecting the iOS of the mind to the human brain, and for the first time, the human brain controls the iOS.
In other words, we're trying to build a computer that doesn't have to learn how to use it.
So what we're doing is we're creating a system that allows users to know how to use it.
I'd like to share with you three of the key ideas that we've been working on in the new design of user experience.
And that's what I'm going to talk about today.
The system is complex and abstract, and the first thing you're going to do is use your brain to understand it.
It's doing the opposite of "the minimum resistance pathway."
But in extended reality, if you put a hologram TED panel here and put it on the other side of the desk, the space memory can adapt to this and reach out and extract information.
From the Tesla car you want to buy, you can see everything that the law team asked me to do before the flight.
All right, now your brain has learned how to extract information.
The second one of the interfaces is "see and touch."
If you look at something that's interesting to the baby, what do you do first?
(Laughter)
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
The visual system receives its basic stimulation from what's called its own sensitivity, which is what happens in the depths of the body.
So by touching the work directly, we can not only control it better, we can also understand it more deeply.
That's why we see and touch.
(Laughter)
And that's what we're going to talk about.
From there you will find the third needle, the hologram version of the example of the fire at the beginning.
If we can see each other's face and hands in three dimensions, the primate's mirror neurons and subsystems can see each other's faces and hands in three dimensions, they're better able to connect and work together.
And if you look at the video behind me, there's a couple of Meta users who are using the same holograms to interact with each other without being distracted by the device, and they connect with each other through this object.
Now, let's try this again with neuroscientists in mind.
It's our favorite "iOS of the Heart."
Let's take this headset and put it in this position next to the desk.
Now, I'm with you. This moment, we're connected.
And when I'm in the room, and I'm in space, and I'm in the room, and I grab my headset, and I get it back, and I realize that I'm OS.
And then, as I've got my unique sense of acceptance, I'm going to break this headset down into thousands of pieces, and I'm going to touch the sensors that scan my hand.
But seeing this on your own is not enough, so now the co-founder's Ray is about to make a 3D call.
Hello, Ray. How are you?
Ladies and gentlemen, I can see him in three dimensions in front of me.
It's like a picture. It's real. It's like a picture.
(Laughter) (Applause)
My mirror neuron system suggests that this is going to be replaced by a cell phone soon.
Ray, how you doing?
All right. You're having a live conversation right now.
(Laughter) (Applause)
Ladies and gentlemen, not only will this change the phone, but it will also change the way we work together.
Thank you very much.
Ray, thank you.
You're welcome.
(Laughter) (Applause)
It's in us.
(Laughter) (Applause)
So all of the 100 members of Meta's staff, management workers, designers and engineers, will be throwing out their monitors by TED2017, using a truly natural machine.
Thank you very much.
(Laughter) (Applause)
Thank you.
(Applause) (Chris Anderson)
And the debate that I'm going to talk to you about today is, "Are you looking at what's really going on on the big screen?"
There was also a point made about vision, that when you put on a headset, you're going to have a wider view than what you can see when you put on a headset.
So this is what I'm going to show you today.
Of course it's true.
And it wasn't just that -- it wasn't just when I was making the videos that I showed you, I was particularly hard work, and I took them through the lens of the GoPro camera.
Because I wanted you to experience the real experience that you see through your headgear, and I wanted you to be able to fake it.
Thank you for introducing me.
Thank you very much.
I'm from Seattle, Washington, U.S.A., the most free, forgiving, progressive place in the United States.
I grew up in a family of great Seattle kids.
My mother is an artist, my father is a professor, and I'm very grateful for the environment I grew up in, because I've always been able to make my own choices without feeling comfortable.
I didn't actually follow the course my parents had imagined.
It doesn't matter if you drop out or drop out of college when you're 19.
And I started to travel around as a professional horn player, a dream I had always dreamed of.
I've been playing indoor music all over the United States, all over Europe, and for years, I've been working with Charlie Bird, a great jazz guitarist.
And in my late 20s, I became a member of the Barcelona Symphony orchestra in Spain.
What a good life.
My parents never complained.
You've been supporting me for a long time.
It wasn't their ideal.
He said to his neighbors and friends, "My son is in the middle of a gap year.
But there was one awkward conversation about my life, so let me tell you.
I was 27 years old, and I was on my way home from Barcelona on Christmas vacation, and my mother and I were cooking together in the kitchen, and we were alone.
My mother's quiet. She's too quiet.
I thought something was wrong.
I said, "Mama, what are you thinking?"
She said, "We're very worried about you."
"What do you mean?"
And I said, "Well, why don't you answer me honestly? I didn't vote for the Republicans, did I?"
Now, the truth is, I was just a horn player who wasn't really interested in politics.
I had a little bit of a sense of what I was going to do, and I realized that my parents were a little lost.
I had become a passionate supporter of capitalism, and I'm going to tell you how it happened.
It comes from something I've always been interested in: poverty.
I remember the first time I saw real poverty in Seattle when I was a kid.
My family was in the low middle class, but, of course, it wasn't real poverty.
It was so far away.
The first time I saw poverty or poverty in the early '70s was when I was six or seven years old.
(Laughter)
This is a picture from National Geographic, a child my age in East Africa with a fly on her face, and her belly was swollen.
It was obvious that I couldn't help myself anymore, but I couldn't do anything about it.
Some of you may remember that picture, but not the same picture, not the same one, but the same one.
It's a picture of poverty in the Western world, and it's a picture of poverty in the world.
I couldn't forget that painting when I grew up, and I dropped out of school, and I went back to school, and I still couldn't forget it.
I was wondering what happened to her.
I don't know what happened to people like him all over the world.
So I started looking for answers that weren't in college at the time, but I was looking for answers.
It's getting worse, it's getting better, it's getting worse, it's getting worse, it's getting worse, it's getting worse, it's getting worse, it's getting worse, it's getting worse, it's getting worse, it's getting worse, it's getting worse, it's getting worse, it's getting worse, it's getting worse, it's getting worse, it's getting worse, it's getting worse, it's getting worse, it's getting worse, it's getting worse, it's getting worse, it's getting worse, it's getting worse, it's getting worse, it's getting worse, it's getting worse, it's getting worse, it's getting worse, it's getting worse, it's getting worse.
And then I found the answer, and my life changed.
Now, most Americans think that poverty has gotten worse than when I was a child.
If you ask Americans if the world's poverty has worsened or improved, 70 percent will say that hunger has worsened since the early 70s.
I'll tell you the truth.
(Laughter)
We've had 80 percent of the world's population, from 1970 to today, living on less than a dollar a day, and we've also adjusted the rate of inflation, and we've gone down 80 percent.
And in fact, the world's worst poverty was down 80 percent from when I was a child.
I didn't know that.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is a miracle.
It's something to be happy about.
It's the greatest achievement in the history of the human race, as far as poverty is concerned, and that's what happened in our generation.
(Laughter) (Applause)
If you don't know why you did it, you can't reproduce it.
If we want to reproduce this, if we want to save another two billion people from poverty, that's what we're talking about. &gt;&gt;That's what we've been talking about since my childhood. &gt;&gt;Our two billion brothers and sisters have come out of poverty. &gt;&gt;All right. &gt;&gt;All right. &gt;&gt;All right. &gt;&gt;All right. &gt;&gt;Narrator:
I'd like to know how to save two billion more people.
So I started looking for answers.
I had nothing to do with politics. It didn't matter to me.
I'm still not interested.
I wanted the best answer from mainstream economists, regardless of whether it's right or left or middle class.
I'll tell you the answer.
There are five factors that make it successful.
The world has delivered two billion of our brothers and sisters from poverty by now.
I'm going to show you two examples.
The second is free trade.
The third is property rights.
It's the fourth one. It's the legalist.
(Laughter)
And what's interesting about this is that since the '70s, free enterprises have become possible around the world, and free enterprises have become possible around the world since the '70s.
But I'm not that simple either.
We know that free enterprises are not perfect, and we know that there are other things that we need besides free companies to build a better world.
(Laughter)
It's more than politics.
The things I've learned, the things I've learned, the things I've learned, the things I've learned, the things I've learned, the things I've learned, the things I've learned, the things I've learned, the things I've learned, the things I've learned, the things I've learned, the things I've learned, the things I've learned, the things I've learned, the things I've learned, the things I've learned, the things I've learned, the things I've learned, the things I've learned, the things I've learned, the things I've learned, the things I've learned, the things I've learned.
It's not about wealth. It's about capitalism. It's about wealth.
The best thing about capitalism is that a lot of people talk about it on this platform, and that's the desire that comes out of it.
I'm going to have to do more of this.
Now, let's talk about the second realization, which has to do with the first insight, which has to do with progress not only in the world, but also in this city in which we live, not only in the world, but also in this city in which we live.
And that's what I'm going to talk about today, and that's what I'm going to talk about today, and that's what I'm going to talk about, and that's what I'm going to talk about today, and that's what I'm going to talk about, and that's what I'm going to talk about today, and that's what I'm going to talk about today, and that's what I'm going to talk about today, and that's what I'm going to talk about today about today, and that's what I'm going to talk about today, and that's what I'm going to talk about today about today, and that's what I'm going to talk about today about today, and that's what I'm going to talk about today.
"and saved billions of people from poverty."
Who said that?
It's like the sound of Milton Freeman or Ronald Reagan.
No, sir.
President Balak Obama.
Why can't you say it with your own eyes?
Because he said it directly to me.
I can't believe it.
(Laughter)
And I thought to myself, "What a wonderful opportunity."
Do you know what I was thinking?
In May 2015, I was in the middle of an event on this subject at the University of Georgetown.
And I thought, this is the solution to the biggest problem facing America.
And what we need to do is reach out to the people who need us the most, with the idea that the free market will solve poverty, regardless of the liberals or the conservatives.
You don't have to tell me that the crisis in America and around the world is due to the polarization of politics.
We're reaching a critical point now.
It's a very uncomfortable situation.
Last year, an article appeared in the U.S. Academy of Sciences magazine, one of the most authoritative scientific journals published in the West.
In 2014, the theme was "The Insynchronism of Political Motivation."
What I'm going to talk about today is, in the definition of psychology, my own ideology is born of love, but the worldview of enemies is born of hate.
And that's what I'm going to talk about today.
It's a phenomenon that can be seen, for example, between Palestinians and Israelis.
What the authors of this paper have discovered is that in the United States today, the majority of the Republicans, the Democrats, and the majority of the people are in the thinking of "the invertebrate of political motivations."
I believe that the majority of people in America today who are passionate about politics believe that they are moving from love to hate.
(Laughter)
And I'm going to tell you a little bit about this, and most people think, "My ideology is based on very basic tolerance, and I want to help people, but the others are the bad guys who're trying to frame me."
We can't move forward as a society as long as we have this kind of asymmetricalness.
It's impossible.
So what's the solution?
Let's be honest with ourselves.
It's not so simple as not to underestimate the difference.
(Laughter)
(Laughter)
I'm a professor of psychology at New York University.
We're studying the differences in ideology, values, and morals of different people.
According to him, for example, conservatives and liberals are quite different about what they consider important.
According to Haute, for example, the number of people who care about poverty in the liberal world is 59 percent higher than those who care about economic freedom.
They say that there are 28 percent more conservatives who care about economic freedom than those who care about poverty.
It's not going to shrink.
You're saying we're never gonna see each other again?
It's about diversity. It's about diversity. It's about diversity.
Do you remember what saved the poor?
And what's interesting about this is that the obsession with poverty has taken the form of a free economy that has spread all over the world.
We need each other, if we want to help the next two billion people out of poverty.
There's no other way.
Okay.
How do we get there? How do we get there? How do we get there?
It's hard, isn't it?
And that's what we need to do.
(Laughter)
It's going to be a social event. It's going to be great. I'm sure it's going to be great.
It's called "Streambrevre," and it requires ethical, moral, and responsible investment in foreign countries.
You're absolutely right, but what do you really need?
It's a new world with flexible ideology.
We're going to need more than that.
Right?
Have you ever felt that your ideology was starting to get in the way?
I don't know if it's common.
Do you think you're listening to people like you?
(Laughter)
Because if you talk about the economy in this country, there are conservatives on the right, and they're talking about taxes and regulations and big governments.
And if you think about it, there's a liberal on the left, and every time you talk about the economy, you're always talking about the inequality in income.
It's both important. It's really important to me and to you.
When we talk about relief from poverty for people who are starving and in need of help today, this gets in the way.
We should use the highest level of tools that we can use and cooperate in the best way that we can ease poverty, which is that conservatives can only recognize that liberals and their obsession with the problem of poverty need conservatives and their obsession with the free market.
And if we accept this diversity, we're going to be one of America's strengths in the future.
(Laughter)
You need a list of activities, not just you, but me.
I want you to remember that it's not enough just to accept people who are different.
That's not enough.
We need to keep in mind that we need people who don't agree with us because there are people who are still waiting for these tools that we can provide by our diversity.
(Laughter)
So where does that start?
It's all of us in this room. We're blessed.
I'm lucky to have someone who can listen to me.
We've had a lot of success. We've had a lot of leadership.
You might even be able to listen to something that you don't think of as an ideology.
That's where the progress might start.
That's the first one.
I want you to be somebody who's a little bit different, and I want you to be somebody who's also somebody who can turn boundaries into vagues, and I want you to be the one who can be the one who can be the one who can be the one who can be the one who can be the one who can be the one who can be the one who can be the one who can be the one who can be the one who can be the one who can be the one who can be the one who can be the one who can be the one who can be the one who can be the one who can be the one who can be the one who can be, and I want to be the one who can be the one who can be the one who can be, and I want to be the one who can be the one who can be the one who can be the one who can be, especially be the one who can be the one who can be the one who can be the one who can be the one who can be the one who can be the one who can be the one who can be the one who can be.
If you're a conservative, you're a conservative, you're a conservative, you're a conservative, you're a conservative, you're a conservative, you're always talking about poverty, you're always talking about a moral obligation to fight for the poor.
If we're liberal, if we're liberal, if we're liberal, then we're going to be liberal, if we're going to solve our problems, and we're going to talk about the good of the free market at all times, if we're going to use it in a responsible way.
And I'm going to give you an example of how to do that.
First, we can start to save the next two billion people, and we can work on the solutions that we've seen a lot in the past.
Second, we can transform the terrible, sacred ideology that we're experiencing in this country into competition for ideas based on unity and respect for each other.
And if you do that, you'll probably realize that the big differences that we think are not so great after all.
Thank you very much.
I was a political major in college, so I had to write a lot of reports.
And if you're a student, if you're a student, if you're a student, if you're a student, if you're a student, if you're a student, if you're a student, if you're a student, if you're a student, if you're a student, if you're a student, if you're a student, if you're a student, if you're a student, if you're a student, if you're a student, you're a student.
Now, this is slow beginning, but you're going to have to move forward well in the first week, and you're going to get a little bit more weight, but you're going to be in an orderly state.
That's what I want to do.
As planned,
Now, I'm going to do this right now, and I'm going to do this right away, but when I'm actually going to do this report, this is what happens to me.
This is what happens every time.
I'm going to write 90 pages of dissemination, and I'm going to write 90 pages of dissemination.
I knew it wouldn't work the way I always do.
It's too big.
(Laughter)
It's a one-year plan.
I'm going to start with a little bit of light, a little bit of light in the middle, and then I'm going to put a strip on the end, and I'm going to feel like a kind of humble staircase.
(Laughter)
It won't be difficult.
But something strange happened.
The first few months.
It's been too long, but I couldn't do anything.
That's why the plan will be changed.
And then we went through the period of the peripheral period, but we couldn't write it, and this is what it looks like.
Two more months, one month, and then two more weeks.
When I woke up one morning, I had no choice but to write a 90-page paper in 72 hours, and I spent two nights in a row.
I thought it was all over.
A week later, I got a call from the university.
"Are you Tim Urban?"
Yes.
I'd like to talk to you about the paper that was submitted.
"What is it?"
And he said, "I've never seen such a wonderful dissertation before."
Oh, my God. It didn't happen.
(Laughter)
I just wanted everyone to think, "Isn't this guy a genius?"
It's a hell of a paper.
I'm a writer now.
I'm a blogger. I'm a blogger.
I decided about two years ago that I wanted to write about delays.
Because my behavior was always confusing to the people around me, what was going on in the head of the procrastinator, and what was going on in our heads, and why we're like that.
I wanted to explain it to people who weren't procrastinators in the world, because I think there must be a difference between the brain of the procrastinator and the brain of the non-existent.
So I decided to find a place where my brain is not a procrastinator, and I decided to compare it to a place where my brain is not a procrastinator.
(Laughter)
I'd like you to be careful to see if you can tell the difference.
Now, if you're not a brain specialist, and you're not a brain specialist, you're not a brain specialist.
This is the brain of a non-existent person.
I'm not going to talk about it. I'm not going to talk about it. I'm not going to talk about it. I'm going to talk about it. I'm going to talk about it.
In my brain, it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's...
[Sal] I want a reward right away. This is the difference between the two of you.
In both of these brains, there's a rational decisionmaker, and in the case of the procrastinator's brain, there's a monkey who wants a reward right away.
What does that have to do with the delay?
Everything's going to be fine until this happens.
The rational decision-maker makes a rational decision to do something productive, but he doesn't like it, and he says, "Well, I remember reading a Wikipedia article about the case of Nancy Keraghan and Tony Harding.
I have to go check the fridge to see if anything's changed since ten minutes ago.
After that, I'm going to watch a video about Richard Feynman talking about the magnet, and then I'm going to watch Justin Bieber's mother's interview all the time.
I'm sorry, but I can't do this today.
I can't afford a job."
What's going on?
The monkey doesn't want you to steer.
I'm alive in this moment.
I don't have memories of the past, I don't have knowledge of the future, and I only care about two things that are easy and fun.
If it's the animal world, it's not a problem.
If you're a dog, if you're a dog, if you're a dog, if you're a dog, if you're a dog, if you're a dog, if you're a dog, if you're a dog, if you're a dog, if you're a dog, if you're a dog, if you're a dog, if you're a dog, if you're a dog, if you're a dog, if you're a dog, if you're a dog, if you're a dog, if you're a dog, if you're a dog, if you're a dog, if you're a dog, if you're a dog, if you're a dog, if you're a dog, you're a dog, if you're a dog, you're a dog.
You know, for monkeys, humans are just animals.
You just have to eat well, sleep well, and produce another generation.
I don't think we're living in a primitive world right now.
We live in an advanced civilization, but the monkeys don't know what it is.
And that's why we have another human brain, another rational decisionmaker, which gives us the ability that no other animal has.
And that's what we're trying to do.
You can see the big office.
We'll have a long-term plan.
The rational decision-maker takes everything into account.
I'm trying to get him to do what he needs to do right now.
Sometimes it makes sense to do things that are fun and easy to do, such as at dinner, when you're sleeping, when you're taking your leisure time.
There's a link between the two of them.
Sometimes we agree.
But sometimes it makes sense to do something that's too difficult and not very fun to do.
And when that happens, there's always a conflict.
If you're a procrastinator, you tend to end up with a certain outcome, and you spend a lot of time in orange-colored parts.
(Laughter)
The dark playground is known to all the procrastinators.
It's not when you're playing, it's when you're playing.
The pleasure of the dark playgrounds is not really fun, and it's filled with familiar procrastinations of pleasures, of guilt, of fear, of self-absorbing.
The question is, how can the procrastinators move to places where the blue area is less comfortable, but where the really important things happen?
As a matter of fact, the procrastinator has a guardian angel who watches over us all the time.
Most panic monsters sleep, but suddenly they wake up when the terrible end of the job crisis approaches.
What matters is that it's the monkey's only thing to be afraid of.
I've been in charge of it for a long time now, but six months ago, people from TED contacted me and asked me to give a TED talk.
And I said, "Well, I'm going to do it."
It was my dream for many years to be able to say, "I've been to TED talks before."
[I've been to TED Talk] [I've been to TED Talks] ♫ ♫ In the midst of this excitement, rational decision makers care about something else.
Do you know what you've taken?
Do you know what happens one day in the future?
I need you to sit down right now and get this thing out of here!
And the monkeys say, "Well, I don't know if that's true, but I'm going to open Google Earth and expand the bottom part of India to 60 meters above the ground, and then I'm going to scroll for two and a half hours and I'm going to get a better picture of India."
That's why I've been doing it all day.
It took six months, two months, one month, and TED's list of speakers.
When I opened that page, I saw my own face staring back at me.
So who woke up?
The panic monster went mad, and soon the whole system was in chaos.
Remember, a monkey fears a panic monster, and then he runs into a tree.
It wasn't long before the rational decision makers were taking the wheel, and I was getting ready for the lecture.
And what happens is that the panic monster can explain the demoralizing behavior of the procrastinator, who spent two weeks without writing a single line in the report, wakes up like a miracle and writes eight pages all night.
This is the entire situation with three characters in it, the system of the forwarders.
It's not really clean, but it's going to work eventually.
This is what I decided to write a blog two years ago.
And when I wrote it down, I was surprised by the response to my blog.
And literally thousands of e-mails came from all over the world.
A nurse, a banker, an artist, an engineer, and a lot of graduate students.
It wasn't just me, it wasn't me, it was everybody's writing the same thing.
But the lightness of the blog article and the weight of the e-mail I received were contrasting.
It was written with a lot of frustration about the impact that procrastination has on their lives.
And I thought to myself, "What's going to happen to the pre-existers' system?"
Why are they in such a dark state?
What we found is that there are two kinds of delays.
There was a deadline in my case.
If there's a deadline, the effects of procrastination are limited to a short period of time, when panic monsters appear.
But there's another kind of procrastination, and there's no deadline for it.
Because if you're an entrepreneurial job like a private entrepreneur or an artist, you don't have a deadline at first, because nothing happens until you go out and do something and you get into orbit and you start running.
And there's a lot of things that are important outside of work: going to see your family, exercising, maintaining your health, breaking up relationships that don't work.
If the procrastinator was the only mechanism for doing these difficult things, there's a problem, because there's no panic monster in the middle of nowhere.
It's not going to wake you up, it's not going to wake you up, it's not going to stop, it's going to go on forever.
There's no such long-term procrastination that's so hard to say compared to a ludicrous, short-term procrastination procrastination.
It's a long-term, long-term, big tragedy, regret.
I think that's why they wrote the email, and that's why they're in such a terrible situation.
It's not like they're being canned on a project.
The longer-term procrastination, the longer-term procrastination, makes you feel like an observer to your life.
And what's interesting about this is that their frustration is not that they can't fulfill their dreams, but that they can't even begin to pursue them.
I've been reading e-mails like that for a long time, and I've come to realize that there's no one who's not a procrastinator.
They're procrastinators.
You may not be a mess like me, but you may still have a close-up and a healthy relationship, but notice that the monkey problem is when it's not tight enough.
There's one last thing I want to show you.
It's called "The Calendar of Life."
Each box corresponds to each week of your life in 90 years.
We don't have a lot of money, and we don't have a lot of money.
(Laughter)
And I think that's important, because what I'm really putting off is what I'm really putting off, and everybody should be putting off something.
You need to be aware of the monkey you want to get your reward right away.
This is our job for all of us.
And when you think about the fact that there's not a lot of boxes in the world, we should start this work today.
Well, maybe not today.
I hope so.
Sooner or later,
Thank you very much.
At that moment, I was in a church in Texas, with a soul and body, waiting for the last moment of my life in fear.
And I was sitting in a room like this, on a broken wooden chair covered with red rags, with a choir on the left, behind, and then a baptism pool in the back.
It doesn't change at all.
And I'm going to show you what I'm going to show you, and I'm going to show you how to do it, and I'm going to show you how to do it, and I'm going to show you how to do it, and I'm going to show you how to do it, and I'm going to show you how to do it, and I'm going to show you how to do it, and I'm going to show you how to do it, and I'm going to show you how to do it, and I'm going to show you, and I'm going to show you, and I'm going to show you, and I'm going to show you, and I'm going to show you, and I'm going to show you how to do it.
On December 31, 1999, the night of Christ's second coming, I believed that the world would end.
That year, I was just 12 years old.
And I'm going to argue that it's not fair that the world is going to end, but it's going to be a later festival.
I'll change my mind. I'll go to church as long as I can.
I prayed so earnestly that I would forget the passing of time that God would look at my disbelief and make sure I didn't get there sooner than I was supposed to.
And I thought about it, and I thought about it, and I said, "Please save me."
One time, I found out in a sentence that if one of us is lacking in faith, then another tragedy awaits us.
Anyway, my job is to control every desire, to overcome every desire, to defeat the devil and the demons, and to win the victory over my own unfaith.
It's hard to do when you're 12 years old.
And that's when we get closer and closer to the moment.
23:50.
For the remaining ten minutes, the pastor gathered us in front of the altar with a deep prayer that the hands of his watch would point to the time of his destiny.
People of all denominations will meet together.
The choirs stay in their seats, the deacons and their wives -- as it were, the church members in the front row of the altar.
In America, you know, even at the second coming of Christ, there's a VIP seat.
(Laughter) (Applause)
They're the ones that are the key to me.
They've dedicated their lives to this moment, just as the predecessors of the Middle Ages were waiting for the coming of the end of the day, and they've made sure that the talk show starts every day at four o'clock.
And like my grandmother, she's going to go to the altar, and I'm going to go to the altar, and I'm going to sneak her back, and I'm sure she's going to go to heaven, and she's going to go to heaven, and she's going to go to heaven, and she's going to go to heaven, and she's going to go to heaven, and she's going to go to heaven, and she's going to go to heaven, and she's going to go to heaven, and she's going to heaven, and she's going to go to heaven, and she's going to heaven, and she's going to heaven, and she's going to heaven, and she's going to heaven, and she's going to heaven.
I was thinking, if I could hold her hand during my prayers, maybe we could go to heaven together.
And then I held my hand, and I closed my eyes, and I listened, and I prayed.
The priest's voice is violent.
The prayers that respond to them will cry out, and the church will hear them.
(Laughter)
I'm going to show you what I'm going to show you in the next video.
I'll hold her hand again so she won't leave me.
He fled into the darkness behind the bush before the horrors of fate.
And that voice pours out "Amen."
It's over.
(Laughter)
It's already past the time of fate.
The Saviors didn't show up, and I looked and I couldn't even see the new possibilities because I closed my eyes so deep and I couldn't see their disappointment as they swam.
(Laughter)
They were being deceived, they were being deceived, and I was one of them.
I've been praying for my life, trying not to give in to temptation.
It was me who had been baptized twice, not once, but twice.
Until then, I'm sure.
I went home and turned on the TV, and Peter Jennings celebrated the very beginning of the new century, and the news spread all over the world.
And then there's a strange idea that comes back to my mind, and I wonder if God's going to fall over and over again to worry about the time difference.
This flash was too ridiculous, and it was cruel.
But I still didn't stop believing.
And we have a new faith, a new faith, a faith that doesn't have one answer.
My answer was wrong, and the problem itself was wrong.
And then, in the summer, the frozen winter mountain of faith, a new sunlight, began to flow into the unsightly landscape.
I still look back on that night when the Saviors didn't come, and if in a moment what I believed wasn't a lie, that moment that I knew wasn't true.
I'm sure many of you who celebrated the 2000 moment in a completely different way are here at the end of the process that I followed.
I reached out for something that I could trust this time.
I'm going to enter the University of Yale, 18 years old, and it's the most beautiful opportunity I've ever had for people who had lost their broken dreams and hopes at Oakcliff, Texas, to separate themselves from all those dark pasts.
But one day while I was on winter vacation, I was lying on the floor of my house, and my hands were tied behind my back, and a burglar was holding a gun to my head, and I finally realized that education wouldn't save me.
In 2008, I reached out for the next salvation, a company called Lehman Brothers.
I'm going to make a quick phone call to my house, and I'm going to make sure that I don't have any money anymore.
But even in the middle of the financial crisis, I broke down in front of my eyes, even in business.
And as an employee in Washington without giving up, the voices coming out of Illinois shout out, "The time has come."
But the Congress was frustrated, and the change was not a funny joke, because when the government came back, nothing happened, and they didn't get saved.
I did swear allegiance on that altar, named the American Dream, to the god of capitalism, success, wealth and power.
And yet, at the same time, when the date changes, I'm opening my eyes to see if there really wasn't a God.
And that night, I decided to face it again, not because I was brave, but because I was willing to die or believe, but because I had only two choices left me.
And then I went to the next holy place because I knew I wasn't willing to go to the Harvard Business School for help that was nice and open to me at this time.
We don't have enough effort yet.
One night, after the harsh winter of Cambridge, we were in the middle of a big party, and three of our friends were talking about it, and it was one of the most common topics of youth for any young person.
We didn't know where to go, and we didn't know where to go, and we didn't know where to go.
But I was obsessed by Jack Kerouac's novels, and we left to find out what was going on in this country.
And, of course, there were a lot of voices against me, and most of all, I heard that voice, but anyway, I took a step forward.
In the summer of 2013, we began a journey of 8,000 miles around the United States through the grasslands of Montana, the ruins of Detroit, and the swamps of New Orleans.
I was trained in the highest order of capitalism, and I was more innovative than that.
This idea is going to expand into the NPO organization called MBAs Cross America, and that's what made me stand on the stage of TED.
And I'm going to tell you a little bit about how greedy our generation is for purpose and meaning.
And we realized that this wave was a sign that we couldn't see, that we couldn't see it, that we couldn't see it, that there were so many entrepreneurs out there who could create and transform jobs, that we needed a little more help.
And we finally realized that, honestly, I was trying to make the waves happen.
And I've certainly thought of it as a way to make people feel that way, that each one of our social companies is able to heal and comfort and raise the wounds of this fragile country again.
But this journey of preaching led me to a new gospel, and that's why I'm here today.
This is an event that happened about a year ago when I was at the Museum of Natural History in New York.
I was sitting with some of my friends, some of my friends, and I was sitting with some of my friends, some of my friends, some of my friends, some of my friends, some of my friends, some of my friends, some of my friends, some of my friends, some of my friends, some of my friends, some of my friends, some of my friends, some of my friends, some of my friends, some of my friends, some of my friends, some of my friends, some of my friends, some of their friends, some of their friends, some of their friends, some of their friends, some of their friends, some of their friends, some of their friends, some of their friends, some of their friends, some of their friends, some of their friends, some of their friends, some of their friends, some of their friends, and some of their friends, some of their friends, some of their friends, some of their friends, some of their friends, some of their friends, some of their friends, and some of their friends, some of their friends, some of their friends, some of mine, some of their friends, and some of their friends, and some of their friends, some of their friends, who were, who were, and their own, and their own, who were, who were, and their own, and their own, and their own, and their own, and their own, and their own, and their own, and their own, who were in their own, and their own, and their own, and their owns, and their ownsss, and their owns, and their own, and their own, and their own, and their own, and their owns.e.e, and their owns.e.e.e, and their owns, and their own,.e.e.e, and their owns, and their owns, and their owns, and their owns, and their owns, and their owns, and their owns, and their owns, and their owns, and their owns, and their, and their owns, and their owns, and their, and their, and their, and their owns, and their owns, and their owns, and their owns, and their, and theirs, who were in whom, and they's, and they's, and they's
It was a space filled with people, people, people, and their assets -- a space filled with pride, which was well over 500 billion dollars.
If you look at the results we've achieved, they're all beautiful.
But that didn't stop me, and two days later I had to go to the Harem area, where I sat on the edge of a farm built on an empty space, and a man named Tony told me about children coming to the farm every day.
We're talking about kids who live below the poverty line.
Even when they go to bed, they pick up their bags so they can't steal them in a homeless shelter.
I'm going to go to Tony's program, which is called Harem Greate Harm, and they're going to come to Tony's program, and they're going to ask him for a single meal in a day.
After 20 years of taxi drivers, Tony lost his pension and started that program.
He didn't pay his salary because he was in need of money while his activities were spreading.
He said he was going to hang on to any straw.
And I'm determined to be that straw.
And on my way home, I heard a dull sound in the back of my chest, and I just cried.
And I was so ignorant that under one roof, there was a group of people who were thinking about the whale replicas and moving the 500 billion dollars, and two days later, in the sky, just 50 blocks north, there was a man running unskilledly to prepare a child's meal.
And it wasn't because of the inequality, it wasn't because of hunger, it was because of pity for homeless children, it wasn't because of the anger of 1 percent of the wealth, it wasn't because of the 99 percent of the poverty.
I was just upset by the fact that in a country with kidney disease,
I realized that my story was for people who had no shoes, but who had to keep walking for them.
It was a flash that completely shamed me, and I remembered the fact that the new century, which Peter Jennings told me, was so many times over, that I was deceived and deceived and deceived.
It was a distraction.
But this time I was a false savior, and I was so far away from that altar that night when I believed the world would end, that God's Word is the truth.
We're on our way from that world that we believed in, and we're on our way back to where we started.
We live in a time where we don't believe in an age where we don't believe in the past; rather, we believe in the past.
Some of you may believe what she says, and others may believe what she says.
"The New Yorker." "The Harvard Business Review."
And I think there are people who believe in them, and there are people who believe in them, and there are people who believe in them, and there's a church right now called TED, where we're praying, and we want to believe it, and we need to believe it, we need to believe it, we need to believe it, we need to believe it, we need to believe it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we have it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we have it, we have it, we need it, we need it, we have it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, it, it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it, we
We want a leader who solves all kinds of problems.
They believe that suffering is the necessary evil of the God of capitalism.
But when we neglect to question one element of foundation because we fear that what we believe is on the ground, then the human cost of it is overlooked.
If something that you have to accept is in your way, then it's time for you to stop and ask again.
The gospels that are responsible for creativity, innovation, social, environmental and economic responsibility are not my domain.
We're not trying to spread the gospel here, in fact.
That's why I'm here.
I'm not asking you to stop believing in the Gospel, but I'm asking you to do something new.
We have to accept the mistakes we've made, and the questions we've asked are wrong.
This Gospel of doubt suggests that we can all be wrong in this space right here.
"Why do you ask me this question?" "Why do you ask me that? "Why do you ask me this question?"
What is it that needs people to suffer for nothing until they abandon the power that we have to ask them to do?
And in my belief in re-examination, I made a decision about my own activities, and I made it a non-profit.
We've made it available and shared it so that we can cut down on the staff of the organization, stop new recruitment, and use our business model for free.
I've been asking myself why, and I've been asking myself why, because I've asked people to abandon their role as saviors, because our lives are too short to wait for Christ's second coming in the face of the truth that there will be no miracles.
This gospel of doubt, when there seems to be no hope, will inspire you and fill you with hope, even when there is no hope for it.
And when you scream, you just make a simple voice out of it, and you say, "There's got to be another way."
Thank you very much.
Food Crisis
It's been on the news ever since.
What does that mean?
There's a lot of food in the world, and there's a lot of food, and there's an oversupply in the world.
The GMO is helping the world.
I'm going to give you a couple of examples.
Over-abundant agricultural waste is poisoning the oceans, poisoning them, reducing their nutritional value.
(Laughter)
I'm very disappointed with your argument about the environment.
How can we solve this with our knowledge?
And that's what we're going to talk about.
I'm sure you all ate one apple last week.
How long do you think that apple has been picked?
Two weeks?
Two months?
It's 11 months. It's an average of an apple in an American grocery store.
I don't think there's much difference between Europe and the rest of the world.
We take an apple, we put it in a refrigerator, we store it in a stored gas, and we have a record of workers entering this storage room, and they died trying to get it, because the air that slows the decay of apples is toxic to humans.
Why didn't anyone know about this?
Why didn't I know?
In fact, 90 percent of the antioxidants in apples are lost by the time you eat them.
(Laughter)
Why are we so short on information?
It's because the platforms are missing.
So, what I'm going to talk about is platforms -- computers -- and I'm going to tell you a little bit about what I did when I was young -- and I'm going to show you how to do something really, really, really bad on the Internet.
We did it on this platform.
But I was able to meet people and express myself.
How do we use food to express ourselves?
If you have a platform, you can ask yourself, "If..."
And I asked myself, what if the climate was equal to everyone else?
This is a map of the world's climate.
So here's what we're going to do.
And as you can see, the colors are moving and changing, and the center of agriculture in California is now moving to Mexico.
China is growing better food on Brazilian soil.
What if each country had a climate that was suitable for production?
How does it change people's lives?
How do we change the quality of life and nutrition?
The problem with the past generations was to get more food at a lower price.
Welcome to the world of global farms.
The human race built a huge analog farm.
The line here shows the transportation of food connected to cars, airplanes, railroads, and so forth.
It's a miracle that the food supply that sustains the population of seven billion is being produced by a small percentage of people.
What if...
What if we could build a digital farm?
It's a global digital farm.
What if we could take this apple out and digitally create it in some way, carry it through the air as a particle and reassemble it in another place?
What if...
And I started to read these sentences, and I was inspired, and I started to study them.
First, Japanese agriculture has no young labor force, no water, no land, no future.
The land was polluted, so the children moved to Sendai and Tokyo.
The food problem is not limited to Japan.
It's about two percent of the population in the United States.
There's only so much we can do with less than two percent of the world's population.
If you look at other countries, 50 percent of Africa's population is under 18 years old.
I don't want to be a farmer, I don't want to be a farmer, I don't want to be a farmer.
I'm a farmer. I'm a farmer. I'm a farmer, I'm a farmer, I'm a farmer, I'm a farmer, I'm a farmer, I'm a farmer, I'm a farmer, I'm a farmer, I'm a farmer, I'm a farmer, I'm a farmer, I'm a farmer, I'm a farmer, I'm a farmer, I'm a farmer, I'm a farmer, I'm a farmer, I'm a farmer, I'm a farmer, I'm a farmer, I'm a farmer.
And that's what I'm going to talk about today.
It's going to go into cities.
In India, the number of farmers who didn't even receive water or electricity was the highest in the last decade.
(Laughter)
Where are the farmers going?
It's a city.
And that's where we're going. We're not going to be able to do that. We're not going to be able to do that.
So how can we build platforms that stimulate young people?
I'll introduce you to a new tractor!
(Laughter)
(Laughter)
So I started making weird things, and I tried to get the plants to dance, and I connected the plants to the computer, and they all died.
I've been able to make sure that it doesn't end up dead.
I've built something that is one of the most intimate relationships of my life, which is that I've started to understand the language of plants.
He said he wanted to grow bigger.
They said, "Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
There's just an old electrical lab that no one wants in here.
What do you think you can do?
I've been working with some of my colleagues, and I've been working with them, and I've been working on a farm in the MlT Media Lab, and this place has been known as a digital life lab, not biology, but digital life labs.
We've produced enough food for three hundred people every month in this six square meter space.
And that's what I'm going to talk about today.
What's the most interesting of them?
Beautiful white roots, dark green vegetables, monthly harvests.
Is this a new type of cafeteria?
New retail experience?
A new grocery store?
But there's one thing I can say for sure: it's the first time in the media lab that we've picked something from the roots.
There's a salad in the bag, but there's no problem.
But what happens if you have an expert in image processing, a data scientist, a robot researcher, picking something from the roots and thinking, "I can use my knowledge to do this?"
We're trying to keep these plants in the lab before we get them out, because we don't want to throw away what we grow.
My tongue has changed, and I don't want people to eat it until I know it's a decent food.
So I eat lettuce every day.
"Oh, that's PH6.1. I can't eat today."
(Laughter)
It's because plants are stressed out, and they're trying to protect themselves, and chemical reactions occur inside, and it's so sweet.
And that's what makes the sound of plants so sweet that it's my favorite.
The engineer who turned to plant physiology...
And I thought, well, I'm going to do this experiment, and I'm going to do this experiment, and I'm going to do this experiment, and I'm going to do this experiment, and I'm going to do this experiment, and I'm going to do this, and I'm going to do this.
I'm curious about what's going to happen in the future, and what's going to happen in the future.
I'm going to give you a couple of examples.
There's my lab on the front of the media lab, and there's about 30 sensors on every plant.
If you're familiar with genomes and genetic engineering, this is what we call a fenom.
And that's what we're going to talk about.
For example, if you like Mexican berries, you actually like the ones that grow in the climate you like.
So if you program that climate, you can program a combination of carbon dioxide and oxygen levels to program the flavors, nutrients, shapes, colors and teeth of plants.
It's got a lot of data, and it's got a lot of sensors to figure out what's going on, and when you think about indoor gardening plants, it makes you very sad.
It's an amazing thing, because farmers have the most amazing ability to predict the growth of plants in their late 60s and early 70s.
When plants are dying, they know why they're running out of nitrogen, they're running out of calcium, they need moisture.
This amazing vision will not be passed on to you.
This is what we're going to talk about in the next video.
And that's what we're going to do.
We're going to talk about how to do that. We're going to talk about how to do that.
I'm going to show you a couple of examples of what I'm going to show you in the next video.
It's not just an IP address, it's an IP address, it's an IP address, it's a blogger, it's an IP address, it's an IP address, it's an IP address, it's an IP address, it's an IP address, it's an IP address, it's an IP address, it's an IP address, it's an IP address, it's an IP address, it's a blog, it's an IP address, it's an IP address, it's an IP address, it's an IP address, it's an IP address, it's an IP address, it's an IP address, it's an IP address, it's an IP address, it's an IP address, it's an IP address, it's an IP address, it's an IP address.
(Laughter) (Applause)
And what I'm going to show you today is data that can be downloaded about the growth of plants that we've seen before, not just when we can eat more than we can possibly imagine, but when we can eat more than we can eat.
And that's when we get the nutrients that we need, and that's when we get the nutrients that we need, and that's when we get the nutrients that we need.
I'll predict when it'll taste good.
Isn't it too much water?
Isn't it too much sunlight?
I'm also warning you.
They talk to me, they talk to me, they're intelligent, they have words in common with me.
(Laughter) (Applause)
So what we're going to do is we're going to start making friends, and we're going to have a plant profile, and then we're going to start making friends, and then we're going to have a friend, and then we're going to have a friend, and then we're going to have a friend, and then we're going to have a friend, and then we're going to have a friend, and then we're going to have a friend, and then we're going to have a friend, and then we're going to have a friend, and then we're going to have a friend, and then we're going to have a friend, and then we're going to have a friend, and we're going to have a friend, and then we're going to have a friend, and we're going to have a friend.
There's a lot more nitrogen in the plant than there is in the plant, and there's a lot more nitrogen in the plant, and there's a lot more potassium in the plant, and there's a lot more potassium in the plant, but there's a lot more potassium in the plant than there is in the plant.
We're also learning about the complexity of interplanting relationships that we can only guess at the moment.
The plants may not recognize us as friends, but it's possible that's up to us.
This is my lab now.
I'm a little bit more orderly than I used to be, and I've had a lot of experience in setting up data centers in different hospitals, and I have a little bit of knowledge about creating a controlled environment.
And then I'm trying to do all kinds of experiments in this environment.
It's a process that NASA has developed to reduce the flow of water into space to the Mir space station.
Here, we provide plants with just as much water, minerals and oxygen as they need.
The roots grow in a simple way, and if you just give them what they need, they grow in a way like this.
It's like a plant with two hearts.
The heart is four times faster than the heart.
It's a perfect world.
We've made progress in technology over the years, and we've developed seeds that grow in harsh environments, but we've developed a new way of doing it.
We've grown a lot of different kinds of plants.
It's not a tomato. It's not a tomato. It's not a tomato. It's a tomato.
Did you know that mankind has a rare and ancient seed bank?
I'm talking about seed storage.
(Laughter)
In some species, the reproductive properties are preserved alive, and no one has ever heard of them.
I'm the only tomato eater in the lab.
And the problem with this is that it's a sauce tomato, and you don't know how to cook it.
I used proteins to grow a lot of things.
Even humans could do it, but they didn't do it.
(Laughter)
We wanted to spread it around the world, but it took about 10 million dollars.
It's hard to find a person who can get 10 million dollars out of it, and that's where I'm going to make a small one.
This project is actually one of my students, and Camille, a graduate of mechanical engineering, went on.
Camille, my colleagues and I experimented again and again during the summer, trying to find something that would be cheaper and better for anyone to make.
(Laughter)
If you want people to make fun of you, just tell them something.
I went to school, and I said, "Well, let's set the humidity to 65%."
One of the students asks, "What's the humidity?"
I said, "It's about water in the air."
He says, "I don't have any water in the air. I'm not stupid."
And I said, "You don't have to believe me. You don't have to believe me."
You don't have to believe me.
Let's set it to 100%."
He's set 100%, what's going to happen?
The water condenses, and it becomes fog, until it drops.
He said, "What do you mean, wet rain?"
Why didn't you tell me?
We've created an input screen that looks like a game.
It's a three-dimensional display that allows you to log in from anywhere in the world.
We can control the bot's various devices and sensors.
You can choose a recipe made by other children around the world.
It's a very simple recipe. It's a very simple one. It's a very simple one. It's a very simple one. It's a very simple one. It's a very simple one. It's a very simple one.
And that's what makes us change as we grow older.
"Why do plants need CO2?
(Laughter)
If you increase CO2 concentration, the plant dies.
It's called CO2. It's called CO2. It's called CO2.
And when we're done with the plant, we're going to have a new digital recipe.
It's a process that we design, develop, and explore over and over again.
You can download data on new plants and new digital recipes that they've developed, and the changes are either effective or opposite?
Think of these as the core of the development process.
We'll learn a lot.
This is what we call a food computer.
It's just grown up in three weeks.
And the more important thing is, for the first time, she thought she could be a farmer, and maybe she wanted to be a farmer.
And that's what we're going to do.
It's all online. It's all online.
It may be a little difficult, but...
It's a new experiment. It's all in place.
It's very important that it be available so easily.
I'm going to make it closer to you.
These are farmers, electricians, mechanics, environmental engineers, computer scientists, botanists, urban planners.
I'm going to do what I'm good at on one platform.
It's getting smaller and smaller in this lab.
This is the new facility that I've just started using.
There's a warehouse like this all over the place.
That's why I chose to do it.
We're trying to build something like this in a warehouse.
This is already real.
(Laughter)
This one's already there.
Each of them grows green vegetables and Ebola vaccines.
And one of the reasons these plants won the Grand Challenge of the National Institute of Defense Research was that they were ahead of them.
This plant produces proteins that are resistant to Ebola.
And that's what I'm going to talk about today.
It's not very similar to lettuce, but that's what I'm going to do in my research.
It's different in every way.
We're still in our early chaos, and we're like, "This is our black box."
And I said, "No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
And I'm going to tell you a little bit about that, but actually, it's just beginning, and it's about to change society.
So while we're looking for more and more cheaper foods, we're looking for food that's sweeter for a better environment.
The fact that McDonald's published the contents of the chicken nuggets, which were always considered the most suspicious food, indicates that they're doing business with the world's changes.
(Laughter)
A private food computer, a food server, and a food data center are operating in an open phase.
Unlike the open genome, we're like Wikipedia with a little bit of climate recipe.
(Laughter)
You remember the world was connected by a line?
I'm going to give you a couple of examples.
So instead of sending out food itself, we're going to start sending out information about food.
It's not just my illusion, it's already spreading in places like this.
We've got food computers, we've got food servers, we've got food data centers, we've got data centers, we've got information, we've got information, we've got information, we've got data, we've got data, we've got data, we've got data, we've got data, we've got data, we've got data, we've got data, we've got data, we've got data, we've got data, we've got data, we've got data, we've got data, we've got data, we've got data, we've got data.
The future food supply isn't about fighting internal flaws.
We don't know what's wrong. We don't know what's wrong.
The future food supply is a network linking the next billion farmers to the platforms that allow them to create and solve problems.
Thank you very much.
Sometimes, as a European, I don't feel very good about myself.
Over the past year, more than a million people have come to Europe for help.
(Laughter)
We all mourn the tragic death of two-year-old Alan Kurdi, but since then, more than 200 children have drowned in the Mediterranean.
And yet, despite the international treaty's recognition of the responsibility for the acceptance of refugees, the number of refugees in the small country of Lebanon is more than the total in Europe.
We regret the existence of a secret ship, but we have made it the only way to escape to Europe.
And what we're doing is we're removing the people who are in need of labor, but who are in need of human resources, and who are able to match them economically and population-basedly.
They're against Islamist fundamentalism, and they're against liberalism, but they're holding young refugees in custody, separating their children from their families, taking their children into custody.
It's funny, isn't it?
Why is it that we've come to have so much inhuman response to the humane crisis?
I don't think it's because people are indifferent, at least I don't want to believe it's why.
I think it's because politicians lack vision, because they have a vision that adapts international refugee policies built over 50 years ago to a changing globalized age.
So I'm going to go back and ask you two very, very fundamental questions.
So I'm going to ask you two questions.
And how do we fix this?
The modern refugee system was built by these people right after World War II.
Our goal in the first place is to give people a place to live in security and dignity, when the state collapses or, worst of all, when it turns its blade on the people, where it gives them a destination, where they can live in security and dignity until they return.
It was designed in preparation for the very conditions that we see today in Syria.
The United Nations has promised to unite refugees from conflict and persecution through the 1951 Convention on Refugees, an international treaty between 147 countries, and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
But today, this system doesn't work.
Theoretically, refugees have the right to asylum.
In reality, our immigration policy is blocking the way to safety.
Theoretically, refugees have the right to assimilation to shelters, and they can go back home.
And that's what happens when you're in a situation where you're in a situation where you're in a state where you're in a state where you're in a state where you're in a state where you're in a state where you're in a state where you're in a state where you're in a state where you're in a state where you're in a state where you're in a state where you're in a state where you're in a state where you're in a state where you're in a state where you're in a state where you're in a state where you're in a state where you're in a state where you're in a state where you're in a state where you're in a state where you're in a state where you're in a state where you're in a state where you're in a state where you're in a state where you're in a state where you're in a state where you're in a state.
Theoretically, refugees share responsibility in all parts of the world.
In fact, we're talking about a geographical problem where countries next to the conflict zone take over by an overwhelming majority of the refugees around the world.
The system doesn't work. It doesn't work. It doesn't work. It doesn't work.
Because we don't apply the rules properly to the changing world, we have to reconsider them.
I'm going to talk a little bit about how this is going to work.
I'll explain a little bit.
But I'm going to tell you from the point of view of refugees, not from the top-down perspective of the system.
(Laughter)
Let's call him Amira.
A woman who represents a lot of people in that area.
Amira, like 25 percent of the world's refugees, is a woman and a child, and the reason she can't go home is because she lived in a city like this.
We're not in a situation where we can go home.
But there is no way for Amira to re-inhabitable in Third World because it's kind of like a lottery, and it's only about 1 percent of the world's refugees.
That's why Amira and her family have almost no choice.
There's only three basic options.
I'm going to talk about two things.
There's no hope for Amira and her family in the future, even though they're being helped.
The refugee camps are barren, barren, many of them in the desert.
At the Taliban camp in Jordan, you can hear bullets on the Syrian border at night.
And that's what I'm going to talk about today.
It's not a good education, it's not a good education, it's not a good education.
And of all the refugees living in camps around the world, about 80 percent of them go on like this for at least five years.
And if you're a Syrian, the life there is miserable, and that's probably why only 9 percent of the Syrians actually choose this path.
And then there's the choice of moving towards cities, such as Amman and Beirut in neighboring countries.
This is the choice that 75 percent of the Syrian refugees chose.
But there's also a great deal of difficulty.
The refugees usually don't have the right to work in these cities.
I can't take any of your help.
In this case, Amira and her family, after spending so much of their savings, have almost nothing left to live in urban poverty.
The third choice is the choice between the Syrians and the Syrians, and the Syrians and the Syrians and the Syrians and the Syrians and the Syrians and the Syrians and the Syrians and the Syrians and the Syrians and the Syrians and the Syrians and the Syrians and the Syrians and the Syrians and the Syrians and the Syrians and the Syrians and the Syrians and the Syrians and the Syrians and the Syrians and the Syrians and the Syrians and the Syrians and the Syrians and the Syrians and the Syrians and the Syrians and the Syrians and the Syrians and the Syrians and the Syrians and the Syrians and the Syrians and the Syrians and the Syrians and the Syrians and the Syrians and the Syrians and the Syrians and the Syrians and the Syrians and the Syrians and the Syrians and the Syrians and the Syrians and the Syrians and the Syrians and the Syrians and the Syrians, and the Syrians and the Syrians and the Syrians and the Syrians and the Syrians and the Syrians and the Syrians and the Syrians and the Syrians. and the Syrians and the Syrians.
It's a phenomenon that we see today in Europe today, where people want a handful of hope for their families, and they're willing to risk their lives to go on a very dangerous journey to other countries.
There are three choices: camping, urban poverty, and dangerous journeys.
And that's what I'm going to talk about today.
(Laughter)
I think there's room for reassessment.
The only reason we have these choices is because we think that this is the only option that refugees can choose in our minds, but that's a mistake.
The politicians believe that the refugee problem is a "zero-sum problem," that is, if we do something for the refugees, it's going to be a burden for the citizens.
So what I'd like to talk about today is a common assumption that refugees tend to be a burden, a burden, a burden, a burden in society.
There's also a way for refugees to contribute to society.
What I'm trying to say is that there are ways in which we can increase our choice of refugees and yet benefit ourselves.
And I think there are four ways that we can change the way that we think about refugees.
What I want to talk to you about today is a way that we all have one thing in common, a way that we take advantage of the opportunities of globalization, of liquidity, of markets, of changing our way of looking at the refugee problem.
The first idea I'd like to talk to you about is the environment for refugees, which starts with very basic perceptions, that refugees are just the same people they are, that they're in very unusual situations.
I started doing research in Uganda with a colleague at Oxford University, and I looked at refugee economic activity in Uganda.
It wasn't because we chose Uganda, or because we chose Uganda, or because we chose Uganda, or because we chose Uganda, or because we chose Uganda, or because we chose Uganda, or because we chose Uganda, or because we chose Uganda, or because we chose Uganda, or because we chose Uganda, or because we chose Uganda, or because we chose Uganda, or because we chose Uganda, or because we chose Uganda, or because we chose Uganda, or because we chose Uganda, or because we chose Uganda.
And it's a very important thing, because it's a very good policy.
And unlike other adopted countries around the world, Uganda has given refugees economic opportunities.
They gave the refugees the right to work, the freedom to move.
This has been a remarkable success in both refugee and refugee communities.
In the capital, Campala, 21 percent of the refugees had businesses, employees, and 40 percent of the people who were hired were adopted citizens.
It's not just that we've seen it in the last few years, it's that refugees have created jobs, they've hired people to accept them.
We've seen wonderful examples of personal projects that are very active, even in refugee camps.
For example, in a refugee camp called Naquivare, Congolese refugees have been engaged in a business that deals with digital music, and they've been able to get access to it.
One of the projects set up by a Rwandan refugee was to provide video games and televisions for young people.
In spite of the harsh environment, innovation is under way.
When I arrived in the living room, I had almost no money, but I wanted to be a film artist.
He's working with his friends and colleagues, and he's setting up a community radio station, and he's borrowing video cameras, and he's now doing video work.
We've been working together on two documentary clips that my team has asked me to do, and we've been able to make a success of our business with a few hands.
We need to look at these examples to determine how we deal with the refugees.
We need to give refugees an opportunity to thrive as human beings, not to view refugees as necessarily dependent on humanitarian aid.
And of course, clothes, beds, sleeping places, food, everything that's important in an emergency, but we need to look beyond that.
And that's what we're going to do.
And we have to offer them the benefits of the world economy, which is what we can do, which is possible for the refugees, and should be.
(Laughter)
I'm sorry to say that not all of the world's refugee-resistant countries have a policy like Uganda.
Most countries don't welcome refugees into a part of the economy in a way like Uganda.
But there's a practical idea that can be used.
I went to Jordan last April with Paul Collier, a co-worker and developmental economist.
So, we've come up with a way to give the Syrians jobs, an idea about economic districts, to figure out the possibility that they're going to hire refugees, and they're going to do it with the employment of the Jordanese people.
There's an economic zone just 15 minutes away from a refugee camp where 83,000 refugees live.
The Jordan government put over a million dollars into this area, connected it to the power grid and the road grid, but there are two things missing: labor and internal investment.
What if the refugees couldn't work here, they couldn't stay in camps, feed their families, learn their skills through their trade training, and then return to Syria?
I thought this would be useful for Jordan, because development of Jordan as a middle-income country requires the development of domestic manufacturing.
It's good for the refugees, but it's also good for post-conflict Syria.
(Laughter)
King Abdra hasn't seen it.
There's been an announcement this summer at a Syrian support meeting in London two weeks ago that it's going to be conducted on a test this summer.
(Laughter) (Applause)
It's very rare to ask refugees where they want to go and where they want to go.
The idea of matching theory developed by economist Alvin Ross is to determine the final combination by the selection of the parties.
My colleagues Will Jones and Alex Tetervoy have found a way to apply this concept to refugees, where they're given a choice of where they want to go and where they want to go, and when they're given priority in terms of job skills, language and so forth.
Now, of course, we should also consider the terms of acceptance, the diversity, the vulnerability, and so forth, as a way to increase the matching rate.
The concept of matching is used well, for example, in college acceptance of students, kidney donors and patients.
We're not going to do that. We're not going to do that. We're not going to do that. We're not going to do that.
We can use it on a global scale, on a global scale, because one of the big challenges we face is to convince local communities to accept refugees.
Now, in Britain, for example, in my country, we often do the stupid thing to send engineers to the rurals and to the cities.
So if you do a market match, you can match their wishes, and you can hear their needs and needs from the people who accepted them and from the refugees.
(Laughter)
Most of the tragedies and chaos that are taking place in Europe are completely avoidable.
It's because of the fundamental contradictions between the European refugees and the European refugees, which is that, in order to become refugees in Europe, we have to make that dangerous journey without preparatory preparation.
In this time of full-scale airlines and consul services, travel like this should not be necessary at all, but last year, more than 3,000 people died in Europe's borders, within Europe's borders.
The simple thing is, if a refugee is allowed to go to Europe normally and become a refugee, then the way to do this is called a humanitarian visa, and you get visas at the embassys and consuls in the neighboring country.
A thousand euros to cross from Turkey to the Greek islands using smugglers.
There's 200 euros on the flight from Bodorm to Frankfurt.
There's a big advantage to free refugees of these choices.
It's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone.
It's not rational policy, it's policy policy that's hindering these measures.
(Laughter)
It was the first time that Brazil took this approach, and over 2,000 Syrians got their humanitarian visas and entered Brazil, and when they arrived, they got their refugee status.
All of the Syrians who used this system have attained the status of refugees and have been officially recognized as refugees.
There's an example of this in history.
During 1922 and 1942, there were 450,000 Assyrians, Turks, Chechnyas, who moved around Europe and applied for refugees in other European countries.
The Nansen International Refugee Office won the Nobel Peace Prize, and this realistic strategy was recognized by the world.
And I'm going to show you how all four of the ideas that I've just talked about are ways to increase the options that we're talking about -- the temporary refugees, the Amiras, the choices that we're talking about.
It's a way to expand the range of options for refugees, and it doesn't have to be the only three irrational choices we've talked about in the first place, and that's why others get the benefit.
And to conclude, we really need a new vision, a vision that shows that we don't have to be a burden while expanding our options for refugees.
The idea that refugees are inevitably a burden is wrong.
Now, it's a humane duty, but it's a humane duty, and it's a man of skill, talent, and will.
In the future, the world will never be the same.
It's not going to work. It's not going to work. It's not going to work. It's not going to work.
Refugees continue to move and continue to seek their place, and they should find ways to use opportunities, not based on the old theories of rational, realistic ways of helping people, but on the ideas of charity.
I'd like to talk to all of you, all of you, all of you, all of you, all of you, all of you, and all of you, and all of you, and all of you, and all of you, and all of you, and all of you, and all of you, and all of you, and all of you, and all of you, and all of you, and all of you, and all of you, and all of you, and all of you, and all of you, and all of you, and all of you, and all of you, and all of you, and all of you, and all of you, and all of you, and all of you, and all of you, and all of you.
Thank you very much.
I've been longing for the sea since I was a child.
It's a wonderful place filled with colors and life, home to strange creatures like aliens.
I could imagine a big shark controlling a food chain, and a graceful turtle swimming across a coral reef.
I've moved from a marine biologist to a photographer, so I've devoted most of my work to finding places where I had the magic that I had dreamed of when I was little.
As you can see, I've explored the water since I was quite young.
(Laughter)
And I remember very vividly that I was swimming in the water, and I was trying to touch an old cannon on a shallow coral.
And then I got hold of it, and I looked up, and I was immediately surrounded by colorful fish.
I've been living on Earth for 40 years, Thomas Pesczyk, a photographer, and I've been given the precious opportunity to explore the wonderful landscapes of National Geographic and the Saave Our Seas Foundation.
I've been shooting everything from the huge shark to the pretty thing in the palm of my hand.
And I was there on the cold Canadian coast of the Great Bear Rainforest when a very life-threatening whale came out to feed just a foot away.
And I've been there for a long time, and I've been there for a long time, and I've been there for a long time.
The oceans and everyone on the planet have affected each other.
And it's getting more and more difficult to find a sea that I dreamed of when I was a child.
We're being cornered, we're being threatened, we're being cornered, we're being cornered, we're being cornered, we're being cornered, we're being pushed, we're being pushed, we're being pushed, we're being pushed, we're being pushed, we're being pushed, we're being pushed, we're being pushed, we're being pushed, we're being pushed, we're being pushed, we're being pushed, we're being pushed, we're being pushed, we're being pushed, we're being pushed.
We've been the most powerful captors on the planet, but I've witnessed and filmed the ever-growing effects of this.
I've been thinking for a long time that I'm going to take an interest in people's lives by being shocked by these shocking pictures.
(Laughter)
I thought the best way to make a difference was to appeal to love.
As a photographer, I had a precious opportunity to reveal all the animals and ecosystems hidden beneath the surface of the ocean.
And if you don't know that there's something in there, you can't care about it, you can't defend it.
It's the ability of the photograph to reveal what's behind the scenes.
We've visited hundreds of ocean areas in the past few years, but there's a few of them that are particularly deeply impressed.
The first time I experienced such excitement was 10 years ago off the rocky coast of South Africa.
Each year, in June and July, a huge army of eagles will make a huge move north by the name of Sardin Run.
(Laughter)
It's because the hungry, fast catcher is going after it in secret, with great force.
In general, dolphins hunt in multiple numbers, pull some of them away from the pack, and form a ball-like group called the Bay Ball.
And they're going to push the fish down to the surface of the ocean, and they're going to be caught in this alive and moving feast.
There's a shark right behind you.
Now, there's a lot of people who believe that dolphins and sharks are natural enemies, but they actually live together in the Serdin Run.
The dolphins help sharks to feed efficiently.
Without dolphins, the Bay Ball would be much more dispersal, and sharks would be stuck in so-called Serdin donuts, filled with water, and they wouldn't get anything.
Now, I've had an exciting moment with sharks, and I know they don't see me as bait.
But at this rough banquet, it's as hard as any other fish, or it's hit with a hammer.
And if you go east from the coast of Africa, across the vast Indian Ocean, you go to the coral, the Maldive Islands.
During the hot southwest monsoon season, they come from all over the islands to a very small part of the Baia reef called Hauffar, mostly a large quantity of crustaceans smaller than a person's eyes.
If there's a flea in the place of the plankton, they feed alone, and they turn back and forth, and it looks like a puppy chasing its own tail.
But when the plankton concentrates in one direction, they form a long chain for feeding.
The more plankton they have, the closer they are to each other, the closer they are to each other.
The rays, as they circle in a solid formation, form a series of columns, gather the plankton in a vortex, and they carry it to their cave-like mouth.
I'm going to tell you a story, and I'm going to tell you a story, and I'm going to tell you a story, and I'm going to tell you a story, and I'm going to tell you a story, and I'm going to tell you a story, and I'm going to tell you a story, and I'm going to tell you a story, and I'm going to tell you a story, and I'm going to tell you a story, and I'm going to tell you a story, and I'm going to tell you a story, and I'm going to tell you about it, and I'm going to tell you about it, and I'm going to tell you about it.
When I first shot it at Ha Ni, it was not protected, it was threatened by development.
And by working with NGOs like Manta Trust, my picture eventually helped Ha Ni become a marine reserve.
The fishermen on the neighboring islands used to catch them to make their traditional drums in the hides of the rays.
Now they're more zealous in protecting themselves than anyone else, and thanks to rays, they're making $8 million more dollars a year in Maldives.
I always wanted to go back to the past, where maps were almost empty, where dragons were written.
One of the closest things I've ever been to that time was the western reef of the Indian Ocean.
If you go far away from sea traffic and fishing fleets, you can see how the sea used to be very painful.
Most of you probably haven't heard of a small coral reef in the Mozambican Channel called Vassus da Indiana.
This is a coral reef, and it's a barrier, and the reef lake inside is a breeding ground for shark sharks.
This shark can't be a coward even during the day.
I had the idea that at night, I would be more bold and more likely to come out.
Have you ever encountered so many sharks in a single coral dewdrop?
And I'm going to share with you a moment like this, and I'm going to remind you of why I went this way.
(Laughter)
About half the Pacific side of the peninsula is San Ignacio Lagoon, an important breeding ground for gray whales.
It's been over a hundred years, but over 20,000 gray whales have been killed, and only hundreds of them have survived.
Now, the whale's offspring are able to push their children to the surface of the ocean to play with and even interact with us.
(Laughter)
Now on the other side of the peninsula is a quiet fishing town called Kabo Purmo.
It was on the verge of collapse after decades of dispersal.
In 1995, a local fisherman asked that the sea be designated as a marine reserve.
And then what happened was nothing more than a miracle.
In 2005, even though it's only been 10 years since we started protecting the fish, the fish population has recovered unscathed.
But look at it for yourself. Let's go together.
Let's take a breath, go deep, swim into the biggest and most dense fish I've ever encountered.
It's not just about hope. It's about hope. It's about hope.
I want to tell you, through my photographs, that it's not too late to protect our oceans.
I want to focus on the ability of nature to recover, especially in the face of 73 billion people.
And what I'm hoping is that if we don't look very closely in the future, we won't get this kind of picture, and we're going to take it as a sample of how we interact with the ocean.
I just hope it's going to happen every day.
You have to be an extremely optimistic in order to survive in my profession.
I'm always working under assumptions, and I'm wondering if there's a wonderful picture of change just around the corner, beyond the coral there, in the lagoon, or one more thing.
In 1985, when I moved to Harare, social justice was set at the heart of Zimbabwe's medical policy.
At the end of the long, independent war, a new regime immediately declared a socialist policy, basically free medical services and primary education.
In the last two hours, about 80 percent of the population has been able to reach the health care facility within two hours of walking.
In 1980, when Zimbabwe was independent, there were 25 percent inoculation rates for children in the country.
In 1990, only 10 years later, 80 percent.
(Laughter)
I couldn't help but see the excitement and the unity of the people.
I felt like I had become part of the world's cutting edge public health movement, not just in Africa, but also in the very talented scientists, doctors and activists there.
But there was a terrible problem.
The year I arrived, 1985, the first case of AIDS in Zimbabwe was reported.
When I was in the early 80s, I visited some of the patients who had AIDS at the Harem General Hospital, but I had no idea what was on the way to Africa.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about HlV in the early days of my stay.
It was 17 years after I left Harare that I was infected with one out of every four adults.
By the mid-90s, I had told hundreds of workers that they were HIV positive.
I went through the death of my colleagues and friends, and I saw the death of my students and my patients.
(Laughter)
And I'm going to show you how to use condoms, and I'm going to show you how to use condoms, and I'm going to show you how to use condoms, and I'm going to show you how to use condoms.
I'm going to start sex education at school and at work.
We can do a case study, we can teach the infected partner how to prevent it.
And I was working really hard, and at the time, I thought I was doing my best.
I thought that I was doing a good job of treating my patients.
But I wasn't doing anything that would require structural reform.
Mr. Kofi Annan, former U.N. Secretary General, frankly, his own fault has led to Rwanda's slaughter.
And he told me that he was going to send a group of people to kill him, and in 1994, when the massacre happened, he was the president of the United Nations, and he was the president of the United States, and he was the president of the United States, and he was the president of the United States, and he was the president of the United States, and he was the president of the United States, and he was the president of the United States, and he was the president of the United States, and he was the president of the United States, and he was the president of the United States, and he was the president of the United States, and he was the president of the United States, and he was the president of the United States, and he was the president of the United States, and he was the president of the United States, and he was the president of the United States, and he was the president of the United States.
When I looked back at the memorial service for the 10th year of the massacre, I realized that I was doing my best at that time, but there was a massacre, and I realized there was something I could do, and there was something I had to do to get help."
I'm not the only one who regrets that I should have acted sooner now, when the World Health Organization predicts that 39 million people have lost their lives to AIDS.
But while I was in Zimbabwe, I didn't think of myself in a position to promote change or in a political setting.
I came here as a clinical doctor and epidemiologist, because I've been working on my own expertise.
And I thought, well, in my mind, my job is to look after the patient, to do research, to understand more about the infectious patterns of the population, so that I could stop the spread of this virus.
I realized that there was a high risk of AlDS and death due to social weakness.
In the early 1980s, 60 percent of pregnant women were HIV positive in a farm that was founded in the mansions of what is now the Cane Farm rather than any other company in the modern world.
And I taught them that the fact that they were infected was not the same as the fact that they were infected; rather, they were the product of male superiority, of forced labor, of colonialism.
The white population has suffered very little.
As health care workers, we were so helpless that we begged people to use condoms to change their behavior.
And it wasn't until the 1960s that the epidemic began to increase, and drugs were developed in the West, and AIDS is still the most effective form of treatment in Africa, but it was out of reach for any public sector in Africa.
I didn't say anything about the fact that I couldn't get an equal supply of life-saving drugs, or the political and economic systems that are at the root of the AIDS epidemic, or the mechanisms that have caused so much infection.
And I thought to myself, "I'm not a resident of this country, and if I sound the alarm, I can't even get a good job out of the country, and I won't be able to treat patients, and I won't be able to do the research I need."
So I didn't say anything about the government's policy against AIDS at that time.
I didn't argue enough about my concerns.
And I'm sure many of the doctors and health workers would have thought that I wasn't wrong.
It's the promise of the doctor to the patient, and the other version of it is the sanctity of the relationship between the doctor and the patient.
I did everything I could, and I did everything I could for every one of my patients.
But I realized that this epidemic was a reflection of social distortion, not only of biological causes, but also of ethnic, gender, sexuality, social, and so on.
And that's what we're going to talk about.
(Laughter)
So, what I'm going to talk about here is what I'm going to talk about in this video, and I'm going to talk about in this video, and I'm going to talk about in the next video, and I'm going to talk about this in a little bit, and I'm going to talk about in a second, and I'm going to talk about in a little bit about what I'm going to talk about, and I'm going to talk about in a little bit about, and I'm going to talk about in a little bit about this video, and I'm going to talk about in a little bit about this video, and I'm going to talk about in a little bit about a little bit about this video, and I'm going to talk about a little bit about that I'm going to talk about today, and I'm going to talk about, and I'm going to talk about a little bit about a little bit about a little bit about what I'm going to talk about a little bit about today, and I'll talk about, and I'll talk about a little bit about a little bit about, because I'll talk about a little bit about a little bit about, because I'll show you about what I'll talk about, and a little bit bit about, and a little bit about this video about a little bit about what I'll talk about a little bit about a little bit about what I'll show a little bit about what I'll talk about what I'll talk about, because I'll show you.
If you want to be of any use to your patients in any way, don't forget to recognize these social inequalitys.
And it's the first step in making public health work, so that we can gather our partners together and make real change.
That's why I'm not silent these days.
They're talking about a lot of things, even when they're uncomfortable with the listener, even when they're uncomfortable with themselves.
So I'm going to talk to you today about many things that should no longer exist in this country, such as racial disparity and institutional discrimination, but much less in the field of medicine and public health.
And that's the price that people pay for it, because it's the price that people lose their lives because they don't live.
So it is central to my mission as director of New York City's health, to warn against the racial discrimination of American health, the violence that is now taking place in the institutions, the humans, the humans, and the peoples of color, and to warn against the 250 years of slavery left in the United States, the nine decades of the Jim Claw system and the increased violence of 60 years of imperfect equality.
In fact, in New York City, the death rate for young men under 65 is 50 percent higher than for white men.
In 2012, black women died more than 10 times as often as white women.
Now, even though the survival rate of babies has improved dramatically, black babies still have nearly three times the risk of dying at the age of one year.
It's not just New York. It's not just New York.
And that's what I'm going to talk about today.
A recent New York Times analysis shows that 1.5 million black men are missing throughout the United States.
According to the article, today more than one in six black men between the ages of 25 and 54 disappeared from their daily lives.
There's a lot of injustice in the world today, and there's a lot of violence that happens every day to young black men, which is the object of a protest known as "BackLives Mutter."
But what we need to remember is that each one of them has a different incidence of common disease, which continues to occur, which slowly slows to death, such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and AIDS.
When the "BarkLives Matheter" movement started, I felt frustrated and angry, because in the medical world, even using the word "racial" in research and at work has been prevented.
(Laughter)
And in fact, in the last few years, most people in the medical world have stood by and watched as medical students dressed in white, protesting, and still continue to influence the appearance and mortality of disease.
The modern trend toward individualized medicine and intensive medicine is to miss out on the overall picture in the field of biological and genetic research, and the daily environment in which people live, grow, work, work, and love each other most affects the health of so many.
As a health care worker, we see a lot of injustice in our daily jobs, in our clinics and in our research, because there are even more desperate priorities that homeless people can't follow the doctor's guidance.
And what I'm going to tell you today is that the role of a doctor as a health worker is not just to treat patients, but to call attention, to become a therapist for change.
It's not just the rights, it's the rights, it's the right thing to do, but it's the right thing to say, and it's the right thing to do.
I'm sorry that I didn't speak out in Zimbabwe, and I took an oath to myself that I would use my opportunity as the head of health care in New York City, and that I would call attention and help improve the gap between health care and health care.
And I'm also going to stand up to racial discrimination, and I'm going to help you, and I'm going to help you when you stand up to gender discrimination in any other way.
Now is the time for us to stand up and speak up as a group against structural inequality.
You don't have to know all the answers to call for change.
I just need courage.
The health of our patients, our health of all of us, is at stake.
Now, I'd like to ask you to do something for me, but have any of you ever removed your friends on Facebook because you've made some unpleasant comments about politics, religion, child rearing, food?
Is there at least one person who doesn't want to talk about it, who doesn't want to talk about it?
I wish I had told you about the weather and the health of the day, and I wish I had told you the words of Professor Higgins of "My Fair Lady" to be polite.
In recent years, climate change and anti-inoculation have not been a safe topic.
In the world in which we live, every conversation can develop into a controversy, and politicians can't talk to each other, and there are people who are very much in favor of even the smallest of problems.
And when the Puy Institute looked at 10,000 American adults, it turns out that people are now more polarized than ever before in history, and they are at odds with each other.
They don't want to compromise. They don't want to listen.
And it's because we already believe where we live and who we marry and who we're friends with.
(Laughter)
You know, conversation requires a balance between talking and listening, but we've lost that balance somewhere.
It's one of the reasons for the development of technology.
I'm sure you'll find that your mobile phone is either still in your hands or within your reach.
According to the Puy Institute, one third of teenagers send more than 100 messages a day.
And I think that most of those people are more likely to be texting than talking to face-to-face.
(Laughter)
There's an interesting article by a high school teacher named Paul Burnwell.
(Laughter)
I wanted to teach you how to talk about specific subjects without using a note.
(Laughter)
"The ability to talk is the most neglected skill that teachers fail to teach."
Students spend hours on the screen every day dealing with ideas and other people, but they have little opportunity to improve their social skills.
And I said, "Well, this may sound strange, but we're going to have to ask ourselves, is there anything more important than the ability to communicate in a reasonable and confident way in the 21st century?"
I'm a Nobel Prize winner, a truck driver, a billionaire, a kindergarten teacher, a state head, a plumber.
I'm going to talk to people I like, and I'm going to talk to people I don't like, and I'm going to talk to people I don't like.
I talk to people who, personally, don't agree with each other at all.
(Laughter)
I'm going to show you how to speak and how to listen in the next 10 minutes.
I'm sure you've heard a lot about the secrets of conversation, about looking at the other person's eyes, thinking about interesting topics in advance, looking at the other person, smiling at him, repeating what he said, and thinking about him again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again.
Forget all that.
It doesn't help.
You don't have to learn how to make it look like you're listening carefully.
(Laughter) (Applause)
I'm going to teach you the art of interviewing, and I'm going to teach you how to talk to each other so that you can improve your conversation, and learn how to talk to each other without wasting your time, without getting bored, without hurting the other.
We've all had great conversations.
I know what it is.
It's the kind of conversation that I feel when I'm part of a conversation, when I'm in the middle of a conversation, when I'm in the middle of something, when I'm in the middle of something, when I'm in the middle of something, when I'm in the middle of something, when I'm in the middle of something, when I'm in the middle of something, when I'm in the middle of something, when I'm in the middle of something, when I'm in the middle of something, when I'm in the middle of something, when I'm in the middle of something, when I'm in the middle of something, when I'm in the middle of something, when I'm in the middle of something, when I'm in the middle of something, when I'm in the middle of something, when I'm in the middle of something, when I'm in the middle, when I'm in the middle, when I'm in the middle, when I's, when I'm in the middle, when I'm in the middle, when I'm in the middle, when I'm in the middle, when I'm in the middle, when I'm in the middle, when I'm in the middle, when I'm in the middle, when I'm in the middle, when I'm in the middle, when I'm in the middle with someone, when I'm in the middle, when I'm in the middle, when I'm in the middle, when I'm in the middle, when I'm in the middle, when I'm in the middle, when I't.
There's no reason why most of our conversations can't be like that.
So let's take a look at 10 basic rules of conversation together, one of which is that if you master one of them, you can enjoy better conversation.
One of them is, "I don't want to do this."
It's not only that you stop playing with your cell phone, with your tablet, with your car keys.
That's where you are. That's where you're going. That's where you're going. that's where you're going. that's where you're going. that's where you're going. that's where you're going. that's where you're going to be. that's where you're going to be. that's where you're going to be. that's where you're going to be.
I want you to be in that moment.
Don't think about arguing with your boss.
Don't think about what you're going to have for dinner.
If you want to get out of the conversation, please step out.
Two: Don't talk one-on-one.
If you want to argue your opinion without a response, without a argument, without a chance to argue, without a chance to grow up, you can write a blog.
The reason I'm not on my show is because it's boring.
If you're a conservative, you don't like Obama, you don't like food stamps, you don't like abortions.
If you're a liberal, you don't like big banks, oil companies, Dick Cheney.
I understand what you're saying.
You don't have to be like that.
We need to come to the conversation with the attitude that there must be something to learn.
The famous therapist, M. Scott peck, says, "I really need to put myself aside in order to listen."
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
"The feeling that it's accepted makes the speaker feel vulnerable, and makes his audience see him deep down in the heart."
I repeat, come here with a learning attitude.
"Everybody you meet knows something you don't know."
I would say, "Everyone is an expert."
I'm going to ask you three questions about free answers.
Let's take a look at the journalist.
When/where/who/what/why/how do we start asking questions?
I'm going to ask you a simple question, and it's going to give you an easy answer.
And I said, "You're scared, aren't you?"
And the answer is yes, or no, in this case, in this case, I was afraid, and the answer is yes or no.
"Are you mad?" "Yes, I was very angry."
Let him explain. That's what he knows.
And I'm like, "What's going on?"
"How did you feel?"
And if you do that, you're going to have to stop and think, and you're going to get a much more interesting answer.
That's what I'm talking about.
I have to get him out of here.
If you've ever heard an interview like this, you've probably heard an interview like this, where the questions asked by the conductor are completely irrelevant, or you've been answering before, or you've been talking about it, or you've been talking about it for hours, or you've been talking about it for hours, or you've been talking about it for a long time, or you've been talking about it for a long time, or you've been talking about it for a long time, or you've been talking about it for a long time, or you've been talking about it for a long time, or you've been talking for a long time, or you've been talking for a long time, or you've been talking for a long time, or you've been talking for a long time, or you've been talking for a long time, or you've been talking for a long time, or you've been talking for a long time.
So, I was thinking about this, and I thought, well, maybe the conductor stopped listening two minutes ago, and he thought about this and decided that he had to say this.
We're doing exactly the same thing.
And when I'm sitting there talking to someone, I think to myself that I met an actor named Hugh Jackman at a coffee shop.
It's not about listening. It's about listening. It's about listening.
(Laughter)
I'll just let it go. I'll let it go.
"I'll tell you I don't know if I don't know."
We're very careful when we say that we know what we're talking about, especially when we're on the radio, because we know that what we're talking about is going to be on record.
(Laughter) (Applause)
Don't make it cheap.
"You must not identify your opponent's experience with your own."
And one of the things that I want to talk to you about when I'm talking about the loss of my family is that I don't want to bring up the story of my loss.
And one of the things that I want to talk to you about when you're talking about trouble at the office is that you don't talk about how much you hate your job.
It's a very different experience from what you've been through.
Every experience is unique.
I'm not talking about myself. I'm not talking about myself.
I don't have to show you how wonderful you are and how embarrassed you are to have an opportunity to do that.
Steve Hawking was asked by his IQ, and he said, "Well, I don't know, I'm not proud of IQ, I'm a loser."
And I think that conversation is not an opportunity for self-advertising.
"How's it going today?" "Look at your blog." "Don't say the same thing over and over again."
It's a lot of work, but it's a lot of work.
And when you're talking to people, especially at work, or when you're talking to kids, you change your words, and you repeat them, trying to show them that you're right, that you're right, that you're right, that you're wrong, that you're wrong, that you're wrong, that you're wrong, that you're wrong, that you're wrong, that you're wrong, that you're wrong, that you're wrong, that you're wrong, that you're wrong, that you're wrong, that you're wrong, that you're wrong, that you're wrong, that you're wrong, that you're wrong, that you're wrong, that you're wrong, that you're wrong.
Don't do that.
"I don't care about details."
And frankly, they don't care about details, like the year or the name or the date.
I'm not interested. I'm interested in you.
Who you are and what you have in common.
So let's forget the details. We don't need them.
That's nine. That's not the last one, but it's the most important one.
To hear.
I don't know how many great people have said this, but listening is the most important skill anyone can develop.
And I'm going to tell you a little bit about what the Buddha said, and I'm going to change it a little bit, but I don't learn anything when I'm open.
"No one was fired because of what he heard."
Why don't we ask each other?
One thing I'd rather talk about than ask you.
And I'm going to tell you a little bit about what I'm going to talk about.
You don't have to tell me you're not interested.
You're gonna have to pay attention.
It's not just about identity, it's also about identity, it's about identity, it's about identity, it's about identity, it's about identity, it's about identity, it's about identity, it's about identity, it's about identity, it's about identity, it's about identity, it's about identity, it's about identity, it's about identity, it's about identity, it's about identity.
But there's another reason. It's to distract us.
The average person speaks 225 words a minute, but we can hear 500 words a minute.
And that's what we're trying to do, and that's what we're trying to do.
It takes effort and energy to keep an eye on the other person, but if you can't do that, you're not having a conversation.
They're in the same place. They're yelling at each other.
We have to ask each other.
(Laughter)
And I said, "Well, I don't think so."
I'm asking you to answer."
There's another rule.
(Laughter) (Applause)
I grew up in a very famous grandfather.
When I was a kid, a lot of people came to talk to my grandparents, and after they left, my mother came and she said, "Do you know who that is?"
She's become the Submis America.
He's the mayor of Sacramento.
She's a Pulitzer Prize winner. He's a Russian ballet dancer.
So I thought everyone had something amazing to hide.
I've come to believe that I'm going to be a good host.
I hope you'll be able to open your mouth and open your heart and impress me as much as you can.
I'd like you all to do the same.
The most important thing is to go out and talk to people and listen to them and, most importantly, expect them to be impressed.
Thank you very much for listening.
Hello.
My name is Matthew Williams. I'm a champion.
I've won a third sport in all of Canada's national championships, and I'm honored to be a Canadian champion of the World Cup.
(Laughter) (Applause)
By the way, this is all about the Special Olympics.
Does that change your view of what I and I have done?
The world doesn't always view people like me as champions.
Until recently, people like me were out of touch and out of sight.
In many cases, intellectually disabled people are invisible to the vast world, and they've changed a lot since the special Olympics began in 1968.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about it, but everybody doesn't think it's wrong to use discrimination in front of me.
We use the word "driven late" with contempt.
So you don't think about how much hurt I or my people are.
Don't think I'm here for pity.
I'm here because there's still serious problems in the world's view of intellectually disabled people, and in so many cases, there's nothing to see.
Did you know there was a world convention this year?
I was one of the 65,000 athletes who had mental disabilities.
There were over 62,000 spectators watching the opening ceremony, and the TSN and ESPN at Sports Television were broadcasting live.
You didn't know that, did you?
What do you think when you see someone like me?
What I'm going to talk about today is a challenge for all of you.
The Special Olympics can change the identity of the mentally disabled athletes, and the values of all those who see them.
And I'm going to talk about the special Olympics for people I don't know, and I'm going to talk about the special Olympics.
It's not like Paralyn Pick or the Olympics.
It's a high level sports event held throughout the year for the mentally disabled, changing the lives and values of those involved.
This has changed my life, and it has changed the lives of millions of other people.
And the eyes of the world are changing when we look at the mentally disabled.
I'm born with epilepsy and mental disorders.
I've been playing hockey since I was a little girl, and I've been playing hockey since I was 12.
And as I grew older, it became increasingly difficult to keep up with people, and I was frustrated and angry.
I was away from sports for a while, and I didn't have a lot of friends, and I felt sad that I was left behind.
And that's what I'm going to tell you about today.
I don't know if I could take part in sports, or maybe I could be a valuable member of society.
In the 1960s, Dr. Frank Hayden, a scientist at the University of Toronto, studied the effects of regular exercise on children's mental disorders.
The conclusion reached by Dr. Hayden and other researchers by means of a strictly scientific method of research is:
And I think that for those with mental disabilities, exercise programs and sports events are useful.
There wasn't a lot of people who believed that they were right, but the pioneers, Dr. Hayden, and the founder of the Special Olympics, Eunice Kennedy Schlaber, didn't give up, and the athletes have proved that they were right over four and a half million times.
(Laughter) (Applause)
But when I went there, everyone was encouraging and supporting me, and I couldn't care less about people's eyes, and I couldn't be who I was.
Now I'm a basketball and speed skater, and I've been in state and national competitions, and this year I've held the summer World Cup in L.A., and I'm a Canadian for the first time as a member of the World Cup team.
(Laughter) (Applause)
Being a special Olympic player, we can regain our pride and dignity.
The Special Olympics also meet vital health needs for athletes.
According to research, the average life expectancy of men with mental disorders is 13 years shorter than that of the average person, and for women, 20 years shorter.
I'm not sure what I'm going to do, but I'm going to do a special Olympic event, and I'm going to be able to move myself, and I'm going to be able to stay healthy.
And it's not just about food, it's also about nutrition. It's about health.
In the Special Olympics, we're providing free health care, and what we're going to do is we're going to have students who are having difficulty communicating with doctors, and they're not going to be able to get access to medical care.
In the summer of 2015, my team, Canada, fought a basketball team in Nigeria.
The day before the match, the Nigerian team had a public health exam, and seven out of 10 of them received free hearing aid for the first time in their lives.
(Laughter) (Applause)
I was playing with my coach, and I was playing with my hands, and I was playing with my hands, and I was playing with my hands, and I was playing with my hands, and I was playing with my hands, and I was playing with my hands, because I was able to communicate with my coach, and I was able to communicate with my hands, and I was able to play with my hands, and I was able to play with my hands, and I was able to play with my hands, and I was able to play with my hands, and I was able to play with my hands, and I was able to play with my hands, and I was able to play with my hands, and I was able to play with my hands, and I was able to play with my hands, and I was able to play with my hands.
And I was so excited because I could hear the sound of the ball, and the sound of the whistle, and the cheers of the fans standing there.
(Laughter)
It's not just a game, it's a game, it's a game, it's a game, it's a game, it's a game, it's a game, it's a game, it's a game, it's a game, it's a game, it's a game, it's a game, it's a game, it's a game, it's a game, it's a game, it's a game, it's a game, it's a game, it's a game, it's a game, it's a game, it's a game.
According to the results of this year's survey, nearly half of American adults don't know anyone who has mental disorders, and 44 percent of Americans, they have a very low-receptive, significantly negative view of the disabled.
And the fact is that there's a lot of discrimination in the language, and there's a lot of evidence that intellectually disabled people are still invisible to so many people.
We all use it as an easy way to express ourselves, or as a mean word to say things.
The word "driven late" is more than nine million Tweets last year, but it's a very damaging word to me and to my four and a half million athletes around the world.
We don't all think we're going to be insulted, but that's a mistake.
My friend, John Franklin Stevens, a global messenger of mine, wrote a short note to a political critic that made a big difference in terms of discrimination.
"Please try and see if you can go home without being moved."
(Laughter) (Applause)
We've all been on standby, and my teammate, Jackie Bartlett, as we call it, has lifted 297 kilos in a deadlift and raised 277 kilos in a squawk, and we've made a significant update on our top record at the Special Olympics.
Jackie is the record holder on the island of Newfoundland, not just the Special Olympics, but the entire weight raisers.
And he became a big star in L.A., and the ESPN posted his new record live.
50 years ago, almost no one thought that an intellectually disabled person could do that.
This year, 60,000 spectators buried that famous L.A. Memorial Coliseum to watch the opening ceremonies of the world games and to cheer up athletes from 165 countries around the world.
We're not a secret being, we're a cheerleader.
The Special Olympics teach athletes to have confidence and pride.
And it tells people in the world that intellectually disabled people deserve respect and acceptance.
(Laughter) (Applause)
(Laughter) (Applause)
(Laughter) (Applause)
The next time you see a person with an intellectual disorder, you need to see what he's capable of.
I want you to tell me how terrible it is to see someone who speaks a different language.
And I want you to think about getting involved in the Special Olympics.
(Laughter) (Applause)
(Laughter)
The Special Olympics are really changing the world, and the four-and-a-half million athletes have a place of rebirth, a place of confidence, a place of friends, no prejudice, and they can actually be champions.
Thank you very much.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this place called Kenya, in Sierra Leone, Alua, Nigeria.
It's one of the rarest places I've ever seen.
In the hospitals there, nurses, doctors and scientists have quietly fought one of the most terrible enemies of humanity for many years.
The lassa virus is very similar to the Ebola virus.
It causes a high fever, sometimes even death.
But they're putting their lives at risk every day, and they're protecting all of us from the local communities.
But the most amazing thing about my visit years ago was that every morning, they began singing and singing about every single day in a very harsh front line.
We're all here to show our joy.
Show me your energy.
And I'm going to tell you that over the years, we've been visiting each other, we've been together, we've been singing, we've been singing, we've been singing, we're not there just for the sake of science, we're not there for the sake of human love.
I think you can imagine that as things change, things become very important.
And that changed a lot in March 2014 when the outbreak of Ebola was declared in Guinea.
This was the first break in West Africa near the border between Sierra Leone and Libya.
We were afraid.
In fact, for a while, we thought that Lasa and Ebola were more infected than we'd ever imagined, and that one day we'd get to Kennedy.
So my team immediately acted to join Dr. Fimmer Khan's team, where they prepared a sensitive viral RNA detector so that when she reached the border area, she could detect it.
I had already used this kind of device to counter the lassa virus, so I knew how to do it, and the team was very good.
All they had to do was provide them with tools and places to test Eva.
But unfortunately, that day came.
On May 23, 2014, a woman was admitted to a hospital obstetric ward, and a team went through a virus RNA test to confirm the first case of Ebola fever in Sierra Leone.
They didn't have a lot of money, they didn't have a lot of money, they didn't have a lot of money, they didn't have a lot of money, they didn't have a lot of money, they didn't have a lot of money, they didn't have a lot of money, they didn't have a lot of money, they didn't have a lot of money, they didn't have a lot of money, they didn't have a lot of money, they didn't have a lot of money, they didn't have a lot of money.
So what we did was, we took this case immediately, and we started tracking people to make sure that they were safe, that they were able to figure out what was going on.
It could have stopped the spread of the infection early.
But by that day, the blackout had already been going on for months.
We've had hundreds of cases where we've gone beyond the break-ins that we had before.
When we reached Sierra Leone, it wasn't just another case, it was a tsunami.
We've been working with international communities, health departments, and Kennedy's offices to deal with this infection, and the next week we've had 31 cases, and 92 and 147 cases, all of our patients have been in Kennedy because there's a limited facility in Sierra Leone that can deal with this disease.
We did everything we could for 24 hours to save the patients and alert them, and then we did one simple thing.
Of course, the blood samples from the patients that we were taking to detect Ebola were destroyed.
Instead, they used drugs to inactivate the virus, put a blood sample in a box, and then send it over the ocean to other labs.
I sent him to Boston, where my team is.
I was working day and night on my shift every day, and I was quick to analyze 99 genomems of the Ebola virus.
And that's what we're looking at here.
And that's what I'm going to talk about. I'm going to tell you a little bit about what I'm going to talk about.
And that's what makes us so different from all the other things that make us so different from each other.
It's very simple, but it's very powerful.
And we've been able to look at 99 viruses and compare them to the three genomes previously published in Guinea, and we've been able to figure out that the blackout started months ago in Guinea.
It's very important to figure out how we should intervene, but it's important to follow up on the contact.
We've confirmed that as the virus infects humans, it's a mutation.
It's very important to observe each one of these mutations, because all of these things are essentially based on the genomic sequences of diagnostics, vaccines, treatments, and so on.
We need international health experts to do something about this, and we need to adjust everything we've done so far.
So what I was doing at that time as a scientist was, first of all, I was putting data into the lab for months, months, months, months, months, months, months, months, months, and months of careful analysis of the data and a series of interactions, and finally, when the paper was published, I would release the data.
This is the current trend in the research of scientists.
But you couldn't be doing that, could you?
And what was clear to me was that my friends were on the front lines, and I needed help, and I needed a lot of help.
So the first thing I did was, after the genom sequence was read, I immediately published it on my website.
And I didn't know what to do with it, but I did send the data straight to the world and I said, "Help me out."
And help came.
I got a call from people all over the world who were surprised to see the data released.
The number one virus tracking team in the world suddenly became one of us.
So I started working with the virtual world, and then the phone and e-mails, and I figured out how to track the virus in minutes and stop the spread of the virus.
It's not like that. It's not like that. It's not like that. It's like that.
And I'm going to tell you a little bit about that, and I'm going to tell you that, especially when the blackouts started to spread around the world, everybody was going to be active, they were going to be involved, they were going to be able to lend them power.
And they wanted to be part of it, they wanted to be part of it, they wanted to be part of it, they wanted to be part of it, they wanted to be part of it, they wanted to be part of it, they wanted to be part of it, they wanted to be part of it, they wanted to be part of it, they wanted to be part of it, they wanted to be part of it, they wanted to be part of it, they wanted to be part of it, they wanted to be part of it, they wanted to be part of it, they wanted to be part of it, they wanted to be part of it, they wanted to be part of it, they wanted to be part of it, they wanted to be part of it, they wanted to be part of it, they wanted to be part of it.
And I think that's a really amazing ability for people like that to be around the world, and the Internet will connect us all.
Imagine that we're all going to be doing this rather than looking at each other as a threat to each other.
And I said, "Well, we're going to do this together."
The problem was that we were all using data that we were looking for on the Internet, and it was very limited and inadequate.
And when that happens, there's a lot of potential, and there's no chance.
In the early days of the Kennema epidemic, 106 cartels gathered around it, and we decided to spread it around the world.
And our labs have demonstrated from 106 examples that computers can predict the outcome of a victim's life in close to 100 percent accuracy.
So we've created an app that allows us to give people information, but the app works well, and to prove that, we're going to be able to do that, and we're going to be able to do that, and we're going to be able to do that, and we're going to be able to do that, and we're going to be able to do that, and we're going to be able to be able to do that, and we're going to be able to be able to do that, and we're going to be able to be able to be able to do that, and we're going to be able to be able to be able to be able to do that.
We were waiting for more data to arrive at the release.
(Laughter)
I mean, we all studied, thought, and waited for each other, but we were all in the silos, and we weren't using the power of cooperation.
But this can't be right. This can't be right.
Isn't that what you think?
Our lives are at stake.
In fact, many lives have been lost, including five medical personnel, five of my precious work associates, Dr. Bal Foney, Alex Moguvoy, Dr. Fam Khan, Alice Koboma, and Mohammed Fuller.
They were five of the many medical personnel who died in Kenya and around it, and then we were working in silence and breaking apart while the world was waiting for us.
Hemorrhagic fever is the same as the threat to other humans.
When we build walls between us, the virus becomes more powerful.
But unlike any other natural threat, the battle against Ebola is just as much about us as it is about us all.
We're fighting together.
If someone gets infected with Ebola, it could infect someone else right away.
I hope that our lives are just as vulnerable, that we have the same life force, that we have the same fear, that we have the same hope, that we can happily cooperate together.
One of my graduate students read a book about Sierra Leone and found that the city's name, "Kennema," which is the name of the city's Mende, actually means, "It's clear like a river, it's invisible to everyone."
And I felt a deep sense of that because before I knew it, we've always respected the people of Kenya, and we've been trying to share information and work together in an open environment.
That's important.
Because when the blackout occurs, it requires us to share information without fear, without fear, with ourselves or everyone around us, to fight it together.
It's not the first outbreak, it's not the last.
And when the next epidemic occurs, it may occur in a big city where millions of people live.
It could be an air-infected virus.
It's possible that the virus could be spread deliberately.
It's a very scary thing, but at the same time, what this experience taught us is that we have both the skills and the ability to overcome the virus.
But as long as we work together, we can do it with joy.
The people who died in the fight against infectious diseases, Dr. Khan, and the people who died on the front lines, they've been fighting with us all along.
Let's light the world with billions of warm hearts and compassions so that we don't let one virus destroy it.
Thank you very much.
