On this broadcast, there will be a book called "Students of the World Had I worked hard at it, I'd have been the most hated teacher I'd ever known."
Suzuki, who ran a model debut in the Garr magazine in 2007, at the age of 18.
Ever since I first appeared on TV in 2011, I've been busy and involved in high-pressure talks and over-reactions, rascaling and playing barry.
That kind of tree won first place in "The Hated Woman Running" section of a weekly magazine this year in the U.S.
In addition, they say they've been elected second in the whole entertainment world.
As a result, his mother was shocked, and his husband was able to play at work, and he was in trouble with his own family.
In class, I look back on the steps of the tree as a talent and how I've reached the top of "I don't like women running."
It's said that the background of all the talk and reaction in the Suzuki's excessive talk was from a master's word.
Moreover, not only the reaction, but also the "full body contact" and "full-sharing" and "full-sharing" and "all-sharing" &amp;amp; so on &amp;amp; so on &amp;amp; so on &amp;amp; so forth &amp;amp; so on &amp;amp; so on &amp;amp; so forth
In the past, when you show the body touch that Suzuki used to go to the big movie star, the rudeness of it caused the studios and the studios to shake.
And immediately after the ground wave broadcasts, we're sending out a full edition of the class and a laughing team.
Also, the private stories about my husband, which I was exposed to in order to increase the scene of the explosions and the events of the time of Suzuki.

It's not safe to drive with high heels!
(Music) (Music) (Music) (Music ends) (Music ends) (Music ends) (Music ends) (Music ends) (Music ends)
A violation of traffic laws.
It's a big mistake to think that it's only a matter of old drivers.
In the number of misdiagnosed cases, the highest number of accidents in the history of the United States is under 24 and the highest number of accidents over 75.
The mistakes are by no means common to older people, but it is important to call attention to younger people as well.
Do you want me to take some of that shit from under your feet?
You want me to make it safe?
Unlike the elderly, who are often considered to be infertile, driving skills, reflexes, and so on, this data does not list men and women's or causes, there is also the possibility of mistakes in the younger generation because they are distracted by other things, such as music, conversation, and clothing.
Among other things, women choose their shoes according to their high heels, Pamps, Sandals, Muir and others choose their shoes and drive them as they are.
Some people know it's not suitable to drive, but it's difficult to change clothes, but many drive without any thought of the danger.
But driving with high heels and sandals violates road traffic laws.
One is: "Make sure you operate the steering wheel, brake and other operations," and "Do not drive so as to harm the person who caused the accident."
And the other is the 71th Article, which determines that the drivers must observe the requirements of each State Security Council's security committee. For example, the 12th rule is: "Abstain your shoes, slippers, shoes, high heels, and other drivers in such a way as to prevent you from driving with them, or do not drive in such a way as to prevent you from driving. "
The same is true of driving in each Tokyo prefecture, as well as in the High Strategy, which is a violation of "a possible obstacle to driving" without writing it down.
Then why is it dangerous to drive with high heels?
It's obvious when you think of the basics for safe pedal operations.
For a secure pedal operation, first place your heel on the floor, then place your foot straight against the brake pedal, and then turn your foot to the right when you step on it.
At this point it is important to keep your heels firmly fixed so that no matter what car you're driving, your heels don't break.
However, the high heels have a smaller area on the floor with a smaller heel, and it will always break, and the lower foot will be too small to fit properly on the pedal, so that the whole foot will have an angle at the height of the heel.
This could lead to danger.
Also, most cars have floor carpets, which are easy to catch on to heels of high heels, such as an emergency brake, where heels get stuck and pedals don't work, or where heels take off their heels on the ankles, so that they don't fit in the back of the pedal, and they don't step in the back of the pedal.
In addition, there are cases where the heel stuck behind the pedal and the Axel pedal stopped coming back.

On September 27th, the yo-yo car and the SUBARUs are agreed to a new business capital partnership.
The yo-yo gets additional Svalbard stock and relates to the application of possession law.
Ever since they agreed on a business partnership in 2005, both companies have been working together in the development of the Sval's capacity to produce the yogi car, the supply of cars from yog to sbar, and the joint development of the FR sports car '86'.
We've also agreed to work on EV platforms and EV vehicles in June, using Sval's AWD, and yo-yo's electric-powered technology.
In the business capital agreement that we agreed on this, the yogata gets an additional svalbar.
The Svalbard stock currently owned by the yo-yo has a resolution ratio of 16.83%, but it gets added until it reaches 20%.
Sval will be associated with the application of yoga's derivatives.
Sval, on the other hand, gets a yo-boo stock worth as much as the yogi's amount of money to get the svalbar stock.
Both companies developed and strengthened cooperation through their business capital partnerships.
We're going to move forward with a joint development of the AWD model, with a joint development of the 86/BRZ model, with the TSV-Suttone hybrid system on the wheel, with cooperation in connection with the connected area, with technology in the auto-driven field.
It's the lowest form of access to the United States and refugees in three consecutive years.
In 26 days and 20 20 years of accounting, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced a policy to reduce the limit of refugees from all parts of the world to 18,000.
The minimum number of refugees since 1980 has been updated in three consecutive years.
In view of the election of next year's president, the card administration is going to appeal to the conservatives for strict immigration and refugee policies.
While people are being chased from various parts of the country, criticisms from human rights groups and others are inevitable.
The former Obama administration set the limit of 17 years to 110,000, but the card administration that started in January of 17 covered it and cut it down to 50,000.
18 years have been reduced by 45,000, and 19 years by 30,000 year by year.

The Ministry of Labor sent a document to make sure that there are no similar cases in the whole country, and that there are no similar cases, and that they can be taught according to the need.
According to the Department of Labor, several institutions have been checked to increase prices since October, as well as to increase the cost of incomes for children over three years of age to be provided for.
There were also complaints at the free-for-profit call centers set up by the House of Representatives.
The Ministry of Labor says there must be no reason for the increase.
The 100th national gym in "D-8" is on fire.
A sacred fire broke out in the 100th national athletic Games in Korea's easternmost island, Akira.

Kim Bjönsche's head said, "There's been no reason for us to put up with our economy in Japan today and claim that the island is our own land." And he emphasized that "all the people should be united in this national athletic competition."
The deputy chairman and the head of Kim County went on fire with them.
The Holy Fire was handed over to the first runner, Captain Ho-Kong-Song Ho-Fi, the head of the Holy Fire, to Ho-Wong-Sog.
This solo fire event was scheduled for the 21st, but it was postponed this day up north of typhoon 17.

Captain Ho inherited it from the landing site of the Helicopter to the middle of the island, and the officers from the middle of the island to the dock.
This sacred fire moves to Xubashima Island on the Watchable Island Bridge, where Kim Sonho and Kim County heads are moved in order to Seoul by relay.

We're going to go to the shelter, and we're going to go to the shelter, and we're going to talk about the victims, and we're going to go to Livve, the newspaper, and we're going to take care of them, and we're going to take care of them, and we're going to take care of them, and we're going to take care of them, and we're going to take care of them, and we're going to take care of them, and we're going to take care of them, and we're going to take care of them, and we're going to take care of them, and we're going to take care of them. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
We're going to take a bath and enjoy the Seoul Food in the big town.
In the 25th and 25th days, the Great Town Council for the Big Town Management of the Big Town, built at a store that provides "Kinjio" Noodles, acted as a "Kinai" in the town of Miyumi, which is a refuge for the heavy rain victims.
Since the time we had the Toshima coal mine, our beloved soul food has encouraged those who suffered.
"All we can do is cook and have them eat us."
Four grocery stores on the menu helped make 90 meals and then transport them to a shelter.
I added a lot of meat, shrimp, vegetables and other ingredients.
Not only the people in shelters, but also those in the baths where the Self-Fire is setting up offered "The Taste of the Big Town."
I've been a fan since I was young, but I haven't eaten for the first time since I moved in about a year ago.
The vice-president Fujisakiro, who had finished cooking, rushed in and said, "I'll help you get back to your daily routine if there's anything I can do."
Even when the power goes out, water is secured, and the water main is running through the building. &gt;&gt;A residence building in Hokkaido. &gt;&gt;Naida News &gt;&gt;electronic. &gt;&gt;&gt;Hugo Barra:
We're taking action in an apartment building in the city of the warehouse where there was a dehydration after the blackout due to last September's earthquake in the east.
According to the city's corporate and public water department, in the first year after the quake, seven apartment buildings have set up a drain that can pump out water even after the power is out.
More than four - story apartments and private housing that are being supplied with water at the water tank during the blackout have about 400 buildings in the city and the same group is calling for a plan.
The water supply system of the house is very divided, and there are two "oppositories" that feed directly to each door from city water pipes, as well as the water supply that is stored underground and on rooftops and other water tanks.
The water tank system, even if the water supply has not been damaged, if the electric pump that pumps water from the water from the water can't move because of a blackout, it won't be able to water, and each door will be shut.
Training for a disaster in Aomori prefecture.
Training to search and rescue those who were lost before the autumn mushroom harvest season was practiced in the Shingo village.
Sixty people from the police, fire, and hunting parties participated in the training at Shirazuzawa Forest Park in the Japanese village.
At the opening ceremony, Chief Koda of the Police Department called out, "I want you to work closely together and encourage your training."
I'm going to begin training for mountain training and rescue.
The training was based on the assumption that a man who went out to look at the mushroom harvest would not come home at night.
The participants will search the mountain for the name of the missing man in three teams.
In the Japanese village, a 70-year-old man who went into the mountain in June to pick up vegetables is missing and is being rescued from injury the next day.
In my training, I found a man injured, and I checked the connection between the search and rescue going down on the platform, checking to see if there was any trouble, and preparing for the fall season when the mushroom harvest is likely to occur.

It's a painful story of how the chief member of the Yakuza and the I.A. team who's not interested in making a contribution to society will take over the rebuilding of the nearly bankrupt high school and solve a number of difficult problems indecision.
Nishita, a strong but undetestable partner, plays West Island's number two day-to-day village where he's always being run around by his parents.
Nishishima's first day "I've been nervous all this time" and has an unfeeling face.
"Not only during the shoot, but after the shooting, this member has always been a very united team, so much so that he's been talking about a lot of things."
Ito laughed and said, "I also had a simple drinking party called "responsibilities," which was a plus for the field as well. Teamwork improved and motivation increased. After the end, there was a lot of good memories."
The story of the drinking party also revealed the unexpected face of West Island.
Nishishima confessed, "When you're having a condolence meeting with this member, you've got too much to drink and often don't remember half of it."
Nishita said, "I don't know what it looks like, but I don't know what it's like." He said, "You look like a slaff, but you're drunk, aren't you?" and he smiled at the audience.
He showed his desire to use your help and to work hard toward the series, and he felt sorry for Ito and the middle part because Nishita were watching the movie and Nishita was singing. Then he said, "Now I want to sing" and the wooden manager got big applause.

In connection with the disaster at Toyo Fukushima and the subsequent testing operations on fishing off the coast of Fukushima, discussions with locals and districts have been decided upon.
On the 27th and 27th days, the union chairman's union board was held in the prefecture of the prefecture in central Japan.
The Union Chiefs Association has also approved a formal addition to the fish species for testing operations as far as Kazago, Sacramas, and Murasi are off the coast of Fukushima where the shipping restrictions have been lifted.
The remaining water products became the two fish species of the vinos and common cascasbe.
After the end of the program, the President of the U.S.
In response to the treatment of water after purifying the water of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, he said: "Keren-chair discussion is a problem. It doesn't change the position of opposition to ocean emissions."
In his discussion of the operation, Egawa's director of the Good City Fishing Union pointed out that "you need to blow up opinions from below" and respected the union's wishes.
After the substrates held a meeting and resolved each problem they had, they came to a conclusion as city fishing cooperation.
Shinji Shibuya, director of the Bicyon fishing group, says that "you need to discuss it with the fishermen as well as with the brokers."
In order to receive the support of the United States and to have seven new ships next year, he said, "It's important to get back the catch first." He showed him the idea of moving along with the discussion of full - time fishing and environmental maintenance.
I'm here today to talk to you about how to drive, how to smoke, how to get better.
I'm asking you to drive safely.
In accordance with the "City of Traffic Safety in the fall" movement, the China tobacco sales association carried out its street activity on 26 days, in the streets of Sakura, Sakura, in the city center of Tanguzu City.
About ten others, including union members, joined in and called the driver to drive safely.
The participants gave the driver flyers, ballpoint pens, etc., while saying, "Please drive safely."
To encourage the ban on tobacco pop, I gave her a cell phone tablet along with me and complained about improving her smoking habits.
The union's Kumamoto Koto (80) said that there are more accidents every year, more recently, and more driving. Be careful how you behave and drive.
"Beautiful and Ugly" is a piece of paper?

What do you have in common with mysterious beauty and shadows?
Since the 1950s, works have been sent to the world, and the "Cysto-Girl Collection" has been released in August of the year 2019.
When you hold it in your hand, you'll notice the correlation between the beauty of your work and fear.
Is it attractive because there's a shadow?
(Music) (Music ends) (Music ends) (Music ends) (Music ends) (Music ends) (Music ends)
There's a saying in the opening chapter of the "Beautiful Girl Collection" that "their beauty, their horror, their horror, their impact, and their development at the opposite end of the story," but the contrast between the beautiful faces and the ignominious look on their faces... could make a difference.
There's a word for "snake" in many of the works, but snakes can be viewed by the viewer as "horrible creatures," or people who feel "beauty" and how they receive it.
There are some people in the world who like reptiles, and there are others who are just not good at it.
So, by the sensitivity of the viewer, "beautiful" and "ugly" may be both "snake" and "snake" creatures.
Also, this creature is regarded as a higher-powered creature than in ancient times, and it is believed that the home in which the White Snake resides is blessed.
I'm going to tell you about my work on the "Snake" in 1965, and I'm going to tell you about the "Mama's Bad!" series "The Snake Girl" and "The Little Girl" in the series.
In general, being a "naked woman" is the equivalent of being a shadowed beauty.
I think it's kind of cool, if you put it this way, it's kind of like the type of "Courtby." It's kind of like what girls have in common in their drawings.
Among other things, from 1969 to 1969, "The Loki" is a beautiful girl character, representing the work of art, but there is something that reminds me of "the snake" - a part of a hundred years of deep sleep to keep eternal life and eternal youth.
Seven students from Savier High School are mayor.
In 26 days, seven students who studied at the principal's office in Savier High Matsumoto went to see the mayor of Fujita, Fujida City in Mt. Fuji on the 26th of the 26th day.
The students told the students what they wanted to do during their stay, and Mayor Fujita encouraged them to live a meaningful school life.
Using The Asian Bridge Project by the Ministry of Science, high school students from around the world will be attending the next month.
Six girls from China, Cambodia, Mongolia, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia and Malaysia live in dorms at that school for eight months.
Turkish boys spend ten months in school doing home-steee work.
Students who visit city hall, one by one, introduce themselves in Japanese.
Regarding the city's impression, I said, "If you're taking a walk, someone you don't know will take you home. It's quiet and nice."
I also said, "I want to see Mt. Fuji while I'm in Japan."
In addition to that, I told the girls living in dormitories that I had access to host families and that I was looking forward to volunteering to the library.
Mayor Fujita called out, "I'd like you to experience and experience actively. You'll invite friends and host families to join us at the city's Halloween events next month and yours in San Park."
Deputy Minister Yamamoto, eat Tweets, and explain the cause of the helicopter crash.
Deputy Minister of Defense Yamamoto Yamamoto submitted a comment along with a photo of the Ishida Defense Secretary of the Protection Minister, and then deleted the Twitter screen.
When the Deputy Minister of Defense Yamamoto Yamamoto ate at a fiesta shop in Saga, he removed a comment from Twitter that said, "It's delicious."
Mr. Yamamoto entered the county on the 26th day to explain to the local community the results of the accident of AH64D, the AH64D rescue guard, last February.
That same night, Tweets said, "I've been on a business trip to Saga prefecture!"
I posted a comment like, "It's delicious."
In the accident, the girl in the house was attacked and two of the men were killed.
Mr. Yamamoto was elected four times by the House of Representatives and was elected in proportion to that.
The "child's Diary" circle has spread throughout the country.
According to studies by NPO officials and others, about 3700 sites are active throughout the country this year.
In Fukui prefecture there were 24 places last year that increased by 9 in proportion to 1 and 6 times as much as in 2018.
I don't know why I'm in the nursery right now.
A social activist named Yuasa-san, the chief director of the NPO law, told the background and meaning of a lecture held in Osaka City.
Old age makes the area lonely, and the shopping districts fall apart.
There's no place for people to meet.
It's like, "I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know."
It's called the Seung Jo's Diary, but it's also a multi-generation exchange site for older people.
Not only do we lose the food we eat alone, but we also contribute to the support of the elderly and to the health of the elderly.
Cut through the poor chain and cheer up the community.

From the first month of the month to the last day of the day.
The auditoriums range in size from a few people to hundreds, and from private homes to temples.
I'm beginning to feel like someone who wants to do it.
I'm fascinated by the low level of the threshold.
It's just hard to keep operating expenses and staff.
Sometimes we hear about problems such as security management.
Even though Yuasa-san's relationship with so many people can change values, connecting with society can become a safety net for disaster and other things.
It's like the light of hope in a closed society.
The first day of the High School Fukui County convention in the fall is September 29th and will be finals and third place in the county district.
The finals will be won at the fall games by Tsutomu, who will be at the top of his fourth year. He will fight for the first time in 36 years.
The centrifuge of the Seed School won three games in a row.
At the finals with the Northland, Aesshima made a final victory at Pitching, which is the most important place in the world.
The line is good for 13 cheap hits, and I want to cover the finals.
I won the contest against it from no-seed.
The semi-revealed finals took place at one point, and in the semi-revealal with Hani, they ran away with three minus one, and so on.
Even at the finals, I want to be sure that I'm going to connect my chances to the score.
The third-graduate battle that took place in the remaining one frame of the northern championships was the Northland Hanazawa.
Northland has a semi-winning point, a field base, and a bant. But I'd like to get back on track in third place.
On the other hand, Hani has now attracted the attention of the competition to defeating the mighty Fukui construction project.
I'm not sure if I can win northeastern in third place.

We've got eight new models of Air Force 1, including the NBA corroboror and the "Gothex" model.
"Niki NIKE" has been popular since 1982 as a sneaker representing brands.
Three of the eight models are for Willings, and the Night's Footware, senior creative director, George James Goeorga James, says that women are a variety of beings and want things that are different from other people's perspectives.
There are eight new models of Air Force 1st, including the NBA corroboror and the Gothex model.
The "Air Force 1 NBA Pack," which was co-founded with NBA, appeared in two types of low-cut and high-cut.
Lowcut is a color ring based on NBA color red, yellow, black, and Navy, while highcuts are expanded by three teams of Unihome Colors, including Los Angeles Lakes ANGELES.
In addition to the NBA logo in heels and shottan, the satin fabric is used toward the rear of the uppercut, and the eyebrows are designed for the first bicolor design.
The price is 13,200 yen in taxes and will be released on October 1st.
The Air Force 1-Suishpack is designed for use in the language of the sush characters and logos.
It's interesting to note that even the shot section of the brand logo should have been changed to the character of a special "SWOOSH."
The character "air force 1 shadow" is a shadow, such as the side splash and so on.
While the autosor is heavier and higher than the original, the hollowing of the heart has made it pleasant and lighter for women.
The price is 13,200 yen in taxes and will be released on October 3rd.
"The real killer" who attacked Saudi Arabia's oil facility.
"The Iranian drone "Abbabe" used in this bombing has dramatically improved its performance in recent years by analyzing the drone of the U.S. military that crashed.
It's cheaply manufactured and has a navigable range of about 1,000 kilometers.
It's also an advantage to be caught by radar because it's too low to be caught by radar."
On September 14, 10 military drones bombed the oil facility of the largest oil company in Saudi Arabia, Sauziramco.
Right after this, Yemen's anti-government organization, Hussi, is making a statement.
"What's behind the Hussi sect is the Iran led by President Lohjo. Iran cannot allow hostile Saudi Arabia to make money on oil while its country can't export oil. If you continue to ban oil on Iran, you're going to make it known to the international community that there's a corresponding pain."
After the bombing, half of Saudi Arabia's oil production stopped, and oil prices rose 15%.
Some people say the oil shock will come back.
With that out of the way, Iran will continue to strike the Husse people in secret. But the United States will not be able to endure. It is very likely that they will ever decide to attack Iran.
The "represent war" between the United States and Iran is facing an explosive crisis.
That's why YouTuber, a meta-human, became a legitimate employee.

YouTuber, now so popular with young people.
Although it's not uncommon now for companies to start and use their products for advertising, there's a company that's started a unique system called YouTuber.
It's a company's CCRM and customer management. It's a company's primary business. It's a company's direct marketing mix, DmMMIX.
What does it mean to adopt YouTuber?
I spoke to Mr. Komori, who is the chairman of the DmMIX and who is actually the director of the company that YouTuber hired, and who is the first member of YouTuber's staff.
I want to support young people who work hard on YouTube.
- What do you mean by "YouTuber" in the first place?
(YouTuber) Now, your career as a YouTuber has become the envy of many young people.
Since elementary school students are at the top of the list even if they want to work in the future, there will be more and more young people who will want to continue.
So far, our company has adopted and supported young people who are pursuing their dreams of bandmen and laughrs.
In the same way, it's "YouTuber" to hire and support young people who are pursuing your dream of becoming YouTuber.
I've got an image of YouTuber as an individual who voluntarily submits videos, but why did you want to do it?
Koforan: While many young people are eager for a career called YouTuber, most YouTubers are not able to make the kind of revenue they thought you would.
There are not many creators who do videomaking and post while working part-time or who can't be recognized by their family as YouTuber.
In this approach, you will provide your adopted creator with an environment for salary and content production.
I'm going to support your work by supporting the depreciation of your work as YouTuber, which will make you unstable at first.

"I hope Korea will return to GSOMINA."
On the 27th of the 27th, Deputy Deputy Secretary of the U.S.
It's unusual for a high-ranking U.S. official to refer to the re-examination of GSOMINA.
GSOMINA is the basis for sharing such things as Japanese, Japanese, American, American, American, Japanese, and U.S.
When Korea violates its treaty with Japan in August, notices will be issued, and if it expires, the framework for protecting military information in Korea will be broken.
Mr. Napper insists, "I can't deal effectively with the crisis without GSOMINA."
"There's time to expire," he urged Korea to return to life.
He said that it was "the first time in history" and said, "The Koreans who share the values of democracy and human rights are essential to a partnership within the alliance."
I'd like to point out that today's deterioration of relations with Korea "will damage U.S. national interests."
He said, "I have no intention of intermediation," but he said, "I play a positive role in helping Korea fill the gap."

An artist from Fukui County, Japan, who was a co-worker in the Fukui prefecture, tried to make books live, and started a crowd fanning on the net to try to publish a creation book that was inspired by legend within the province.
Sawada, who was from Hokkaido and started working as a co-worker since April of this year, said, "I want to convey to you through a illustrated book the affection of Fukui people based on their deep faith."
The donation is made to communicate Toshii's heart.
Sawada works as an artist working on modern art and so on, but he also works as a cooperative team after the return date.
This year, in April of this year, after working as a cook for Nagano, Kumamoto, and Toshimoto, I moved to the pre-city.
Kajiko, I'm trying to build a house in the city from which I've come. I've saved my books.
Sawada, who lived in the city and said, "I was surprised at the depth of the compassion around me for the first time."
It was noted that the city's legend was "The Face of the Lady of the Wife."
It's about a gentle wife who continues to sing in order to help her but doesn't care about being surprised by her face.
"I forgot my hatred and returned with affection and kindness. I felt the origin of the devotion and kindness of the Fukui people."
The hint was given to Sawada-san, who went to the original picture book and, as soon as she got there, went to Yoshizaki's little boy in the city of Yosaki, and completed the story of the gentle demon couple and the boy's appearance.
Starting in June, I was able to live my full career and draw a warm water-colored picture of ten scenes and have all the materials in the picture book.
I'm going to take advantage of my traditional craft's advance paper and produce the cover of the book on Japanese paper.
Reading will help parents and children enjoy the touch of Japanese paper.
The goal of the donation to 600 copies is 850,000 yen.
The deadline is due to the 25th of October.
Kanda-san said, "The mind of Fukui, who has been raised in a historic Buddhist culture, is proud of the whole country.
"I want to tell you what it is to be truly kind, to be compassionate, that has been passed on to children through picture books."
Fukui County approved 11 projects of regional activation by co-cooperations and entrepreneurs in the province, and one of the projects supported by application and tax.
The Fukui newspaper sends out information, and Fukui Bank is cooperating with management support.

The place where Big Camera Okayama station is being sold so well before tax increase.
On the 28th, after the last weekend before the consumption tax increase, family members came to the grocery store and supermarkets in Okayama prefecture.
There are home-house centers and suits that open special establishments to try to buy whole stores, and suits that sell by pre-cutting winter clothes, as well as shops that are trying to sell.
In the early part of the 30th, the sale of limited prices was carried out in the early part of the 30th.
When he came to the store looking for a refrigerator, he said, "Even though 2% is expensive, we can't overlook the difference."
According to the store, television sets, washing machines, refrigerators, and other large household appliances will go up in September, and sales will be about twice as high as they were last year.
"Increasing demand is more than imagined. In the latter part of the day, customers who want higher prices stand out."
It's the same business as selling suits to carry out a sale that has been labeled "pre-decision pre-tax tax."
They have sold their coats since early September, a month earlier than usual, and said that this month's sales have increased by 10 percent than the previous year.
"The ceremony is still ahead of us, but I want to buy it before I go to tax."
This tax increase puts the tax rate for drinking and other items, such as food, in the tax-increasing system, so at home centers and supermarkets, they appeal to day-to-day supplies and liquor.
At home center's time store, I'll expand a special section of large-scale cleaning and tissues near the entrance.
Sales of day-to-day waste are one and a half times higher than the previous month, and "We'll be cut out if we don't supply it a day many times."

A van loaded with detergents, toilet paper, and paper diapers will also be set up in the host hall.
(Portuguese man 35) said: "The cost will be very little different from the amount of cash-backed points we receive, so we're not in a hurry to buy day-to-day supplies."

After the "The Best" award ceremony, the German commander claims, "I didn't imagine anything so wonderful. I'm so happy and proud that I won this award. It was a wonderful few days for me. Thanks to my athletes, I was able to win the most important team."
He gets a lot of titles. His style of playing is extraordinary. He's the best director I've ever played, and he's been able to compete with him, and it's an honor to be able to compete with him.
It also refers to Director Pchettino and Tottenham.
"His last year was incredibly wonderful. In many cases, if you don't get a title, there's nothing left in people's memory.
I don't think many experts or myself would have bet on us at the best moment in 2019, but it's like a three to zero death sentence. I can't believe we had a small chance and couldn't believe it. If we look back, we might say, "This game is going to be controlled by CL in our memory."
The last person to ask a more personal question: "When I was blessed with the Binderlyga championship, I didn't even know where I was on a bench. This happened because I was plagued by self-revealation, and I don't like getting drunk. I remember that the blessings of CL domination have all been very modest. I remember that if I put everyone in front of me, I might be able to identify all the people I saw from the bus."

It's made into a special one that enhances wind quality and taste.
Resuss will set up a special train for the Laxurepe "LC" and "Spotysedan" and "IS" and will be released on October 1st.
It's called the "Resus LC"
The special car was developed based on the idea of "CRAFTED."
CRAFTED is a manifestation of a sense of Japanese beauty developed in rich nature and history, a sense of a vague need for words, a desire to move to the person's mind, to move from master's art to the cutting edge of technology, and to create new and exciting experiences.
The LC special car "PATINA Election" based on LC500/LC500, combined with softness and natural tone, using L-ANIINE sheets, and a soft-feeling Premium Resorting.
I finished my wind speed and taste as an even higher model.
The L-ANILINE singles only the topmost skin, and achieves softness with a long process of flexibility and a color coat aimed at a thin coat of its own technology.
It improves the comfort of the seat wrapped up and the fit of the running.
They also use premium leather as well as steerling so that they can feel quality with their skin.
In addition, we made metal with Alcantarololuff and laser Etching, as well as specially equipped with squawk plates and color-head-up displays with heavy L scripts.
In the interior, I'm going to adopt a colorful panna brown for special cars and doortrims, real leather and seat belts and a colorful combination of browns.
It also uses the two colors of light and dark brown with different shades of light, and expresses the quality and depth of space in combination with the obsession.
Body color is a three-color color for specially designed cars, including the Teline Carmike Metallic, and so on, so on and sociological, black glass frequest.
I want to use Sidecar.
According to Apple, the new macaOS Catarina, which will be started during October.
That specific date hasn't been made clear, but maybe it'll be delivered on October 4th?
Is the release of catalys Catalys on October 4th?
The above image has been posted on a Danish Apple site.
The image certainly has the character "fra dan 4. cottobber" starting October 4th.
If it's an official site, the accuracy of the information is likely to be high.
By the way, the last feature I'd like to try in MacaOS Catalina is "Sidecar Sidecar."
This is how you treat iPad as a sub-form of Mac, and this is what you used to do with a third app.
And since Sidecar is an upright feature of Apple, it is expected to be better with perfectness and removation.
There are rumors of the next 16 inches of MacBook Pro, but I'd like to experience this next generation of macaOS.
The growing shrimps, such as P.T. and Shizuoka City, are shooting 290 meters deep.
This year, filmed successfully in the deep waters of Sakura Bay, was born on 11 days off the coast of Shizuoka, Shizuoka City.
Shizuoka City and other grisly industrial clusterers have recently taken a photograph of a shrimp that is believed to have been born at the bottom of the river bay at a depth of 290 meters (290 meters) and was born during the hatching season in the spring of this year.
The video of the growth process is valuable, and the people involved want to connect it to the many mysteries of the shrimp's ecology.
The picture is about three and a half miles off the coast of the city area.
I've identified about 300 birds in 17 minutes.
The traditional knowledge that the shrimps in the deep ocean during the day "are forming a certain swarm at the bottom of the sea" was reassessed.
The adult was about 40 millimeters long, and the individual was about 23 millimeters long.
We cross-referenced the decomposing shrimp with different seasons and identified the egg season.
Detail analysis will be sent to the elite software techs and Shizuoka Industrial Technologies, which make up teams.
The director of the Azuno Project says, "I want to get a live picture of the growth process, including shrimps."
The people of Chiba are back on their mother's farm, free of charge, by the end of October.
It's a mother's farm that's back in business, and the mascot character in Chiba, who welcomes visitors.
Mother's Farm in Chiba, Japan, who had been closed for nine days because of the power failure and damage from typhoon 15 has resumed business for 28 days.
In an effort to increase the area of the disaster, those living in Chiba will be free to enter until the end of October.
The mascot character " Chiba" welcomed us at the entrance gate as many people came to see us under the autumn sun and opened the garden at the same time.
Although the roof is covered with blue sheets and is continuing to be mended, half the restaurant's drinking area has started to resume.
A family visitor, Shibuya Shikiya, a company worker in Kibashi City, said with a smile, "I was worried about when I'd be back again. I'm here to look forward to an event where we'll be back together again. "
(Applause)
On the 28th of the 28th day, the 69th presidential championship championship championship in Hokkaido began at the Hokkaido newspaper in the central area of Tsuzu.
Thirty people entered the competition to compete at the top of the amateurs in Michima and had the best four in it.
It went to the semi- finals (Shotaki-san).....................................................................................
The winner of last year's championship, Asano-san, won the finals by a half eye.
The youngest member in the history of the games, Tokuta Toyo-san, has been defeated by Kyusaka-san, who won first prize in the last year.
Akii-san was out of the game two more times.
The 29th day is from 1:30 p.m. to the finals and finals of all the roads.
From ten o'clock in the morning to the 26th day of the year, we'll have a full-circuit women's championship.
They're all in the area.
(Minmura)
He's a step ahead of us!
Boy Singles.
The Japanese champions who won six medals at the Big Event of Budminton in August, the 25th World Cup, will finish their training camp in early September, and will join the ChinaOP State/ Super 1,000 (Super 1000) which will open from the 17th of September.
Here, looking back on the first half of the fight between May and August, which began next year's five-wheel race in Tokyo, we're going to dream of a male single match for the mid-summer (December).
The five-wheel race of Budminton, which began in May, digested four of the top players 'excellents' competitions (over 500) when they finished world championships.
In the first half of the match, two of the best players will be Hideki Toda and Cho Tienchen from Taiwan, who decorated the second championship during the four games.
To win the World Cup, to win the World Cup, to win the World Cup, to win the Olympic Games, to win the High Point of World Running Point, and to win the five-wheel race.
In addition to that, S750 rules have been passed on.
We've been fighting since May. (May / China)...........................................................................
Compared to other top players, there are few, but it's a schedule that keeps the burden down on the body.
Since August was just one of the world championships, there will be less fatigue than in the war.
You will be asked for good results in a series of middle fights where the top games since September have been held.
It's an ace in Taiwan that's strong for battle.
Look at the young men in Thailand!
The Cypriots who won the top of the Olympic Games, also in IndonesiaOP and Tiops S500, are already in the 7th.
I joined in the September head-of-the-S300, and won an excellent victory.
In the beginning, they were strong, and they didn't make the fight hard.
Even if the convention lasts, there's no big problem with the performance of the game.
In fact, by winning high points in the first half of the game, it would be easier to adjust the schedules for future conventions.
It was an impression of lack of explosive power until last year, but this year, with increased security on the playing field, I was able to continue with my good grades.
I'm afraid I'm going to be a lot more trouble for Seung Jo than I've ever been before.
Except for these two players, the results were left in the last half of the match: Ace Cantaphone, a young man in Thailand, and Cypony B in India.
And the three players of Anders Antonsen, who are struggling to be left alone as the European Powers.
Cantaphones aren't going to win the finals at the top, but they're trying to win the top four in this season.
There's still a rough side to it, but Larry, 20 years old, 18 days old, 21 years old, can be equal to the top player, seems to have a lot of potential for leaping in the five-wheel race.
And Cypnice B..................................................
In addition to Samir Baramas, Pranoi H.S., and Slycans Kidambi, who are injured and delaying, we need to be careful about India after the middle war.
The new cost of a cell phone is reduced by fair competition. &gt;&gt;Naida News:
A new cost plan for a mobile phone company has been set up in connection with October's rerouting communications operations.
But it's been a very high-end end.
The Chief Minister of Justice said there was room for a 40 percent drop last summer, and despite high expectations for lower prices, there was no price competition.
A major factor is that the real entry of the weather has been forwarded and the status of three major companies continues.
For consumers, it is desirable to be an easy charge system for use by fair competition.
I want to make the effort of each cell phone company.
Modification laws prohibit terminals and communication discounts.
Because instead of selling the terminal money cheaply, communication fees were set to go up.
The soft banks and the KDDDIU) announced a plan that would cost up to half their terminals.
But both companies have a system called SIM lock that doesn't have any other line for 100 days.
The NTT dommo makes the terminal's cost up to a third of the total for only its clients on its own line.
It seems that the three companies are continuing their "indentation" to prevent transfers to other companies.
As for SIM locks, the Prime Minister has set up a policy that requires immediate decommission.
The corporate side needs to be dealt with quickly.
The delay of the weather is due to the failure of the network of stations and other communications to follow the plan.
He's dressed up like a shoulder massage, just because he's expected to be a trigger for a low-value race.
I thought it had a soft look.
The start and charge of the full service hasn't been revealed either.
As a company responsible for the social infrastructure, I want you to work on the business.
This time, the charge reformation was triggered by the comment of the Ministerial Office Secretary.
He complained about three new fees: "I think the competition is about to begin. I don't think it's going to be good enough."
I just don't think that "man-made down" is going to distort the market and encourage healthy competition.
The corporate side should develop a competition as competitive as it is in customer life before it comes out from the government.
Each company's charge system is very complicated, and it's not easy to compare.
The Consumers Agency called attention to the fact that while terminals advertise "the maximum amount of money" and so forth, in some cases the consumer's burden is more than half the price.
To avoid misunderstandings on the part of the company itself, we must consider polite and easy-to-recognizable explanations.
Iseshima Hotel's budget is down to 500,000 yen, three credit cards per third state, Ise.
For 26 days, the three-trusted safe within the Third State has decided to lower the amount of cash card dues in order to prevent damage to special fraud.
For the past three years, we've not had more than a certain cash deposit card in ATMs, and we've had more than 70-year-olds in the past three years, we'll have half a million yen per day in cash cards.
The trinitary trust safe and the North Iseshima safe will begin a decline on October 1st and the Akino trust safe will begin November 1st.
There have been a number of special fraud cases in the province, such as financial institutions, law enforcement agencies, and so forth, over cash cards and security numbers and ATMs, and credit safes officials, who say, "We'd like to protect the customer's valuable savings in any way possible. "
We're going to move to the back room of the Rural Dragon.
In addition to the death of Iseshima Hotel in 27 days, Japan's Imprisonment Society has announced that the transfer to the inland room of the Ibunji River, the three wrestlers from the Ibbei Room, and the one from Bedong Mountain, has been approved.
The back room is the same as the Iwner Room.
The master's master's master's father, Hijitaka Tokishima, comes from the Iwner Room and strikes the mother's brother, the mother's brother.
Iwner's parents died suddenly on the 16th, and the cranes were held in the same one mirror room and continued to be discussed.
In the deep room, there are ten fog-horses from Mongolia, the same as Tsurakure, and twelve wrestlers at the fall point.
To U.S. athletes, face-to-face Tuckling is a far cry from "Indignous and mean play."
And I said, "Well, I don't know if that's true, but it's true."
(Whistling) The Japanese games were last seen in 26 days, 20 in 20 countries, and the United States lost it at 7-45 in England.
The black star started off, but FL John Quill played later in the day, the rough play called for waves.
You take a shot in the form of adding a scurder-tuck to the face of the opponent.
The actual scene is also presented by foreign media with videos, and former British champions have complained: "It's insulting and mean play." "It's not something that's called a "tuckle."
"Indulgent and vile play" and a wave of foreign waves!
One shot out, two players in a riot... at the actual moment that Quill, the American representative, played face-to-face risk.
The hot fight has crossed the line.
It's 29 minutes later in the latter part of the week at 0-38.
Deep down in the enemy formation, General Farrell of England lost balance and balance as he caught his side path.
It was Quill that went to the tackle.
I just raised my upper body, not from the waist down, and hit myself hard on the upper body.
The result is that the opponent's head comes into contact with the other person's head and hits him in the head.
Farrell was blown hard and fell down.
The English player who tried to push Quill for a play that obviously wasn't justified.
The two players gathered together at once to form an explosive atmosphere.
As a result, Quill left with a red card.
The bat left the pitch with a bad look on his face, but the crowd asking for fair play asked some questions.
"The local media" staff of New Zealand, the great football player, got the headline "BigW 2019: the U.S. player is out of the game with a mean play and England is out of control."
He reported that he had a mean Shodacher on the face of the English Star Farrell and that it was a fight between the two military players.
In the article, I'd like to introduce to you the comment of former English champions of the organization named Oogo Moña.
"It's insulting, it's not what's called a mean-ass. It's a mean play."
The U.S. lost one game in 81 minutes and managed to get out of the game by a determined test.
But Quill's play left behind a bad taste.
On September 26th, the Ministry of Health and Human Services first published the 424 names of 455 of 1455 public hospitals in the country, such as public hospitals and red hospitals.
In Fukui County, the Ministry of Labor has reviewed the treatment record for 14 public and public hospitals, and has been subject to four small beach hospitals in the prefecture of Tsukishima Hospital, Japan's prefecture Hospital.
The fourth hospital to reassemble is not the standard.
The unusual response was that we needed to encourage reassemble and integration with hospitals in a rival area because of the age-separated health-threatening ban on health care.
In October, we asked the hospital for a serious review of reassemble and integration, and we thought we'd have them come to a decision by September.
There is no force, but fear that there will be no more immediate hospitals predicts the rise of local chiefs and residents.
I made it public at the meeting that same day.
For every 29% of all hospitals, there were relatively few beds.
The ratio was high in the order of 43 and 3% of the mountain.
The number of subjects was 54 in Hokkaido, and Okinawa was the only zero.
On the basis of 2017-year-old data, the Ministry of Labor has studied 1455 hospitals capable of dealing with the "extreme acute" and general emergency surgery for patients in public and public hospitals.
I analyzed whether a rival hospital, such as cancer and emergency medicine, was located "in less than 20 minutes in a car" and decided that the hospital's name needed to be published.
The target hospital will consider abolishing or transfering some medical practice to other hospitals.
Medical expenses rose sharply in 25 years when all of the core generations were 75 years old or older.
For this reason, the Ministry of Labor has set the goal of reducing the number of beds in one hospital to 1191,000 floors throughout the country.
Now, while there are a lot of "high-acute" and expensive beds for nurses and health care, there's a shortage of rehabilitation programs that the elderly need.
In order to cope with aging, we need not only to reduce the number of beds but also to increase the amount of rehabilitation.
In the reassemble and integration of hospitals, we plan a "division of regional medicine" designed to determine the number of beds each Tokyo prefecture needs in 25 years.
The country is divided into 339 sections, and local and medical personnel are discussing it, but many local residents and chiefs remain cautious, and debates are difficult.
The Department of Labor wants to activate the discussion by publishing the name of a hospital whose performance is less than that.
It's been 18 years since I joined the community. &gt;&gt;Narrator:
On September 27, disaster prevention training was conducted in the woods, rice and deer town of Iwashima on the 27th of September.
There were about 400 personnel and residents from 20 different institutions, including roads and three towns.
It's the first time since the Hokkaido Safety Council has arranged a evacuation plan in August for the evacuation of residents.
For the first time in 18 years, residents have been involved in extensive training.
It is assumed that at 8:45 a.m., a fire broke out, and the mud stream reached the town at the foot of the mountain.
When the eruption level was raised to five (the evacuation level was five), shelters were set up in the woods, in both the cities, and residents were moved by buses and police cars provided by each town.

About 100,000 citizens, centered around students who had sympathized with 16 - year - old environmental activist Gregora Tungberg, marched in the city of Vancouver on September 27 to protest against climate change.
I'm going to show you some examples of climate demos in Vancouver.
The march took place from Vancouver city hall across the canvas bridge and down to the library in downtown.
A few hours before the start of the assembly hall, people began to gather with placards, and at the start time, 13 o'clock, the number of people was enough to bury a few blocks of road in front of the city hall.
After that, attendees continued to grow and eventually more than 100,000 attended.
On the road along the way, the police took the road control and watched as everyone walked together for hours.
In accordance with the summit of United Nations climate behavior held in New York City, the city of Vancouver will host a number of events that will consider warming from last weekend to the end of the week.
The 27th day of the last day carried out a school strike called "Fridays for the Future."
Students who were absent from school this day complained to adults that they wanted to keep the earth safe by resting on the important things of school, and saw many adults who were absent from work respond: "We do our best for the future of children who are seriously learning."
- Yeah! - Yeah! News!
In 27 days, to prevent the spread of cattle disease, the Department of Agriculture and Agriculture has published a new bill for anti-intestinal vaccines against the currently unrecognizable pig.
In the area, the policy is to choose nine prefectures, such as
The spread of vaccines, such as live pigs and ovarians, is restricted to the area, but the flow of meat and processed goods is allowed.
With such things as public comment to general public opinion, if you are early, you will plan to complete the procedure in October.
The use of vaccines and recognition of foreign circulation, such as raw meat, may not be a "clean country" approved by the international organization, but may affect the export of pork.
Since last September, Japan had a temporary status in a clean country.
In the amendment, the Ministry of Agriculture has an expert's opinion on areas with high risk of infection from wild animals to pigs.
The Tokyo prefecture will create a "compulsion program" based on the range of inoculations, timing, head count and progress, and allow use by the Ministry to be checked and ruled by the governor.
The other seven provinces, which are listed as an inoculation proposal, are Yaoichi, Tokuyama, Ishigawa, Fukui, Nagano, and Ishino.
The region is determined by understanding the situation when the finger is corrected.
The transfers of pigs, sperm, fertilized eggs, dead bodies, and excreta are restricted to the area as a principle.
When it comes to meat and processed goods, they do not subject themselves to the cost of distribution or the effect on farmers, but, in fact, accept circulation from outside the range.
In order not to spread the virus, we will take care of food garbage thoroughly.
We're going to talk about the safety of the pig we've immunized, and we're going to try to prevent the damage.
The amendment to guidelines was confirmed at a meeting of experts held in the same day and at a meeting at the Center for Defence Control.
From now on, we will continue to review and make public comments at Tokyo State University until October 7 and administer new quarantine needles.
I don't know what you're talking about, but I don't know what you're talking about, I don't know what you're talking about.
"Give me an offer. I don't need money."
9/ 28 (Sun) 2:57
During last season, the Australian A League of Leagues decommissioned Melborn Victory.
Are you really in the game?
The truth of your dreams will be revealed.
The Shinda who updated their Twitters at midnight of the Japanese hours said, "Give me an offer. I don't need money, but I need to play with great teams and great teammates."
The person who sent the "reverse offer" is the world's famous Manchester United.
Why did you make a grand request to one of the most powerful clubs in the Premier League?
The beginning is in an Australian article on FOX Sports published on the 24th.
In an article entitled "Five FWs Possible in the Injury of the Injury of the Injured, " five players who are currently unrecognizable were picked up.
Among the players, such as Hattem Ben Alpha and Jupiter Rossi and Wilfred Bony, were the names of Honda.
At present, injuries such as MF Paul Pogba, DFL Luke Show, FDF Eric Byley, FW Anthony Marlar, FW Marks Laxford, and others are in dire straits.
The "Red Devil," who is leading Orre Gunner Surchard, has been forced to win and lose 222 in the league, and has been forced to lose and suffer, and has been put to the test by the quality of the front lines.
So it was Honda that the Great State Media named as a new candidate for entry.
It was analyzed in the article that "Saida's contract as a player on the creative side, not strictly a striker, can fill the hole that Andreas Perira is filling."
It was pointed out that "the 33-year-old Honda needs to draw complete attention away from his amusements and to attract full attention to the entertainment of the champions of Cambodia."
Does Honda's approach really work?
It's also important to note whether United will move for the Betherun, which is publicly announced as the target next year's opening season in Tokyo.
500 portable translators have been set up.
A mobile translator who gives 500 free-for-profits to a store in Beach Matsu City.
For 26 days, the Beach Matsukataka Institute announced that it was a venture to pay for a portable translator at its member firm "Puqueto" free, and that it had set up 500 of them in stores and other places on the beach.
It's interesting to note that it's the first country in the world to focus on the translation in the same area.
The inside translation of the loan is 236 drinks, 113 retailers, 17 accommodations, and 134 others.
The downtown section of the city makes up 60 percent.
I also started to see where I would lend to the map app "Google Map" so that I could use my smart phone to find out where the "Aquarium for Foreign Language" is.
You can access it from places like the beached lake area and other sites.
The free donation of Poke Talks, corresponding to 74 languages, began in April with the declaration "The Inbound City of Beach" by nine other organizations in Japan.
The firm buys 500 cars and rents them for two years to a medium-sized business that meets conditions such as hospitality authentication and cacheless payment.
The director of the trading center said, "I'd like you to connect me to the pioneer of new foreign customers while the business environment is tight."
Don't you need to get your first T-shirt up now, Kashimura?
Today's best shot.
A 1W shot doesn't always hit with a Tweet.
If you want to earn your distance from a ball on the ground, such as the 2nd punch, you can hit it with a ball on the ground. There's also what is called a "retard" technique.
These days, 1Ws may have a large head volume and have the risk of losing the ball, but some players do this frequently on the tig round too.
Ichimura, who will be waiting for his first victory on the tour.
The 24-year-olds of Pro 7 are smaller than 6'6," but they're currently 7 in the Draving Resistance sector, on average 304.02yd.).
While I was good at long shots, one of the subjects was fairway Wood's precision.
In the spring, I didn't get a shot of Spoon 3W, so I thought I'd try a straight line.
Sometimes you drop a ball on the grass of the tequila from a practice round and you can easily shake off a 1W.
In case Big Carrie is asked for, she uses a lot of tea up, but the two sides use a direct ladder, such as in a small hall.
"You can use a hall with eyes down."
In the ballistics measurer, Carrie has a record of 270yyd280yd.
"That's why I don't need 3W.
From the Japanese tour championships in June, Wood's in the caddy bag is the only one.
The second longest club is the U.N. at 17 degrees Loft.
I'm glad to see the surprise of my tour companions as well. I'm also glad to hear the admiration that leaks from the gallery.
The trick is to roll the club level.
"It's a down blow, an upper end hit, and it's not going straight. If it's in a cut orbit, it's going to go right.
The ball won't get caught, and the slice's at risk, but the left side won't turn.
I'll tell Kantão, but... it's a professional trick that makes me forget.
It's the first time I've been on board.
This is the first season observed in the Tsukoku pond on board.
For the first time in this season, ice was observed for the first time.
Four days later than last year, one day faster than the average of the last ten years.
According to the Board of Flight Management, about 6:25 a.m., an officer patroling the road made sure that there is about two millimeters of ice floating in the west of Tsurke pond.
The weather at the observation was sunny and 3 degrees Celsius.
The lowest temperature in the prefecture this day was nine and a half degrees in the city's state.
Let's go and experience the Paramarital Games!
"Tomorrow, a Caravan event on an ion-name beach."
In 2020, the Tokyo Paralyn Picker's plane was set up, and the Tokyo Sea-Sun-Sun-Sun-Sun-Sun-Sun-Fied Fire Insurance "Creating Caravan Events" began on a small beach called ionmor, 28 days later.
There's a corner where you can experience the six games of the Paralympic Pick, where you can play the basketball, the wheelchair, the game of the wheelchair, the goal ball, the land, the wheelchair football, the six games of the game, and you've got a lot of customers.
Challenge 6 was held from July to October, in the province of Tohoku, and in Fukushima it became a scene.
The paralyzing game is still less famous than the five-wheel game, but through challenge six, by having some experience with the athletes, the goal is to get more people to understand it.
The stadium was wrapped in a yellow costume, and a familiar joker at Getts! came to see Mr. Dandizano, who had enjoyed the games together, and was excited.
On the 29th, a joker named Maggie will be running.
Until the 29th.
The hour is 10 a.m. and 5:00 p.m.
The children's play facilities, the children's children's children, the children's children's children, and the Tsunami's children's children's children's children.
Yamaji City is planning to build it in a way that allows private funds to be used. The city council's official committee, which held 26 days for children's play and the new school's bids for a new school building, held on the 26th of the day.
Picture of a new children's play facility in the mountain valley.
The children's play facility is scheduled to be built in the northernmost part of the valley area, and the property area is about 23400 square meters.
The building is an iron flat, and the floor area is about 3,000 square meters.
Prepare a gym, a café, a library corner, and so on.
There are also 300 parking spaces outside with Universal Design instruments that allow disabled children to play.
On the 5th of this month, a review committee was set up at the city hall, and the shelter group, made up of 13 companies, sold it for three and a half million yen, including the design, the preparation, and the maintenance and management costs of 15 years.
We'll be entering design and construction next January, and we'll be opening in March 2022.

Give me your first copy of the book you wrote before you killed yourself in the river.

It was published in the very last year of his fight against literature by author Yusuke Tanizaki in Japan (in the year 1892), and it was obtained by the Tadashi Village Memorial in the northern part of Tokyo, Japan, by 27 days.

I wonder on Twitter why adults laugh at children and threaten them.
In his speech on September 23th at the summit of United Nations Climate Action in New York, Swedish environmental activist Greta Tounbury.
While the speech is being watched, there are messages coming in that way that insult Greta.
"Why do adults laugh at children and threaten them?"
A political critic in the United States on a TV show said that she was "psychic. She's being used by her parents and her international left wing."
In Japan, too, there are a lot of messages on the Internet that say, "I'm sorry I'm being used," "I should go to school" and "I should go to school" and "I'm not going to go to school" and "I'm not going to go to school."
Then, on September 26 she posted on her own Twitter and said, "Why do adults use their time to mock and threaten teenagers and children?"
"I'm going to come up with every possible lies and conspiracy theory I can think of."
You know, people who hate me are as active as you realize. They're going to follow me around where I'm different. They're going to come up with all the lies and conspiracy theories they can think of.
And I pointed out that adults look like they're missing the point of the story because they don't want to face climate and environmental crises.
I can't understand why adults use their time to ridicule and threaten teenagers and their children. Honestly, I don't understand.
I'll be able to do another good thing during that time.
I think they feel threatened by us.
But don't waste your time on paying any more attention to them.
The world is starting to wake up.
The change is making.
Whether adults like that change or not.
I'll see you on the street on Friday!
Last Friday, on the 20th, there were strikes on climate change in New York and elsewhere around the world.
Greta called on me to do it on Friday 27th.

The 432nd broadcast of Akita TV was heard on August 16 by a professional editor and food expert!
Each of the programs presented a favorite curry shop, a point in the home where professional taste is enjoyed, and an elaborate leather curry secret story.
While the committee's opinion was that "a simple concept or theme is clear" and "carriepan was also interesting to the end, there was such an idea that I could see it from a different perspective than a gurme site," it also said, "I wanted advice for professional curry making."
I don't know what you're talking about, but I'm going to tell you about it.
The final round was held on the 22nd of the "Sinhandenhall" District Convention, in Korea's "Bear's Best Cheongna Golf Club, 7238 yards past 7238 yards per yard.
They're coming to Japan!
Well, we're gonna have to take a Wedgeshot of Garcia.
I was able to extend it to some extent in the first half, so I thought I could do it later in the day, but I felt bad because the pasta was so good and couldn't stretch out.
- Did you see the winner in Eagle 6 and Bardy 7?
After I hit the boogie at number four, there were five of them, so if I wanted to get them back, chip in Eagle came at number 6.
Even though it was a chance to win Bardi at number seven, I regretted that I couldn't reach it later.
- What did you get at the competition?
It was nice that Fairway was able to keep a tight hold on a small course because he wasn't feeling well recently.
I didn't have much experience (so I didn't study much).
- What's the difference?
Like where you could shoot a camera.
I didn't care about myself at all, but I didn't know that the gallery was taking videos or anything.
There wasn't much different about it, but it was just a convention where there were few Japanese players, so I came to the game with the feeling, "I'm not going to lose to foreign athletes."
We're going to go on to the second round, but we're not going to fight for the prize king if we don't win more than one, so I'd like to win another, and in the near ZZO championships, we're going to try to get in the top and qualify for the competition.
What's the best way to prevent Alzheimer's disease and keep it "forgotten"?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Major pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals are trying to develop a drug that's broken down.
However, it seems to me that the relationship between dementia and lifestyles is being resolved, and it's possible to remain extremely mild and forgetful.
I've spoken to Professor Osama from the University Hospital of Japan.
It doesn't go away. It doesn't go away.
- There's been a long wait for cognitive prevention or treatment, but what about the situation?
The difference between bipolar and serious is that everyone in their age can develop dementia.
However, it is thought that it will still take more than 20 years for new cognitive drugs to be developed.
The drug Denebpedil, commonly used in Japan, is already out of insurance in some countries abroad and can't expect a significant cure.
On the other hand, with fewer deaths due to infectious diseases and accidents, with fewer cancers and fewer cancer deaths as a result of significant advances in anti-malarial treatment, people have been able to live longer.
So it's also true that there's an increasing number of people with Alzheimer's.
It's not something you can solve by yourself or your family alone, but you need to make sure that you are safe in the community as a whole.
How to keep it "forgotten."
- Are there people who are prone to dementia and who are hard to be?
Even if it's inevitable that you're going to have a major dementia, it's possible that you'll be able to control the symptoms as much as possible and keep them as much as "forgotten" as possible.
Sensitivity is thought to be one of life - style diseases, and people tend to be more inclined.
First of all, people in Metabo tend to develop dementia.
It's considered to be one of life's habits.
It's a combination of obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes and high cholesterol.
It also affects the lack of economic power.
For example, there are parts of the United States that distribute food tickets to poor people, but the food they get from food tickets is frozen hamburgers, pizza and chicken.
People who live in environments where they can't use gas or electricity or cook in the first place.
Then it becomes a diet with less vegetables and protein and leads to a life of fat and sugar.
In time, I'll be poor, but I'll be obese, and all I have to do is watch TV and I'll be disabled.
A similar situation could exist in Japan.
Other people who don't think and work tend to develop dementia.
In other words, to prevent dementia, you need to think about things by reading books from day to day.

Jaguar F-PACE, first major improvements... and possible hybridization.
A new prototype prototype was first captured in southern Europe.
F-PACE is based on the fourta concept SUV, first released in 2013, C-X17.
Then, in 2014, the 5taser version was published, and in the 2015 Frankfurter Motor Show, the official debut as "F-PaCE."

Grill is fully disguised, but I'm sure it will be re-invented.
In the rear end, you can see part of the new taillight with a long, thin streamlight at the top.

Besides the company's "Pivi Pro" touch screen design system is expected in the cabin, new digital clusters, HVAC control screens, stained wheels and gear workers will be refreshed.
The power train is expected to set up 3.0 liters of parallel indentation indentation.
