Governor Yoshimura, I'm going to join you in Corona.

From the beginning of this month, Osaka has issued a "description sticker" to those who are maintaining their guidelines to promote the spread of infectious diseases and to provide security for the people of the country.
However, the supply of stickers under the government, which is said to be more than 120,000 in the restaurant alone, remains in 11,000 stores.
So, Governor Yoshimura is planning to do it at the end of the month, but when he makes a reservation, he will sign up for the declaration stickers so that he can see them in the reservation stage.
I told him that the important thing is not to keep it a "night street." You should clearly separate the shop that's doing what you're doing and the one that's not doing it. It's also important to try to increase the number of stores that will do it.

The poet and nursery writer, Masashi Miyazawa, published a notebook that said that he had sent funds to the disaster site of the Tokyo earthquake in the year of the year when he grew up with the residents of his own city.
It's a valuable piece of information that shows the connection between wise rule and Shikoku. It introduces you with the culture and history of the town.
Until August 23rd.
The notebook was found by a member of the assembly and was organized by Ito Ito, a member of the organization in the same city's Yogizawa City community when he organized his own warehouse last summer.
My grandfather-in-law, Takahashi Takahashi, who owned a local grocery store, used it.
On September 15 it says, "The Tokyo earthquake-surprising army." Along with the sign "○" "*******," it contains the names of Shikoku and the funds for the support of the residents of the city of Japan at that time.

Aided by the calm response of the ally, the stand-up pinnacies are able to get through zero, and from two times to two times, we're playing west-warning in a combination of sliders and forks at the center of which we're proud of our straightness.
Pull up your hip and line up the zero on the scoreboard.
The strike line was running through the face of the opponent, but the third, the third, was put on the ground in the fourth place, and the Koyo Okaoka sea was able to steal two.

Then, eight more times, he attacked his opponent, Miyagawa, and appeared on his way.
I folded it to push the back of the young ace candidate in marines and decided to play it all at once.

By the way, we've got a new operation, and we've got an accident.
In a bicycle class that was opened as a mission start, a car and bicycle experiment was conducted.
In recent years, Tsukaoka Police Department's chief, Sato Toto Fair, has set up an Operations Zero Operation on Bye-By-By-By-By-By-By-By-By-By-By-Aid, trying to eliminate a high percentage of bicycle and motorcycle-related accidents in the tubes in order to avoid accidents in recent years.
In addition to providing protection against accidents with traffic safety organizations in the tubes, we're going to go on a campaign against and strengthen the traffic rules of our bikes.
Three traffic deaths have occurred in the station this year, and a person who was driving a bike or a bicycle has been killed.
Although the number of accidents is on the decline, the rate of accidents involving bicycles is about 11.7 percent as of June 30 as of June, bikes related about 5.8 percent, and motorcycles are both higher than the county average.
In particular, bicycle accidents have caused more accidents in the last five years than the prefecture average, and have planned a plan to break this situation.
The name of the mission combined "bike" with the meaning of an accident destruction.
I'm going to have the association call out more often than ever by teaching older people how to drive and using night-light reflections in traffic safety classrooms and so on.
At the station, you can mix yellow cards and give attention to them, for example, during the raids.
The mission began on the 21st of the 21st, at the Ambulance School's School of Vehicles in Yamaoka City.
About 30 people were present, and Chief Sato said, "I'd like to ask you to help me reduce any tragedy."
The official at the station showed the policy and the activities of each organization.
We will continue to host a bicycle class as the start of the operation.
We demonstrated how different the impact on the bike is from the impact on the car when the driver braked and hit the bicycle, or at about 55 kilometers per hour without stepping on the brakes.
The president of the Council on Traffic Safety and Safety in the area of Tsukaoka was saying that he "renewed the horror of the traffic accident. The elderly, of course, want to call attention to the young as well. "
Akasaka-sama, who has been in the service for five months, has been in the field for professional speaking and intruding. &gt;&gt;Chris Akasaka. &gt;&gt;Hugo Barra: Thank you. &gt;&gt;Hugo Barra: Thank you. &gt;&gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Thank you very much. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So.

The man who visited us as husband and wife said: "The way in which you speak and act and the way in which you've been drawn, you've got a smile."
Ms. Josa said that her voice had been in one piece for a long time, but it was a good time.
In Osaka City, magic groups and magic concerts were also presented.
Akasaka's laughing husband opened up in the old Akasaka town as his first national guest in 1996.
I've been in and out once a month, but I've been in and out of my seat for the last time this year because of the new Colorado effect.

Butler once again praised Tyler Hero, the young warrior responsible for the future of the heat,
The first fight is with the Kings.
In this game, which won 104-98, Duncan Robinson played 18 points on the team high, and Tyler Hero followed by 15 points and backcoats.
Robinson, the league's first best shot, of course, is that the step up of the lead and hero, 13th to the whole draft, is important to the heat.
The hero missed the 15 games between February and March due to his ankle injuries, and the last season, the Honetts, on March 12th, when he was returned from the war, ended in a long intermission.
The hero said he had plenty of time and was able to get back 100 percent of the conditions. But his performance in the Smegage was more convincing than words.
The first point guard, Kendrick Nann's reunion, was delayed, so the hero's play time increased, and saved the chance.
It's worth a lot because it's 15 points on the job that's different than usual, and it's a perfect score.
The team leader, Jimmy Butler, once again praised the hero of his favorite.
He's a player who can do everything for his team, he can do it for a handler, he can do it for a score, he can do it for his team.
Since the beginning of this season, Butler has been fond of the strength to win and the urgency to tackle the basketball.
That's why I asked him to start my personal practice at 4:00 a.m. and we trained together.
Butler once said, "He says his opinion to everybody and doesn't withdraw. He respects such a fight."
That Butler is the type of person who always talks, and when he thinks it's good for the team, he's going to give in when he knows it's going to happen.
It has made my relationship with my teammate worse in the past.
Butler's putting himself up for a hero in his younger days, isn't he?
Butler's personality is sometimes too fierce for teammates to be a good guide to anyone who has enough guts to follow it.
If two foster brothers and sisters who respect each other spread across the entire team, Heat should be a team that points even higher.
It's the first time on the island to be the leader of Shizuoka County High School Games.

♪ Four fights led by three years ♪
For two years, Matsuura, the first round of thanks.
The opponent's origin was the fourth in the second year of his first summer.
Matsuura, an island solder, for the first time, beat the ball of change to the left.
"If I lost three years in three years, I'd retire immediately. I wanted to make myself win."
Last fall, when I took part in fourth grade, I was thrilled.
A three-time fight was three-year-old fighting, and two powerful years were under control.
Director Ikeda gathered the players at the meeting and told Nine that he had been here for three years. He was going to be a best member from now on.
Four out of the nine Stamen this day fixed their core in two years.
It's a sign that he's been serious about it, though he looks ruthlessly.
Matsuura reassuringly says, "From now on, my opponent's level is up. I'm going to come over here to send the runner home."
Saito, who was in line for three years, didn't even go on second base with a six-gauge round, didn't even go on second base, didn't go on second base, didn't go on second base.
The number 10 on your back will be stimulated for three years by two years. If you win, you will have a favorable response.
The rest of the games aren't intended to be remembered by the team who set up the Shizuoka Games last year in three consecutive years.
In the world of singing with the local people, there are 16 musicians in the Fukushima area who have joined together.
I'd like to send a lively song from the beach, in and out to the world.
There were 16 musicians in the Fukushima area who assembled and made a message song.
We walk toward the recovery from the Tohoku earthquake and the Tokyo Power field disaster. We sing about the humble state of Fukushima fighting the new Corona virus.
By next summer, the ten-year anniversary of the earthquake will be complete.
On the twenty-fourth, I released the song on a video post site called YouTube.
The song's name is "Pray from Fukushimagu Play Frem Frem Fukusima."
I put the positive attitude of people on a cheerful melody that I'd like to share with you from Fukushima.
The live house, which is a base for musical activity because of the new Corona effect, has been forced into the holiday, and many musicians have lost their place to sing and play.
(It's time we didn't see it, so we decided to believe in the power of music.)
Napoléon handles raps with words and compositions, and Dazo handles rap.
When the project began in March of the Corona disaster, the song writer from Fukushima City, M.N.A.A., agreed, and the circle spread in the blink of an eye.
Mr Napoléon, in his mind's eye, says, "I'd like to enjoy this opportunity as much as I can think of."
We didn't have an opportunity to gather 16 people as a protection against infection, and we recorded each in a live house or home.
In an effort to encourage the project, Grandma, a painter in the city, drew down an image character.
They go back to Fukushima prefectures and describe the natural, green and natural soils.
The finished song will be sent to the world by YouTube and will be able to make CDs.
Next year we will be hosting the Tokyo Five-Wall Paralyn Pick, which has been postponed after ten years of earthquake damage.
Mr Dazuo said, "We've been through a lot of difficulties, and we have a lot of big things to carry on. I'd be happy if we could get a lot of people excited by the presentation of the songs with the eye. "
The other participating musicians are as follows.

"I want to know as soon as I can where the disasters and accidents occurred."
This is a strong need not only for news media such as television and newspapers, but also for many companies such as social infrastructure and localities.
The service that responds to that is the "specty" developed by Sedentee, who uses AI to analyze information.
It's called "Sympathy" and it's called "Sympathetic" and it's called "Sympathetic" and it's called "Sympathetic" and it's called "Sympathetic" and it's called "Sympathetic" and it's called "Sympathetic" and it's called "C" and it's called "C" and it's called "C" and it's called "S" and it's called "Stem."
Now, the first way people know about disasters and accidents is to move from TV to Internet information media.
Social media, such as Twitter, has become an important medium that transmits information right after disaster or accident.
It's just hard for people to keep an eye on the flow of information and extract useful information from it.
Spenti has the ability to deliver information from social media, such as Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, to detect natural disasters, analyze information about accidents, and determine the truth of the information and then to deliver it to a user company.
"A wide range of negative impacts such as stopping and stopping social activity."
The NHK in April 2016 in Bearmoto earthquake, the first major use of Scotty, and then the adoption movement spread rapidly among the corporations.
It's said that more than 350 national companies, including television and newspapers, are currently using them, as well as companies that support social infrastructure, such as power, gas, transportation, and locals throughout the country.
▪ Parsing post to determine the type and location of the crisis
Spenti takes four steps to deliver information: "Governing Information," "Decision and Discretion Classification, "" Titled, "" and "False Criterion."
Using companies have specified beforehand (such as districts and municipalities where information is collected) and crisis category disasters, accidents, etc.).
Spenti collects the appropriate posts and collects them using the APls provided by social media.
Next, analyzes and classifys the text, images, and videos contained in the post collected.
For example, if there's a fire car, and there's a black smoke out of the building, and there's an orange flame out of the room, then I'm classed as a fire.
In addition, if you have an image of a upside-down car, it's like a traffic accident, or if you have an image of a flooded road, it's classified as a road cap water.
Specti also estimates where disasters and accidents will occur.
"I often don't know where I'm going from post, so I'm guessing by combination of various information," says the village CEO.
For example, if a road sign or a sign is shown in an image or video, it will extract local names from it and match them with a local name database to locate them.

○ Asretex 7x - 3 Enertes on July 24th.
The first round of the season, which was the first round in the middle, was a four-time round, but after that, the fourth round was out of the room and had a score of five for one and one for three for the first time in the season.
Ojidani's three times on the first day of his life. He's going to hit Montauna again and he's going to play around.
The fifth round we received at 1-1 was played by the second best man on the first day against his right arm Petit and fell out of the game here as well.
The fourth round we received in 2-1 and 1st lead is against the Dixman with 5 left arm as the lead player.
The second ball went straight in the opposite direction at the right angle, but instead of over the fence, he fell to the left.
Angelis received a one-point lead eight times, his rescue arm Batley lost two points and allowed him to go back, and nine times he lost his way, nine times he lost his way, and seven times the new captor, Kastro, take the solo bullet that becomes the first season team, and put it in the right wing.
I caught up with three-thirds of the meeting at the last minute.
After that, it's two dead, two at first, and two at the end of the strike.
The Asretex bench here received a message from Trout and chose the Battle of the Great Valley at the second base.
The valley was expected to win, but asretex, before the guardian god Hendrix, the 3rd play.
The game didn't end in nine, but it entered an extended battle that began with the season's undead second base.
Since Ojidani was the last nine hiters, he was a second base runner.
Angelis sent the ball to third base, even if the first hit Walsh played ten times.
The valley between the second and third base has become a touchout.
Angelis was then on the second floor, but eight Simmons fell in two.
On the other hand, Engels has a series of roves, such as a dead ball and a violent throw, and he's got two or three rounds of death.
Here the new director of the Macdon tasked the shift to five people in the interior, while the Rovets have the fourth Davis to walk in the fourth ball.
His left arm, Milner, was taken to 5 Olson with a high-end bullet, which was a good-bye, to the right wing.
Once more, isolated, 33 families of Kimura will be temporarily bridged with more water, 26 days and 26 days, fear of the heavy rain in the south of the province.
In Nagano prefecture, there is a danger that there will be heavy rain at the center of the south in 26 days, while in the middle and in the south, we need to be on guard against dust disasters.
In Tsukimura, the circuit of the pre-passing prefecture runs through and is once again isolated by the residents.
The swollen river will be swallowed up by a temporary bridge of earth and washed away.
After 3 a.m.
This is a prefecture that has been blocked by mud. It's a circuit that's been built on river mats. From 17 days to 17 people's cars, it's accessible only to people's cars.
This means that 56 families in the Oshima area will be isolated again, and the Ikeda construction office wants to work on the restoration as soon as the water pulls back.
It is hoped that the warm, humid air will flow toward the rainy season front, and the province will have more than 30 millimeters of heavy rain an hour over 26 days.
Twenty-six days, six o'clock, 24 hours of expected rainfall is 80 millimeters or 120 millimeters in the middle of a lot of places, and in the middle and south, we need to watch for the dust storm late at 26 days and late at night.
The weather station has issued heavy rain warnings in the Sakura, Sakura, and Kigi district.
Can't you get through to my house?
"I really thought you weren't saying that."
The Chiba people near Tokyo City.
I've lived in the province less than 30 years since I was born.
If I used it in a conversation with a friend at college, it would have been taken for a moment.
The flow and the sense of language made sense to me, but I was told by the Yuuki people of Tokyo, I don't use it.
- "I'm sure it's cheating and cheating? "
I think I might be able to guess what the meaning is because I think I'm going to connect with it.
And one more thing.
I didn't realize this was pointed out to me, but the expression "home," meaning "my house," is not used in any way by any readers or friends.
- Oh, my family was... was that so?
I use it at my local club, but I didn't realize whether it was because of my natural failure when I grew up...
Japanese Cold Chinese people don't like it... doesn't they?
I don't know if you've ever heard of it, but I've heard of it.
In China, the Chinese call it "Sun Cold Noodle."
As I mentioned at the outset, cold Chinese Chinese are Chinese dishes of Japanese origin based on China's soft side.
Thus, although it doesn't originally exist in China, the diversity of food has begun to come into view in Japanese restaurants in the summer.
And recently, in a Japanese convenience store, there's also a range of products that have been described as "Sun's Day's Day's Day's Day's Day's Day's Day's Day's Day's Day's Day's Day's Day's Day's Day's Day's Day's Day's Eve's Day's Day's Day's Day's Day's Day's Day's Day's Day's Day's Day's Day's Day's Day's Day' Day's Day's Day's Day's Day's Day's Day's Day's Day's Day's Day's Day's Day's Day's Day's Day's Day's Day's Day's Day's Day's Day's Day's
On the other hand, I'm pushed by popular Chinese food, such as Shingawa and Lake South, and I'm not very popular with Chinese Chinese in China.
Of course, the Chinese are often familiar with the Chinese flavor of Chinese dishes.
That's why I don't like it, but if I don't have impact, I tend to get a bad reputation.
The Cold Chinese Chinese are not the exception, but they are still minors in China.
As a matter of fact, in China the name of the Chinese cool Chinese name is "Sun's Cool Noodle."
To the Chinese, it is recognized as one of the Japanese dishes.
Summer's duel "Lingpie."
In China, when it comes to noodles that feel summer, it's probably called "Lingpie."
In Japan, I'm sure many people are unfamiliar with it, but the knoll is made from wheat flour, rice and corn, which are native to China.
It's said there's a really 2,000-year-old history.
It's a B-grade machine that's also sold on the stand, and the price is around 10 o'clock in the morning, and it's very Leedsnabre.
Although it contains the letter "calamity," it doesn't have to be iced like the Japanese cold Chinese.
Rather, normal temperature is the basis.
On noodles, chopped cucumbers, carrots, pepper palm, and other favorite ingredients are topped and added to the flavor of the ingredients of your choice, such as pepper, pepper, pepper, garlic, and so forth.
Finally, a mixture of soy sauce, la oil, vinegar, paste, peanut paste, and so on.
It's easy to get into your throats when you're plying, and you often get a sweet, sour, sour-flavored tatami mixed with it, even when you're afraid of summer and you don't like it.
Also, because of its translucentness throughout China, there are various toppings and flavorings, and there are many variations, which are characteristic and one of the ways to enjoy ourselves.
The expert will explain!
It's called "The Cold Water shower," and it's called "The Cosmopolitan," and it's called "The Cold Water shower," and it's called "The Cosmopolitan."
I'm not going to let you do that. I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to do that.
Research into the effectiveness of Hyderotherapy Treatments, published in "The North American Journal of Medical Sciences," found that the effects of physical and mental healing can be expected.
It is said that by taking cool water after exercise, you can control muscle pain and other infections.
Professor Douglas Kassa, who conducts the study of sports medicine and teaches at Connecticut University, says: "It's important to exercise and take a cold shower without giving as much time as you can. After you move your body, it's important to get warm quickly, and then you're going to get a recovery from the flames and fatigue from exercise."
I'm gonna ease your fatigue.
I hear that if you exercise in a high temperature, your heart, muscles and skin will need more blood flow than normal.
"When you exercise, your heart rate increases, your blood flow increases, and your muscle flow increases because you need more energy to contract muscles. And for skin, there is much blood flow to regulate body temperature."
"The cold water shower lowers the temperature of the skin, thus reducing the flow of blood sent to the skin. Instead, it sends blood to the intestines, such as the gastrointestinal tract, making it easier for water and nutrients to take in after exercise. As a result, you can reduce the fatigue you feel after exercise."
Holmings effect expected
Drozevsky explains that by drinking cold water, you can expect "holming Effect" to work.
Holminger's effect is the idea of having a little bit of matter or stress that is harmful to your health rather than none at all.
A cold shower can stimulate hormones and throttles and enhance physical and physical strength and resilience.

I'm going to take a sports veteran's license to the end of the day.
Shizuoka prefectureded the 2nd day of the 24th, with the "Sporter at the Best," and the 2nd team of bikes in the east of the prefecture.
It's called Team Brixton Bicycling at Mishima City and "Reventate Fukuoka" at Tokushima City.
A team of Blighston Cycling's Tadashi Assads, who received a plate from Governor Fukuyama on Koyama's Speedway, embraced the idea that they wanted to build a bicycle race with the people of the prefecture: "I want to join a team and raise a bicycle race with the people of the prefecture."
The regional strategic room chief received the plate.
Miyagi Oyama, 2 in the air!
Director Yano, it's a nice show.
It's the fourth round, it's the fourth round, it's the fourth round, it's the fourth round, it's the fourth round, it's the fourth round, it's the fourth round, it's the fourth round, it's the fourth round, it's the fourth round, it's the fourth round.
The ball that jumped high has landed in the middle of the left wing.
Oyama sends two consecutive arches around the diamond.
When I went back to the bench, I looked at my white teeth.
And I said, "Well, you know, I've got a good swing. I've got a good swing. I've got a good swing.
Four times, 0-2, I entered the race in the first place.
It's the first ball. It's the second ball after the foul.
I didn't miss Onoo's sweet, 134-mile slider.
The ball caught at the core is so perfect as to be convinced that it stands in the moment it hits.
The two consecutive games followed by the 23rd of the previous day were a curse to fight back.
It wasn't easy, but it wasn't even worth it.
On the other hand, if you're going to fight for Onoo on the 17th, you're going to hit 9 at 4 on the 9th.
However, if it were the Nagoya dome, they would have suffered from seven defeats during the previous 12 games, with 7 winnings, 1 defeat, and 8 23rd, 2013.
I took the point of being 23 inning at the Nagoya dome from such a difficult enemy, and I didn't pass the game by with a single shot.
"It's a high level to be able to get a good catch of sweet balls, and it's windy, and the timing is foul." "I think he's still going to hit you." "I think he's still going to blow it."
One time he has a right-hand punch, so he marks a six-time and three-game low-value round.
The opening session has been cut off, but the seventh and 16 rounds have already served as team tops and fourths.
We're going to keep the result going for the victory.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
It's been four months since Iwao's victory.
On the 25th, after interviewing the press online, they decided that they wanted to "I want to come together and win the prize" on Tokyo's five wheels, which were postponed next year.
(Portuguese Kooka Kooka) and Fukuoka, who worked for the 15 World Cup in the same circle for 19 years.
The commander insisted, "Of course, it's great, but we can fight together and move forward."
From this day forward, the team will start a national candidate camp in Tokyo.
Although accommodations have been held since March, until the 28th, no practice of contacting new corona viruses will be performed.
The representative decided to return to the top group of seven people from next season for the entire World Cup, but because the WS itself is in disrepair,
The first 40-year-old female in Nagano County to run PCR tests.
It was found that a woman in her 40s in Nagano province was infected with the new type of corona virus.
It's the first time in the province that medical workers who are staffed at the Red Cross Hospital have been infected.
The infection was confirmed by a woman of 40-year-old medical staff in Tsukoku, Japan.
There are 87 infected people in the province and the first medical worker.
According to the province, women have 13 days of cough and cough, and after 17 days they have visited three medical institutions.
I was in the hospital on the 23rd, and on the 24th, I found out I was positive.
It's a mild condition, and the family of four with dense contact doesn't have any symptoms.
That women are on duty until the 16th, and that they have not been able to make a visit outside the province for the last two weeks before the onset of the disease.
We're currently working on the way to the infection.
The Red Cross hospital, where women work, announced that there were infected staff 24 days and nights.
There are no "contained contact" in the hospital, but it means running PCR tests on all contacts and closing hospital wards involving women and so on and so forth.
The Prefect of the Macao Casino has seen what's going on in casino facilities... and has had to be presented with a new corona virus negative certificate at the time of entry.
About 40 casino facilities in Macao have resumed their business on strict prevention measures since February 20th.
The Macao Casual Control Authority (DICJ) requires that employees and guests be allowed to maintain maximum safety between tables, and in a table game they can sit next to each other at a table, for example, at a table where three people can sit at the same time at the same time at the same time, and also a set of operating and cross-infectation risks for slots.
There's also been increased contamination of the chip and other gamer products.
Also, guests are required to wear masks when they enter, to check the temperature, to have a valid health code, to have a recent stay, to have no new history of contact with patients, to have no symptoms such as fever or cough, or to enter and produce contacts.
Starting at midnight a.m. on July 15th, the presentation of the new Corona virus nuclear acid test (only within a valid period of time issued by Macao or Kanto's approved facility) also agreed with the proposal.
A new negative certificate must be presented in the context of a 15-day six-morning decontamination of quarantine for 14 days between Macau and Canton. It is a precaution against this.
DICJ announced that in addition to observing the execution of preventive measures in casino facilities, he called a meeting of security representatives from the casino administration of six companies and asked them to take full control of their guests'health care and to protect their employees and guests.
At DICJ, we continued our strict patrol of casino facilities, regularly having meetings with management companies and government health guidelines along the guidelines of the government's department of health care.
It's said that this casino inspection was conducted by the chief of the Health Department's Center for Disease Control (George C.E.), and instruction was given on how to clean chips and take a safe distance between seats in electronic casinos.
In addition, due to a sharp decline in the number of in-driven passengers, including border limits, this year's monthly casino sales are 337.4 percent less than the previous year.
Let's go from hot springs to turquoise festivals next month.
Because of the effects of the new Corona virus, we are beginning to work on a hot spring that the annual annual "Sun of Water Fiesta" will call off, and on August 1st, we're going to start writing a message of support for the health workers.
Put some 350 sheets of paper written by fans and locals across the country, wrap the city of hot water in apricot light, and deliver healing to visitors.
The Chrysanthemum is an animation of the festival in the "Spirit of Water" model based on hot springs. The Yuzu Hotspring Tourism Society will host it.
It started in 2011 when cartoons were broadcast, and thousands of cartoon fans from all over the country came every year.
Every day, from the lighting ceremony in July to October of the book festival, they have it lit up on the stairs that follow the whole water - water - water - rice shrine.
This year they were forced to cancel the festival because of their new corona, but local and national fans kept saying, "I miss the fact that the summer of hot water is clear." So the Society launched this project.
I wanted to be of some use to the healing and recovery of a troubled world in the Corona disaster.
There have been over 100 applications from all over the country, except for having them write illustrated messages to about 50 local children on the lawn.
If you buy a message paper from the Society's home page, fill it out, send it back to the Society in a return credit envelope, then you can pick up a picture of it hanging on a blur and turn it on.
At 6,000 yen per set, we will accept the application until we reach 350 thin lines.
A dim light will be set up until the end of November.
Mr. Yamaro Yamaro, who is the head of the festival for the first time, said, "Reading a message can inspire us. We want to celebrate the tenth festival next year."
For the campaign, we also prepared an illustration of the characters who are blooming and the drawing of Asano and the Great Bridge.
From the day on, I'm sending an illustrated and clear file to the special accommodations planner at the Yuzu hot springs.
- Yeah! News!
The Western-sized "Object of Moriyama" has shown cooperation with the soul and has presented its second victory in this season.
Two-two-nine times, four of them still far away, showed commitment to victory.
The lead Owada is on head-sling from safe tea bunt to first base.
And in the last six games, we've got 18 minutes, 2 minutes, and 3rd in depth.
The fourth mountain River was turned down, and after returning from the forest to 5 this day, outside of Japan, destroyed Koda's direct sphere and led to three-two victories.
I thought I had to do something about it. Mr. Yamakawa told me that before going to the front line in the background, he said, "Be active!," and then he said, "I've made up the flow of the three people who made it into the stream.
Four of them in their 13-year drafts, second in forest, second in mountain river, third in 14 years, third in power, and third in 16 years.
Both of them have experience with generals in amateur times and have a sense of responsibility twice as great as anyone else.
In his 4th year, he took over the captain from Fujisaki, who said, "The captain who pulls the team with words because he's a good talker anyway. I'm a good captain who talks so I left him to talk, and I was the type who's standing behind." Each of them takes on his own personality to support the forest of the new General's General from Japan and the new president.
The director said, "That's Harada's safety tea?" But I thought that was the sign, and he was also a wonderful bant.
All four of them are suffering at the rate of 22 to 4 minutes, but they're supporting their team with the wisdom to win even if they can't hit it.
U.S. Inter-working Groups respond to the threat of the Communist Party:
The U.S. Department of Securities has announced that in 24 days, the Chinese Communist Party's growing threat to the U.S.
The Chinese response by various departments in the Ministry is combined and priorityd.

The Secretary of Homeland Security, Wolf, stressed in a statement that "injurious activity in China's trade, cyber security, immigrants and intellectual property has reached alarming levels."
The Ministry of Homeland Security has thus far launched a counter-relationship campaign against Chinese manufacturers who use the new Colorado pandemic.
The boat, the SG, the boat, the boat, the boat, the ship!
- Yes! - Yes!
The SG of the boat racing gate "25th Ocean Cup" was held on the fifth day of the 25th and third final battle at the border.
The first round, 9R, is the winner of the escape!
I decided to go first.
(The two-sided battle was won by Sakura Kotatata.) (The two-way battle was fought) The three of you from Nishiyama's intense struggle with one another, the mountain rises two meters in two laps and floats up second.)
I won the first prize in second place and decided to go for the first prize.
The next 11R was the form of the extremism of the foreign frame.
Since the 28th Grand Prix of December 2013, we've done about six and a half years of SG Feiner's list.
And for second prizes, there's a lot of fighting in Takano Takano's armory, which was the first SG convention.

The U.S. government has confirmed the closing of China's General Consulate in Houston, southern Texas, and the conflict in the United States has increased.
In a twenty-five-day editorial by the National Communications and Communications Organization, China's subcommittee showed that the Secretary of the United States, who criticized the Communist party's regime, was prepared to reject the speech of the Secretary of the United States, who spoke out against the Communist Party's regime as "an ideology, and set up a new Cold War against China and the United States. "

Jiro is a veteran of the new era. Western scholar, doctor.
After standing on the platform in Edo, I opened the Dove Palace in Edo and taught the arts, military studies, and medicine.
Even after I returned to Nagago, I continued to teach military studies at the Yamamoto-Aki Institute.
The bronze statue focused on Jiro's benefits as an educator.
I took the form of holding a book beside the globe and giving a lecture in paleontology.
It is said that the height of the statue with its platforms was about three meters (1.55 meters) and that it was made by the eyes of a disciple who was taught by Jiro's teaching.
The design was a benefit to Jiro's wife and descendant of Tokiko and was given charge of the local designer.
In 150 years after Ichiro Komura's death, whose mother's name is Omura, the Minister of Operations, formed a donation.
About 12.8 million yen's worth of goods have been collected from 1104 people across the country.
The business expenses, including the installation of a fine board, are about 12 million yen.
The surplus money will be used to maintain the bronze statue and so on.
Jiro, who kept his ambition high and had a great contribution as an educator, was talking about the pride of Kojiro and the copper statue that children in the future will wish for.

At the Cape de France final, which was held on the 24th of local time,
The PSG has achieved two crowns in the country.
Neemar's first goal in sending Saint-Tierne at the end of Neimar's finals was the final finish line, followed by League Ann's winning the second crown of the country, but is now in a state of concern for the August champions league.
Killian Embape, who started the same fight in the same year, received a wounded turnover after receiving a vice of the CB, Roy Peran.
In the first half of an hour, a young French star was knocked down in such a way that his right ankle was stuck in.
In this play, the players of the two teams got into a fight with each other.
Embape, which is thought to have twisted his right ankle, has been unable to continue playing.
The Red Card was offered against Pelan.
After the game, Embape, holding her right leg, left the stadium with crutches on.
PSG fights the Coop Dora League final with Leyon at 4:10 a.m. on August 1st, Japan, but it is certain that it will not be possible to use Embape in this game.
We need to wait for a medical report published by the club, but we may miss the champions league in Portugal.
The Corona disaster, near the art center, online museum, from the Northeast newspaper, set up.
Everyone has an art museum free of charge whenever they like.
It takes a wide range of famous artists, such as Claude Monet and Gustav Klimto, as well as unknown artists in the country.
Since the opening in April of 2019, the online museum "HASARD" has taken advantage of its convenience and newness, and has taken note of a new way of life from the koruna plague.
Everyone wanted to create a service that would be easy for everyone to enjoy. Under trying circumstances, they wanted to touch the art.
When you visit Azer, you are surprised by the abundance of exhibits and the beauty of the images.
Today, on the 24th, we're publishing a regular exhibition and project exhibition of 14 exhibitions, and we attract people to the extremely high resolution that can be seen not only in color but also in the quality of the brush.
I don't need membership and admission fees, and it's characteristic of artists who want to open an exhibition as well as to look at it without cost.
If it's online, the way you show it will also attract attention.
That's one of those things that moves the picture.
When Claude Monet's permanent exhibition "It Starts to Work Again," they're using digital work to make clouds, flowers, and meadows work.
With your thoughts, I feel like I'm in the picture.
When I was an elementary school student, I had an art meeting with a representative of Akino.
At that time, when my family and I went to the newly completed Aomori County Museum, we saw three huge paintings of Mark Chagro's "Aleko" and were shocked by the force.
From the next day, art classes changed into fun times, and after coming to college, they moved on to gallerys and so on.
At the same time, I couldn't get close to the museum, and the big project exhibition was just going to take place in the capital area, and I felt that many people didn't have much opportunity to interact with art from different perspectives, such as the fact that it's difficult to go out as a child.
So I spent about two months working at an IT company, and I set up a site where I could admire art on the Internet.
The number of users reached an average of 10,000 per month in the first ten months, and increased to about 30,000 after the new cholera epidemic.
If anyone wants to see art in a free fashion.
Azer's aim was to be accepted by more people than possible by the cholera plague.
The representative of the Akino team emphasizes the importance of the art prize. He will enrich his imagination.
"When your imagination grows, you'll be able to reach out to people in need."
"I hope that art will become a better society if you get close to it."
(A simple reason for the end of the Chinese quality era and the era of Japanese quality)
Pandemics, changing values.
There are many predictions and debates about the world of afterpandemic.
For business reasons, the article on July 8 is beginning to lose its "administration" job in Japan... and the article on July 4 and "After Corona" in the world of "The Making of Japan" may change.
The identity of Japan's strength, unknown only to the Japanese, is the unexpected reality that we saw in Asia.
Mentally, the flow of articles on June 26 has become the main focus of articles such as "The " Full - Burn Sense of Fire'to a person who becomes conscious of life's end" and June 10th.
And it's the great flow of "Chinese to Japanese" that's supposed to be visible to our eyes as the combination of matter and spirit.
For example, if there's a bad fault with a T-shirt or a bad turtle, it's annoying, but there's nothing wrong with the person who buys it.
On the other hand, the poor quality of the Chinese masks and respirators that have recently been talked about... "Chinese quality" in such a life and safe product is lethal.
No matter how cheap it is, you can't buy such a product.
Even at a considerable price, they will want a Japanese quality product.
Of course, this stream is not happening in Japan alone.
It is evident from the fact that the United States and the United States, which were in trouble because of lack of masks and medical equipment, still continued to do "repairs" one after another to the terrible nature of "Chinese quality."
Safer than cheap.
Also, goods such as automobiles are products where defects can be fatal (accidentally fatal).
No matter how many countries, starting with Korea in a cheap trade strategy, can't compete with Japanese production, and the June 16 article on June 16 says, "Are the world's automakers going to win alone?
And this Pandemic reminded me that many other products need security.
Also, security is important not only in Japanese quality in manufacturing but also in Japanese quality in services such as stream.
Like toilet paper riots, they produce properly, but they can't be reached by a delay in middle circulation.
And like the April 17 article "Who Is the Real Killer of the Mask? "
It's very important that every country have its own priorities, so that it can get supplies such as masks and food in its own country.

It was announced that 25 days and 10 a.m. this day, the number of people infected with the new Corona virus has increased by 113 from midnight a.m. to 110,4092 a.m.
It's been 15 days since April the new number of people infected per day crossed 100.
In addition to the fact that 32 sailors were infected by a Russian ship that entered the port of Busan, 32 of the 293 workers who returned from Iraq on the 24th day may have been tested positive.
The number of new cases of infection in Korea, except for 20 days and 26.

There were 36 immigrants from Iraq, 34 from Russia, 5 from the Philippines, and 3 from the United States.
On the other hand, 27 people were infected throughout the city, 11 each in Seoul and Tokyo, and 5 in Busan.
The five men in Busan City were employees of a repairman who boarded a Russian ship.
The death toll is still 298 from the day before.
I'm going to show you how it's possible that a player in Nagoya Miyahara is Corona positive, soccer J1 and the League is back on track.
The Nagoya soccer team announced that they had received a positive response from the new corona virus in 25 days and 25 days.
After resuming the J League, the player's first positive response was this time.
The players of the club are the third after the two GK Mitchell Rungeaks 31st from Australia.
They have already been treated and returned to the game.
The Miyahara player of this season sat on the bench for 22 days at the J1 major game at the Japan Electrical Company.
Nagoya had a press conference online on the 25th and had a PCR test for 60 athletes and staff members on the same day.
98% reflect.
It has been found that the tephron - made white paint from a frying pan can increase the air-conditioning effect by insulating it!
That's a hell of a discovery!
This year, the rainy season is marked by an unprecedented amount of rainfall, but if it's clear, the hot summer will become real.
It's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot... it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's, it're just, it're just, it're just, it're just,..........................................
Global warming is a big problem in the world, and mankind has concentrated on how to get over hot summers a little more comfortable.
One way to do that is to wear thin, white clothes.
You know, you don't have to wear black clothes that absorb heat in summer, do you?
And I hear that more and more cases are using white paint to apply the same principle to the architecture of the house.
Can't white be white, or can't it be a paint that reflects more light and doesn't absorb heat? And that was also the latest study.
Henry Samuel School of Los Angeles (UCLA) recently announced with Columbia University's researchers in applied physics and applied mathematics that he found a way to match white paints that can most efficiently play the sun and increase the cooling effect in buildings.
It's estimated that early practicalization will be pointed to.
So far, white paint that has the highest reflector of sunlight has reached 85 percent and has been used with carbon dioxide.
White paints that already use carbon dioxide have been painted on the roof of a high-heat building and have been used to block out the sun's heat to increase air-conditioning efficiency.
However, what was newly discovered was a white coating from the polytolic fluorolololol ethylatelyteFE.
The white paint that uses this tephron effect is supposed to reflect the sun's rays close to 98 percent and make a large heat cut.
Thanks to the unexpected white coating of tephron even in hot summers, it is easy to live in the house without being exposed to intense heat.
I'm not sure if we're going to be able to do that.
It's like the roof of a Japanese house has a lot of dark colors, but from now on it's going to be the white system.
When is the annual sale in the Amazon, or this year?
The U.S.
We held it in July each year, but this year it was reported that we were forced to put off because of the spread of the new Corona virus.
▪ Public relations officials say, "Details will be released soon." The Amazon publicist said in a statement.
"President Day has become a special celebration in the last five years, which we'll be looking forward to. This year, we'll have our employees safe, support them and their customers, and hold them later than usual."
However, when it came to saying, "The details will be released soon," it didn't reveal the specific date of the event.
On the other hand, I've decided to hold an event in India.
I put press release on the country's site.
I've explained that we're going from midnight to 48 hours on August 6th.
The Prime Day has been held at the world's joint convention, but this year it may take unusual steps.
▪ A large event that sells 760 billion yen in two days, the Amazon began to sell this membership in 2015 as a way to promote sales in summer when sales are down.
At first it was a 24-hour event, but it was a 24-hour event, but it expanded from year to year, and last year ran from midnight to 48 hours in 18 countries, such as the United States, Canada, Britain, Germany, France, India, Japan, China and Australia.
Last year, according to the company, sales for two days exceeded sales for Black Fridays and Cybermanday.
This event also contributed to the acquisition of the new member Prime, last year with the highest number of first-day applications, and the next day with the next.
And last year they sold 175 million goods worldwide.
Regarding this, Internet Relayer, an expert in the Internet trade industry, reported that two days of global sales amounted to 770 million dollars a year more than the previous year.
Your eyes are hard to keep up with your mobile number transfers and excessive restraints.
What about commissions and points?
(New switch) - Yahoo! News!
The Ministry is making a full review of the same numbering transfer system (MNP) that can be used to change cell-communication companies.
At the 21st session of experts, I showed them the policy of modifying the MNP guidelines established in 2004.
The exact point of the argument is many different ways of having an MNP fee and holding back against those who want to switch.
While it is expected that the communications company will backfire, the attention will be focused on whether we can connect it to the promotion of a healthy market race.
The darkness of each company's network, whose cell phone transfers are so far away, was introduced by MNP in the early '06, and the customer charge was 2,000 yen, but today it's 3,000 yen.
The MNP commission income of three leading cell-communicators is estimated at 159 billion yen per year.
In the 21st, the Department of Investigation listed the status of the MNP at the "WG" conference, which discussed the competition of the communications market and so on.
I also raised the time of receiving the MNP reservation number required for consumers to transfer to other communications companies.
Each large communications company accepts it on the web, but thanks to the convenience of the infrastructure system, the reception time comes mainly at 9-20 p.m.
The WG material clearly stated the direction in which we will consider the principle of day-to-day response.
It's also a matter of holding back people who want to be transferred to the MBP, and cell-communication companies giving them points, such as giving them points.
Because it's the judgment that excessive restraints will only interfere with fair competition.
The Nomura General Institute's partner, who serves as a WG member, suggests: "If you get permission from users to explain how to provide financial benefits, and if you don't accept it, it's important to issue numbers quickly and quit. It's important to know this process first."
However, in a series of points, when it comes to MNP commissions, "The higher the customer gets, the more likely it is to be motivated to drop aggressively."
If someone lowers the MNP fee first, it's also a concern that the company will have increased its customer flow and business efforts will not be rewarded.
The General Ministry also points out that many countries abroad do not ask for a customer-rate charge for MNP, and it is possible that this will happen in Japan too.
The Ministry of Justice put together WG results as a report about 9 to 10 months ago, and then the plan was to begin a revision of the MNP guideline.
When changes are made, they can be dated after 21 years.
Each cell-communication company seems to be having trouble thinking about how to sell or support customers.
I'm going to give you a round-the-day win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win.
The 25th is the first time in twenty-five days.
I lost my mark six times and four times.
I've been throwing it because I thought it was my best chance of getting the last climb. But I didn't care too much, so I was able to compete with my opponent.
The first climb of this season and the last 18 days of the Kunihito festival (the first time in the season and the last 18 days)
I didn't do my first job, this time it was a dry run for a single army.
This time I hit a fierce tiger strike against him with a hearty ball.
When the late 140-mile-long straight ball ran, it could be used effectively by other change balls, such as count balls.
Six times I hit the head of the Sanz with a left-hand double, but I hit the mountain on the left, hit the Boar on the left, hit the Boar on the double, and hit the base two times.
In the game of vacation here, I won two balls and ended up with forks.
I lost my swings in three balls, and I picked out my pins.
At the end of the middle game, the director of the game got out of the bench and asked for a transfer.
The win-win was at the same time 108 balls, but the first shape of the game was the shape of the mound, so I couldn't get the rights of the first victory this season.

It's a brand-new brand for special products, a brand-new brand for the Okayama County Co-worker Association, up-to-date PR................................................................................................
The Okayama County Trade Association re-newed its own brand of "Sun-san's sunny day" for authentication of special state products.
We have created a new system where we can change our name to "Sunday Mountain Brand" and produce better products.
I tried to enhance PR.
Authentication begins in 2004 to open up small businesses.
It's been 15 years since I got a new one.
In March of this year, we examined the products recommended by each trading company and identified 22 items, such as local wine and hand-made hats.
I made 121 items for 99 items, such as sweets, flavors, makeup, and so forth, that I took over from the old brand.
I'm going to apply for it in the future.
The goods, especially quality and so on, are prizes as "best-severance awards."
This time I gave it to the "Jourgagurt" of Tsuoyama's dairy farming association.
In the Challenge Prize for a new product, I chose the "cachi cans" of Kashiko.
I introduced all the goods with pictures and made 10,000 catalogs with prices, sales and so on.
In addition to sending it to buyers and exporters across the country, they distribute it free of charge at tourist resorts in the state.
I also make logo marks that combine peach flowers with fruit, and authentication products can be sealed.
The association says that "all the products that use local resources are goods. We want to increase attention and appeal in the renal. "
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, but I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, but I'm sorry, I'm sorry, but I'm sorry.
That's why I'm here, and I'm here because I'm here because I'm here because I'm here because I'm here because I'm here because I'm here because I'm here because I'm here because I'm here because I'm here because I'm here because I'm here because I'm here because I'm here because I'm here because I'm here because I'm here because I'm here because I'm here because I'm here because I'm here because I'm here because I don't want to.
In July of 2019, Officer Saita's car in the white horse paraded across the district.
Sawada's shrine, located in the area of Takano Takano in Yoichi Yoichi. It's dedicated to the treatment of the disease cholera epidemic that spread around the region 125 years ago.

The district guard also dropped out this year's séances, which are visited by police school students.
On the 21st of the 21st, I visited Omamashima, off the coast of Takashima.
Mr. Takeshi made up his mind, "The brave and devoted spirit of the police is that I want to take over as it should be."
Officer Takada from Bearmoto prefecture was sent to Takao in July 1895.
The procedure is to clean up patients' homes without sleep, and then infect themselves with cholera itself.
I said, "All the high-end cholera will go on your shoulders." Then I took it and died when I was only four days old.

"Good health and seminars," advised experts on various health problems.
The chief chief of the Seung Jo's eye at the Miyagi Hospital, explained about the diseases of the eyes that are deeply related to life, such as Diya's and Seung Jo's disorder.
Dre-Eye is said to be "the disease of tears," and explained to me that it is a disease in which the quality of tears breaks down and the tears don't cross the surface of the eyes evenly.
Mr. Kimura told him that "a contact lens user is about four times more likely." He warned him, "Keep up with long hours of use and wear. "
I showed you how to keep your computer screen below your eye level, and in a room where air-conditioned air conditioning worked, such as that.
I also introduced you to ingredients and food that are effective on dry eyes.
"The Omega 3" included in blue fish and other fish prevented the exhalation of tears, and "mutin," which is so much in natto and okra, increased the quality of the tears."
In the case of cataract surgery, there was a simple focus and multiple focus on the internal lens to be inserted instead of crystallized.
About 40 people attended the seminar.
As a precaution against the new Corona virus infection, we divided the morning and afternoon parts into two sections, opened them in small groups, and put in pre-enters' temperature, decontamination, and adequate ventilation for the hall.

On the air, the Council of Broadcasting, and Fukushima County. - Yahoo! News!
A television conference has been held to discuss programs broadcast by Fukushima Central TV.
At this program's conference, there was an opinion on "Gooji, Part 1" broadcast from Monday to Friday at 3:50 p.m.
In the program, we discussed how to prepare for natural disasters and how to stretch around the home while the new Corona virus is threatened.
There were voices such as, "I think it was appropriate to meet the rainy season and encourage caution," "I would like to evaluate the attitude of giving helpful information in a clear way," but there were comments from the committee that "you may get a busy, busy impression" and that "you also need a carpenter to invite many people."
Craster at the new Corona Fire Department, there's no harm done in the work.
Kofu has announced that a man in his 30s in the city has been infected with a new type of corona virus.
The new infection was confirmed by a 30-year-old male employee of the Taliban Fire Department.
Although this man wasn't the four highly infected contacts at the Confederate Fire Department, he was tested positive for PCR tests on the 14th of this month, including fever.
I have no symptoms now. I'm staying at home.
The staff at the South Fire Department is the fifth person infected, and the county and the city claim to have a cluster.
Six other staff members with suspected infection are currently running PCR tests.
In the fire, we set up a support group and set up another team to do nothing to interfere with our business.
The infection was confirmed in the province by 85 people except in cases where it was positive again.
I don't know if there's any chance of J1 Deview in Kobe, 17-year-old FWang.
Miyamoto's Overseer's Powers Explosive.
In response to a previous interview by G Osaka's Miyamoto Miyamoto, who won 25 days and 4 games in Kobe, he looked forward to the first member of the previous line of high school FWS team.
The commander made the top-ranking Tangshan in this season against a bench member in the 22-day war on Hiroshima.
I didn't give you a chance to enter, but here's a part of J3 that came up with a point against a striker who left 3 points and a result in this season 5 game. I'm 17 years old, but I want you to do it even more. I've seen athletes going abroad since I've been young, but I've also ordered you to play with high consciousness and greed.
Tangshan was a special player last season at J3 and won 10 games 8 goals.
With a sense of the coolness of the shot shown in front of the opponent's goal at the moment of quick movement, he is proud of the 15-winning goal 11 and the amazing score score of the score in J3.
The Hiroshima war was the result of an injury to FW Ademieson and MF Onose, which made them out of the bench, and we got a chance to go to Mount Tang, but we didn't have a chance.
The director of Miyamoto's office explained that the condition of Adeumi and Konoo is "not 100%, but they're willing and ready to go to Kobe."
If we keep them warm, there will be another chance of a bench in Tangshan.

Number four, Yamagawa is a proselytist.
The senior high school senior was walked away, and the inner spirit of Foreignzaki was burning.
I thought, "Oh, shit." Before Mr. Yamakawa went to first base, he told me to be aggressive, so I got a good feeling.
I was stuck in a straight ball from one ball, but the ball fell right in front of me.
Throughout the amateur era, he hit "I don't remember" by saying "I don't remember."

They called him a man who didn't have it.
He was chosen as a man-made japan to defend the outside and outside field. He served as the world's best player at the "Premia 12" last November.
But I didn't have the experience of beating a good-bye in the West, and I was told by the director, by the horse and by the defense coach, "I don't have it. I don't have it. I don't have it. I don't have it."
Bring back a bad reputation, and perform the second good-bye victory this season.
The director said, "I asked the goddess of victory to ask for it only today."
In savings two, third place between top software bank and one game.
This season is still just one strike, and outside of the batting rate 252 said, "We're still going to have to hit it. We're going to win the next one, and we're going to do it all together."

The second example of a pig farmer in the province.

This time we raised about 10,000 of the five farms and obtained JGAP authentication at the fifth farm, which produces "Law Pig."
The company's goal was to obtain authentication from the idea that "a large buyer must be selected" and that it had to be used on food supplies in Tokyo's five-feet village.

On the 25th day, on the 7th of the 8th fight, on the 8th, on the 4th, on the 25th, on the 25th, on the 25th.
The result was two goo.
Fukuda, the head of the team, was put on the ground at the middle of the battle, and D1th and Ishigawa decided to take a pre-tank and set up a first strike on the 1st and second base.
This is where the number three comes up this day.
A big cheer came out of a fan hanging over the Nagoya dome in the middle of the day.

The rain of July, which caused so much damage to Japan, including Kyushu and Shizuoka prefecture, has been a disaster within Shizuoka prefecture.
The damage to sand and sand has been left behind, and in many cases it takes time to recover.
In addition to the inconveniences of everyday life, residents are creating anxiety over the adverse effects on economic activities and others.
At the Seboustashi on the Togogawa River in this district of Dragon Mountain, there is a long line of cars waiting to pass through throughout the day.
The front car remained parked for nearly 40 minutes.
The 152 road has stopped going all the way to the city, and it needs to be transferred to the Tokyo River versus the shore to travel in the town.
But the road is narrow, and the whole section is one-sided, and waiting is unpredictable.
In that town, a mudslide occurred on the national road on nine days, and the danger of falling rocks on the nearby slope stopped the traffic.
On the 13th, they found cracks in the fall leaves tunnel within the zone, and they haven't been able to get back into the process yet.

It seems that MF Nakashima, Japan's representative, is on his way to the Porto Regiment.
Portugal's ZAP gave us the information on "Recold."
Porto, who ruled the 2019/20 Portuguese league, won the Ceremonies on the pitch at the end of the platform this month on the 20th of the 20th.
But we've been talking about the fact that there was no Nakashima in this place either.
Nakashima, who refused to join the team during the league break-in with the new Corona virus, continued the absence after that.
The fact that you weren't there for the winner, and even for Ceremony, has led to the move this summer.
According to "Recold," Porto called Nakashima to this seremony.
Just that Nakashima didn't show up.
That's why Middle Island is increasingly out of Sergio Conseison's plan. We need to leave the club at the next emigration market.
Nakashima, with number 10 on its back in Portugal's famous gate, but in a year, the retreat has become more intense.

A phenomenon that appears to be the horizontal arc of the rainbow - a circle of light around the sun - and a horizontal arc of the rainbow - appeared at the same time before 9 a.m. on 24 days, before 9 a.m., and at the same time in the mountains.
According to the mountain weather station, both the sun and the earth's horizon arcs are caused by the reflected light of the sun on the fine ice crystals in the clouds.
A normal rainbow looks in the opposite direction of the sun, but a horizontal arc is characterized by a horizontal arc looking in the same direction as the sun.
It's a relatively visible phenomenon, but it's said that the horizontal arc in the ring doesn't show up as often as the sun.
This day, even in Takataka, the sun was seen.
At home, about 11 a.m., his daughter confirmed that he had a strange rainbow.

This year a lot of spectators come to see the spectacles of horse racers dressed in armor. But this year, to prevent the infection of the new Corona virus, they will stop most of their activities, including horses, and they will run a portion unintended for 27 days.

A great long-term suspect and a woman began to interact with SNS about December, 2018, and they may never have met until the day of the incident.
My wife has a wallet at 45%!
Is my husband happy? Is he unhappy?
I'm afraid your husband says you don't have enough money or enough money this month.
The home where this conversation takes place is where my wife holds her wallet.
In the world, how many families have a wife holding a wallet?
Also, let's take a look at the percentage of the "cooperative management" between husband and wife.
Which of you has a family's financial wallet?
Matsui Securities, 400 men and women in their 20-30's, 400 young men and women within three years of marriage across the country, 50-60s and 400 older couples, and a total of 800 Internet research into family management.
Who's holding a family's financial wallet?
Wife: 45.4% husband: 24.8%
Whichever you manage, it's a budget management process, but there seem to be a variety of episodes.
If my wife manages the family budget:
Aiko manages the family budget completely.
I negotiated with my husband to cut down on my allowances, since I had more months of college exams than I had in the last few years.
On the other hand, he said, "Let me see what the balance sheet is." So I showed him the accounts.
Even though he should have listed all the expenses, the family accounts didn't make enough money to go into the red market.
She was about to be approached by her husband, who said, "You're good enough." But Aiko, on the other hand, said, "I know, I'm not good enough to manage a household, so please take care of everything." She'll say, "Yes, please."
Later, when Aiko interviewed her husband, he said that he was not happy with having allowances and so on, but that he didn't have the time and energy to manage various household expenses, such as school materials and PTA costs.
The husband manages the family budget: in B children's case, the full-time housewife, B-iko, has been on a daily basis, paying for her living expenses by her husband.
Last spring, since the refrigerator was broken, B-ko asked her husband to buy her a refrigerator.
However, the husband refused to change his purchase, saying, "I don't like the freezer, but I can still use the refrigerator part."
But in the summer, her husband wanted to make sure that he was ready to eat ice cream, so she said, "Let's buy ice cream or ice cream."
So she complained to her friends that her husband was so small that he made a mistake.
It's the first time I've ever heard of it, but I've never heard of it, and I've never heard of it, and I've never heard of it.
It seems that this season, Japan's representative, who played in a part of Spain, is moving slowly.
Even though Marjolka has given up to two parts, the duration of the season has risen sharply since the end of the season.
But it's difficult to return to the same part of Real Madrid with the same "possession" in relations with the EU. We're going to play at other clubs next season.
We've already received an offer from about 30 clubs, but R Madrid is the policy of getting soldiers trained at domestic clubs.
The Spanish newspaper "Marka" was reported by a group of Villaralal, Granada, Hetofe, and Betsys as the source of the long-term transfer, and "five clubs are interested in the acquisition of long-term, but R Madrid wants more than the middle of the league."
Among other things, Villaral and RSsaida will be in the European League of Nations in the next season, and Granada will match the terms of the team that R Madrid wants from the second round of the 63th round.
The Big Club of World Number One will make what decision as to the disappearance of Japan's Great Treasure?
