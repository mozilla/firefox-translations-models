I don't want to watch TV anymore because I have that kind of thing.
TV is a performer's fool.
Yesterday I watched a thousand birds on Netflix, but when I said it wasn't particularly funny, there were quite a few scenes where the staff laughed and grinned behind me.
It's obviously not funny, but it's probably not uncommon to laugh at the "all you have to say is laugh because you're a sold-out performer".
But if the staff doesn't laugh, the actor's mood will deteriorate, and the work will be socially unpleasant.
Like the old black companies, the industry is a sporting club, and some entertainers seem to have an egotism that is usually disgusting, and otherwise they can't eat.
On the other hand, it is amazing that the artist himself is always saying "don't scold the artist" when he feels that his work is too difficult.
I know that I have quite a small income before I can sell, but I'm always told that the entertainer's job is like being on top of the crap.
The beauty of their own careers and the ridicule of comedians can only be heard as justification for their overly high standing in the media and society.
To be honest, the industry I work in has a pretty tough part, but I feel like the entertainment industry is getting more and more unreachable.
I'm sorry for the embarrassing comments.
It felt like I was not well enough to go out like Onjala.

The buyer is presented with a sample.
The goods ordered from the Tsukmonet Shop were automatically replaced.
Summary: When we ordered a cheaper radio mouse, a wired version of the mouse arrived, and if we wanted a refund, we were told to return it.
It's a marketing problem rather than a PC topic, but whatever you think, it's not satisfactory and famous, so I'll let you write here.
At the Tskumo Day Sale at the Tskumo Net Shop, which began last Friday, we discovered that MSI's wireless gaming mouse was selling for 3,280 yen.
Since the wired version was the same price at the store, I ordered it considering the possibility of a price error and the possibility of a page error.
As usual, an order email was received, and a delivery email the next day.
The purchase history of both emails and MyPage was labeled "CLUTCH GM41 LIGHTWEIGHT WIRELESS".
Since there was no error or cancellation notice before the order was shipped, I thought at this point the wireless mouse that ordered would arrive.
The problem was that a few hours after shipment, an email came in saying "there was a product registration error".
According to the email, the dog was killed.
* The radio version was sold at a discount, but it was actually a radio version.
*and since the wired mouse is already being shipped,
1. refuse to receive and cancel completely.
2.and return the mouse salt and return the money.
3.and use the wired mouse as it is.
Choose the answer to the question.
The wired and wireless product pages were separated, and the purchase history, email and delivery notes said they were wireless, but the wired version was sent automatically instead.
And isn't it bad to be sent something different from the goods you bought and sent to you without knowing, if you want to return the money, you can return it from here?
So lend me wisdom, because I want to fight back, whether I accept it or not.
If you were already looking for a marriage or a partner, wouldn't you want to be with someone who is not close to your family?
Or does it have anything to do with it?
If you care, why?
For example, people who are separated from their parents, siblings, and siblings.
And I don't care about that at all.
The worst part is that some parents and siblings have different personalities and are unreasonable.

Twice isolated... the only bridge connecting the area with typhoons and heavy rains has been blown up. The residents have tripled their food supply.
Mr. Matsunoka from the Highland Region of 矢祭町, 福島県.
The 2019 East Japan Typhoon had a major impact on the lives of three and eight families.
Mr. Matsubun: "At first it feels like 'Magic' isn't it?"
It was like this could be broken, or even flooded". The only road to the highland region was the 'Highway Bridge' which was flooded by the East Japan typhoon, leaving the area's 11 households and 30 people in isolation.
The residents who were forced to cut off the water continued to use the railway bridge of JR, which is not normally allowed to pass, for days to transport necessary supplies.
Matsun Horo: "I felt the need for transportation, the need for cars to come to the yard, and to walk down the bridge with the car in hand or carrying it over the railroad bridge to come here". The emergency bridge, completed a month later, was flooded by heavy rain less than three months later and again isolated for several days until the temporary bridge was built.
Although the recovery has been underway for more than two years after the disaster, Ms. Matsubane continues to take action to learn a lesson.
Matsunoka: "I think there are about 10 cases.
In the meantime, I'm thinking of making sure that we're making sure that we're getting some sort of two-thirds of the time". Canned, cup-and-dish, and other foods that can be used for a lot of food, are about three times more prepared than before the disaster.
Matsumoto: "I felt again that it was better to save a little or something, because I don't know when disaster will come to me, except for other people's business". Meanwhile, the bridge flows through the "unforeseen disaster" of the town of Yizhen.
Starting in 2021, the town started its own initiative to remember the lesson.
Director of the Department of Education, Yajita Town: "We have decided to designate Yajita Town Day as a day to consider disaster preparedness and we want to announce that October 12 will be a day to consider disaster preparedness.
I think there has been a greater awareness of what could happen, more than ever, in the face of the unforeseen and unforeseen".

Be careful when buying a medieval home!
The catch of the "building situation investigation system" is that it is a "diamond online" - Yahoo! News
● The newly established "building situation survey" system to stimulate the antique housing market and to stimulate the development of the market is in good shape.
Prices of both houses and apartments are rising, and the reform market is also expanding.
While the coronavirus has increased house-holding trends, the rising trend towards "station-front" and "massive" buildings, represented by words like "tower", is also likely to be affected by the sharp decline in popularity of relatively cheap new buildings.
However, compared to overseas, the share of existing (old-fashioned) residential distribution in Japan remains still low.
So the Ministry of Transportation (MRT) in 2018 started a so-called inspection called a building situation investigation, aimed at a revised law on the commercialisation of residential buildings, a safe and secure transaction of medieval dwellings.
This is a system where architects familiar with housing check the status and condition of buildings, including deterioration of the property, and then put it together into a report to inform the buyer.
The Ministry of Transport explains that the introduction of inspection has benefits for both buyer and seller.
Because the seller can avoid post-delivery claims by conducting property inspections before a sale transaction, and gives buyers a sense of security.
It may even lead to differentiation of competing objects.
On the other hand, it is also a system for the buyer to understand the condition of the old house to be purchased, to convince and buy, and to claim that it is a system with a large advantage in appearance.
But under the current system, the dominant authority for building surveys is primarily the seller.
In addition, I would like to note that only notification of the inspection system has become mandatory.
That is, if a real estate developer in charge of mediation is obliged to explain that "in the course of mediation, you can introduce an architect to investigate the building situation" or "you can't", but the implementation itself is not required.
● The risks of a seller-led inspection are of concern; on the other hand, if you look abroad, the antique market is already in place in the United States and the United Kingdom, where the market is booming.
And in the early stages of a home purchase, the buyer has a system whereby a professional called an "inspector" or "building surveyor" is asked to investigate a building.
For example, in the United States, 70 to 90% of all antique residential transactions are inspected by state and state.
After all, in that the "buyer" leads the inspection, the main Japanese inspection and its nature are very different from the "seller".
The seller will try to sell the building as quickly as possible, as high as possible, and as soon as possible.
On the other hand, the buyer, on the other hand, thinks that he wants to live in safety by examining the research, making appropriate adjustments and making sure that he is comfortable.
Even the same inspection, a loophole has been created between the two purposes.
For this reason, the following are highlighted as a risk of concern for the Japanese system:
● The scope of investigation for state-mandated vendor-led inspections remains minimal.
● For an inspection firm, the brokerage firm that presents the case may also be a customer.
Therefore, "graduated" inspections may be carried out, such as not reporting adverse results to the seller.

The name of the booming street that created "Ginksu" in Japan and around the world, "Ginksu" in Tokyo's central district.
Originally, "銀座" referred to the silver coinage founded in 1612 (金17年), and the office of the銀座 was moved to Edo, now in the city of Shikoku.
It was called "New Exchange Town" at the time, but when it moved to the shell town it became known as the "Genghis Khan" by its synonym.
By the way, it was once said that the nearest to the Riksdag was a "peninsula" that had risen out of the sea.
Before the Edo period, the entrance to the river was extended from the Japanese River valley to the central part of the island, and from the Japanese bridge to the central bank, the peninsula known as "Edo Pre-Karaoke".
The tip of the peninsula is now the present-day Genghis Khan.
Tokugawa Ieyasu opened his office in Edo, built the entrance to the river, and furthered the development of the Jingji Bridge area.
In addition, the family has been busy with the construction of the neighborhood and the development of shipping.
And then cut the ground that had cut the jaja and the mountains of Shinada, and filled the river.
It is worth noting that in front of Tiffany's central office, the central office of the city of Ginza (2-7), there is a stone inscription "Ginza's birthplace" showing the location of the office of the city of Ginza.
Who knows, the "pilgrimage to the Holy Land" of the Rings is known.
The annual "Holy Land Pilgrimage" is held in the city of Genghis Khan, known as "Genghis Khan's Eightfold Temple".
Of the more than 10 shrines, the most visible is the "Sacred Lighthouse" in front of the Kojiki Seat.
The company that stands at the right end of the 歌舞 chair, few people enter before and after the performance.
Meanwhile, "Dragon Shinja" is on the roof of the Ginzae House, and "Ginzae Born" is on the Ginzae Terrace on the third and ninth floors of the Ginzae House.
The Baboja Rainbow Temple or the Adhuma Rainbow Temple is located at the back of the street, but is notorious for being revered by the city's leading dancer, the village of Han Han left guard, and the successor to the Rainbow Temple in the entryway of the Ashanti Palace building 1F is not open to the public except for the time around the temple.
This temple includes the worship of the king of the Imams and the goddess of the underworld, but most of the deities offer lightning to the god.
The Fox-housed "Lighthouse" in front of the House of the Company was built as a result of the benefits of the "grain rich" of rice, which is often grown by farmers.
In turn, in large cities like Kyoto and Edoja, it was said that there was a booming business and that beliefs were spreading in every major Japanese city, including the city's main street, the city's main bank.

South Korea's POSCO International has acquired Senex Energy in the state of Hubei, expanded its offshore gas field business.
Poscoja International announced on 12th of July that it has entered into an equity purchase agreement with Senex Energy of Hawaii and an investment agreement to acquire Hancock Energy and Senex Energy.
As the transaction is still pending at the Senex Energy General Meeting and approval of local corporations, the acquisition is expected to be completed in March next year.
The acquisition will be the largest global acquisition, merger and acquisition since the 2010 merger of Poco International into the Poco Group.
The acquisition was worth 777.9 billion won, of which Posco International decided to invest 50.1% and Hancock Energy 49.9% respectively.
Poscoja International explained that the acquisition was decided because demand for natural gas was increasing steadily during the energy transition, and the hydrogen market was divided by the natural gas-based blue hydrogen along with green hydrogen.
Posja International will secure 802 billion cubic feet of natural gas reserves, equivalent to 44% of South Korea's 2019 natural gas consumption, and personnel to operate onshore gas fields in the Ho Chi Minh City area.

The pain in that knee, perhaps a "deformed knee joint"!?
 and different treatments depending on the cause.
Editor's note: Recently, knee pain has continued.
What kind of disease is it possible to have?
Mr. 丸山: The causes of knee pain are various, including injuries, joint rheumatism, and seizures.
Among them, most Japanese people have "deformed joint disorder".
and the Editorial Board: Does this mean that the joints are deformed?
Mr. 丸山: Yes, it is.
The surface of the joints is actually covered with anthrax, which is responsible for relieving shocks and smoothing joint movement.
However, due to age, obesity, intense sports, and so on, the tendon can become weak or distorted.
As a result, it causes joint deformities and inflammation.
ja Editorial Department: Does the degenerative joint develop beyond the knee?
Mr. 丸山: Yes, I know.
In addition to the knee, it can also occur in the joints of the fingers, the ankles, neck, waist, toes, and thighs.
However, the most common cases occurring in the knee are called "deformed knee joint" disorders.
Editor's note: What is the structure of the joint in the first place?
Mr. 丸山: The joint is joined by two bones in a concave shape.
And, the opposite side of these two joints is covered with "joint cartilage", and the surrounding joints are covered with "joint bags".
Editorial: It is a complex structure.
Mr. 丸山: Yes, you are.
In the inner layer of the joint sac there is tissue called the mucosa, which forms the joint fluid.
This joint fluid, which acts as a lubricant, is composed of hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfuric acid.
That is why it is said that "hyaluronic acid or chondroitin sulfuric acid are better for smoothing knee movements".
Editor's note: What symptoms do you experience when you have a degenerative joint disorder?
Mr. 丸山: The joint cartilage is sticky and elastic, and it helps prevent bones from directly colliding with each other.
A role like a pillow, you know.
But when this becomes too weak or distorted, it causes joint deformation, inflammation, and pain.
Are you wearing a pajamas when you go to bed?

The gameplay and gameplay of the Kaigija series, which you can actually experience.
The popularity of the online gambling comic book series 'Kaigi' centred on men has exploded.
One of the flavours of the original is that there is a finite game that has taken its life.
Just watching the photos is so much fun to challenge the Iron Cross!
So this time I want to test the Kaigi game that can actually be played or practiced in project video.
■ The bog is a trap-filled "boog" of the "Gambling Ring Breaker Kaizis" character.
In the original work, Kaizie was shocked by the 1 ball, which was rated at 4,000 yen.
In this bog, a large trap of "nail-forest" "moving objects" "three-stage crews" was set up, and the approach was considered almost impossible.
But Kajaji, using every means possible, finally put a vinyl tank in the building and went out into the wilderness to lower the floor and tilt it, successfully attacking it.
The "boat" in Kajiji is actually a patinco, and many people play it.
Of course, it's not like "one thousand yen", and even the difficulty is lowered, but you can still get a taste of the Kaigi feel.
The Iron Cross was a "human race" that was carried out by debtors including Kaiji at a "Starside Party" held by the wealthy as a bonus.
The debtor and the debtor are competing for speed while working to prevent falling over the thin iron bone installed 10 meters above the ground.
While 12 people can participate and the top two can win prizes, only four iron bones are available, safety measures are inadequate, and the risk of death is quite high.
This high-risk, yet-relevant, railroad crossing was not only developed as a VR game, but also offered a very close experience at the Eagle Bridge, located in the "Miya-Mishi" of the "Oktana Life Park", home of the professional baseball team, the Golden Eagles.
This Eagle Bridge is a 20 meter high iron bridge that spans the building's 7th floor, preceded by a "skybrink" and "victory bridge" that is set up and walks.
Of course, security measures are already in place.
Comedian Koala Storm, who has posted and made headlines on his YouTube channel as "a railroad crossing can be experienced in Japan", posted a video of him walking along the Eagle Bridge.
■Eja card game for two people in a battle of cards  "E-card"
And one emperor card, eight citizens cards, and ten slaves cards are used to play the emperor's side and the slave's side.
The game is very well-crafted, and the emperor is stronger than the citizen, the citizen is stronger than the slave, and the slave is stronger than the emperor.
Kajiji plays against Legan Kawa in the play with a strict rule: "If you lose, you can cut off your own ear".
After the Great Patriotic War, Kaizhi realized that an ear-destroying device like an earphone attached to the ear was being read psychologically by sensing and transmitting pulse rate and body temperature changes, and Kaizhi, who had his ear cut to the extreme, confused and defeated the River Lichen by abnormally cutting his body to the extreme.
Eja cards are available in the market and can be purchased on Amazon, etc.
On YouTube, popular YouTuber Hikalja has posted a video of her competing in E-card with Fujikawa as Kaji in the film, which has sparked controversy.
■Is it possible to taste the Kajija mood?
In situations like Kaji, everyone doesn't want to be, but it's true that reading a comic book can only make you feel good.
Through the game, you can feel the worldview.
Step into the new year, kindly and encouragingly, the prefectural ministry of health and well-being has been given a huge boost to the news.
In preparation for the new year, the great horse "" appeared in the prefectural shōgun shōji shōji (山形市) next year's cadet.
Students from the Northeastern College of Art and Technology who designed it visited the temple for 11 days and performed a service of consecration before the god.
The same company has been commissioning the original painting of the horse from the artisanal college since last year.
This time, the works of the artist from the middle of the three years were painted by nine artists from the Japanese Painting Course, led by Professor Matsujimiming, and were adapted from the works of 22 artists.
The Great Pichha Horse is 3.3 meters wide, the center is about 1.8 meters high.
Turja House said he painted it with "an image of cherry blossoms gently pushing the back of the new year".
The tiger's appearance, stopping and gazing at the cherry blossoms, made him wish he "would have the luxury of admiring the beauty of nature in a rapidly changing world".
The design of the Turja House is also depicted in the generally distributed painted horse.
The great-grandson of the great-grandfather of the Chinese civilization, Chiyū Yū, said, "I think everyone can help overcome difficulties".

Let's think about "Yuja I want to live on"  suggestion to the city4 high-schoolers workshop: Sanyang News Digital
What town will Yūjō in 2030 be?
Student representatives from four high schools in the city of Yujano are working on a workshop on "Yujano I Want to Live on".
As part of the research and policy proposals project of the Yūjōja SDGs Development Center, a central support organization, it brings together young people's voices and makes recommendations to mayors.
"When is it fun? "
To the facilitator's question, students respond verbally to "when they're excited with a lot of people" and "when they want to play drums".
The first time was on November 13th at the Sunrise Party Hall.
In the World Cafe, a method of conversation between 18 high school students and the community, each moving around a theme-based "island", they thought of "a nice town", "a livable town", "a city that feels alive".
Each idea is written on a sticker, pasted on a molded paper and arranged.
"A town with a lot of young people is fun". "Transportation, such as trains and buses, is essential for easy living".
And we will discuss further whether there are any similarities.
"I thought Yajino was boring, but it was fascinating to be able to cycle around the beach", says a 3-year-old student at Yajino Business High.
A three-year-old student at Baynan High School (18), who said, "There are few shops, traffic is not convenient, but the nature is good", said that adults who talk to each other seem to notice not only the local challenges but also the charm.
For the second time in December, only high school students gathered to organize the contents of the presentation.
He plans to invite mayors and heads of education to announce the announcement in February next year.
The director of the Center for the Study of the East, says that "as high school students develop a love of their homeland, they become motivated to engage youth in the struggle".

How to find the new wrapper of the store - Yahoo! News
It's a must-have for winter, but you never get to put a cloth at the bottom of it.
You may be able to balance the mirror after you roll it, but you may hear a voice saying, "I don't know".
If I thought there was a cloth that didn't fit, a stool that could be rolled up, I would have found something new.
The "COTTORI" stalls are about a meter long and feel a more compact size than the common ones.
When I first saw it, I was like, "Can you be so short and roll?"
The fabric is made of a single piece of fabric, and the whole is shaped like a web.
And in the eyes of the net, the end of the stall is being made to penetrate.
So, even if the end and end are not connected, it can be wrapped and kept together.
Very lightweight, warm, and made of free materials.
This year, the top-of-the-line sleeveless jacket is popular, but many people will wear it in combination with a stall to keep their shoulders cool.
I think having a stall like this would be a great help.

I'm doing giggles right before the band broke up, so not the dramatic giggles I imagined.
He worked hard and worked his way through the "I know I'm a jerk, but hey!" or "But hey!" or "George" or "John" or "John" or "John" or "John" or "John" or "John" or "John" or "John" or "John" or "John" or "John" or "John" or "John" or "John" or "John" or "John" or "John" or "John" or "John" or "John" or "John" or "John" or "John" or "John" or "John" or "John" or "John" or "John" or "John" or "John" or "John" or "John" or "John" or "John" or "John" or "John" or "John" or "John" or "John" or "John" or "John" or "John
I don't mean to say that we hate each other so much that we fight, but there is a very strong sense in the atmosphere of "I can't work with you anymore", and the Beatles were like that, which is a funny legendary breakdown.
And when they started playing in that air, everyone was really talented.
The process of changing from a little phrase to "what's up?" to "that song" is a mess.
It's a great moment to be able to get a kick out of the title, especially Get Buck.
It's amazing how a nose song like the unmistakable hum hum hum hum hum has gradually become that hum hum hum hum and the scene of the lyrics is recorded so well.
You don't want to be seen as this is the way the composition is going.
Of course, everyone is getting fat so you can be happy just watching the performance.
Although it still appears to be one of the three episodes, the biggest reason for the split so far was the impression that the surrounding environment was more than the Beatles themselves.
The four of them would have fun if they started making music, but when the producers and advertisers were talking about the live venue, it was easy to see that the producers and advertisers were saying, "Just the Beatles from the world's first!" and then saying, "Oh, they're getting out of their own hands".
Well, since the documentary also includes interpretations by the director, Peter Jackson may have felt that way.
I thought that this might be the reason why Paul is so often seen as a villain instead of Paul, as he is supposed to be supervising.

Several tornadoes and major damage in the United States caused by the effects of the off-season heat and strong cold weather.
Between the hours of 10 a.m. and 11 a.m. local time, several tornadoes struck in the center of the southern United States.
During this period, the atmosphere became very unstable, and clouds of clouds developed rapidly, due to the effects of a strong cold southward downward in places where the record was warm.
In the American South, warm air flowed from the southwest, setting a record high temperature.
In Houston, Texas, the maximum temperature has risen to nearly 30 degrees Celsius on Tuesday and Thursday, local time.
At a place where this record warmth was already present, near 5500m above sea level, as the extreme cold below 30°C dropped to the south, a large temperature difference created an active front and clouds developed rapidly in a way that would have led to a frontal lineage.
Tornadoes appear to have occurred in succession around the area.
South America is originally a tornado-prone region, but during the high season, from early summer to summer, there is little damage during this time.
Tornado warnings issued in one day during the winter season reached nearly 150 times, a record high.
The US Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has reported more than 400 tornadoes and other types of typhoons in the past 10 days (Friday) local time.
From this, we can see that there are two concentrated areas that are broadly separated by the southern line from Kentucky to Texas and the northern line, including Illinois.
In Kentucky, the EF scale (improvement of the Futuda scale) indicates the strength of the tornado, reaching the third strongest of the six levels, EF3, and it is believed that a typhoon immediately after 70m/s was blowing.
Depending on future research, it may be possible to determine EF4 and 5 as well.
In Japan, the Japanese version of the Japanese improved fōtōda scale is based on the JEF (Japanese version of the Japanese improved fōtōda scale) that is adapted to the situation of Japanese architecture.
JEF3, which is equivalent to the current American tornado, is also likely to occur in Japan, a level that will bring down wooden houses.

There was also a call for help with live broadcasting from the "biggest" tornado ever to hit the ground. - Yahoo! News
In his comments on the tornadoes in the Midwestern and Southern United States, President Biden described it as "one of the largest tornadoes in U.S. history".
MIACNN TV reported it and others.
And Biden stressed that "as a federal government, we will do everything we can".
"The full extent of the damage, including how many lives were lost, is not yet known", he explained.
More than 100 deaths have been feared.
In Kentucky, tornadoes affected by tornadoes, residents carrying household items from broken homes, etc., occurred in at least six states, including Kentucky, between the hours of 10 and 11 a.m.
Although records of the extent of tornado damage remain of 219 miles (about 350 kilometers) in 1925 in Missouri and other states, the weather experts at US National Weather Service estimated that this time the largest was about 250 miles (about 400 kilometers).
In Mayfield, Kentucky, where the damage was severe, a candle factory that was operating 24 hours a day in preparation for the Christmas trade war was also severely damaged.
Although 110 people were employed at the time, the building was destroyed and left no trace of it.
In the dark, a woman who could not move under a roughly 1.5 meter thick shell, feeling the weight of the lifeguard searching over the shell, called for help from her mobile phone via Facebook live broadcast.
The live broadcast that was released today, in addition to the screams of women calling for help, also sounded a cry or the singing of "Happy Birthday to You", which another woman is believed to have sung while crying to stir up terror.
Amber Brown, a convenience store owner in Mayfield, was safe and quiet in her home's basement with her five-year-old son, who was hidden in the tornado alert.
"And many people compared it to the sound of a train, but it was a terrible sound, like an earthquake that something more was exploding".
A Mayjafield City Police officer said, "The search continues until no longer necessary.
I don't know how many weeks, months, or years that will be, but I don't know how many years".
In Illinois, a storage facility for Amazon, an internet retailer, collapsed, killing at least six people.
Blockages are followed by a shock to the railway car so that it is cut off, or by the impact of a highway or a vehicle overturning.

It has long been said that different people think differently about the rating system of the star system.
While foreign countries are scoring five stars as a benchmark, Japan claims to be scoring three stars as a neutral plus/minus.
Since there is already a difference of two stars at the reference point, four stars have a completely different meaning when they say "there is a reduction element" and "not a title but a good one".
If you consider five stars, then "work without defect" and "work of the highest standard" are the same, and if there is such a tendency, then I think it would be a systemic flaw that does not suggest the meaning of the star, but because such a system is currently being used, you should not place a star rating.
So if you try to challenge those who claim this kind of argument with Steam's two-way rating, the argument will be broken.

The family has come a long way in establishing environmental protection efforts in China and the surrounding region.
(Katoyo Yori: Hong Kong EnterpriseFind Asia Business Consultant) China, with a vast landmass, is also important in terms of biodiversity, the species of mammals that live in it are the world's first, and the species of plants are the world's third.
Some self-governing communities recognize the value of biodiversity and are not only protecting the environment as governments do, but also promoting environmental activism.
Siasapanna, Yunnan province in southwestern China, is one such region.
Li Li Lianja, sister of Ceipan, who is now active as an actress, is a region bordering Laos and Myanmar, and a region where many ethnic minorities live, including the Thai people who share roots with the Thai kingdom.
The Mekong River, which flows through Southeast Asian countries, is a major source of water.
The Sissapanna Taija Nation is an autonomous province of the Sissapanna Nation, which covers only 0.2% of China's total land area, but is home to about 25% of the wildlife species and 20% of the plant species.
This time around, I've told Li果, who is involved in environmental protection activities in Sijapanna, about the content of the activity that has taken place on the ground.
■ She started environmental protection with her German husband ― ― I celebrated 20 years of environmental protection.
And what was the motive behind it?
Mr. Lija, our environmental protection campaign "天" has been active since 2000.
The inspiration for this was my husband, Joseph Margraf.
Husbandja is from Germany and came to Cezapanna for a joint scientific project between the United Nations and China.
This is the only area of rainforest in China, and it has a significant biodiversity.
But, at the same time, economic development was slow.
For this reason, large-scale deforestation of the tropical rainforest has been carried out in the past to establish industry in the region and to produce rubber that was scarce in China.
My husband was sent here from Germany to work on restoring natural resources and researching biological resources.
And, as I was a reporter here, I met and married him.
― ―And before that, Lee was not interested in nature conservation? ―
Mr. Lija, I am from Cezapana but I was not interested in the importance of the rainforest or the meaning of biodiversity.
So she and her husband went on to pursue the project without that knowledge.
And even though I don't have a good face or a particularly tall face, I do see people with auras occasionally, but why do you think?
A popular actor once said, "I'm sorry".
And aora is not something that you want to go out.
And it's something that comes naturally in the moment of self-confidence.
The person must have a strong sense of self-confidence.

I wonder if it's too much to say that the other person's clothes are homely or colorful?
It's not too small, is it?
It's not as obvious as it seems.
And I don't think it is small.
And since there's no such thing as a complimentary, detailed statement, I don't know what that means.
And a little compliment or something?
What would you do if you confessed to Mr. Yokoyama?
"And confessing to Ms. Sakura, my heart is full of joy, please", he replies.

MOD itself is the cause of environmental CTD, and it took about a month and a half to complete.

Is it due to a mistake in setting the shader of an actor/NPC costume or body mesh for an actor/NPC costume? Furthermore, SPID 2.0 uses default.ini in writing, but as a result, the intended result is that the NPC should be subject to Perk presupposition.
At first, I focused on the check-in with wet clothes on the site attack or OnjaHit related motion/battle MOD (of the.dll) but the result was something like this.
I don't think there were any similar bug reports at English, German or French level.
I was asked to post thinking that if someone has a similar CTD problem in a Japanese-speaking environment, it might be a reference for a reminder.
And most of them are doing it with a gritty mindset,

I'm not retired from mental health, but I think it was a limitation just before I retired.
And thinking about the importance of visiting nursing psychiatrists - today's visiting nursing is over.
I have been a visiting nurse for a long time, because I have bipolar disorder, but I feel that I am getting along longer and have a very good relationship with the nurse from the visiting nursing station I am using now.
We talk about a lot every week.
Of course, it will also do the necessary things for pharmaceutical management, but above all, I have found in today's visiting nursing how important it is to have pleasant communication for people with mental illness.
Today we are talking about gender disparities and even talking about gender issues.
We also talk about sexual desires of men and women, why she got divorced, and can we do that with a nurse?
Sometimes, though, I dress up as a woman.
I've heard from people I know that in the case of visiting nursing stations run by psychiatric hospitals, a nurse who is unable to work in the ward will come and provide only administrative assistance, or that an occupational therapist in visiting nursing will come and direct you from above, "because you are doing medical care".
I am using a small visiting nursing home run by a social welfare corporation, but I think she is a really good nurse who can face Frank, as opposed to me with mental illness.
By the way, she's a beautiful person who laughs.
And many of you are likely to be receiving a psychiatric visit or thinking about receiving one.
And visiting nursing is very beneficial for people with mental illness.
If approved by the doctor, we are happy to accept it.
And then let's choose a good visiting nursing station.
In the past, I have had to cancel contracts from here because I was not necessarily opposed.

South Korea's patent on hydrogen technology, China's fifth... "The implementation of the hydrogen economic roadmap is delayed" (中央日報日本語版) - Yahoo!ニュース
The South Korean government has announced a 2019 hydrogen economy roadmap.
The plan was to have 65,000 fuel cell vehicles in circulation by 2022 and to operate 310 hydrogen stations nationwide.
The target price of hydrogen was 6000 won per kilogram (577 yen).
But by November's standards, fuel cell cars are only 27 percent of the target level (about 17,000).
The schedule for the deployment of the core infrastructure's hydrogen stations and the targeted 38 percent (about 117 cases) of the price of hydrogen per kilometer is not much different from the roadmap's announcement at the time of the announcement, at 8,400 watt.
It was found that the government's implementation of the hydrogen economic roadmap has significantly lowered the target values.
The National Coalition of Economists (NCEA) on the 12th of July released its report "The current state of the hydrogen economic ecosystem and policy direction".
According to the report, it is a fact that the core components and materials of the hydrogen industry are largely dependent on the United States, Japan, etc.
The carbon fiber in the fuel cell car core material is supplied by the fuel cell carrier, and the carbon fiber is supplied by the fuel cell carrier, the fuel cell carrier, the fuel cell carrier, the fuel cell carrier, the fuel cell carrier, the fuel cell carrier, the fuel cell carrier, the fuel cell carrier, the fuel cell carrier, the fuel cell carrier, the fuel cell carrier, the fuel cell carrier, the fuel cell carrier, the fuel cell carrier, the fuel cell carrier, the fuel cell carrier, the fuel cell carrier, the fuel cell carrier, the fuel cell carrier, the fuel cell carrier, the fuel cell carrier, the fuel cell carrier, the fuel cell carrier, the fuel cell carrier, the fuel cell carrier, and so on.
The number of patented hydrogen technologies in the world and the six countries that dominate the hydrogen market (China, the United States, the European Union, Japan, Korea, Germany) has increased by an average of 14% per year (after 2014).
In terms of the number of patents in the field of hydrogen production, fuel cell and fuel cell (cumulative 2014-2020), South Korea ranks fifth in the world.
But the JACKROL reported that "the top six countries, in fact, account for the majority of the world's hydrogen market, in fact, mean the bottom of the competing countries".
The ranking of patents by country is in China, the United States, the EU, Japan.
Since 2017, China has been pushing the gap since it surpassed the United States at number one.
The number of patents registered in 2020 has surpassed Korea's Japan (974 patents) by 1,033 to number four, while China's 4721 patents are at a 22 percent level.
The National Strategic Technology Council proposed that "hydrogen technology should be designated as a 'national strategic technology' with significant reductions in the investment of equipment and the cost of R&D".
It has been a month and a half since surgery to cut the muscles of the fingers.

The military aid weapons and ammunition arrived in Ukraine and the troops were also trained.
(CNN) U.S. Department of State officials reported that by 12 January, equipment containing small arms and ammunition had arrived in Ukraine under a security assistance plan approved by President Biden.
Military aid totaling 60 million euros (about 6.8 billion yen) will be delivered to Ukraine at the beginning of the year, with the last equipment, including four radar systems to identify launch sites such as mortars, to be delivered to Ukraine.
According to a US Department of Defense spokesman, Kirby, these aid measures included lethal weapons such as anti-tank missiles Jaberine.
The military support is intended to strengthen Ukraine's national defense capabilities, such as the military buildup that Russian forces are advancing against the Ukrainian border.
The MIA has also increased its alert to Russian military movements, consulted with NATO member states, and devised a response plan in case Russia invades Ukraine.
President Biden had approved the arms assistance on September 1 of this year when President Zelensky of Ukraine visited the White House.
U.S. military aid to Ukraine this year reached about $450 million.
Since Russia forcibly annexed the Ukrainian-Crimean peninsula, the total aid amounted to more than $2.5 billion.
The MIA is also engaged in training missions for the Ukrainian military.
Last month, the U.S. State of Florida sent troops to the country as part of a multi-national joint training program supported by Ukraine.
According to a statement from the U.S. Department of Defense, the U.S. Special Operations Forces in Europe also play a major role in training and advising Ukrainian special operations forces.
The number of U.S. special forces operating in Ukraine has not been disclosed as a matter of confidentiality during the operation.
While President Biden held an online meeting with Russian President Putin on July 7, he also had a close conversation on the situation in Ukraine.
The United States has also shown willingness to impose severe economic sanctions in the event of an invasion.

The "revision" of the inheritance-gift tax process that makes lifetime gifts "forbidden hands" directly hit the former chairman of the SDP's tax commissioner, Ghanliming!
The first feature of the December 18 issue of "The Diamond of the Week" was, "Speak to the family at the end of the year!
It is a lifetime gift-in-heritage technique".
While the debate on the legacy tax and gift tax integration continues, the concerned 2022 tax reform agenda has been seen as a step forward, but in the near future, lifetime gifts, the royal method of dealing with inheritance tax, are likely to become "prohibited".
How will the rules of succession change?
Along with the direct hit to the former chairman of the DPRK's Tax Adjuster, Ghani, and the House of Representatives, he will teach the basic principles of gift and inheritance, from taxation to tax saving techniques, for timely, convenient, and profitable gifts throughout the year.
(Diamond editorial department 宮原ja啓彰)
● To the "prohibitors" of lifetime gifts, from property owners to urban entrepreneurs, "to advance a thorough consideration of the taxation of inheritance and gift tax in terms of a more integrated approach, toward building a neutral tax system in the choice of the time of asset transfer.
As a result of the 2021 fiscal reform agenda, which was announced last year by the party and the party, there was considerable unrest not only among the wealthy but also among the middle class.
Because, as the saying goes, by changing the inheritance rules and making "forbidden" the "lifetime gift", the royal method of taxation, it means to raise the inheritance tax.
The rules for tax avoidance of progressive inheritance taxes are to "reduce taxable property".
The most powerful of these offers, the gift of life, has been widely used by wealthy people, of course, even by businessmen who are subject to inheritance tax at a lower rate because they have a home in the three metropolitan areas.
The debate that followed was "the integration of inheritance and gift tax".
Although the 22nd Annual Tax Reform Agenda, which was announced on 10 December and was concerned about the fastest implementation, was seen as a step towards integration in the "revised current inheritance tax system and calendar year gift system" and "the non-taxation of gift tax measures is a system that does not require any taxation on the transfer of assets within the family within a limited amount of time", the policy was reviewed in more advanced texts.
In an interview with the editorial department of this magazine, the former chairman of the Taxation Inquiry of the SDP, Ghanliming, the former chief executive, said:
"The most important thing is to keep the tax burden the same whenever and how much the property is transferred, and the advantages and disadvantages of the transfer period.
I'm currently simulating what kind of problem (by integration) arises". If the quickest correction were made, the remaining chance of a lifetime gift would be three times greater.
If not, it is likely that in the near future, a major move will be made towards the elimination of lifetime gifts as tax-saving measures.
So, how exactly do the rules for inheritance and gift tax change?

The teams that won the NFL 1 game pass 3 times, the players, how did they feel?
In this game, Jones' pass to the Patriots was only three times.
This was the fewest passing game in the NFL in the last 50 years since the Bills recorded two passes in Week 3 of 1974 against the New York Jets.
The 1974 Bills had an unusually talented RB named O.J. Simpson, who had surpassed 2,000 yards in a season for the first time in history.
Bills had overwhelmed the Jets with a run by Simpson and another RB Jim Braxton.
The biggest reason the Patriots were carrying out such an extreme offense was the weather.
Buja Buffalo is a town near the Canadian border, not in the same latitude as the Northeast Passage.
And on this day, after a temperature of almost 1°C, a wind of 18m blew, and before the game, snow was blowing.
The Bills were only local, and they didn't change their play options much.
The run is 25 times against the 30 passes.
Alja Allen's pass was 15/30 yards and 145 yards.
And there was no intercept, and it never went out.
In the 10 offensive series, there were four Red Zone breaches and scoring machines.
In particular, since the end of the third quarter, the team has advanced to the Red Zone three times in a row.
But in those three times, FG only took three points from one.
Goal and defense of the final goal of the game.
The Bills, who were four-point chase, were third and 14th, finishing with a penalty of 3rd and 9th.
18 yards to go with the goal.
In 3rd & 14th, QB Allen, surrounded by a dash of Patriots defense, came out of his pocket and flowed right.
And then he threw a pass to end zone T.D. Knox, but failed.
In this play, the ESWR Stefan Diggs, who was outside right, walked over the Sharon Acrosse and was free in front of the end zone, but Allen apparently didn't see it.
4th & 18th, Allen was aiming for WR Gabriel Davis, who ran from outside the end zone to the left, but the pass ended in failure when he was beaten by Patriots' DB Miles Bryant in front of his hands.
While Bryant was covering Bills' WRCall Beasley with a man-to-man, he watched Allen's movements along the way, dropped Beasley, and reacted to the pass.
Allen, who missed two receivers, threw a pass to the end zone twice.
The pass of the fourth down may have been decisive, but the third down didn't have to be TD's.
We should take the first down in two plays.
It was only two minutes before the fourth and short, so Allen's ability to run his own runs would have been revived.

It's time to "throw away" and "change away" items that will be left in the kitchen for a long time.
Sponge is a sponge.
Although it is often replaced, the sponge is probably not replaced as often as recommended.
A 2017 study found that even if kitchen sponges are disinfected daily with electron range, many bacteria can reproduce.
German researchers who conducted this study recommend that the sponge be replaced once a week to keep it clean.
The board is very small.
The United States Department of Agriculture has warned that if the crane starts to rub, scratch, or crease, the crane should be replaced.
Once the wound or groove has developed, it becomes difficult to keep it clean, as bacteria multiply.
If you're still fine, don't forget to frequently disinfect the odorless liquid bleacher in 1 gallon (3.8 liters) of water with a table-spoon-1 cup of dissolved solution.
Soak the surface of the plate in liquid and place a number of dots.
Sprinkle clean water, naturally dry it, or cut and dry the water slightly with a clean paper towel.
And missing or broken food items.
Disposing of your favorite magcup may cause chest pain, but the missing surface will be a new warmth bed for bacteria and bacteria.
It also causes the missing part to cut off the lips and the drink to spill.
Yes, it's a chance to buy a new favorite mag!

Community markets and trade are different.
And the community marketplace uses a steam payment system.
This feature is useful for dealing with other red people in cash, rather than with cash, whereby you can only keep items without paying them.
Because it doesn't happen.

FlashjaBIOS never ends, please help me.
I bought Ryjazen7 5800X and replaced it with the B550 I bought in September with the Tomato.
Once I went to the BIOS settings screen, but when I saved the settings and restarted them, the white cursor-like dots on the black screen flashed and remained untouched.
Even if you try to rewrite it using FlashBIOS, thinking that the BIOS is broken, it doesn't work out at all.
According to MSI's blog, it seems to end in about five minutes but not an hour.
The reason for this is that the USB memory you tried is too old and you can switch between the SD card and the USB card.

By the way, Japan is a good place to be.
Japan is a country of the Japanese.
It has nothing to do with the wind and the wind.
It's better to say early, "Why am I the only one who's a dumpster?"
So when it comes to being an outsider, it's best to say that it's just not comfortable.
I don't think I ever dreamed of having a bad mind with a good chance.
I was on my way to live abroad, but Japanese travelers who went abroad, including me, mistakenly assumed that people who didn't like the upper-class religious practices could stay in the country and say anything to the locals.
If Westerners look like they're purely evil, I think they're doing it with a kind of sense of guilt or a sense of humor.
If my friend or Westerner were a friend, I would call him by the following name, but sometimes I get a little lost when I speak Japanese.
Well, I'm still good friends with you.
Although the original is purely normal, it is best to say now, as the exceptional treatment that is considered to be a gadget may not be effective.
I'm Japanese, so can't you please talk to me according to Japanese rules?
Henna: It doesn't matter, but my white friends who are returning home always raise their glasses higher than other youngsters when they have a toast at a party.
I'm sure you're aware of that, but I think it's a good habit to do so because you're not going to get a weird grumpy face when you're younger or older or you're going to get treated like a Japanese.
Japanese people are such a small-minded person, regardless of their personality, because there are people (including me) who are fucked up.

I only judge by translated text, as I have only a limited understanding of English.
I think the translated text is a level that is unobstructed in terms of understanding what I want to convey, and playing it.

I think that a non-Japanese speaker can understand the subtle nuances of Japanese even if he studies for a long time.
I don't know what level you're looking for, but if the Japanese are looking for a level where they don't feel any difference, it's thought you should look for another one.

And the battle is to explore the practice of the 'Ghost-Destroying Blade'.
"Equal exchange of effort" is a human hymn.
Among recent teen comics, The Ghostbusters is particularly unusual in that it is "a lot of practice".
The theory is that, in most cases, there is no battle, and that the practice of exercising at dawn and dusk is not popular with readers.
That's also evident from the fact that even in the same jump comic strip 'ONE PIECE' when a piece of corn was lost, it took two years of practice, drawing only touch and the rest of it flying fast.
Well, one of the attractions of the Wampie is the eccentricity of the walking land, although "stay and practice in the same place" may not always be as appropriate.
Now, the practice of the protagonist of 'Ghost Killers' Anjingiro, who sat down to beg for life and tried to take his own life, began with the words to the hero, "Don't let others take your life!"
And the weak have no right or choice, only to be forced by force to surrender to the strong...
That is to say, the gentleness of the hero is also the fact that the recent introduction of the "guardian" who trains aspiring cadets of the Ghost Killers is a very simple one that does not explain its intent.
The first contact between Anja and kataka was when asked, "What do you do when your sister eats a human?" and the answer was "Justice is slow".
Even among fans, it is a story-telling, one-on-one, and unrealistic interaction.
Taking a ghostly sister with you implies the possibility that a moment may come when you will be forced to make such a decision.
It can be said that the initiative is a mind-blowing one that goes into practice.
But he took an amateur anarchist who had not yet practiced to a narrow foggy mountain and told him to go down to the top of the mountain by dawn and drop the waterfall.
The air is thin and the air is full of traps, pitchers, and traps, and it almost dies before it enters practice.
Yet, with the sharp sense of smell that he had before, he could smell the slight smell of man-made vanas, and barely avoid them in any way, making it a "protagonist's fix".
Yet, the essence of making Anchorage say "I'm not so physically fit that I can suddenly avoid it all!" is that it's a ghost-killing thing.
The normal human being, without any support, suddenly becomes stronger or awakens, and only then can "the power and skill that has been refined so far" be used in its true potential.
The "exchange of effort" - which is not worth anything to those who have done the hard work, who are not paid enough, and who have not done the hard work - is a human hymn, unlike a ghost with unfounded supernatural powers, and a compelling rule consistent with the work.

I think it's "hard" to draw a line in order to get some sort of benefit from more than just the minimum amount of work.

Samsung Electronics of South Korea has created a new "DX department" that integrates home appliances and mobile phones, "emphasizing user experience" (WoW!Korea) - Yahoo! news
Samsung Electronics continued to integrate the CE and IM departments into set departments, decided to name the company DX ((Device Experience) and announced on 12 December that it would reflect this in the end-of-year organizational transformation.
The aim of enhancing user experience through a variety of services, from mobile to home appliances, can be read.
Samsung Electronics has revealed that its newly launched DX division, which will be merging the CE and IM divisions, will be from business divisions such as VD, Visual Display, Consumer Electronics, Medical Devices, MX, Mobile Experience, Networking, and more.
A Samsung Electronics spokesperson explained that "the name change reflects the medium-term business structure and future-orientedness, as well as the strengthening of global leadership".
It also emphasized the idea that products such as TV, appliances, smartphones, and communication devices, of course, will allow consumers to easily enjoy an optimized experience through service solutions that reflect customer needs.
The name reflected the introduction of the integrated leadership system into the machine, a strategy to create synergies across the organization and build a differentiated product and service base beyond the boundaries between organizations.
Samsung Electronics is already devising a strategy through the "Multi Device Experience" conference to allow users to freely access content and services through the interconnection of devices, such as home appliances and smartphones based on the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI).

This is a bit unnatural.

I think it should be.
What worries me is that I'm not interested in the real thing.
*and have you made reference to other documentaries?
*and are you looking at it from the ant's point of view?

If you translate the armoured heads into a disc-shaped head, you'd think the part "on the scale of an ant is a giant beast with a shell" would disappear.
I know that 24 trailers collided, the driver of the trailer was sick, unwell, and not paying attention.
In the aftermath of the collision of 24 cars in Aija Prefecture's small pastoral town, the driver of the trailer arrested and sent for inspection was found not to be ill, but to have been accidentally injured due to some kind of negligence.
On the morning of 10th, 24 trucks and passenger cars collided on National Road 41 in the small pastoral town of Chuochaja, 12 people were slightly injured.
Police arrested 54 suspected gunmen who were driving a trailer on the charge of causing injury to a 71-year-old man after a first-time hit-and-run accident.
The tractor of the suspected victim continued to step on the brakes after the accident, and the fire department confirmed that the suspected victim had temporarily lost consciousness shortly after the accident.
However, according to investigators, it was found that the suspect was not ill, but that some sort of negligence was the cause.
Police are searching the victim's home and investigating the circumstances at the time.

After Mr. Helper came home, he was in hiding.
The first episode of the comic book series The Kinks Review, fourth volume, is published by Yahoo! News.
The 20th Super-Human Olympics, which began with 3 volumes, ended with these 4 volumes!
Unlike the previous installment, which was shot in one take from opening to semi-final, which focused on just one game, the new plot is full of new tricks!
●ja' 'kin肉man' 4 volumes  Review of the postman name ぬまX★★★★★★★★★★★★★ 5 stars out of 5) ● Superhuman Prowess is already starting right before the game!
These four volumes are, quite literally, a detailed account of the final match of the game between the Chickenman and Robin Mask, but I would like to emphasize first of all that this is not a book that is solely about the ring game.
And even though the signatures, the hand-to-hand combat, the training landscape, and so on, are not exactly the same, it's never boring.
This feeling of increasing tension in the work that the First War of the Century was about to begin is certainly linked to the rise in tension among readers, and it is surprising that even this period was a really calculated performance.
And, one more thing you can't miss before the important final is the three-game series between Terrieman and Lermanman.
While it is a fancy match card, I like the fact that Lamman was behind the scenes before the game and said to the chickenman poster, "From now on, I'm going to be jealous!"
And trying to beat the chops.
But when the tellerman who passed by suddenly grabbed the knife and stopped, silently and silently, the scene was just about to break apart.
What's amazing is that both of them are already losing, and there is no longer a chance to fight the henman in this tournament.
But there's this kind of boring rumor about the chicken man.
When you are shown this way, you cannot help but think of a future activity!
That's what it's like to be a character, and it's still a painful experience for me as a cartoonist!
The two fights ended without much of a fight, and the famous scene was the crying cry of the Lamentman after the match.
"Don't be surprised by the strength of God's good fortune for the Kinja-Man!
It's a very special thing.
Is this a spectacular metaphor for the work itself, that even readers who have read it before have felt that Kinman was ultimately victorious, in a way that he could not lose because he was the protagonist?
But by making Lamman make this statement, Mr. Yue-Tang has been stabbing himself to the point of not being able to use his hand.
In this phrase, the reader asks, "Well, then, does a chickenman actually knock down a robin with his power?
How can you eat? "
You can imagine the unprecedented development again, and from another literary point of view, this is the same meaning that Mr. Yuvraj imposed on himself as a binding upon himself in the making of his work.
This was a remarkable achievement.
And I think it's definitely one of the big points of this volume.
