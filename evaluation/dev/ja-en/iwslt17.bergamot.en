It's about how we get knowledge.
This woman, Natalian Lipptinski.
It's an old-fashioned death.
I'm going to call Dr. Dead.
Latif Naser: I thought it was especially interesting.
In the summer of 2006, she had a file-leaf bed.
Nathalia: I think it's bored.
When she noticed something.
It's an old red-colored palm.
He fell ground.
I thought it was just a piece of wood.
But I'm going back to the night camp.
I'm looking at the old wheel.
It's probably because of storage.
It was bone.
She's been a long time since I've been here.
There's no number. It's like small plastic bags.
I'm going to show you some examples.
It's really hard.
It's a little bit more complicated.
So I used 3D scanners.
It's amazing, isn't it?
It's been easy to work on the screen.
I'm so impressed when I'm all combined.
How was your confidence?
If you're building another assembled, maybe different?
No, I'm sure of it.
I found her bones, leg bones, and vinces.
It wasn't like that.
It's too big.
It's a great size.
What animal was that?
She's got one of them.
We've had a characteristic smell.
It smells like burning meat.
It smells like Natalian cuts off the skull.
Cholagen maintains the structure.
And that's what happens.
It's a little bit like this.
And then, after one or two years,
Each animal has a little bit a little bit different, differently, and if you know unknown bone collargens, you may be able to identify it.
That's why I sent one bone.
I wanted to track it.
He handles bones, compares 37 modern mammals.
I found matching animals.
The bone holder of bones were buried in the northernmost region of Nathia.
It was camel.
I thought, "What?"
I've tested many bones.
But when I think of the bones found, this camel camel was three percent more than present.
The height of the height was about 2.7 meters.
That's right.
It was the Great Arctic camel.
You're going to hear me that everyone's going to be a hooka.
The picture in the head will probably be the human cobrada of this human cobrada, which lives in the desert.
Why did that animal reach the Arctic?
Actually, scientists have been known before the discovery of Nataria.
It was born here.
It's been about 4,500 million years since camel appeared, but it's about 450,000 years.
What's wrong with you?
Nathalia: The body's size.
It's a very long type.
I've got a face like crocodile.
The early primitive camel was very small and thick.
Latif: What? Is rabbit-sized camel?
It's an early type.
You don't know.
It's like having rabbit camel.
I'm sure it's great.
And then, 3 to 7 million years ago, came down to South America, Rama and Alpaca.
Last day, the end of the glacier.
It's already known. It's not completely explained that it was discovered in northern.
For example, temperature, Sahara Desert is positive.
It's definitely 3500,000 years ago.
That's why the wleaf forest was spread.
But the winter will continue six months.
And bladder.
The dark night was 24 hours.
All right.
How could the superstar survive the Arctic climate?
And that's what's happening.
And that's great.
What if we think of the fakda's feature, what's evolution like winter?
If you're walking on the sand, it's not like walking on the sand.
I'm surprised you're not water, but it's not water, but it's hard to get a winter over the food?
Then, after beyond the land bridge, after a while, we've been working on a winter-to-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go
For example, if you store the whole fat, it's like a lactic, it's a hot climate.
It's easy to escape heat.
It's been thought that this instinct idea, it's a typical evidence that he adapted to the desert.
I'm not this first.
And that's what we're doing.
But I don't know why I like this.
It's about me. It's about itself.
I was an educated.
And that's what we're doing.
They're gonna understand past.
It's called space, planets, and Earth's life.
And that's what we're doing.
We're going to build stories.
It's a very well-known story.
I've been in desert.
I'm sure you'll find small evidence.
And that's what I'm talking about.
In this case, it was also known as one scientist, and it's like a tree, and it's like a book of Dr. Suse.
My idea is different.
It's a very important thing to do.
Thank you very much.
Hello, Azouri. Hello.
Here you go. Eat.
It's called the "Syri."
Not just kidding.
Now, this Azuri is a story about our world is dynamic evidence.
We're going to reassemble stories.
Isn't that right, Azuri?
There's a world's new view over the bone.
Thank you.
Today's computer is too kind.
I'd like to talk to you today about this problem and this is about nerve science.
In 2011, the night of harem's night,
I've been working on a computer science and a neuroscientist, and a bar outside Columbia University.
When our conversations are tides, then his phone was lighted.
He started typeing for this.
And when you look up, he said,
But, of course, his eyes have gone.
And then on the side of the bar, another student has a phone, set up a friend.
Show Instagram's pictures of the flash and showed it.
I'm not going to talk about what's happening.
It's not digital information, but simply display devices are quarantined me from friends.
They were connected around something, like you're talking about stories around the fire, like my ancestors developed social cognitives.
It's an extension.
It's happening on the other side.
When you're sending my wife, I'm writing a symphony, or when you're embarrassing your wife.
It's going to be a little bit more complicated.
I think it's wrong.
We're going to do that.
It's not a sensory.
Here we have such machines.
It's called "Meta Two."
Let's try it.
I'm going to show you what I'm doing.
So we're going to go into the hologram experience of three, two, one, one, one, one, two, three, one, two, three, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, two, three, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one,
Of course, it's good for shopping, learning material, and you can control good.
Iron Man's proud will.
I'll show you soon.
(Applause) If you think like me, you think about what can you do with such technology.
My mother is an architect.
My mother's now touching the video and selects interiors.
It's all taken through headgiers.
The next example is very personal.
As a student of brain neuroscientists, I always dream about learning like this variety of complex brain structures.
It's an extension reality that's now being extended.
Come on.
And that's what we're doing.
And that's what we're doing.
Imagine a little bit of story, a story, a cerator, an intellectual designer, and what does it mean to us here?
And I'm going to show you a couple of examples.
I'm very passionate.
Well, let's make a secret.
In about five years, this isn't a small device, but these all the thin glasses that will project the holograms.
When we picked your phone, hardware itself, it's so important.
It's very important to make this appropriately.
I don't know what you're thinking.
In all the possibilities, we led the most intuitive interfaces to design.
And this center is called "Small Resistance"
It's not like that.
I'm going to make a computer.
It's a system that allows users to use.
We're going to introduce three main design guidelines.
The most important thing is "OS"
The system made up of traditional files are complex, abstract, and so forth.
It's a little bit like this.
But in extended reality, you can put the hologram's TED panel here and put hologram mail on the other side of the desk.
I want to buy it from Teslacar to the tetra car.
Okay, this is your brain.
The second interface is "see."
What do you want?
Reach your hands.
It's called "Natural Machines."
It's called visual system.
So you can do it, but you can control it.
That's why I'm watching.
But it's not enough as experience.
It's not about humans.
It's the third guide.
The primate's mirror neuron subsystem shows that if we can see each other and hands three-dimensional.
I'm going to show you a video behind me.
Let's take a look at this.
Our favorite iOS.
Let's go ahead and move this headset.
Now I'm with you.
I'm going to show you some examples.
And my personality work, I'm going to break this headset into thousand parts, and touch my sensor to scan my hand.
But it's not enough to see this alone.
Hey, Ray. How are you?
I'm going to show you some examples.
With realistics.
Thank you very much.
My mirror neuron system suggests that they'll take them soon.
Ray, how's it going?
It's okay. It's live.
(Laughter) (Applause) Ray, I saw you on the video.
You'll change this to the phone, but we'll change how we work together.
Thank you.
- Thank you, Ray.
You're welcome.
(Laughter) (Applause) This is the message I found in that bar in 2011.
It's in us here.
If you leave today, you'll be able to find out what's going on here.
So, all 100 staffs to work on Meta, office management, designer, engineer, monitor screens, and you're using "natural machines."
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I'd like to hear it.
And I'm going to show you some examples.
It's also pointed to be pointed out on the field of vision.
You showed me real video?
Of course it's true.
And that's what we're doing.
I wanted to experience real experiences throughout the headgiers.
Thanks for introduction.
Thank you.
My land is the most free, forensibility, promising, prosthane,
I grew up in my family.
My mother was artist, my father's professor, my professor, and I'm very grateful to my own environment.
I actually didn't see the path as my parents.
I don't care if you've ever heard of college.
And I started a professional horner.
I'm going to show you some examples.
And at the end of my 20s,
What a good life.
My parents don't complain.
We've been supporting you.
It wasn't their ideal.
He said to the neighbors and friends:
But I've only had a conversation about my way.
I was back from Barcelona at 27 years old in Barcelona.
My mother's innocence.
I thought something's crazy.
"What are you thinking?"
My mother said, "We're very worried about you."
"What do you mean?"
"I'm sure I'm honest with you."
Well, really, I'm not interested in politics.
And that's what happened.
I'm a enthuman of capitalism.
It's from a long time since I've ever been interested.
I remember the first time in Seattle.
My family was low-level.
It's distant.
I've never seen poverty and poverty.
It wasn't like you've experienced.
It's a picture from the National Geographic.
It was obvious that we can't help.
Some of those who remember that picture,
It's a picture of poverty that keeps suffering.
It's been burned in the painting.
I'm worried about her.
What happened to those around the world?
I've never looked at the university there.
What happened to me?
And the answer was found.
And that's what we're talking about.
If the U.S. people have improved poverty, the world's poorest, then 70 percent would answer hunger after early '70s.
Let's teach the truth.
It's called my world.
From 1970 to today, people living in the world's population.
It's about 80 percent of my kids.
I didn't know that.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is a miracle.
It's rejoiced.
And that's what we're doing.
(Laughter) (Applause) (Applause)
I can't reproduce why we could.
If you've been able to reproduce this, then we've been able to save 200 billions of people from poverty.
I want to know that to save 200 billion.
So I started looking.
I didn't do politics.
I'm not interested.
The best answer from the main economists.
Let's say that.
That's five successful factors.
We saved their brothers and sisters.
One is Glossing.
Second is free trade.
Three, property rights.
Fourth is legalism.
Five's starting.
It's possible in the world since the '70s.
It's not just that.
I know that the free companies are not perfect.
But it's amazing.
It's over politics.
What I learned is.
It's not about capitalism.
The best part of capitalism is a volunteer that people speak on this platform.
You must spread this volunteer.
Now, let's talk about the second understanding of the second, and we're going to talk about the second, and we're going to talk about what's happening here.
It's the best way to think about poverty relief.
"I've saved billions from poverty."
Whose words?
It's like Milton Freeman, Ronald Reagan.
No.
I'm President Balak Obama.
Why are you sure?
He's directly told me.
I can't believe.
It's called "Banza!"
And I thought, "What's going on?"
You know what?
In May 2015, at Georgetown University.
I thought that America's greatest solution is the greatest solution to America.
And that's what we're doing.
You know that there's a crisis in America and the world.
And now we're working on a crisis.
It's a unpleasant situation.
Last year, a paper was published in the U.S. Academy of Sciences.
It's called "The Political Motivator."
In the definition of psychologists, my own ideology is born from love, but the enemy's world view is born from hatred.
It's common in conflicts.
It's not just about Palestine.
What's the author of this paper?
We believe that we're in love, they're acting hate.
Think about it.
"My ideology wants to help people with a very basic generity, but they're trying to fall into me."
It's not going to work.
Unable
So, what's the solution?
Let's be honest.
It's not that simple.
There's a lot of good studies.
My friend Jonathan Heit,
I'm a professor of psychology at New York.
We're studying different differences from Ideology, values, moral views.
He says that he's pretty different from the Conservatives and liberal people.
For example, according to High, people who keep poverty in liberal, 59% more than rid of economic freedom.
And that's what we're doing.
This difference is shrinking.
You're sure you'll agree.
It's a diversity.
Remember what we've saved poor.
And that's what we're doing.
So we need each other.
There's no other way.
Okay.
How can we achieve?
It's hard.
Inventive thinking.
There's lots on this.
It's definitely wrong, isn't it?
Sistemics, moral, responsible overseas investments.
But what really necessary?
It's a flexible ideology.
More unexpected.
Right?
You felt my ideology model?
What's wrong with you?
You just listen to me?
Why is this dangerous?
And that's why we're talking about economics in this country.
On the left, if you talk about economics, you're always talking about income inequality.
It's important to both.
Today, I'm going to tell you a story about the rescue of people who need help.
It should be helped by the best way to ease poverty while we can use free, and we should be able to cooperate under the best way to ease poverty.
If this diversity, even accept, one of the most American strengths.
So let's think about it.
I need a list of activities.
First of all, I'm going to show you one.
That's not enough.
I'm going to tell you a story.
What can I do now?
Where are we going?
We're all in this room.
I'm blessed to someone who listens.
It's a success, leadership.
You may listen to me.
It's going to happen.
That's the first one.
I want you to be a person who wants to be a person who wants to be.
And that's what we're doing.
If you're using responsibility, it's always about the good news of the free market.
So let's do that.
First, you can get to the next 20 billion rescue.
The second one we've experienced under this country, you can change the competition of ideas based on the competition of condemnations and respect for one another.
Then maybe we're thinking, we're not so big.
Thank you.
I'm a political major in college.
And that's what we're doing.
It's the first week, but it's very slow, but it's very fast.
I'm like to do that.
As a schedule.
I'm going to take it right away.
It's going to happen.
And then I've been writing a 90-page degree.
I knew you'd always use.
It's too big.
That's what I'm doing.
A year's plan.
It's like a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a scraper.
This stairs up.
It's not hard.
But I've happened something wrong.
First month.
I couldn't do anything.
That's why we're here.
And then we went too much time.
It's going to be two months.
One morning, I've only three days until the deadline, but it's only three days to write a choice.
That's what I thought.
Calls came a week.
Tim Arkan?
Yes.
"I've been talking about the paper submitted."
"Oh, yeah."
That's what I said.
I didn't happen.
It's terrible paper.
I just wanted to think of this guy's genius.
It's terrible paper.
I'm in the book.
I'm writing a blog called
I've decided about "preserved."
I always had troubled people around me.
I thought people who don't have to be extended.
I decided to find a certain brain to take the MRI of the stranger.
I've got the result today.
I'd like to see you.
If you don't have a brain expert, you're disappointed.
This is a human brain.
[ Reasonal will-to-man]
My brain.
This is the difference between both.
There's a rational decision in either brain, but in the case of the house brain, there's "Sal" for "I want soon."
How does that work?
Everything is going well.
"You should work a little bit," "Well," and the rational decision, which makes it a rational decision that makes something production.
Then I'm going to check the fridge.
After that, I'm waiting for YouTube gurlers from the video Richard Feinman talking about magnets.
That's a good one.
I can't afford it.
What's going on?
Sal doesn't want to slept.
I'm alive just this moment.
The past memories are not known about the future.
It's not a problem.
If you're a dog, you're just having fun.
For monkeys, humans are over.
It's a good time.
I'm not starting now.
We're in a civilization society.
It's called "Revolutionary Will."
We imagine the future.
I can see it.
We've got long-term planning.
The rational will, all of them.
I'm going to do something for myself.
Sometimes it's fun in the raccook.
Both have a heavy part.
I don't think so.
But it's a great deal.
It's not like that.
In the case of the pre-pistent, this conflict is always the trend that ends in the result.
I call this area.
The dark playground is everywhere.
It's where you're playing.
It's not really fun in the dark playgrounds. It's not fun.
The problem is that the house is going to be a real important place.
It's called "The panic monster."
The panic monsters sleep in most cases, but they're losing their eyes.
It's the only thing that's ever.
I had been talking to you recently.
Of course, I said,
It was a long-term dream.
I've ever had TED talks.
"What's the matter with you?
You know what happened on the future?
I'm not going to do that!
"I'm going to give you an example of what I'm going to do.
That's what I've been doing.
Six months are four months.
I'm going to show you how to do that.
So who's awake, right?
The panic monsters are half-smoil.
Remember the panic monster.
I finally got the rational decision.
It's been a long time since I've been working on a long time.
This is the entire situation.
It's not beautiful. It's finally work.
So let's look at this.
I'm surprised to answer the blog.
And that's what we're doing.
Nurses, bankers, artists, engineers, real graduates.
They were together, "I've got the same thing."
But the weight of the email received in that blog article was contrasted.
It was written with a strong fragile on the effect of their lives.
I thought I saw it.
Why are they so dark?
It's a couple of different things.
It was cut off in my case.
It's a short period.
But there's another type of pre-existing.
It's because it doesn't start up.
There are many things that are not due to work, but there are many things that are closed.
If there's only a panic monster, there's a problem in the situation.
It's not going to happen.
It's not like that long-term prescriptions, such long-term prescriptions, short-term, cut-off, and not even visible.
Long-term, big, unfortunate, regret.
That's why they wrote texting.
It's not a canning.
It's a long-term presumption.
They're not going to make dreams.
I'm not sure if I'm reading that e-mail.
They're all long-distance.
It's not like me, but it may be maintained with a hardness and healthy relationship.
So let's do that.
It's a life calendar.
Each box is a week in 90 years.
There's so many mountains.
We're all gonna look around this calendar.
Everyone should be extended.
We need to be conscious of Sal soon.
This is our job.
If you think the box doesn't seem so much much.
Well, if it's not today,
If possible,
Not far away.
Thank you.
Then I was waiting for life at the church of Texas.
In fact, there was a red cloth covered in a red bowl, shallow on the broken wood chair, or on the left, Organ, and the sanctuary has been put on the back.
Nothing's changed.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about it.
On December 31, 1999, the night of Christ's back night,
That year I'm 12 years old.
And that's what the world's end.
I'm going to make a new one.
I've given you seriously praying about my disbelief.
I thought about it.
I found it during my time.
Anyway, the challenge that was stricted to control all the desires, the devil and the truth.
I believe it's hard to age 12.
It's almost coming.
23:50.
Ten minutes left, the pastor gathered us to meet the time of fate.
Every sect meets in the hall.
The choirs remaining in the buts and their wifes.
We're still in America.
(Laughter) (Applause) The world is the old one who continued to work in the cotton fields of cotton fields who continue to work in the cotton fields who continued to work in the cotton fields.
They're the leading part of me.
They dedicated all this moment in this moment.
She was lying to her back, as my grandmother, and she was convinced.
I thought that if she's holding her hand, you're not going to go to heaven.
I'll shut your eyes open.
The parser's voices are rough.
And that's what happened.
The keyboard rings.
It's a fever church.
I'll hold my grandmother's hand once.
Before the fear of fate,
And then there's an arguing.
It's over.
Clock needle.
It's already too fate.
The Saviors didn't show up, and I saw it.
I'm hurting them.
They were deceivable victims, and I was one of them.
I've been praying. I'm not tempting.
I believed that twice that trial baptism.
Until then, yes.
Peter Jennings celebrate the opening of the new century.
And that's what's happening.
This flash was too stupid.
But I didn't believe it.
And that's what we're doing.
My answer was wrong.
It's a freezing winter, without motion, and it's a new sun.
Until the night I didn't visit the Savior, I'm looking back.
Many people celebrated the moment of 2000, and there would be a person who has been present in the same end as the end of what I duck.
I've stretched your hands.
I'm going to go to Yale University, 18 years old, and I'm going to go to the University of Yale.
But the winter vacation, I'm in the middle of winter vacation, I'm in the state of the house, and I was stuck behind my head, and I realized that it's not saved me.
In 2008, I grew out for salvation.
I'm calling the house quickly.
But even the central finance was broken before my eyes.
I'm going to give up the following hope in Washington, and I'll give you a voice.
But the parliament has been a bit of hope, and "change" became a joke that the state has not been laughing joke.
I've been in the American dream, and I've made it a god of Integrity.
I'm opening up when I'm changing date.
I've decided to face again that night, but you believed to die.
And then I went to the Holy Land.
It's not enough effort.
It's about three friends in the corner where the harshkenbridge winter was still still a night.
I didn't know how to go.
But Jack Kerac's novel I was masturbated.
There were many voices against the opposition, and there were more templified voices.
In the summer of 2013, a trip to the U.S.
I was trained in capitalism.
This idea is a way of changing the appearance of the NPO organization called MBAs Cross America.
How generation of our generation is greedy?
We realized that we've noticed that the waves we realized that we've been working on it.
And when we finally realized,
One of the collapsed traumas, one of the social companies, and they could stand again.
But this journey led me to a new Gospel that I have a new Gospel.
It's about a year ago.
It's called the spirit of the reprogress of the same window and social contribution.
The pulses that they gather there, and their assets were more proud of over $5,000 billion.
If we look at our accomplishments, everything beautiful.
But after that, I was used to go to the Harm District, once in the corner of a farm, sitting on the corner of a farm, sitting on the corner of the farm.
It's about kids.
It's not stolen homeless shelter.
"Hallem Great" to the program of Tony, which has given.
After 20 years, Tony breaks his pension and started that program.
He didn't give him.
He said, "I'm not going to do anything."
And I'll decide that's a stain.
It's just a tear.
Under one roof, a whale replica was running over two days after two days, under a few or 50 blocks, a man ran a surged to prepare one child's meal.
It's not inequality, but it's not a generous to mild against a generous child.
I was just upset.
My story was not even though I had shoes, but I realized that it was for those who have been watching, Harem, Aparatia and New Orleans, and my voice, which was not fairly unknown, and it was a silent voice.
And I remembered that the new century of Peter Jennings have been repeated.
It's ridiculous.
But now I was a false savior, and I believed that the world was ending.
It's a long way from the world.
We don't believe it.
Brena Brown, you're believed about her words.
"The New Yorker." "The Harvard Business Review."
People believe them in the church of TED right now, we don't want to pray.
We're going to solve all the problems.
I believe that the hut can tell you the sanctuary of technology progress.
But believers are afraid of the foundations, too, when you're sustained, human sacrifices that cause the basis, and the human sacrifices that occur.
If something doesn't accept, when you're preventing you.
The Gospel is not my country.
Actually, something's the Gospel.
I'm here for the suspect.
This Gospel is not to believe.
It's a mistake. It's a mistake.
This Gospel suggests that we're in this space in this place.
"Why" is the Gospel.
Where is the need to be abandoned us to abandon us?
I've made a decision about your own activity.
We've been working on this for a long time.
Why did you ask me to ask me abandon the role of the relief?
This Gospel that doubts that when you think it's not hopeless and hope you'll be able to see that.
It's just a simple voice.
Thank you.
Food Crisis
It's news from day.
What does that mean?
It's not that bad.
GMO is the world.
GMO may have problems.
Overcomes, pollution, pollution, poisoning, and low nutrition.
It's going to be a while.
It's very disappointed in environmental debates.
How can we solve our knowledge?
Let's take a look.
You've eaten one apple last week.
How many apples do you think?
Two weeks?
Two months?
11 months - average in apples, parallel to American food store.
I don't think there's a difference in Europe and the world.
Picking out the apple, stored in the refrigerator, and lock it in the storage room.
Why didn't anyone know this?
Why didn't I know?
It's been lost by 90 percent of antioxidants in anxide.
That's just sugar.
Why are we lack of information?
It's because the platform's missing.
I'm going to talk about platforms.
It's on this platform.
But I met people. Self-existing.
How do you express yourself?
There's a platform. It's also possible.
My question was:
It's the world's climate map.
It's a very simple place.
The heart of agriculture in California is now moving into Mexico.
China grows better food in Brazil.
If each country has a suitable climate?
What makes people change?
Can you change your nature?
And that's what's happening.
Welcome to global farm.
Mankind built a giant analog farm.
It's called the hood.
It's a miracle that's being produced by a few percentages.
If...
If you're building digital farms?
It's a digital farm.
If you can reassemble this apple in any way, digitalized as particles, and reassembled in another place?
If...
I'm stimulated the text here.
First of all, Japanese agriculture went to the south of Fukushima, and there's no future.
The children have moved to Sendai and Tokyo, Japan, to import 70 percent food.
Food issues not limited to Japan.
And that's what's happening.
It's not just that.
So let's look at another country.
They don't want to be farmers.
It's not about agriculture.
It's a small farm.
It's going to city.
In India, farmers were not provided by water and electricity.
It's really bad.
Where's the farmers going?
City.
Young people are not local.
So how can we build platforms?
New tractor introduction!
This is Convenine.
I started working on a daily store and DlY.
It started making something weird.
It's like we're dead.
It built one of my most intimate relationships in my life.
I want to grow.
They said, "Oh, my God!
There's only an old electric lab.
What can you do?
And I built a farm with my associates to MlT Media Labs.
It's about six square feet of space.
There's a lot of interesting technology.
What's the most interesting?
Beautiful, white, green vegetables, and monthly harvest.
Is this a new type of cafeteria?
New retail experience?
New food store?
It's the first case of getting out of roots in the media lab.
There's salad in the bag.
But what happens if you think, "Let's try to use your knowledge."
We're going to stay here for the first time in the lab.
My tongue changed, first, I'll try it out.
So I'm eating lettuce every day.
"Oh, it's PH6.1.
This day's lettuce was very sweet.
It's not like death.
It's a very sweet taste.
Technologicalists across phytomology...
I'm going to show you some examples.
I'm interested in what's going to be created.
I've made it.
There's my lab on the front of the media lab.
And that's what we're doing.
It's called "phenomenon."
For example, "I like the Mexican berries like that you're liked to taste."
So, if you create a climate in the program, you can use a recipe for recipes like the plant flavor, nutrients, shape, tooth.
It's a lot of sensors that you need data.
The farmers predicts plants grow.
When plants are dead, they know why they need calcium lack or calcium, humidity.
This wonderful eye is not inherited.
It's a data stored on the cloud.
Following data's time.
And that's what we're doing.
These are the labs of one day.
It's an IP address.
(Laughter) (Applause) If you think it's not enough strange, click here to see the plant profile.
It's a downloadable data about growing plants.
And that's what we're doing.
I'll predict my taste timing.
You're too much water?
Isn't it too sun?
Warnings.
I'm talking to me.
(Laughter) (Applause) I thought it was the first plant book.
It's a plant profile.
And that's what we're doing.
It's a good match.
It's possible that plants can't admit with friends.
This is my lab.
I've been working on a lot of knowledge.
And I'm going to try all experiments under this environment.
This method of cultivation was developed to reduce the water to carry space space for the Mir Space Station.
It's just necessary for plants.
It's not just that.
There's two things.
I have two hearts.
It's perfect.
Mankind has developed a long-term technology and grow in a strict environment.
We've raised various kinds of plants.
This type of tomato was not produced for 150 years.
Do you know mankind have rare and old seed banks?
It's seed storage.
That's great.
And that's what we're doing.
I just ate this tomato in the lab.
The problem is that it doesn't know how tomatoes for sauce.
I've been raised something different.
I don't know if you're human.
And that's what we're doing.
It's been a long time since I've been here.
I thought I couldn't find out what's happening.
This project actually has been a student of my students.
Camille, me and companions in summer.
And then we've got this in high school.
Tell me something to be ridiculous.
I went to school.
One student asks: "What's wrong?"
I answered, "It's about water in air."
He says, "I don't think I'm not water."
I'll give it back.
Don't believe me.
Set it 100%."
He set 100%. What happens?
It's a little bit like this.
He said, "He's about humidity.
Why didn't you say that?
We've created a game-like input screen.
It's a 3-dimensional display.
We're going to do that.
I'm going to give you a recipe.
It's called the recipe.
It's going to change.
"Why do plants need CO2?"
It's called words.
And that's what happens.
If you drop CO2, the plants are very well.
It's a new digital recipe.
It's a process that repeat design, development, and search.
You can download data on new plants, new digital recipes, and changes are effective?
So let's think about it.
We'll learn much.
It's called a food computer.
It's three weeks.
I thought, "I'd be a farmer."
So we opened all data.
It's all online. Let's build a hood computer.
It could be hard, but...
It's just a try.
It's very important to obtain.
I'm getting closer.
They're farmers, electrical engineers, engineers, environmental engineers, computer scientists, economists, urban planners.
It's about your good things.
It's been narrowed in this lab.
This is my new facility.
There's a warehouse like this.
That's why I chose.
I'm making this stuff in the warehouse.
This is already real.
Look.
I already have this.
It's a green vegetables.
One of these plants won by Ebola Research.
This plant produces resistant proteins in Ebola.
It's from medicine, nutrients.
It's not like a lettuce.
It's different.
We're still in the early chaos.
"No, I'm very precious intellectual property.
He can't buy me."
Actually, it's just starting.
It's going to be a better food.
Whenever, the most suspicious food, McDonald's published, says that McDonald's published in the world change.
Let's take a look.
Personal food computers, food servers, food data centers, open-form fenoss.
Unlike the open genome, our recipes have a little bit of climate recipes.
What's the world's going on?
Remember the world's connected by lines?
First, set up the blaster.
It's not about food, but it's about food.
It's not just my fantasy.
And that's what we're doing.
The future food supply doesn't fight.
I know something missing.
The future food supply is a network that connects the following billion farmers, and the platforms allow us to provide problems and solutions.
Thank you.
Sometimes Europeans, I'm very sorry.
Over a year, over over 100,000 of our reactions were honest.
It's really a contradiction.
I've met all the miserable deaths of Mr. Alan Kuldi, two-year-olds, but thereafter 200 children are drowned in the Mediterranean.
In an international agreement, they admit responsible responsible for refugees.
We're mourning the incoming ships, and we're going to be the only devust to Europe.
It's not about labor.
It's against Islam's principle, and they are holding a childhood descending refugees in the family.
Doesn't it think?
Why did you get a humanitarian response to this humanitarian crisis?
I don't think that's because people are indifferent.
I think politicians are missing visions.
So we're going to throw two very fundamental questions.
Why doesn't the current system work?
And how can we fix this?
The modern refugees system was created immediately after World War II.
The purpose of the country is to give people to go to the people who are collapsed or the worst, if the nations are to be bladed.
It was actually prepared for situations in Syria today.
It's an international agreement, a convention of 147 countries, a treaty on refugees in 1951, and the international institutions, and the international institutions.
But today, this system doesn't work.
And that's what's happening.
In reality, our immigration policy is blocked the path to safety.
And that's what we're doing.
It's almost forever in reality.
And that's what we're doing.
In reality, geographical issues, neighboring conflicts, conflicts, and overwhelming many overwhelming.
It's not a system.
It's not going to be a change.
And that's what we're doing.
Let's explain a little.
But it's not the top-down perspective from the system.
First, imagine the Syrian woman.
Let's call Amira.
It's a woman who symbolizes many people in that region.
Amira is a woman who lives in a woman who lives in the house.
Not a return.
But there's no way to re-recognized the Third country, such as lottery, and it's only one percent of the refugees around the world.
That's why I'm here.
There's only three basic options.
First, take your family into refugee camp.
And that's what we're doing.
Refugee camps are in the desert.
In Jordan's Zatari refugees camp, sounds on the border of Syria.
Economic activities have constraints.
It's not good.
And in the world, about 80 percent of the refugees in camps.
That's why Syria, who really chooses this road.
There's a choice to refer to the city.
That's what we chose 75% Syrian refugees.
But there's a big difficult.
Refugees usually have the rights of labor in this city.
I'm not helping.
In this case, Amira and family use it, almost nothing left.
The third choice, the Syrians are growing.
It's a revolution that is found in Europe.
It's a very simple idea.
It's an international refugee.
But I don't think so.
I think there's restorative.
The reason for these options are limited to our heads, because they think it's only possible.
The politicians think that the politicians are taking refugees with refugees.
And that's what we're doing.
There's a way of refugees contribute.
What I mean, when I'm going to make a difference, you're going to have to get profits.
I'm going to talk about four ways to talk about refugees.
It's a way to change our way to view our refugee problems.
The first idea is an environmental maintenance for refugees.
I started investigating the colleagues at Oxford University and Uganda.
I chose Uganda is not an acceptable country.
It's very good.
It's not like other acceptances.
And that's what we're doing.
And that's what's happening.
In the capital, the capital, 21% of refugees have business, and 40 percent of the workers hired the workers.
And that's what's happening.
Even in refugee camp, there was a wonderful example of active individual business.
For example, in the refugee district of Nacavalre,
It's called "A Rwanda refugees."
It's a very powerful process.
When you arrive in the residential, he was almost no sentence.
He's open friends, colleagues, community radio stations, and video-making.
We've got two documentary videos.
We should decide our response to refugees.
It's not like that.
Of course, clothing, cloths, sleeping places, food are important in emergency.
And that's what we're doing.
We have to provide the world economy.
The second is an idea about economic zone.
Unfortunately, everything in the world acceptance is not gaining Uganda.
Most countries do not meet refugees in Uganda.
But there's a useful practical plan.
Last April, I went to Jordan, with my colleagues, with Paul Coryer, who stay with Blastoming, and I'm talking about the International Society and Jordan.
I've been thinking about how to give jobs in Syrians.
There's only 15 minutes from the Zatari refugees camp.
The Jordan government has brought more than $10 million and connect this area to power nets and road networks.
If refugees are working here?
I thought this was good for Jordan.
It's also useful for refugees, but it's also contribute to Syria rebuild Syria after conflict.
I'm going to show you some examples.
King Abdra's stop.
It was announced two weeks ago at the Syrian Support Conference in London.
The third idea I want to suggest you is a matching system that will be done between countries and refugees.
It's a lot of helping refugees and wanting to go.
The concept of matching theory developed by the economist Alvin Ross.
The colleague Will Jones and Alex Tytervoym searched this concept to refugees.
Well, of course, the condition of acceptance should be considered to be considered.
The concept of matching is well used for students, as well as college acceptations, kidneys and patients.
So let's do that.
It's possible for domestic accessible.
I'm going to show you some examples.
So we're going to match the market matching the market.
And the fourth idea is humanitarian visa.
Most tragedy and confusion in Europe are completely avoidable.
It's a fundamental contradictator in Europe, which occurs in the cause of the fundamental contradict, and what is happening in Europe, to become refugees in Europe.
This time, the travel that this time is full of cheap airlines and consul services, but last year, 3,000 people died in Europe,
It's a simple story, refugees, and it is to be awaiting refugees and exhausted to refugees.
Using a smuggler, 1,000 euros across Turkish to Greece.
Bodorm to Frankfurt.
And that's what we're doing.
Many lives have lost, refugee smuggling industries itself.
It's not a rational way.
This idea is actually in.
Brazil has been in the country where more than 2,000 Syrians have obtained a humanitarian visa and arriving and arriving.
All Syrians using this system has won refugee status.
It's a historic pre-e.
Between 1922 and 1942, using Nansen's journeys as international identity certificates, 450,000 Assyrians, Turks, and Chechchens, and refugees in Europe.
Nansen International Refugees Prized for Peace Prize.
And that's what we're talking about.
It's a way to expand the width of refugee's choice.
It's a vision that we need to cut off the new vision.
The idea of refugees become inevitable.
In humanitarian duty, but refugees are technology, talent, and immememeable people.
The world's moving world will not be constant.
It's happening in Europe.
Refugees continue to move without changing places, and we should find how to use the reasonable, realistic, realistic, and philanthropy.
All of you, and all of you, and the politicians want to appeal.
Thank you.
I've been in the sea since when I was kid.
It's a beautiful place to live in color and life.
Imagine a big shark ruled a chain.
I've been dedicated to the photographer from marine biologists, so most of the work dreaming when I dreamt.
I've explored water from quite small times.
But the first time I've been underwater.
I remember that it's still in awesome swim.
And finally, when I looked up, I surrounded the colored fish.
I've been working on the 40 years of art for the National Geographic and Save Our Seas.
I've taken everything, and I've taken everything.
It's a cold Canadian gray bear, Rainfort.
And I'm also here to meet you.
All the earth's people and the seas have influenced.
And I'm going to show you some examples.
They're being threatened.
We've been working on earth's main catchers.
I thought I'd be interested in interest by shocking photos.
I've returned the original.
The most way to cause changes.
I might be a kind of broker, and I'm a photographer.
We can't make it important.
It's not just that.
There's a lot of things that I've been here.
It's been a long time since I've been excited about that.
Every year, June and July, the huge flocks of Iwash will move to the north.
It's a very good reason.
It's because you're jealous.
In general, dolphins hunt multiple and woven from some easing.
It's a fish that's moving to the ocean.
There's a shark behind.
Many believe in Ilca and shark are the hosties.
It's not about dolphin.
Without dolphins, the bait balls have more dispersed.
Well, I'm going to take you to Sadine Run.
But this rough feast, like other fish,
I'm going to go to the Maldives.
It's a very small place of a bunker, which is called Hanifal, and it's a smaller piece of crustace.
If there's a plankton place, and the Oneitima is alone, and I'll turn around it.
But if plankton is focused on a place, they'll make a long chain for feeding.
It's a lot of money.
I'm going to take you to the spiral of his own cave.
I really want to forget.
When I first shot in Hanifal, it was threatened by development.
By working with the NGOs like Manta Trust, my picture was helping Hanifal to sea protection.
The fishermans in the neighborhood was handed.
Now they're more zealous protection than anyone, because of her  Morjib, they're getting more than 8 million incomes every year.
I always came back in the past.
I went to the sea of such times.
It's a long way from the sea traffic and fishing squad.
Most people have heard about the small coral reef of the Mozambique Strait.
It's called the coral reef.
I can't say that this shark is a very coward.
I was a bolder at night.
I'm going to ask you a question.
By taking these moments, remember why I'm moving this way.
This year, I've already done this year at the National Geographic.
It's an important San Ignacio Lagoon.
This coast was killed for a hundred years.
Now, the descendants of whales push their children into the sea.
This kind of life has great resurrected.
Now, on the other side of the Peninsula, there's a quiet fishing town called pumpo.
It was a state of decay.
In 1995, the local fisherman sued to the sea as a marine reserve.
That's what happened later.
In 2005, the number of fish has been recovered unprecedented.
But look at your eyes.
Let's go swimming in the most screaming of the most slight fish.
Everyone can make hope.
I'd rather tell protect our sea through my picture.
I'd like to focus on natural recovery when they were,
My wish is to take pictures like this.
It's a daily event.
I have to be a pleasure.
I always work under assumption, and I think that's what we're going to do.
In 1985, I moved to Harre, in the core of Zimbabwe's medical policy,
In the end of the long, independent war, the new regime will now declare social policy immediately, medical services, first and first education.
It's a great idea.
In 1980, in 1980, the domestic child's inoculation rate was 25%.
And that's what happened.
I really thought I was proud of this major reform.
I've seen people's excitement.
It's a very evident scientist, a doctor, activist, an activist, a politician, a activist, a politician, a shoulder, but also in Africa's independent movement.
But there was a terrible problem.
The first case of Zimbabwe was reported in 1985.
I had some AIDS patients at the Harem General Hospital in early '80s, but I didn't imagine anything about Africa.
It's about 2% of HIV infections.
It's been 17 years after 17 years.
And that's what I'm talking about.
He's been working on it.
I started the colleagues and clinics.
Play condoms.
And that's what's happening.
I'm going to show you an example.
I was working hard.
I'm going to do something.
But it wasn't working for structural reform.
Mr. Kofi Annan, former president of the United Nations,
He was the Secretary of the United Nations PKO.
"I was sure that the most consent that he was trying to do the best of the day, but I realized that it was to be able to help me.
The most popular epidemics has been immigrated with medical science and the expected world health system, 3900 million people would have been acting faster than that.
But I didn't think I've been thinking about it in a political position.
I'm a clinical doctor.
In my heart, my role was to see the patient's trouble and investigate the inhabited pattern of residents.
I realized that the risk is high risk.
60 percent of pregnant women's pregnant women were cheerous.
I've been told that it's not infected, rather rather than men's culture, compulsional labor, colonialism.
White layers were almost damaged.
As a medical worker, we were in painful, as we were in painful.
It was just a lot of infections.
I was silent, but the medicine that can save life doesn't get equally.
I just wrote, "I'm not a resident of this country, and I can even get out of the country."
That's why I'm here.
He didn't claim.
I don't think so.
It's a promise to a doctor and a patient.
I've done anything with myself.
But this was concerned that it was reflected that the distortion of society, but it was not only for biological causes, but it was understood that they were ending with a custom of discrimination.
AIDS's on this.
And that's what happened.
Since they call "structive violence," which is embedded in our society's political, economic structure, and that is often invisible to those who have privileged privileges and power.
If you want to help patients, you don't defeat this social inequality.
It's the first step to make public health.
So, lately, I'm not silent.
I'm talking about many things.
In many cases, there's no longer about human discretions, and in this country.
And that's what happens.
So it's a human discrimination in American medicine, which is currently in progress, a systemic, a colored violent, and a colored violent legacy that remains American painful legacy in the United States, and a half-year-old gym owl system, and 60 years of inequality, and a warning is the center of my Chief Health Department, and my Chief Health Department, and the Chief of Health.
In New York City, black men are 50 percent higher than 50 percent.
In 2012, black women's birth rate was over 10 times white women.
The baby's survival rate has improved dramatically.
It's not special in New York.
Same statistics can be seen anywhere in America.
The recent New York Times analysis says that the total U.S.
According to the article, over one of the six-year-old black male, who's 25 to 54 years old, who died in prison or young.
It's a protest, known as a bad man, but it's a protest that is known as a black man.
But each rate of arise is a disease that continues differently, and the end of heart disease, cancer, diabetes, AIDS, and so on.
#BackLivesMatter's movement began, I remember regret and anger.
I used this word.
Most of the medical students who have been observed without anything in the white garlic as a white garment, and he was informed.
In modern trends towards individual health care, we're going to find a whole image of biology and genetic research, and every day's environment, growing, and love, is that many people's health is the most affected health.
As a medical worker, we're working on a medical staff, and we're looking at a slightly unfair in research, but in the medical staff, there is a more wing of a wing of a doctor.
The doctor's role as a medical worker is not just a patient, but a cholerator for a change.
The doctors have quite heavy to speak.
I regret that I swear to you who didn't make a voice in Zimbabwe, and I'm going to use your attention as the chief of Health.
I'm going to help you with racial discrimination.
Now we're standing up, structural inequality.
I don't need everything to call change.
It's just courage.
Our patients' health, our health.
I'd like to ask you to help me, but who's been able to break friends on Facebook?
Who's there at least one who's avoided?
I'm glad you're talking about the words of "My Fair Lady."
It's been a long time since I've been here.
In the world we live, there's fear of any conversation in the debate, politicians can talk to each other.
I'm going to show you some examples.
We don't have any ears.
And where we live, who are married and I'm going to be friends.
It's not listening again.
We're going to talk about talking about talking about.
It's a technology development.
The cell phones are still in there.
And that's what we're doing.
Maybe most of them are more than talking to her face.
It's called "Atlantic."
It's an interesting article by Paul Burnwell.
He's a student. It's a communication challenge.
I wanted to tell you how to speak specific subjects without notes.
He wrote: "I noticed."
"The ability of conversation is the teacher's teaching."
Students are working on ideas and others.
I think it's strange.
I'm working on a job.
I don't like people.
Personally, I'll tell you a person who doesn't match.
And that's what we're doing.
I'll tell you how to talk in ten minutes.
I've heard a lot of things about the secret of conversation.
Forget everything that's all.
It's useful.
I don't need to learn how to show you.
I'm using professional interviewers.
I'll teach you the technology of interviewing you, but it's useful to talk to conversation.
We all made a wonderful conversation.
I know what you're doing.
It's a conversation that you can feel when you feel.
There's no reason for almost conversation.
Let's take a look together with the basic rules of conversation.
"I don't do that."
Not just do that.
That's what I'm saying.
That's what I'm doing.
Don't think about your boss's mouth.
Don't think about dinner.
If you want to get out of the conversation, please, but half of the participation, please stop.
That's what we're talking.
If you want to claim your opinion, you'll be able to write blogs.
It's because why I'm not leaving my program.
If you're conservative, Obama, hood stamp, hate constants.
I don't like big banks, oil companies, Dick Cheneys.
I'm distinguished.
It's not like that.
There must be a conversation.
The famous therapist, M. Scott Peck says,
It's not just that.
"I feel accepted, but it's not possible to be unreserved."
I'll repeat. Let's go.
Bill Nai, everyone who meets himself knows what I don't know.
I say, "No one's expert."
That's 3's question free answers.'
Let's learn journalists.
When/ Where/ Who's going to start with//Why/Why?
It's a simple answer.
"I'm scared?"
It's the most impressive word in the question.
"Are you angry?" "Oh, I was so angry."
Let's explain it. It's over.
I'll ask you a question.
How'd you feel?
Then he'll stop, and the answer will return.
That's 411 flow.
I'm not going to leave.
I've heard of this interview.
The chairman stopped asking for two minutes.
We're doing exactly the same.
When I sit down with someone, I remember actor's Hugh Jackman in a coffee shop.
And sneaking what you hear.
I can talk and ideas.
Just disappear in the air.
"If you don't know, let's say I don't know."
If you're in a record, you know what I'm going to talk about.
You should be careful.
Don't make it cheap.
"Don't look at your own experience."
It's not about telling you when he died his family.
When you talk about corporate trouble, what doesn't matter?
Your own experience is completely different.
All experiences are individual.
And that's what we're talking about.
I don't need to show how wonderful you're in trouble.
Steven Hawking said that I answered an IQ and answered:
Conversations are not self-addicted.
"How do you do that?"
I'm not going to do it.
Especially in conversation at work, conversation with children, and repeat your words.
Don't do that.
That 8" doesn't matter."
I don't care about your business.
I'm not interested in you.
What's the common thing?
So let's forget the details.
That's the last thing.
Listening.
I don't know how many people told this point is that everyone's most important skills.
It's a word of Buddha.
"There's no fired that he's been fired."
Why don't we ask each other?
I'd rather talk to you.
When you're talking, it's self-guided.
I don't need to ask.
It's focused.
You can strengthen your identity.
But there's another reason.
The normal people speak is 225 for one minute.
Our consciousness bury 275 words.
I'm sure you need effort and energy.
They're just screaming in the same place.
Don't ask each other.
The author Steven Kovey stands for.
"Not a lot of people ask.
I'm asking for answering."
There's one more rule.
"My sister says, "A good conversation is short, but only to cover liver things like a miniskirt."
I was so famous.
When many people came home, she came, "Who are you?"
She became semi-mis America.
He's the mayor Sacramento.
She's a popular winner.
So I've got something hidden.
I'm starting to believe this.
I hope you'll be able to close your mouth and feel.
Please do the same.
It's going to be a sake.
Thank you very much.
Hello.
I'm Matthew Williams. I'm a champion.
I'm going to take a medal for the third sports competition in Canada.
(Laughter) (Applause) (Applause)
And that's what we're doing.
Listen to me and my results?
The world doesn't look at me, and the champions.
I've been working on it since I've been here.
In 1968, the special Olympics began, but many of the intelligent people are invisible for the broad world.
I don't think they're using discrimination terms before my eyes.
It's called "disengaged."
So I didn't think I'm hurt.
Don't think I'm here for you.
I'm here because I'm still in a serious problem.
Did you know this year?
I was an athlete with intellectual disorders, one of them, one of them, one hundreds of people from the country.
More than 6,000 audiences were broadcast by the sports TV station's T.S.N.
I didn't know that.
What do you think?
It's a challenge to you.
It's a special Olympics.
I'm going to give you an example.
It's called Paralyn Pick.
And that's what we're doing.
And that's what's happening.
And then we've changed the world's eyes.
I've been born and intelligent.
I was hockey since you're 12 years old.
I was so hungry.
I've been completely different from sports for a while.
And that's what's happening.
No one thought I couldn't help it.
In the 1960s, Dr. Frank Hayden, Dr. Frank Hayden, was studying the effect of intellectual disorders.
And that's what we're doing.
For people with intellectual disorders, exercise programs, sports competitions.
The people believe not too much, but Dr. Hayden and the founder of the Special Olympics,
(Laughter) (Laughter) Before I participated in the special Olympics, I was worried.
But when we go, everyone encouraged us and support it.
Now I've been in a national convention and a national convention, and this year, I've been in a summer event in the United States.
(Laughter) (Applause) I've heard more than four million athletes worldwide.
We're going to be a special Olympic athlete.
Special Olympics respond to the needs of important health.
According to research, male average life with intellectual disorders is shorter than 13 years.
But you can keep health by participating the body in special Olympics.
And that's what we're doing.
It's a special Olympic Games that provide free health diagnosis.
My team Canada, in the summer of 2015,
On the front of the game, the Nigeria team, seven members of the health diagnosis of the hall, was born and heard clearly.
(Laughter) (Applause) (Applause)
I was playing confidence with a better live and game.
It's because I've heard the sound of the ball, and the sound of whistle and the stand.
The special Olympic athletes are not just during competition.
It's about life.
According to the results of this year, there's no one of the most intellectual disorders.
It's also evidence that the use of discrimination is not invisible for many intellectual dishroids.
They're all using as a slight expression.
The word "sight" is over 9 million times, but it's a word that hurts me and a four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-year-old athletes in the world.
I don't think they're all insult.
My fellow, John Franklin Stevens, who wrote a simple release of the public book.
"I'll try if you're moving."
(Laughter) (Applause) (Applause) (Applause) (Applause)
All of us, my teammate Jackie Barlett, the famous "The Great deer of New Fundland" has raised 277 kg in a squaw.
Jackie is a heavy-weight holder on Newfoundland Island.
In LA, the big star, the ESPN has twitted his new records.
I didn't think that.
This year, the 60,000 audiences buried that the famous LA Memorial Coliseum.
We've been calling us a vocal.
The special Olympics teaches that athletes have confidence and pride.
People in the world tells the intellectual disability to accept respect.
I'm going to show you a couple of examples.
(Laughter) (Applause) I'm not hiding or bullying.
(Applause) Thanks to the special Olympics.
If you look at someone with intellectual disorders, I want you to watch his ability.
I want you to tell me how terrible words.
And I want you to think about special Olympics.
(Applause) (Applause)
Nelson Mandera said, "The sport has power to change the world."
The special Olympics is exactly changing the world.
Thank you.
I'm going to ask you a question.
It's the most rare place for me.
In the hospital, in the ground, nurses, doctors, scientists, quietly, and one of the most terrible human enemies.
The Lasa virus looks good.
It's going to happen.
But they're all protecting us by protecting people in the land community.
But what I've visited before years ago, they started singing every day in the terrible first line.
They gather together, joy.
I'm alive.
We're really fun to make songs singing together for years.
I think it's possible to be very important.
And that's what happened.
It was the first outbreak in West Africa, Sierra Leone and Liberia.
We're afraid.
In fact, for a while, Lassa and Ebola has expanded more infected than thought, and maybe you might reach Kennema.
So my team went along with Dr. Hummar Khan's team, so we've prepared a high-sensitivity virus RNA detection device.
I already used a device like this.
They just provide tools and places to test Ebola.
But unhappy, the day came.
On May 23, 2014, a hospital in the hospital's obstetric ward, and the team went into the hospital's obstetrics in the virus RNA.
Their work was extremely genius.
We've decided to determine this case immediately.
It could be infected.
But until that day, outbreak already followed months.
There's a lot of examples.
When I reached Sierra Leone, it's not another case, but it's like a tsunami.
We've been working with the role of international communities, health and the Kennedy, and the next week, and 92, and 147 cases of patients have been responsible for keema.
We're going to help you 24 hours.
The patient's blood sample was discarded.
Instead, we sent them to another research facility.
I've got my team.
And then we worked on the day and working on the day and working every day, and I've been working on every day.
The virus's zinom is that blue.
It's not just Ginom.
It represents all the properties that we're building.
It's not just that.
After human infections, the infection spreaded through humans and spread out through the infection.
It's very important to solve this.
The virus has been infected with humans.
It's very important to observe this one mutation.
The International Health experts expand this to control and adjust all the results.
At that time, I was working as a scientist, and I first stored data in some months, and some months, carefully, carefully analyzed and analyzed research research.
This is the current of scientists.
But you couldn't do that.
And that's what we needed help.
So the first thing I did was read, after the Genom array was read.
I just sent the data to the world.
And help is here.
I've been interviewing the data in the world.
The world's best-fashioned virus tracking team suddenly become ours.
I started working on virtually.
It's a lot of ways to make community.
And that's what we're doing.
I hope they'd help.
That's why they're here.
Imagine. Imagine it.
"Let's fix this together."
The problem was very limited to the data that we were all used is the Internet.
It's a lot of potentials.
And that's what we're doing.
And in our lab, we've proved that the Ebola patient's presumptions nearly 100%.
I've created an app to provide, but that app is effective.
There were 106 more data ever.
But it wasn't much data.
They've been studying and waiting for each of them.
But this isn't possible.
You don't think so?
Our lives are.
In fact, many lives have lost many medical people, five of my important workmates,
They died in the vicinity of the vicinity of the Great Medical Relationships.
It's the same as the threat to other humanity.
And that's what we're doing.
But it's not like other natural threats.
We're fighting together.
Some may be familiar with Ebollah.
We hope our life will help with joy together with joy.
One of the leading graduate students read the book about Sierra Leone, the name of the city's name, "Kenema," actually said in the words of Sierra Leone, who reads the book about Sierra Leone.
And since we knew it before we know, we always respect the Kennedy people in open environments and sharing information together.
It's important.
It's because they're all hidden information when the outbreaks have happened.
This is not the last, but it's not the last, but it's not the last.
And then when there's an infection?
Air-infected virus.
It's a deliberate virus.
It's a very terrible thing, but what we taught this experience at the same time, we're trying to win, and we're going to win.
But it's possible as long as we're going to combine.
People who died in the battle of infection, Dr. Khan, who lost life on front lines, they were fighting with us.
Let's not semblance the world's destruction of one virus.
Thank you.
