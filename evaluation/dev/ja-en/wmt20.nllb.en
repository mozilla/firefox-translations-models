I look back at Suzuki's career as a talented artist and how he came to top the "hatred of women" rankings in class.
And the background of Suzuki's all-out talk and reaction to the excess was the words of an older performer.
Furthermore, not only did he react to "full body touch" and "full body below net", but he also escalated his extremism.

Driving on high hills is dangerous!
A young man's pedal step was wrong and accidents occurred several times.
violations of the traffic laws of the road.
While there has been a growing body of reports of accidents caused by mismanagement, such as pedal footsteps, it is a big mistake to think that this is only the problem of older drivers.
According to 2015 Police Department data, the highest number of pedestrian-stepping accident incidents per year was 1,080 under the age of 24, which is higher than the 1,032 over the age of 75.
And it is important to draw the same attention to younger people, not to the elderly, who never make mistakes.
And take a footstool?
Take security measures?
Although this data does not describe the ratio of males to females, it also considers the reasons for the errors of the steps, such as the complete lack of attention to music, conversation, and other things, and the mistakes of clothing.
Women in particular choose to drive in a variety of shoes, depending on their heels, pumps, sandals, mules and the clothes of the day.
While some find it difficult to change shoes, knowing that they are not suitable for driving, many are driving with little thought or malice about the potential for danger.
However, driving on high heels and sandals violates the road traffic laws.
One of these is "the safe handling of the handle, brake and other operations" and "the violation of the safety driving obligation" of Article 70, which states that "you must not drive in a manner that would cause harm to the person causing the accident".
And another is that the driver must comply with the requirements set by the Public Safety Committee of the Metropolitan Municipality under Article 71 "Violation of the Public Safety Committee Compliance", for example, the regulations for the implementation of the Road Traffic Act of the Miyazaki Prefecture contain a provision in Article 12 that states that "you shall not drive vehicles except light vehicles, wearing shoes that are suitable for riding, slippers, heels, or other means of obstructing driving operations, or wearing shoes that hinder driving operations".
The same is true for every Metropolitan Municipality, including the High Heel, which does not specify the purpose of considering driving in "shoes that may impede driving".
So why is it so dangerous to drive on high heels?
That's obvious, considering the basics of pedal handling safely.
For safe and reliable pedal operation, first, you must fasten the heel to the bed, place the foot upright against the brake pedal, and tilt the heel to the right as a pedal when stepping on the axle pedal.
At this time, it is important to keep the car firmly fixed so that it does not break, regardless of the vehicle's behavior.
However, on high heels, the area of the foot that is on the ground is small, always crouched with gravel, and the heels are angled at the entire foot at the height of the heels, so that the footprint on the pedal is smaller and less firmly penetrating, making fine adjustment more difficult.
This is thought to lead to danger.
Also, although most cars have floor mats, this material can easily pull the heel of the heels, sometimes the heel is pulled when the brakes are pressed, or the heel is pulled when the heel is pulled, sometimes the heel is pulled off and stuck behind the pedal and can't be stepped on.
In addition, there are instances where the heel pulls back to the back of the pedal when the pedal is pushed back and the axle pedal is not able to return.
Toyota, Svalbard and its subsidiaries to accelerate joint development of new AWD vehicles and 86/BRZ next-generation models.
Toyota Motor and SUBARU (Sbar) have agreed on a new business capital partnership on September 27.
Toyota has acquired additional Subar shares and is a holding company under the applicable law.

Also, in June this year, we agreed to work on developing SUVs and EV platforms that leverage Swara's AWD and Toyota's electrification technology.

 and authorized to increase or decrease the price of benefits at outpatient facilities, the Ministry of Labour confirmed the instructions:
Before the decommissioning of early childhood education and care, which began in October, if a case of perceived increase in the cost of childcare was confirmed at an approved outpatient care facility, the Ministry of Health and Labour would have sent documents to the Metropolitan Municipality and the City of Regent to verify that there were no similar cases nationwide by 28 October and to instruct them as necessary.
According to the Ministry of Labour, there were several confirmed facilities, such as those that raise only the fees for subsidized children over the age of three, or those that will raise prices from October.
There were also complaints about the freezing call center set up by the Cabinet Office.
The Ministry of Labour says that "there should be no unreasonable price hike".

The land industry on the island of Harajuku, near the "Telugu water" production site, is in the process of filing for bankruptcy with a debt of about 2 billion yen.
The slump in the housing market and the increasing damage caused by the earthquake also affected the "detached roof of consumers".
The TDB corporate code: 530173983 (capital of 99,2 million yen, military reserve prefecture: 淡路市大谷881-8), representing福原幸蔵氏, 44 employees, filed for bankruptcy with the Kobe District Court on August 30.
 Applicant representatives are the lawyer of the Giza-Godaja District in Osaka, Osaka, Japan, and one other person.
Our company is a manufacturer of watches, founded in June 1895 and incorporated in April 1961.
He initially started his business as a real estate industry in the area of the island of Teru in the present-day Teru in the western town of Teruang, Teruang County, under the trade name of jaja (株).
In October 86 AD, the merger of the cooperative and industrial companies took over the business of the company, while at the same time, the company moved its headquarters to its current location and changed its name to the current business.
Since then, the company has established its business base in Fujaja, Hiroshima, Daizuke, and Miyagi, and has become the current system, whereas it previously focused on grapefruit, but due to changing consumer needs, it is now producing 70% of the grapefruit, such as flat-watt, and 30% of the grapefruit, such as grapefruit, and water.
It has built a broad business base in the heart of West Japan, including big-hand house makers, building materials companies, roofing operators, and in December 2004 had annual sales of about 316 million yen.
He had a corresponding reputation as the top crafting man on the island.
However, the demand for residential housing has been increasing as the downturn in the housing market since the Lehman shock, and the increased damage caused by the earthquake in East Japan, the Kumbon earthquake, and the further deterioration of the rooftops of consumers have caused the demand to grow, bringing the annual turnover in December 2018 down to about 1.345 billion yen.
In terms of revenue, in addition to the lower interest rates associated with fuel prices rising, the company had to face a continuing deficit and heavy capital spending, with excessive profitable debt associated with inventory burdens and equipment investments.
As a result, although the financial institutions were trying to rebuild their business, such as demanding that the conditions for repayment of loans be relaxed, there was no sign of recovery, and the financing was gradually being forced to close.
Having come here and not been able to support the continuation of the business, this was the measure.
The debt is currently under investigation, but is expected to be about 2 billion yen.

The possibility of a playoff appearance has been lost, and the Cubs' Darvish, who finished the season on the podium, has said in an interview that he has "not done anything for two days, just never watched baseball from the bench without a purpose".
He started 31 games this season, winning six, losing eight, and averaging 3.98 defense, but threw 178 2/3 innings and struck out 229 batters.
Especially in the second half, the pitching form was stable, and the outstanding power and the overwhelming ballplay continued to outmaneuver the opponent.
"Now is definitely a different time in my life than ever before. I never thought I'd feel like this at 33 years old. Spring was like, 'I'm going to end up like this, too,' but I'm going to come back and be in a better position and it's unbelievable that I'm going to be in a better position".
And from early June, I gradually got my hands on it.
"And every day there was more to be done, and every day there was more to be done".
Although there were trials and mistakes, continuing to challenge my own hypotheses has improved my grades and, with it, improved my grades.
"And being thrown off the injured list for a year" also led to confidence.
Darvish, who has the option to cancel after the season, said he "has to think about talking to his agent, his family", but said he "has no complaints about the team and is fun".
And while I have not yet reached a final conclusion, I seem to be feeling a little bit more restrained.

"Beauty and the ugly" is a piece of paper?
The image of "snake" that is repeatedly portrayed by beautiful girls in the work is magnum opus. - Yahoo! News
What do mystical beauty and shadowy expressions have in common?
The '図ずお・美少女コレクション' (玄光社) was launched in August 2019 and focuses on the beautiful girls portrayed by Mr. 図ずお, who has been known to have released a number of works since the 1950s and is the first person to be featured in the "horror manga".
As you take it in your hand and look at it, you will notice a so-called correlation between "beauty" and "horror" in the work you are drawing.
Is it attractive because there is a "shadow"?
5 beautiful girls from the works of art)
The preface to the collection of the "Beautiful Girls" contained a line that said, "The shocking scenes and developments of the horror and ugliness of the story are distinguished by their contrasting beauty", but the beautiful face turned into an expression of hatred that was distorted, resentful, and perhaps more "horrible" because of the contrast.
Although the word "snake" is a keyword in many of the works of art, the way in which snakes are perceived by viewers as "unpleasant creatures" or as "beautiful" is different from the way in which they are perceived by those who feel "beautiful".
Some say the world likes reptiles, others say they are really bad.
In the same way, the senses of the viewer can make "beauty" and "ugliness" appear to be "snake" in the face of a creature.
It is also revered as a spirit creature of greater spiritual power than in the past, and is also associated with the houses where "the white serpent" lived.
Among the works of the illustrator, titled "Snakes", are the "Hypsies" and "Two Girls" from the 1965 series "Mama's Hot!"
Usually, the "white woman" becomes the scene of a beautiful woman with shadows.
In a foolish way, can you say "cool beauty" type...... that feels like the common thread of the beautiful girls in the works?
In any case, the main character of the "Fox" series, which has been serialized in Weekly Young Sunday since 1969, is a beautiful girl character, a symbol of the art of drawing, but it is a "snake" that is associated with a deep sleep every hundred years to maintain eternal life and eternal youth, or parts with miraculous powers.

The "real prisoner" who drones attacked a Saudi oil facility (FRIDAY) - Yahoo! News
"The Iranian-made drone Ababir, which was used in this bombing, has improved its performance dramatically in recent years by analyzing the crashed U.S. military drone.
It is manufactured cheaply and can be used for a range of about 1,000 km.
It's also a powerful tool to fly low in the air, to be caught by radar". (Yokadachi, press cameraman)
On September 14, the oil facility of Saudi Arabia's largest oil company, Saudia Aramco, was bombed by 10 military drones.
Shortly after, the Yemeni opposition group the Houthi Party issued a statement.
"The Houthis are undoubtedly behind Iran, led by President Rouhani.Iran, in a situation where its own country cannot export crude oil, cannot allow the rival Saudi Arabia to stockpile crude oil.The goal is to inform the international community that if Iran continues to impose a ban on crude oil, there will be pain in response". (International Political Analyst, Zhao Rohang)
And in the wake of the bombing, half of all Saudi oil production stopped, and crude oil prices skyrocketed by 15 percent.
Even so, there are rumors that the oil shock will return.
"Whether Trump is promising the withdrawal of U.S. troops from the Middle East, or at least until the end of next year's election, he wants to avoid military intervention in any way. Once that is realized, Iran will continue to bomb the Houthis undercover with drones.
The "proxy war" between the United States and Iran is in a crisis of one-shot.
The reason a super-personal YouTuber became a full-time employee.
And ask the hired president!
9ja/27 (金) 8:47 delivery
YouTuber, now a hugely popular youth-focused YouTube channel, is now a huge hit.
While it is not uncommon for companies to use it to advertise their products, there are companies that have started a rare mechanism called "YouTuber Recruitment" that employs them as full-time employees in their own companies.
The company's direct marketing mix, which focuses on corporate CRM and customer relationship management, is the company's main business.
What does "and hire a YouTuber" really mean?
I interviewed Mr. Sholin Yuuki, who is the Managing Director of DmMiX and, this time, actually the first staff representative of the subsidiary company that YouTuber hired.
I want to support young people who are working hard to hire YoujaTubers.
― ― What is the "YouTuber adoption" in the first place?
小林祐樹: Now, the career of YouTuber has become a dream of many young people.
Junior students are also ranked in the top ranking of careers they want to pursue in the future, and more and more young people will be pursuing them in the future.
So far, our company has been hiring and supporting young people who are pursuing their dreams, such as band members, comedians, and more.
Similarly, "YouTuber adoption" is about hiring and supporting young people who are pursuing their dream of becoming YouTubers.
― YouTuber has an image of an individual posting videos independently, but why did you consider "adopting" him?
While many young people are passionate about the career of YouTuber, there is a reality that most YouTubers are not making the income they thought they would.
There are few creators who work and produce videos and post while working, or their families who refuse to admit to being YouTubers.
In this effort, the hired creators will be paid and provided an environment for content production.
We hope to support the activity by supporting the demerit of the YouTuber profession, which will become unstable at first.

"South Korea wants to return to GOSOMIA". - Yahoo! news
In a separate interview with the Nas経新聞 at the US ambassador's residence in Nagano, Japan, on Jan. 27, Nappara said that "We hope that South Korea will reconsider its decision to cancel and return to it" regarding the military information of Japan, including the protection agreement (GSOMIA) that expires on Nov. 23.
It is unusual for a senior U.S. official to mention a GSOMIA bankruptcy review.
GSOMIA is the basis for the agreements signed by Japan, Japan, and Korea to share missile launch information.
If South Korea breaks the agreement with Japan in August, the notion of its termination would break the framework for protecting military information in South Korea.
Mr. Najafar argues that "without GSOMIA, we cannot effectively respond to the crisis".
"There is still time to cancel", he urged South Korea's return.
中ja露 also demonstrated a "threat recognition for the first time ever" of the joint flight training conducted by the Japanese Sea over the Japanese Sea in July, urging that "the United States of America, which shares values such as democracy and human rights, must continue to work together in alliance relations".
He noted that the deterioration of South Korean relations today "harms the national interests of the United States".
"There is no intention of mediation", he said, adding that "Korea will play a positive role in filling the gap".

After the award ceremony for 'The Best', the German commander and I assert that "I never imagined anything so wonderful. I am very satisfied and proud to have won this award. It was a wonderful few days for me. I was able to win thanks to my players. The most important thing is the team".
Regarding Guardia, Krupp said, "I have great respect for him", and "What can we say about him? He has won many titles. His team's style of play is extraordinary. He is the best manager I have ever faced, and it is an honor to be nominated and to compete with him".
It also mentions the supervisor Pochettino and Tottenham.
"And his last year was incredibly amazing. In many cases, people won't remember him unless he won a title. He built a team little by little and played in a great style".
"It's a reversal against Barcelona. (CL) Many professionals and myself would not have bet a cent on us. (CL) with a 3-0 win against a team with Messi and Sures...It's like a death sentence...We could have taken a small chance and made it happen.... I couldn't believe it. Looking back, you might say we beat CL in this game....
Finally, Cropp, who was asked a more personal question, concludes: "When I congratulated the Bundesliga champions, I woke up on a bench, not even knowing where I was. This time, that never happened. I don't like to get drunk because I'm a person who is plagued by the compulsive notion of self-management.

According to Apple, the new macOS Catalina will also be available in mid-October.
While the exact date is not disclosed, it may be delivered on October 4th.
Can you see the full picture? Can macOS Catalina be released on October 4?
The above image is from the Apple website in Denmark, which has been updated.
The image certainly has the words "From October 4th to October 4th".)
And the official website, the accuracy of the information is also high.
By the way, personally, the feature I'd like to try out the most of macOS Catalina is Sidecar.
This is the feature of iPad as a Mac sub-display, a feature that was previously realized in the third-party app.
And since Sidecar is a pure feature of Apple, it is expected to be superior in completeness and responsiveness.
There are also rumors of a sequel, MacBook Pro, with a 16-inch display, but first, I would like to experience this next generation of macOS on storage.

This year's born Sakraebi, who was successfully shot in the deep sea of the Bay of Pigs, is born in the shore of the shark-infested area of Shikoku City (provided by the "Bisakraebi Project").
The "Project by Biśaklajebi" of the Council of the Marine Industry Cluster of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, including the city of Shimizu, thus succeeded in capturing the Sacklajebi, which is believed to have been born during the spring-summer fertility period this year, at the bottom of the 290-meter water in the Bay of Pigs.
The video of the growth process is valuable, and the researchers want to link it to an ecological explanation of the mystery of the sacraea.
The filming was done near the seabed, about 1.5 kilometers off the coast of the same city's freshwater zone.
In 17 minutes, we confirmed about 300 of them.
This was confirmed by the traditional view that the deep-sea sakrajaebi "form a certain herd at the bottom of the sea".
The adult body was about 40 millimeters long, while the reflected body was about 23 millimeters long.
The water-fried sakrajabi identified a period of ovulation by comparing it with seasonal data.
Detailed analysis is requested from the team's foxtoon software technologies and shitoku industrial engineering school.
Project leader Hiroja野恵介 says she "wants to capture a vivid picture of the individual's growth process, including the baby".

The first half of the Bad Five-Wheel Race is a step forward for world champion Tereshida Shengyu, who has completed a successful race!
<ja male singles> BADXSPI!
The Japanese team, which won six medals at the Big Badminton event in August, the 25th World Championships in Basel, Switzerland, will compete in the Chinese Open (Constantinople/Super1000) starting on 17 September, after completing their reinforced residency in early September.
Here, we look back at the first half of the race, which began in May and ran from August to the start of the next year's Tokyo Five, and look forward to the men's singles for the mid-table race.
The Badminton Five-Around Race, which began in May, eliminated the top four events in which the top players would compete at the end of the World Championships.
The only ones who kept up the good run in the first half were the two Taiwanese wrestlers (Teng Tzu Chen) and Tenshi Tenshi Tenshi, who won two of the four tournaments.
桃田 won the World Championship, where he scored the highest points of the "World Ranking Point" that directly linked to the Indonesian OP ((S1000) and the five-wheel race.
桃田 also makes Japan OP (S750).
The tournament, which has been contested since May, is the fourth edition of the Siddimans Cup (May/China) competition, Indonesia (July/results) 16 strong (July) Japan (July) World Championships (August).
And while the number is small compared to other top players, the schedule is a reduction in the burden on the body.
Just because it was only the first World Championship in August, there would be no greater fatigue than during the war.
The top conference will be looking for a good result in a series of mid-season games since September.
Taiwanese ace who is strong in the war.
Pay attention to the young Thai men!
Similarly, the winner of the top-level Indonesia OP and TaiOP ((S500) competitions on Sunday, Qingja, has already competed in seven competitions.
He also competed in the local Taipei OP ((S300) in September and won the event with a landslide victory.
He is originally a physically strong, non-aggressive athlete.
As long as the assembly continues, there is no major problem with the game's performance.
Rather, having scored high points in the first half of the game would have made it easier to adjust the schedule of future games.
Although the team had the impression that it lacked explosive power until last year, this year's improvement in the level of stability allowed them to continue to perform well.
For the world's No. 1 cherry, it will be more difficult than ever to compete.
Apart from these two players, the first half of the match was played between Thai youth Ace Cantaphone and Indian Cy Pranice B.
And three players from Anders Antonesen who are already fighting alone as a European force.
Although Cantajafon did not advance to the final in the top competition, they are still trying to win the top spot, including the best four in the second competition this season.
Although there is still a rough side to it, a 20-year-old who can now ride on top of the top players (aged 21 on the 18th) is said to have great potential to make a leap in the five-wheeler race.
Also, Sai Pranijah B. has taken a step forward in India with a good number of singles players.
Samir Balama, Pranoy H.S., and the injured backward Srikans Kidambhi will not only keep up, but also the Indian movement after the mid-war.
The new mobile phone prices are lowered in fair competition: Hokkaido News
A new mobile phone company's fare plan has been introduced, which will be implemented with the amendment of the Telecommunications Operations Act in October.
But, for the most part, it has become a high-stakes one.
Despite the growing expectations of a price cut, despite the fact that the head of the Housing Authority, Mr. Zhao Wei, said last summer that "there is room for a 40% drop", there was no price competition.
The intrinsic entry of the company was delayed and the monopoly of the big three companies continued to be a major factor.
It is desirable that fair competition and a user-friendly pricing system are provided for consumers.
I would like to call on all mobile companies to make an effort.
The law amends the law to prohibit the discounting of the set of telecommunications and telecommunications services.
Because instead of selling the end-generation cheaply, the communications charge was set to be cut higher.
Softbank and KDDI have announced plans to increase the maximum and half price of their phones.
But since both companies will not be able to connect for 100 days, SIM Lock will be able to access the terminal.
NTTjaDkomomo will only use up to one third of its end-generation to its own wireless subscribers.
All three companies appear to be continuing a "surge" to prevent them from switching to other companies.
The Prime Minister's Office has stated that it is required to immediately remove SIMja Lock.
And the corporate side needs to respond quickly.
The extension of the sky was due to the fact that the maintenance of communications networks such as the base station did not go as planned.
It's a shoulder-length outfit that was only expected to be a competitive trigger for the price drop.
Was there any sweetness in the sight of the world?
The exact start date and fee for the full service has not been disclosed.
As a company with social and infrastructure, I want you to do business responsibly.
This rate change was prompted by the statement of the Director of the Office of the Registrar.
Mr. ja expressed dissatisfaction with the new tariffs of the three companies, saying that "I think the competition will start from now on. I have no intention of staying that way".
But I don't think "official price cuts" will distort the market or promote healthy competition.
Businesses and businesses should be competitive with customers before they are outrun by the government.
The pricing system of each company is very complex, so it is not easy to compare.
While the device is advertising "the maximum half price" and there are cases where the consumer burden exceeds half the price, the Consumer Agency has drawn attention.
Both the company and the company themselves must strive to provide a polite and easy-to-understand explanation so as not to create misunderstandings among users.
The withdrawal limit was reduced to 500,000 yen for cash cards of 3 credit institutions in the three provinces.
Three credit bonds in the Three Treasures of Three Treasures (Sansum Triple Credit Bank, North Izuo Bank, North North North Bank, and North Korea) announced that they have decided to reduce the cash card limit to avoid special fraud.
For depositors over the age of 70, who have a triple-name, a North-East-East-East-East, a North-East-East-East-East-East-East-East, and hold cash cards from credit bonds in various countries, and have not made any more than a certain amount of cash transactions with ATMs in the past three years, the maximum amount of cash withdrawal per day with a cash card is 500,000 yen.
The Triple Credit Bank of Sanja and the North Izu Satsuno Credit Bank of Sanja will be repaid on October 1.
In the province, there are a number of special cases of ATM fraud involving fraud involving cash card and security numbers, including financial institutions and police, and credit card bankers say they "want to protect your valuable deposits as much as possible".
The transfer to the back room of the family was a sudden death.
Japan Japan Sumoja Association announced on 27th that it had approved the transfer of three male gymnasts from the Yōkonjō-Tororō-shi-sillo room, one male bed-shan, to the back room of the Yōkonjō-shi-sillo room following the death of their father.
The back room is the same as the basement room.
The Master's brother, Rōōō Oja, was from the Shiloh Chamber and was considered the brother of the Shiloh family.
When the family passed away on the 16th, the dragons were temporarily a preview of the same mirrored room, and further treatment was being discussed.
In the back room of the landing, 12 male moles are present, as of the autumn spot, with ten moles from Mongolia, as well as the dragons.
The overseas wave of "insulting and degrading play" has drawn on the "face-to-face risk tactics" of American players. - Yahoo! News
The USFL-Kyle, a former England representative for rugby, "can't call it a tackle".
The World Cup was held in Japan on 26th, and was the last time the United States, which made 20 appearances, lost 7-45 to England.
Black Star has been advancing, but the late NFL's John Quill-starring roughplay is calling for a wave.
He was forced to withdraw in a way that would add a shoulder towel to his opponent's face.
The actual scenes have been released on video by overseas media, and the former England international has been accused of "insulting and degrading play" and "not something to call a tackle".
ja video "Offensive and despicable play" and overseas ripples!
In the immediate aftermath of the withdrawal, the riots that swept the players of both armies... the actual moment of the "facial hazard tactic" played by U.S. Representative Quill.
And the passionate struggle has crossed a line.
It's the 29th minute of the second half, 0-38 and 29 seconds behind.
The deeply antagonistic and English-born general Farrell was somewhat out of balance as he caught his side pass.
The first time I went to tackle was Quill.
He just woke up his upper body, not from the waist down, and hit his upper half hard.
The result is that the head and the other's head come into contact, in the form of a head-pumping.
Farrell was severely hit and fell.
An Englishman protested against a player's attempt to push a quill for a game that was clearly unjustified.
Athletes from both armies gathered together, and the air became instantaneous.
As a result, Quill was able to return to the field with a red card.
The bat left the pitch with a bad face, but some of the audience asking for fair play also asked for a bowing.
Rugby's stronghold in New Zealand's local media "staff" is featured with the headline "Rugby World Cup 2019: U.S. players withdrawing with a low play, England win fast".
"Kill, who had made a disgraceful shoulder charge on England's star player Pharrell's face, was dismissed", reports "almost a brawl by players from both armies".
The article also features comments by former England international and commentator Ugo Monea.
"It's insulting, mean, it's not a trick, it's a mean game".
The United States, who were one man short of a game, narrowly missed out on a knockout loss in the 81st minute of the home-and-away tie.
But since Quill's play left a bad taste behind.
On September 26, the Ministry of Health and Labour published for the first time the names of the 424 hospitals judged to be "poor in clinical performance" among 1,455 public hospitals and public hospitals across the country, such as Sun Red.
In 福井 Prefecture, the Ministry of Labour and Social Work reviewed the treatment performance of 14 public hospitals in ▽あわら city, the national hospital organization ▽坂井 city hospital ▽三国病院 ▽越前市織田病院 ▽高浜市若狭高浜病院 - four facilities were targeted.
The four hospitals reorganized are "not up to par".
To curb the growing health care costs of aging, and to promote the reorganization and integration of hospitals in competing regions, we have taken exceptional action.
In October, the hospital was asked to review the restructuring and integration in detail and to draw a conclusion by September of the following year.
If there is no enforcement, the fear of missing nearby hospitals will lead to a reaction from local chiefs and residents.
It was announced at the same meeting.
The targeted hospitals accounted for 29.1% of the total, with relatively few beds.
Other than the prefectures of Dudao, the percentage was higher in the order of: 新
The number of targets was 54 on the Hokkaido Highway, the highest, and Okinawa was the only zero.
The Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, based on data from 2017, surveyed 1,455 hospitals in public and private hospitals that could accommodate "highly acute periods" for patients with severe conditions and "acute periods" for general surgery.
Analyzing clinical performance in nine areas, including cancer and emergency care, and whether competing hospitals are "less than 20 minutes away by car", the researchers determined the need to publish hospital names.
The hospitals to be considered may consider discontinuing or moving some clinics to other hospitals.
Healthcare costs will increase sharply in the next 25 years, when the entire generation of the block is over the age of 75.
For this reason, the Ministry of Labour and Employment has set a target of reducing the number of hospital beds with 1246,000 beds across the country to 1191,000 beds.
Today, while nurses are well-equipped and have a high number of "high-rehabilitation" and "acute-care" beds, the high-need rehab for the elderly is inadequate.
To meet the aging process, we need to not only reduce the number of beds, but also increase the number of beds for rehabilitation.
In the field of hospital reorganization and integration, the Metropolitan Municipality has developed a "regional health plan" that sets out the number of beds needed in 25 years.
Although the country is divided into 339 regions and is being discussed by local authorities and healthcare professionals, many local residents and chiefs have maintained a cautious stance, and the debate is difficult to navigate.
The Ministry of Labour and Employment is trying to stimulate the debate by publishing the names of hospitals that are not doing well.

A look at the climate demonstration in Vancouver.
The march was held from Vancouver City Hall across Cambridgeshire to the downtown library.
People with signs began to gather in front of the town hall where the meeting was taking place hours before the start, so many people that at 1 p.m. the start time they filled the road a few blocks from the town hall.
Since then, the number of participants has continued to grow, eventually reaching more than 100,000.
And along the way, the police also enforced road regulations, cooperating and guarding for several hours until everyone was finished walking.

The swine and cholera vaccine is recommended in regions9 prefecture, farming and water provinces (WEB - Yahoo! news
The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Aquatic Affairs on 27th published a draft of the Epidemic Guidelines, which would allow for the prevention of vaccination against currently unauthorized farmed pigs, to prevent the spread of the animal diseases known as "pig cholera".
The policy will select the target area, nine provinces, including the province of Aichi, where the infection in pigs and wild boars has been confirmed.
The movement of vaccinated live pigs and fertilized eggs is restricted within the territory, but allows the movement of refined meat and processed products outside the territory.
We aim to complete the procedure in October as soon as possible, by public comment to the general public and by public comment.
By allowing the use of vaccines and the extra-territorial circulation of pork, such as pork, it could affect pork exports rather than the "clean country" recognized by international organizations.
Since the beginning of September last year, Japan's status as a clean country has been temporarily suspended.
In the proposed amendment, the Ministry of Agriculture and Water, based on expert opinion, set up "recommended vaccination areas" for areas with a high risk of infection from wild boar and pigs.
The respective Metropolitan Municipality will create a "vaccination program" that will cover the scope, duration, number of vaccinations, and procedures, and will receive approval from the same province and allow it to be used by the governor.
The other seven provinces listed as recommended for vaccination are 玉, Fu山, Shiikawa, Fugai, Nagano, Triple, Shiga.
When guidelines are revised, the region will review the situation and make a decision.
The movement of vaccinated pigs, semen, fertilized eggs, corpses, waste materials, etc. is in principle restricted within the territory.
For the sake of refined meat and processed products, the flow restrictions are not subject to the costs or impact on farmers, but are actually allowed to flow outside the territory.
And to prevent the spread of the virus, we thoroughly process food waste.
It also advocates for the safety of vaccinated pigs and works to prevent damage to reputation.
The draft amendments to the guidelines were drafted and approved by the Epidemic Control Office at a meeting of experts held on the same day.
In the future, the city will continue to monitor and comment publicly on the prefecture until October 7, and will implement new guidelines for the prevention of the epidemic.
There is no public approach to the ManU, which is not owned by Honda.
"Please make an offer. No money needed". (Football Channel) - Yahoo! News

Withdrawing from the Australian Aja League's Melbourne Victory last season, MF Benda Guyuyu, a former Japanese player who is now without a club, has taken an amazing turn.
视频本田圭亚佑, was he actually in the game?
And the truth of heaven will be revealed.
Benada, who updated his Twitter account late on Sunday, July 27, Japan time, has taken a public approach to a club, saying, "Please offer.
The one who sent the "and counter offer" was Manchester United, the world famous team.
Why did Honda make a grand request to the Premier League's strongest club?
The motivation is in an article in the Australian edition of FOX Sports, published on the 24th.
In an article titled "The 5 FWs Manchester United are likely to catch in the crisis of injury continuation", five non-affiliated players were picked up.
Among the players, such as Hatem Ben Alpha, Giuseppe Rossi, Wilfred Bonny, were also Ben's names.
Currently, United are still recovering from injuries including MF Paul Pogba, DFLuke Show, DFERIC BILLY, FW Anthony Marshall, FW Marcus Rushford and are in a state of emergency.
The Red Devils, led by manager Ole Gunner-Sulshar, are facing a challenge to their front-line quality, having to slide through two wins, 22 losses and a rough slide in the league.
So it was Honda that was named by the Haohsiung media as a new combatant candidate for the Tecoja Patch.
The article analyzes that "Bonda's contract as a player on the creative side, not a striker, can fill the hole that Andreas Pereira is filling".
While 18 games and 9 points at the Melbourne Victory were "a solid record", it was also pointed out that "33-year-old Honda needs to move away from his hobby of managing the Cambodian national team, to get full attention".
Is the approach of Honda really working?
It is also worth noting that United will move forward for the veterans who will be making an outspoken statement about the goal of next year's Tokyo Olympics.
500 portable translation machines have been installed, and the facilities for the free transfer of information to the shops, offices and shops are available.
A portable translation machine called "PocketTalk" is being loaned free of charge to 500 shops in the city of 浜松, among others.
The HCMG announced on 26th that it had completed the installation of 500 translators in stores in HCMG, among others, in a project to loan free portable translation machines "PocketTalk" to member businesses.
It is noted that the concentration of the same translation machine in the same region will lead to an increase in the responsiveness of the first-in-the-nation, inbound travellers.
The loans and the previous versions contained 236 restaurants, 113 retail stores, 17 accommodation facilities, and 134 others.
The city centre is 60% of the city.
The map app "Google Maps" also began showing the location of "foreign language stores" on smartphones.
It can be accessed from the website of the tourist area of Lake Hamana, among others.
The free loan of 74 languages, which is available in all languages, was launched in April as part of a project by nine local organizations that received the proclamation "Hama松, Japan's best inbound support city".
The same chamber will buy 500 units, provide a two-year loan to a small and medium-sized business that meets the requirements of hospitality certification, cashless settlement, and so on.
A spokesman for the same chamber said that "it is important to attract new foreign customers in a difficult business environment".
Now the straight-up celebrity, Ickura-Rimesh, doesn't want to take a look at the tip?
Today's Mr. Caddy is the best shot.
A 1W ja shot is not necessarily a tipping shot.
There is also the technique of hitting the ball on the ground when you want to gain distance with the second punch of japar5, such as the so-called "diredra".
The latest 1W is also a large head volume and risks scattering the ball, but there are players who practice this frequently on the field.
It is池村寛世 who is awaiting the first victory of the tour.
The 24-year-old, who is 76cm tall and slightly smaller, is currently seventh in the Driving Distance category.
While the long shot was a must, one of the challenges was fairwaywood accuracy.
"Spoon 3W shot was bad at the beginning of spring, so I thought we'd try straight drawing".
From the practice round, the ball is placed on the grass of the Tiarea with pottery and the ball is also used to swing 1W.
While the big carrier is often used for a large number of tips, both sides make good use of the straight draw on narrow holes.
"It can be used in a hallway where the eyeballs are pointing downwards".
The ballistic meter recorded 270yd280yd on a carriage.
"So you don't need 3W, and Caddy can be more comfortable with a straight-line than 3W".
From the June "Japan Tour Championship", Wood only had 1W in the carriage bag.
The second longest club is the University of Utah at 17 degrees above sea level.
The tactics, which are also amazed by fellow tourists, are the joy of the enthusiasm that leaks from the gallery they have seen.
Kojaz is "to move the club to level [level]"
"I don't fly straight, whether down blow or up blow, but I go right as a cutter. I used to do a straight-drum swing correction for the 1W shot at tip-off.
Although the ball is not caught, there is a risk of slicing, "so the left side can be removed (not curved to the left) ".
I'm not going to tell Kanthan, but I'm not going to say it's a professional skill.
The first icefall in the world is on the ground. - Yahoo! News
The first ice observed this year at the ケ pool of the 乗岳畳平原=27am, Dan生川町,高山市 (the office of the 乗スカイライン管理 provided)
For the first time this season, 27 days of ice was observed in a pond at ケ (ケ), located in the ケ (ケ) in the North Alps (高山市, Dan生川町, Gifu Prefecture, at an altitude of 2702 meters).
Four days later than last year, one day earlier than the average of the past decade.

Greta Tunberli asks why adults mock and threaten children on Twitter.
Swedish environmental activist Greta Tunbury, who spoke at the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York on September 23, was speaking.
While the speech is being watched, there are rumors that insult Ms. Greta.
Greta Tunbery tweeted, "Why do adults laugh at and threaten children?"
The television station, which was quoted by a political commentator as saying on an American television show that Greta was "mentally ill; being exploited by her parents and the international left", apologized.
In Japan, too, there are many online publications about Gretaja that criticize parts of her speech that are not in the content of her remarks, such as "she is used and cute".
Meanwhile, Greta posted on her Twitter account on September 26th, "Why do adults spend time mocking and threatening teenagers and children?"
"And he comes up with as many lies and conspiracy theories as he can think of".
And Greta started posting, "Look, it's starting again. As you can see, people who hate me are always active. They chase me around for my looks, my clothes, my attitude, and where I'm different from people. They come up with as many lies and conspiracy theories as they can think of".
And, noting that adults seem to be making the point of the conversation because they don't want to deal with the climate or environmental crisis, he continued.
I honestly don't understand why adults spend time mocking and threatening teenagers and children.
And at that time, we can do another good thing.
I think they feel threatened by us.
But don't waste your time paying attention to them anymore.
The world is beginning to wake up.
And change is coming.
Whether or not adults like the change, they don't like it.
See you on the street on Friday!
On Friday, the 20th of last week, strikes on climate change were held around the world, including in New York City.
And Greta was calling for it to be done on Friday the 27th.

The 432nd Broadcasting Council of Akita Television (CCTV) was opened, and on August 16th, the "Editor's Specialist in Cooking! recommended by a celebrity! really delicious Akita curry" was broadcast.
The same program introduced each of the items to the curry stores, the points of professional taste in the family, the secret of the birth of the small talk curry.
The committee commented that "the concept and theme is simple and clear", "they were seen as interesting until the very end, and the tempo was present, and the curves were also present", "they were able to see things from a different perspective than the grocery site", and "the drama was long and the reenactment was long", and "they needed one-point advice from a professional curry writer".

A wedge shot of Galicia.
I thought I could go at that pace in the second half because I was able to stretch the first half, but I was disappointed that the pattern didn't work out well.
- and saw the winner in Eagle 6 and Burdy 7?
Even after hitting a bogie on the 4th, there was still a par 5, so if I was doing it with a sense of return, the Chip-In-Eagle on the 6th came to me.
Although Burdy was able to get a chance in the seventh, I regretted not being able to extend in the second half.
- And what did you get at this conference?
Recently, the shooting was not as good, so it was good that the fairway was able to keep a tight track.
Rajah was also a different course, with different rounds and different distances, so I studied quite a bit, as I had little experience.
- And what's the difference between the regular assembly and the regular assembly?
It was possible to take a camera (and a smartphone) at some point.
I didn't care at all, but the gallery was pretty much video-making.
Not much changed except that, as the tournament was co-hosted with few Japanese players, I came to the game feeling "I can't beat foreign players".
Since the second half is about to begin, I would like to add another win if I don't win more than one, but I don't want to be the one to aim for the gold medal, and as soon as there is a ZOZO championship, I will try to get to the top of the conference and qualify for the competition.
And how can you prevent dementia from developing and keep it to a "forgetfulness" level?
取材・文/渡辺陽(わたなべ・よう) is a Japanese language language written by the Japanese.
Dementia drugs are thwarting the research and development efforts of major pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals.
However, the relationship between dementia and lifestyle is being explored, and it has been discovered that it is possible to keep it to a very mild, forgetful level.
I recently heard a conversation from Professor Junozui, the Stroke Center at the University Hospital.
And the dementia is not going away.
― ― since the prevention of dementia, or the treatment of dementia, is awaited, what is the status quo? ―
From mild to severe, no matter the degree of age, anyone can develop dementia as they age.
However, it is believed that it will take more than 20 years to develop a new drug for dementia.
Even the drug, Donepezil, which is widely used in Japan, is already out of the insurance market in some foreign countries and cannot be expected to have a significant cure.
On the other hand, with fewer deaths from infections and accidents, and fewer cancer deaths as a result of the rapid advances in cancer treatments, people have been able to live longer.
This is why there is a growing number of people with dementia.
We need to create an environment in which people can live in peace and security in the region, not just for themselves or their families, but for society as a whole.
How to stay in the "forgetfulness" level.

Although it is inevitable that dementia will develop, it is possible to reduce symptoms as much as possible and keep them to a "forgetfulness" level.
Dementia is considered a lifestyle disorder and tends to be more prone to it.
First, metabolists are more likely to develop dementia.
Dementia is considered a lifestyle disorder.
It is a combination of obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol.
It will affect the economy and power in any way.
For example, in the United States, there are areas where food stamps are distributed to the poor, but food stamps are preserved frozen hamburgers, pizza, and chicken.
And those who live in an environment where gas or electricity are not available can use it, and those who live in an environment where cooking is not possible in the first place.
This leads to a diet that is low in vegetables and protein, and a lifestyle that is based on fat and sugar.
Eventually, you'll be poor but obese, and you'll have to watch TV and be physically uncomfortable.
And a similar situation may be in Japan.
People who don't think and work are more likely to develop dementia.
That is, to prevent dementia, we need to read books every day and think about things without being a metaphor.
