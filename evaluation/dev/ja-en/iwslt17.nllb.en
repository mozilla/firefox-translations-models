This is the story of how we gain knowledge.
The main character of the story is this woman, Natalia Lipchinsky.
He is an ancient biologist specializing in excavating ancient remains.
Natalia Lipchinsky: People used to call me "Dr. Corpses".
Rajatif Nasser: I found it particularly interesting because the excavation site is in the remote tundra region of Canada, far north of the Arctic Circle.
One summer in 2006, she was at the site of an excavation called the Filezleafbed.
Natalya: You may find it boring, because you just walk around for a day carrying a suitcase and a GPS and a notebook and picking up something like fossils.
RajaTif: At one point, she noticed something.
Natalia: It was an old red-and-white hand-drawn carpet.
It was falling to the ground.
Rajavi: At first I thought it was just a piece of wood because the file-shelf bed often found fragments of ancient plants.
But when I returned to camp that night,
Natalia: I took out the loop and looked a little closer, and there was no ring.
And it may be because of the preservation status, which is the more you see.
And it was bone.
RajaTif: She visited the site more than four times over the next four years and eventually collected 30 fragments of the same bone, most of them very small.
Natalya: Not many enough to fit in a small vinyl bag.
Rajativ: I tried to combine the fragments like a puzzle.
It was a really hard work.
Natalya: I tried to use sand and paddy, but it didn't work.
So I ended up using a 3D scanner.
Rajatif: It's amazing!
RajaTev: It is much easier to work on the screen than on the screen.
Natalya: When I put it all together, I was a little moved.
Rajatif: How confident were you that the assembly was right?
Is it possible that a different assembly method would be different, or was it actually ink?
Natalya: No, I'm sure you will.
Rajatif: What she discovered was a bone of the leg, and also a pair of cattle and sheep.
But this bone was not necessarily that of a cow or sheep.
And it was too big.
Natalya: It was a very large animal.
Rajativ: What kind of animal was it?
She showed a piece of bone to a colleague in Colorado who was then unmasked.
Natalya: When we cut our eyes at the end of the bone, it smelled characteristically.
Rajatif: smelling like roasted meat.
The smell was the same as that which Natalia smelled when she cut off her skull in a disgusting anatomy room: collagen.
Collagen plays a key role in maintaining the structure of bone.
As the years pass, it is usually explained, but
In this case, the Arctic climate has been preserved as a natural refrigerant.
When Natalia attended the Society in Bristol a year or two later, a fellow scholar named Mike Buckley was demonstrating a new method of processing called "collagen assay".
Each animal has a slightly different collagen structure, and if we know the characteristics of unknown bone collagen, we can compare it to those of already known animals, and perhaps identify it.
So we sent a piece of bone to the man in the mail.
Natalya: It was important, so I wanted to keep track.
Rajativ: He processed the bone fragments and compared them to 37 modern mammal species.
I found a suitable animal.
What a gift Natalya had for the owner of the 3.5 million-year-old bones he unearthed in the Arctic at high latitudes!
And it was a camel.
Natalya: "Oh, yeah?" I thought, if it is true, then it is wonderful.
RajaTev: I examined many bone fragments, but all of them were the same.
However, given the size of the bone found, this camel was about three percent larger than the current one.
He was about 2.7m tall and weighed about a ton.
Yes, it is.
What Natalia discovered was a "giant Arctic camel".
When you hear of camels, you think of the East Central Asian cockroach.
The picture in my head is probably a picture of this human cobras. Speaking of desert creatures, this is what they do: they live in high-temperature deserts like the Middle East and the Sahara Desert, and in a large bowl of water in their backs they store water for their long journey through the desert, and they step on the sand dunes with their wide feet.
Why did such animals reach the Arctic in northern Canada?
In fact, scientists already knew something before Natalya was discovered, in fact, the camel's native land is the United States.
I was born here.
It has been about 45 million years since the camel appeared, but during almost 40 million of those years there were about 20 or more species distributed in North America alone, perhaps more than that.
RajaTev: When you put it all together, can you tell the difference?
Natalya: Yes, the body size varies.
There were also very long types of neck, which were probably similar to the neck of a kilin.
Rajativ: Some had a squirrel-like face.
Natalya: The earliest primitive camels were very small, about the size of a rabbit.
Rajatif: Yes, a camel the size of a rabbit?
Natalya: an early variety.
You won't even know it by looking at it.
Rajatif: It's like having a rabbit and a camel.
Natalya: Yes, it must be the best.
Radhavi: Then, three to seven million years ago, a herd of camels descended into South America to become the Lama or Alpaca, another species crossing the Bering Land Bridge to Asia and Africa.
By the end of the last ice age, the North American camel had become extinct.
What has already been discovered so far, however, is not entirely explainable by the discovery of such a northern location.
For example, the climate is the opposite of the Sahara Desert.
Indeed, 3.5 million years ago, the average temperature was 22 degrees Celsius higher than today.
That is why the pine forests spread out and may have resembled the current Yukon River basin or Siberia.
Still, the winter continued for six months, and the pool must have frozen.
And there are also brilliards.
There may have been times when the darkness of night lasted 24 hours.
Let's take the whole of the whole.
How did this superstar of the Sahara survive the Arctic climate?
Natalyaja and her colleagues believe they have found the answer.
And that's a wonderful answer.
What if the camel characteristics we thought were adapted to a place like the Sahara desert actually evolved to survive the winter?
What if the wide legs were not for walking on sand, but for walking on snow like a snowman?
What if the strawberries were to help you survive the winter months of six months without food?
What if you were to cross the land bridge and use the wintering features of the high-temperature desert environment for a while?
For example, a shrimp may be useful even in hot climates because if you store all body fat in one place like a lump, you won't have to cover the body with fat that plays the role of a heat exchanger.
This will make it easier to escape the heat.
What this incredible idea had been considered to be a symbolic evidence of desert adaptation may in fact be evidence that once lived in the high latitudes of the Arctic.
I'm not the first to make this conversation.
Others have, through this talk, spoken of the wonders of evolutionary biology and provided clues to the future of climate change.
But there's another reason I like this story.
For me, this is my own story, my own worldview and how it changes.
I have already been educated as a historian.
And I realized that scientists are also mostly historians.
They too try to understand the past.
It tells the story of the universe, the planets and the life on Earth.
And as a historian, you start by thinking about the story's development.
Natalya: We create stories and stick to them, for example, the story of the desert camel.
And a very well-crafted story. The camel is perfectly adapted.
Because I've been in the desert all along.
RajaTif: But one day, a small amount of evidence may be found.
Understanding the little things may help you to reconcile everything you believed in.
In this case, too, the science has reached a completely new and far-reaching hypothesis that surpasses common sense as to why this animal appears in Dr. Seuss's picture book, inspired by a tree-like fossil discovered by a scientist.
My thinking about camels has changed a lot.
From the perspective of a very special animal that can only adapt to a particular environment, the desert, to the perspective of an animal that happens to be in the Sahara desert, but can actually be found anywhere, and is in fact a world apart.
(ja applause) This is Azzurri.
Ahja Azali, hello to you.
ほら お食べて come on now
Azouja is usually in the Radio City Music Hall, but he is usually in the Radio City Music Hall.
And this is not a joke.
Now, this Azouja is living proof that the story of our world is dynamic.
We must rearrange and reimagine the story.
Isn't that right?
And on the other side of the bone, there is a new way of looking at the world.
Thank you very much.
Modern computers are so good that we don't even notice how cool they are.
Today I want to talk about this problem and how to "fix" it in neuroscience.
The night of the fall of the Harem in 2011 was a night that shocked me deeply.
I was studying computer science and neuroscience at a bar outside Columbia University when I was having a meaningful conversation with a fellow student about the power of the hologram that would one day replace computers.
When our conversation reached a climax, yes, his cell phone lit up.
He took out his cell phone and started typing.
And when he looked me in the eye, he said, "I'm still listening".
But of course his vision became blurred, and the meaning of the time was lost.
Then, across the bar, another student had a phone and held it up to a group of friends.
They were showing me pictures of Instagram swiping and they were laughing.
I started thinking about how they feel happy when I'm unhappy with the same technology.
As I thought about it, I realized that the "bad guy" was not the digital information itself, but simply a display device that separated me from my friends and connected them.
They were already bound around something, like a fireplace, like ancestors who told stories and developed social awareness.
It should be an extension of physical function.
But in today's computer world, the opposite is happening.
When you email your wife, write a symphony, or comfort a friend, she is behaving exactly the same way.
He bends and manipulates the continuously appearing icons and menu buttons, represented in such a rectangular manner.
I think this is wrong, and I think we can start using more "natural machines".
We should use machines that can take this work back to the real world.
Applying the principles of neuroscience should be used to limit perception rather than to expand it.
Well, here I have brought such a machine.
This is the "Meta 2" and it's a "Meta 2"
Let's try it out.
Now I can see you all before my eyes and I can see my own hands.
So let's get into the 3-2,1 hologram experience of the unobtrusive type, a very real hologram floating before my eyes - before the headset I'm wearing right now.
Of course, what you see can be a shopping item or a learning tool, and you can use your hands to control it and move it with precision.
Ironman would be proud of it too.
I'll show you this again soon.
(Applause) If you're thinking like me, you're probably excited about the possibility of what technology like this can do.
My mother is an architect, so naturally, I came up with the idea of drawing a building design in 3D space instead of a 2D drawing.
Mom is now touching the footage and choosing the interior.
All of this was shot using a GoPro camera and through the headgear.
The following is a very personal use case of the Glass Brain project, led by the late Adam Gassari, a professor at the University of California, San Francisco.
As a student of neuroscience, I have always dreamed of learning and learning using machines that can touch and manipulate this diverse and complex brain structure.
What we are seeing now is augmented reality, but this is part of a much more important concept - that of expanding rather than limiting physical ability with digital machines.
Well, then...
I believe that in the next few years, mankind will experience a turning point.
All digital information is beginning to be expressed in the real world.
Just imagine for a moment that this is the narrator of the story, the painter, the brain surgeon, the interior designer, and - what does this mean for us here?
What we should do as a social community is to imagine how we can create a new reality that expands the human experience and not just game reality or waste digital information.
I am very passionate about this project.
Now let me tell you a little secret.
In about five years, this is no small device, but in about five years, all of these will be like thin glasses projecting a hologram.
While we don't care much about the hardware itself when we choose a smartphone, we focus on basic software, but as a neuroscientist, I've always dreamed of making, if I may say, "mind-sustaining iOS".
Doing this properly is extremely important because we may have to spend at least as much time with the Windows screen interface and such a system.
I don't know about you guys, but it's cool to live in Windouz.
To derive the most intuitive interface out of all possibilities, we have made neuroscience the core of design rather than letting designers argue in the boardroom.
And the principle that is at the center of this is called "minimum resistance nerve pathway".
It constantly connects the "mind iOS" to the human brain - the first time the human brain controls that iOS.
In other words, we are trying to build a computer that does not need to learn how to use it.
The user is creating a system that naturally knows how to use it.
I'll introduce three main guidelines for the newest user experience design that we've used.
Most importantly, the "user of the OS" is the person who uses it.
Because traditional file systems are complex, abstract, and even use the head to understand them.
It is the opposite of the "minimum resistance nerve pathway".
But in augmented reality, if you place the TED panel of the hologram here and put the hologram email on the other side of the machine, the space memory capacity can adapt to this and extend its hand to extract information.
I can represent anything in a hologram, from the Tesla I want to buy to what the legal team asked me to do before I went on stage.
Okay, so this is how your brain learned how to extract information.
And the second guideline of the interface is "look, touch".
And if a baby sees something that is of interest to him, what will he do first?
And you try to reach out and touch it.
"And natural machines" should work like this.
The visual system receives basic stimulation from the innate sense of receptivity, which occurs deep within the body.
So, by directly touching the work, not only can we control it better, but we can understand it more deeply.
That is why we "see, touch, touch".
But this alone is not enough to be an experience.
Humans are primates, social creatures born into the world.
From there, a third guide, or ja, - a hologram version of the example of the first fire of the fire - is derived.
The mirror neuron subsystem of the primate primates shows that if they can see each other's faces and hands in three dimensions, they can work together and work together better.
Watch the video behind the camera where two Meta users are dealing with the same hologram without being distracted by the device, interacting with each other and connecting through this object.
Let's try this again with neuroscience in mind.
Our favorite is the iOS of the heart.
Let's go a step further and take this headset and place it in this place next to the desk.
Now that I am with you, in this moment, we are connected.
My spatial memory works and when I grab the headset and restore it, I realize I'm the OS.
And my innate sense of receptivity is working, and I break this headset into thousands of pieces - touching a sensor that scans my hand.
But it's not enough to see this for yourself, so now co-founder Ray will soon be making a 3D phone call - Ray?
How is Rae doing?
Gentlemen, I can see him in 3D before my eyes.
It has a realistic, photo-inspired flavor.
(and applause) Thank you very much.
My Mirror Neural System suggests that this will soon replace mobile phones.
How is Raja Ray?
Okay, so we're in a live conversation right now.
(Applause) Ray showed you the brain of the hologram in the video that we saw earlier.
Gentlemen, this will not only change the phone, but also the way we work together.
Thank you very much.
Raja Ray thank you very much.
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure.
(ja applause) This is the message I found in that bar in 2011: The future of computers is not trapped in a flat screen.
It's right here in us.
(Applause) If we picked out just one idea today and left it with you, the "natural machine" is not a future creation, but is already here in 2016.
So all 100 employees at Metaja - management, management, designers, engineers - will be releasing a monitor screen by TED 2017 and using a truly "natural machine".
Thank you very much.
(and applause) Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
(J.J. Anderson) I'd like to ask you - although there have been several expansive reality demonstrations over the past few years.
The debate over whether or not technicians are actually seeing real things on the big screen has also occasionally arisen among technicians.
There have been comments regarding the viewpoint, which point out that the demo will show a wider view than what is visible when wearing the actual headset.
Is the video that I showed you real?
Of course, it is a homony.
Not only that, but when making the video you've introduced, I've worked especially hard to shoot it through the lens of a GoPro camera.
Because I wanted to give you a real experience of what you see through the headgear, and to make it seem like it's a real experience.
And thank you for introducing me.
Thank you very much.
My hometown is Seattle, Washington, the freest, most tolerant, and most progressive place in the United States.
I grew up in a wonderful Seattle family of children.
My mother is an artist and my father is a university professor and I am very grateful for the environment in which I grew up because I have always been able to make my own decisions, without any distraction.
I didn't actually follow the path my parents had imagined.
It doesn't matter if you drop out of college at age 19 or drop out of school.
And as a professional horn player, I began touring around the world, a dream I had always dreamed of.
While performing chamber music, he toured the United States and Europe for several years with the outstanding jazz guitarist Charlie Bird.
And in his late twenties, he was even a member of the Barcelona Symphony Orchestra in Spain.
What a wonderful life it must have been.
My parents never complained.
He has always been there for me.
But it wasn't their ideal.
He said he would tell his neighbors and friends, "My son is in the middle of a gap year, maybe 10 years".
But, since there was only one time I had a clumsy conversation about my lifestyle, let me tell you about it.
I was 27 years old, on my way home from Barcelona for the Christmas holidays, cooking in the kitchen with my mother and me.
My mother was mute, and not too mute.
I thought something was wrong.
"What are you thinking, Mom?" he asked.
"We're very worried about you", she said.
"What do you mean?" I thought, "What else is there to talk about?"
"And you're not going to answer me honestly, are you, you're not voting for the Republican Party?"
Well, in fact, I was just a horn player who wasn't so interested in politics.
The parents, who were a little bit confused by the fact that they had some insight, were a little confused.
I was a staunch supporter of capitalism and I'll tell you how I became one.
It comes from something that has always interested me, perhaps surprisingly, but "poverty".
I remember as a child growing up in Seattle seeing for the first time what is called real poverty.
My family was from a lower middle class family, but it certainly wasn't real poverty.
It was a long way off.
The first time I saw poverty and poverty was in the early 1970s when I was six or seven years old.
It was a normal experience, as you all have experienced.
A photo from National Geographic, a child about my age in East Africa, with a flea-like face and an enlarged belly.
It was obvious that he could no longer help, but there was nothing he could do for me.
Some of you may remember that photo, but not the same photo, but something similar.
This is a photograph that made Western countries aware of the continuing poverty that is plaguing the world.
I never forgot growing up, going to school, dropping out, going back to school, and having a family.
I wondered what happened to the boy.
What happened to people like her around the world?
I started to research, and I was not at university at the time, but I was looking for answers.
And worse or better or better, what happened?
And then I found the answer and my life changed.
Well, most Americans believe that poverty has worsened as compared to when they were children, as depicted in that photo.
If you ask Americans whether the world's poverty has worsened or improved, 70% will say that hunger has worsened since the early 1970s.
Let us teach the truth.
This is the enlightenment that changed my worldview.
Between 1970 and today, the proportion of the world's population living in starvation - those living on less than a dollar a day - has decreased by 80 percent.
The world's worst poverty rate has dropped by 80% compared to when I was a child.
I didn't even know that.
Gentlemen, this is a miracle.
It is a matter of joy and joy.
Combating poverty and poverty is the greatest achievement in human history, and that's what happened in our generation.
(Applause) When I learned of this, I wondered what made this possible.
You can't reproduce it if you don't know why it's done.
If we want to repeat this and get another two billion people out of poverty, that's the main theme. Our two billion brothers and sisters, the "little ones" in the Bible, have been lifted out of poverty since I was a child.
And they want to know how to save another 2 billion people.
So I started looking for answers.
The answer was not political, and I was glad I could.
I'm still not interested in it.
I wanted the best answer from mainstream economists, regardless of right-left-middle-class.
Let me give you the answer.
There are five key success factors.
The world and our two billion brothers and sisters have been lifted out of poverty to date.
The first is globalization.
The second is free trade.
Third, the right to property.
The fourth is rule of law.
The fifth and final step is entrepreneurship.
Since the 1970s, free enterprise has become possible worldwide through the institutionalisation of free enterprise.
It's just that I'm not that simple either.
I understand that free enterprise is not perfect, and that to build a better world, we need more than free enterprise.
But it's amazing, too.
It is a question that goes beyond politics and politics.
What I learned, what I understood, and what I did was a lot of fun.
For capitalism is not limited to the accumulation of wealth.
The best part about capitalism is that there is a will, and many people on this stage are talking about a will, a will that comes from a will, and is closely linked to the free enterprise system.
This spirit must be further spread.
Now, let's talk about the second enlightenment here, which is related to the first enlightenment, and which will bring progress not only in the world but also in this present street.
Of all the words I've ever heard, the one that best fits the idea of poverty alleviation that I just mentioned is this: "No system has ever created riches in human history like the free market.
Because he has saved billions of people from poverty".
Whose words would it be?
Do you think it sounds like Milton Friedman or Ronald Reagan?
No, I'm not.
This is President Barack Obama.
Why do you say that so easily?
Because it was directed directly to him.
You'd be surprised to hear that.
What came out of my mouth was "Banzai!"
And besides, I thought, 'What a wonderful opportunity this is.'
Do you know what I was thinking?
In May 2015, an event on this topic was held at Georgetown University.
I thought this was the solution to the biggest problem facing America.
Under the idea that free markets will solve poverty, whether liberal or conservative, we can reach out to those who need us most.
You may already be aware that the crisis in America and around the world is due to the polarization of politics.
We are now in a state of crisis.
It's an unpleasant situation, and we shouldn't do this.
Already last year, a paper was published in the Journal of the American Academy of Sciences, the most prestigious scientific journal published in the West.
A 2014 paper on the topic was "Apartheid of political motives".
This is, in fact, something that, according to the psychologist's definition, is to determine that one's own ideology is born of love, while the enemy's worldview is born of hatred.
Worldwide conflicts are often the result of conflict.
For example, the phenomenon seen between Palestinians and Israelis.
What the authors of this paper have discovered is that in today's America, Republicans and Democrats alike, most people are caught up in the idea of "political motivation asymmetry".
Today, in the United States, most political enthusiasts believe that their actions are motivated by love and that their opponent is motivated by hatred.
Try to think about it.
Most people think, "My ideology is to help people based on very basic tolerance, but the rest are villains trying to get me".
And as long as there is this kind of asymmetry, we cannot move forward as a society.
It is impossible to do so.
So what is the solution?
Let's be honest first, the difference is obvious.
It's not that simple to underestimate the differences.
There are many excellent studies on this subject.
Veteran speaker and friend Jonathan Hyte is a veteran.
He is a professor of psychology at New York University.
I have studied the differences in ideologies, values and morals of different people.
According to him, for example, conservatives and liberals have quite different views on what matters.
For example, according to Haight, those within the liberal group who are concerned about poverty are 59% more likely than those who value economic freedom.
Among conservatives, those who value economic freedom are 28% more likely to focus on poverty than those who focus on poverty.
This gap doesn't seem to be narrowing, does it?
That it will never be compatible?
This is already diversity, and here is where our strength lies.
And do you remember anything that saved the poor?
And the obsession with poverty spread around the world through the medium of the free economy.
That is, we need each other if we are to save the next two billion people from poverty and help people.
There is no other way.
Well, here we go.
How can this be achieved?
It's hard, right?
And we need innovative thinking.
There are many on this stage.
Yes, social entrepreneurship is definitely the best.
Sustainable and ethical, moral, and responsible overseas investment is needed.
Exactly, but what is really needed?
It is a new world with a flexible ideology.
More than that, we need to be more precise.
ja, right?
Have you ever felt like your ideology has become fashionable?
What is it that you are doing?
Or do you think you're just listening to people who share your views?
Why is this dangerous?
Because when we talk about the economy in this country, conservatives on the right are talking about taxes, regulation, big government.
When it comes to the economy, there are liberals on the left, and it's always about income inequality.
Both are important, but they are really important to me and to you.
This would be a hindrance if today we were talking about the relief of those who are suffering from hunger and need help from poverty.
We should use the highest standards of tools and cooperate under the best possible poverty alleviation approach available to us, which will only be possible if conservatives recognize each other's need for a liberal people and their poverty problem, while liberals recognize that conservatives and their free market need to be committed to each other.
If we accept this diversity, it will become one of America's strengths.
How can we achieve this together?
I need a list of activities and activities not only for you but for myself.
Please remember that it is not enough to accept people with different opinions.
But that's not enough.
It should be remembered that we need people who disagree with us because there are people who are still waiting for these tools that our diversity can provide.
So what should we do, and how should we communicate it?
Where do you want to start?
And we are all in this room, and we are blessed.
And we are blessed with those who listen.
He is also blessed with success and leadership.
Even if I talk about an unforeseen ideology, he may listen.
And progress may begin there.
That's the first one, and that's the second one.
I want you to be me, and I want to be someone who can change boundaries into something blurry.
Conservatives, who always talk about poverty, and conservatives, who always talk about the moral obligation to fight for the poor.
If liberal, then liberal, who always talks about the good of free markets if we use them responsibly to solve our problems.
And then, two things will happen.
First, we can start rescuing the next two billion people and work on the solutions we have seen many times in the past.
Second, we can turn the terrible and sacred ideological struggle we are experiencing in this country into a competition of ideas based on solidarity and mutual respect.
And then, perhaps, perhaps, we will realize that the big difference we think is not so big after all.
Thank you very much.
I was a political major at university, so I had to write a lot of reports.
If a typical student were to write a report, the workload would be distributed in this way.
This is the ja slow at first, but the first week is well advanced and the second half is well maintained, even if the load is slightly higher.
I would like to do the same thing myself.
And as scheduled, as planned.
I'm going to get into it right away, but when I actually do the reporting, this is what happens to me.
This happens every time.
Then I started writing a 90-page dissertation that should have taken a year to write.
I knew that the usual approach would not be commonplace.
And it's too large in scale.
So I decided to make a plan and do it this way.
It's a one-year plan.
The initial step is slightly up the middle and then a little higher, and then a little higher, and then a little lower, and then a little lower.
The only thing that matters is the way up the stairs.
And it won't be difficult.
But then something strange happened.
The first few months of the year were very difficult.
I was too busy to come, but there was nothing I could do.
Therefore, the plan will be changed as follows:
Then, after the middle of the period has passed, and I cannot write, I am in this state.
Two more months will become one month, and that will be two more weeks.
One morning, when I woke up, there were only three days until the deadline, and I still hadn't written a word, and I had no choice but to write a 90-page paper in 72 hours, and then spend two nights straight overnight, but the human body couldn't do that, so I ran across the campus with all my might, and the time slowed down and I put it to the deadline.
I thought it was over, but I was over.
A week later, I got a call from the university.
"Is that Mr. Tim Urban?"
"Yes, yes, yes" is the answer.
"And I want to talk about the proposed paper".
"Yes, I did".
And the answer was, "I've never seen such a wonderful graduation".
Hell, nothing happened to that.
It was a really cool paper.
I just wanted to give everyone a moment to think, "Isn't this a genius?"
It's a really cool paper.
I am now a freelance writer.
She writes a blog called "Wait But Why".
About two years ago, I decided to write about "prolonging".
My behavior always confused people around me, so what was going on in the foreigner's head and why were we like this?
I wanted to explain to people who were not the progenitors of the world that there must be a difference between the progenitors' brains and those of people who were not.
To verify that, I decided to find and compare a place where my brain and the non-prolonger could be used to take MRI of a person's brain.
Today I bring you the results here.
I want you to see if you can tell the difference.
And the difference is hard to understand unless you're a brain expert, but well, anyway, take a look at it.
This is the brain of a person who is no longer a foreclosor.
[and rational decision makers] against this.
It's my brain.
[and immediately want a reward] That's the difference between the two.
Both brains have "rational determinants", but in the case of the prognostic brain, there is also a "immediate reward-seeking monkey".
And what does that have to do with procrastination?
Everything is fine until this happens.
"And better get some work done". "Yeah". A rational decision maker makes a rational decision to do something productive, but the monkey doesn't like it, so he cuts his head and says, "Yes, I read a Wikipedia article about the case of Nancy Kellgan and Tonya Harding because I remembered that it happened.
Then I have to go through the fridge and see if anything has changed in the last 10 minutes.
Then, there's the YouTube spiral that's waiting for Richard Feynman to watch from a video talking about magnets to a much later interview with Justin Bieber's mom.
So let's split up, I'm sorry, but today is a busy day.
You can't afford to get a job".
What's going on, then?
The monkey is not the one you want to catch.
I live in the present moment and the present moment.
There is no memory of the past, no knowledge of the future, and only two things that are fun and enjoyable to care about.
If it's the animal world, that's fine.
If you are a dog, spending time doing nothing but fun and fun is the most successful way to live.
For the monkey, humans are just another species of animal.
It may still be good to live primitive life when you just eat a lot, sleep a lot, and have the next generation.
It's not like we're living a primitive life now.
We live in an advanced civilized society, but monkeys don't know what it is.
That's why there is another "rational determinant" in the brain, which gives it abilities that other animals don't.
We can imagine the future.
We can see the big game.
And long-term plans can be made.
And rational decision makers take all the factors into account.
Now I'm trying to get him to do what he should do.
It is sometimes reasonable to do something fun with the jalak, such as dinner, sleep, or leisure.
Both have heavy parts.
And sometimes there is disagreement.
But as a general judgment, it is sometimes reasonable to do things that are difficult and not very pleasant.
And that's when the conflict arises.
For the procrastinators, this conflict always tends to end in a certain result, and they spend a lot of time on the orange-shaped portion of the page, which is absurdly fun and fun to do.
I call this area "the playground of darkness".
The dark playground is a place that all the procrastinators know well.
It's a place to play when you're playing and when you're not.
The fun in a dark playground is not really fun, it's not supposed to be, it's full of fun and a sense of procrastination of familiarity like guilt, fear, anxiety, self-loathing.
The question is, in a situation where a monkey is taking a ponytail, how can the proliferator move the blue zone to a place where something really important happens, but the comfort is less.
In fact, the house of the foreigner has a guardian angel who keeps watch over me at all times, even when it is the worst time, and it is also known as the "panic monster".
[ja] Panic monsters are often asleep, but suddenly wake up when a terrible end, such as a deadline, or a career crisis, is approaching.
And the important thing is that it's the only thing a monkey fears.
Most recently I was in charge of that: six months ago, TEDsters contacted me and asked me if I could give a TED talk.
"Of course I will", I answered.
It's been a long-held dream to be able to say, "I've already done a TED talk".
[and I've been to a TED talk] In the midst of this excitement, the rational decision maker is concerned about something else.
"And you know what you've accepted?
Do you know what will happen in the future?
You have to get your back on it right now!"
The monkey replied, "I agree, but if you open Google Earth and expand the lower end of India to 60m above the ground, scroll for two and a half hours and get to the top, you might get a better picture of India".
And so I did all day long.
From 6 months to 4 months, 2 months to 1 month, TED has released a list of speakers.
When I opened the page, I looked back at my face.
So who would have woken up?
The panic monster became half-crazy and soon the whole system went into chaos.
Remember that the monkey is afraid of the panic monster and runs off onto the tree.
Now that the rational decision maker was finally able to take the lead, I was busy preparing for a lecture.
The panic monster could also explain the procrastinator's abnormal behavior, and for two weeks, a miraculously strong work ethic would be awakened to the fact that he would not write a single line of the report's outline, and would be up all night writing eight pages.
This is the overall situation of the three characters and the system of the house of the forecaster.
It's not pretty, but it works in the end.
This is what I decided to write about in my blog two years ago.
When I wrote it, I was surprised by the reaction to the blog.
Literally thousands of emails were received from all over the world, from a wide variety of people.
Nurses, bankers, painters, engineers, and a lot of college students.
Everyone wrote in the same way, "I have the same problem".
But the lightness of the blog post and the weight of the emails received were in contrast.
And it was written with a strong resentment for the impact of the extension on their lives, such as what they are suffering from the monkey.
I looked at it and thought, how does the extension house system work?
Why are they in such a dark state?
What we have learned is that there are two types of delaying.
In the example I mentioned earlier, there was a deadline.
If there is a deadline, the effects of the delay will be limited to a short period of time, and the Panic Monster will appear.
But there is another kind of extension that has no deadline.
For individual and entrepreneurial jobs like entrepreneurship or artists, there is no deadline at the beginning because nothing happens until you go out and do something, get on the track and run.
Besides work, there are many things that are important, and there are many things that don't have a deadline, such as visiting family, exercising, staying healthy, building relationships, or breaking up a bad relationship.
The problem is that the mechanism for the deferred prosecutor to do such difficult things was only a panic monster, because without a deadline, a panic monster cannot appear.
There is nothing awakening, and the effects of procrastination will be unlimited and will continue to be procrastinated forever.
Such long-term delays are rarely spoken of in terms of the ridiculously short-term deadline delays, usually with a quiet, individual annoyance.
And long-term and major misfortunes and regrets.
I thought that was why they wrote the email and why they were in such a terrible situation.
It's not like we're stuck in a project.
And prolonged prolongation of a long-term delay makes you feel like you're watching your own life.
Their annoyance is not that they cannot achieve their dreams, but that they cannot even begin to pursue their dreams.
One thing that inspired me to read such emails was that there is no such thing as a non-prolonger.
Everyone is a foreigner.
Even if they are not as mesmerizing as I am, they may be maintaining a healthy relationship with deadlines, but be careful that the monkey's problem is most disgusting when there is no deadline.
And one last thing I want to show you.
"And the Calendar of Life".
Each box is for each week in a 90-year life span.
Not that there are so many, as we already use quite a few.
I think we should all take a closer look at this calendar.
Because everyone must be putting off something, what they really are putting off, and what they are putting off.
You need to be aware that the monkey wants a reward immediately.
This is a job for all of us.
And given that there are not so many boxes, this work should start today.
Well, even if not today.
If possible, it is possible to do so.
And before we are far away.
Thank you very much.
At that time I was in a church in Texas, a church that was soul and body-solid, and I was waiting in fear for the last moment of my life.
In a place like this, a chair of broken wood, covered in red linen, sat flat on the left side of the organ, and was followed by a choir, and a baptismal vessel was placed behind it.
Nothing has changed at all.
There is a high degree of tension, a fervent desire for salvation, sweaty palms, and those who seem too uninterested to sit back.
On the night of Christ's return, December 31, 1999, I believed that the world would end.
That year I was just 12 years old, the age that is officially recognized as the one person in the Bible.
Yet I was complained that the world would end unfairly, but it was no longer a holiday, and I had to rethink my future.
And change your mind and walk to church as much as possible.
I prayed so earnestly that I forgot the passage of time, that God would look upon my disbelief, that his coming would not be delayed beyond the time planned, and that it was almost certain that I would die.
I also read and read books that were popular at the time and were like, 'Please save me.'
I found in a passage in the Bible that if a person lacks faith, even more tragedy awaits him.
However, the challenge I was given was to control all desires, defeat the devil and inertia, and overcome my own unbelief.
Let's believe that it can be difficult to be 12 years old.
The time is finally approaching.
It's now 11:50pm.
The pastor gathered us before the altar to meet the hour with a profound prayer when the clock's needle pointed to the hour of destiny.
People of all faiths and religions come together to meet.
The choir of the sacred church is sitting on the stools, and the deacons and their wives - the bourgeois church members, so to speak - stand in the front row of the altar.
As you know, in the United States, even at the return of Christ, VIP seats are reserved.
(Applause) Right behind that VIP are elderly people who continued to work in the cotton fields in the sunshine of East Texas, and I think of their younger days on their backs, their skin without Shiva burned by the sun and sun, as if the earth were their own, and they had such dreams as if they would have walked another life.
They are the ones who are the main characters for me.
They devoted their whole lives to this moment, and it was worth living through a talk show that started at 4 a.m. every day, as the medieval forerunners waited for the coming of the end.
Like my grandmother, she also went to the front of the altar, and I followed her behind the back, convinced that she would go to heaven.
He wondered if if holding her hand during prayer would help him get to heaven.
And holding hands, closing my eyes, listening, praying.
And the pastor's voice was loud.
The prayer in response to it becomes a cry and echoes in the church.
And the melody of the keyboard increases in momentum.
The accompanying zeal envelops the church.
And I'm going to hold Grandma's hand again so she won't be left behind.
And before the horror of fate, he fled into the darkness behind the shadows.
And then the voice comes down, "Amen".
And it's over now.
The clock's clock is a clockwise direction.
The moment of destiny has already passed.
The Savior did not appear, and I looked, and I saw that those who were too deep to fail to see disappointment with their eyes closed, and could not even see the new possibilities.
I was so moved by their appearance.
They were already deceived, they are victims of deceit, and I was one of them.
I have prayed continually, and have not wavered in my efforts to resist temptation.
I was the one who experienced the baptism of the test twice, not once, but twice.
Until then, of course, it was.
When he came home and turned on the TV, Peter Jennings celebrated the opening of the new century, and the news was being spread around the world.
A strange thought then floated through the brain: Will God come down again and again, caring about the time difference?
This flash was too ridiculous and cruel.
But still, I didn't stop believing.
And you have a new belief that the answer is not the same.
My answer was wrong, but the problem was that the belief in the absurdity was wrong.
The snow-capped waters of the possibility that a new ray of sun would be shining on the frozen, unmoving winter mountain of "and faith" began to flow into an unseen landscape.
I still remember going back to that night when the Savior did not visit me, and in a moment I realized that what I believed had collapsed, even if it wasn't a lie, and that it wasn't true.
Many of those who celebrated the year 2000 in a completely different way may say that they are here at the end of a similar course as I followed afterwards, starting the opening of the new century, when my mother did not go out and communicate with my father, and even God rejected me that day.
I have stretched out my hand to grab something believable right now.
I thought at the time that 18 years old to attend Yale University was a great opportunity to confront the shattered dreams and hopes of the people I saw in Oak Cliff, Texas, and to confront all those dark pasts.
But one day during winter break, I was lying on my bed, my hands tied tightly behind my back, and a thief pointed a gun at my head, and I finally realized that education was not going to save me.
In 2008, I reached out for a second rescue, a company called Lehman Brothers.
I'm going to call home in a hurry, hoping to make money.
But even the financial center of the city was roaring and collapsing before my eyes.
And without giving up, I will reach out to the next hope as a youth staff member in Washington, D.C. The voice heard from Illinois shouts out, "The time has come".
But when Congress collapsed, the nation was rather hopeless and "change" became a ridiculous joke, and politics came back, but nothing happened, no salvation.
I swore an oath of allegiance to the god of capitalism on the altar of the American Dream, and knelt for success, wealth and power.
Nevertheless, at that time when the date changes, I open my eyes to the question: Did God really exist?
That night, I decided to face him again, not to be brave, but to believe or die, and I was left with only the choice.
And I stepped forward to the next holy land, because I knew that this time I would not be willing to accept the relief that was being offered.
And that there is still not enough effort.
It was a night just before the start of the harsh Cambridge winter, when a conversation arose with three friends in the unpopular corner of a party, which was a common youthful topic that young people have all experienced before: "Should we go on a trip?"
And I had no idea where to go, how to get there.
But I was obsessed with Jack Kerouac's novel, "Out of the Night and Out of the Woods".
There were many voices of opposition, and most of all, the voice was right, but I took a step further.
In the summer of 2013, an 8,000-mile journey began across the United States. Montana's pastures pass through the ruins of Detroit and the swamp of New Orleans.
For me, having trained at the highest capitalist institution, it was rather innovative.
This idea has since expanded and transformed into an NGO called MBAs Across America.
How greedy our generation is toward purpose and meaning.
In the wake of that wave, we realized that so many entrepreneurs who are unseen in creating jobs and transforming the world need a little more support.
We finally realized that, and frankly, another important thing is that I was also trying to stir up the tide.
There was certainly a time when such a thought was expressed that every single social enterprise could heal the wounds of this collapsing country and raise it up again, so that many people would think so.
But this missionary journey has led me to a new gospel, and that is why I stand here today.
About a year ago, one evening, I was at the Natural History Museum in New York City, where a group of students at Harvard Business School met.
They sat down with the children of the age of the clouds beneath the whale-sized replica hanging from the ceiling, celebrating the achievements of the classroom and the spirit of social contribution.
The connections that gathered there and their personal assets were a proud space, worth well over $500 billion.
When you look at the results we have achieved, they are all beautiful.
But it didn't end there, and two days later I was on my way to Harlem, sitting in the corner of a farmhouse built on a formerly vacant site, listening to a man named Tony tell stories about the children who come to the farm every day.
It's the story of children living below the poverty line.
Even when they sleep, they carry their luggage in their arms so that the homeless shelter does not steal it.
To Tony's program called "Harlem Grown", such children come in demanding a meal once a day.
After 20 years as a taxi driver, Tony cut his pension and started the program.
He was not paid because, as the activity spread, he was in financial difficulty.
He said he would go for any kind of a ride.
And I am determined to be that person.
On the way home, a dull sound sound sounded behind my chest, and only tears flowed.
Under one roof, a whale replica floated and two days later, a man was running unpaid to prepare food for his children in a sky just 50 blocks north of the city, with a crowd of 50 billion people moving.
Nor did we weep for inequality, nor did we weep for hunger or pity for the homeless, nor did we grieve for the wealth of the 1% or sympathy for the 99% of the poor.
I was just upset that I was a dialysis machine in a kidney disease country.
I realized that my story was for people who had to walk without shoes, and that I had an organization to deliver effective aid to the victims of the Harlem, Appalachian, and New Orleans disasters, which had been neglected so far.
That flash completely embarrassed me and reminded me that the new century, as Peter Jennings tells us, was repeatedly and repeatedly deceived and deceived by the absurdity of it.
They were being treated unfairly.
But this time I was a false savior myself, and I turned away from the altar that night, which I believed was the end of the world.
I have come a long way from the world I once believed in and am once again at the starting point.
The time we live in is not an age of unbelief, but rather a time of unremitting past.
Some of you may believe Brennie Brown in her words, perhaps Tony Robbins.
"ja the new yorker" and "harvard business review"
Some of you probably believe them, especially in the church we call TED right now, are we not praying?
We want such a leader who can solve every challenge we face.
They believe that suffering is a necessary evil in the god of capitalism, and that the scripture of technological progress is absolute.
But when we are too afraid of what we believe to shake off the foundation and neglect to doubt every element of the foundation, the human sacrifice that comes with it is overlooked.
And if something you have to accept is holding you back, it's time to stop and ask questions.
The gospel of creativity and innovation, which promotes responsibility for social, environmental and economic issues, is not my area of expertise.
In fact, I'm not here to spread a gospel of any meaning.
And the existence of the gospel of doubt is the reason I am here.
For this Gospel does not say that you should cease to believe, but merely that you should seek a new attitude, the thought that the answer is not one.
Accepting the mistake made so far leaves the room to admit that the question itself is wrong.
And this gospel of doubt suggests that we are in this place, in this space, that everything is possible wrong.
The question "why" is the gospel.
Why should people suffer unnecessarily until they give up the power given to us to question?
From this conviction of questioning, I made a decision about my own activities, making MBAs Across America non-profit.
We cut staffing in the organization, stopped new recruitment, and made our business model public and available for free use by those in need.
The question of why was asked of me again when I gave up the role of savior that people had placed upon me, because our lives are too short to wait for the second coming of Christ in the face of the fact that miracles do not happen.
This gospel of doubt should empower you and give you hope even when you feel hopeless and inexhaustible, and even when you are in pain and suffering, the inner voice of the blind faith, which is still in the process of being stopped by thought, is a small, subtle, undeniable light that shines on the darkness, whether it is a whisper or a whisper.
Whether you shout or you cry, you simply say, "There must be another way".
Thank you very much.
and the food crisis.
It's been the news every day.
What does that mean?
Worldwide, food shortages or over-supply are increasing from place to place.
On the other hand, GMOs are saving the world.
GMO's may also have some issues.
Excessive agricultural wastewater pollution is polluting the ocean, causing toxic substances to flow in and lowering nutritional values.
This has been going on for years and years.
Today's debate on the environment is very disappointing.
How can we solve this problem with our knowledge?
And let's look at the food problem of apples.
I'm sure you've all eaten an apple already last week.
How many do you think the apple fell off after it was picked?
Two weeks?
Two months?
11 months ago ― the average for apples lined up in grocery stores in the United States.
I don't think there is much difference between Europe and the rest of the world.
There are also records that the worker entered this storage and died trying to pick the apple because the air that slows the decay of the apple is toxic to humans.
Why didn't anyone know about this?
Why didn't I know?
And 90% of the antioxidant content of apples is lost by the time they are eaten.
This is just a piece of sugar.
Why are we so lacking in information?  How can we improve?
And because of the lack of platforms.
When it comes to platforms and computers, when I was young, the Internet was a very bad place to be.
We did it on this platform.
But I was also able to meet people and express myself.
And how to express yourself using food?
If you have a platform, it's also natural to ask, "If"....
And my question was, what if the climate were the same for everyone?
This is a map of the world's climate.
The areas of high productivity and green, low productivity, are indicated in red.
The center of California's agricultural landscape has now moved to Mexico.
China is already growing better food on Brazilian soil, and we are obeying climate.
What if each country had a climate suitable for production?
And how will it change people's lives?
Will it change the quality of life and nutrition?
The problem for the previous generation was to get more food - cheaper.
Welcome to the world of global farming.
Humans have built a huge analog farm.
The lines shown here show the transportation of food connected by cars, planes, railways, etc.
It is a miracle that the food that supports 7 billion people is produced by a small percentage of the population.
If only...
What if we could build a digital farm?
It's a digital farm that's spreading around the world.
What if we could take out this apple and somehow digitize it, transport it as a particle through the air, and reconstruct it elsewhere?
If only...
I was inspired to read the article and started this research.
Ja 1st - Japanese agriculture has no future for young labor, water, or land, and seeing this, I headed for [南相馬], which is just north of Fukushima, which was hit by the earthquake.
Because of the contaminated land, the children moved to Sendai and Tokyo.
And the food problem is not limited to Japan.
In the United States, 2% of the population is engaged in agriculture.
In any country, 2% is limited to just a few.
In other countries, 50% of Africa's population is under the age of 18.
Eighty percent of them don't want to become farmers.
Agriculture is a heavy work.
The lives of small-scale farmers are miserable.
and flow into urban areas.
In India, farmers do not even have access to water or electricity, and the number of farmers who committed suicide this year was the highest in a decade.
And that's really disgusting.
And where do farmers go?
and urban areas.
The young people do not stay in the area, but all flock to the urban areas.
So how can we build a platform that inspires young people?
This is a new type of tractor!
This is the combination I created.
Years ago, I started working in grocery stores and DIY shops.
When plants were connected to a computer to try to make them dance, everything died out.
It finally came out as immortal.
I built up one of the most intimate relationships of my life, which was that I began to understand the language of plants.
I wish I could grow it bigger.
They said, "Oh, my God!
No one wants to go in here, just an old electrical lab.
What do you think will come out of it?'"
Together with colleagues, we built a farmhouse at MIT Media Lab, a place that has been known as the laboratory of digital life, not biology.
In this space of about six square meters, we produced enough food for three hundred people a month, but we cannot say the amount....
There are many interesting technologies that have been put into it.
And what is the most interesting of them?
Beautiful white roots, dark green vegetables and a monthly harvest.
Is this a new type of cafeteria?
A new and exciting retail experience?
What about the new grocery store?
One thing I can say for sure is that this is the first time in the Media Lab that something has been extracted from the roots.
There's a salad in the bag, but no problem.
But what would happen if a data scientist, an expert in image processing, a robot researcher, and a person were pulling something from the root and thinking, "Let's try this out with our knowledge?"
We'll try to keep it in the lab before we take it out, because we don't want to throw away what we've grown - it's precious.
My tongue has changed - I try to eat myself first until I know it's a good food.
So I eat lettuce every day because the pH of lettuce can be seen with a margin of error of 0.1.
"Oh, yeah, that's PH6.1 today, I can't eat it".
The lettuce of the day was delicious.
When plants are exposed to stress and are trying to protect themselves, there is a chemical reaction inside, so sweet that they say, "I don't want to die".
The cry of such a plant makes me very sweet to my liking.
A scientist and engineer who has turned to plant physiology...
I wanted to make sure that others could do this experiment.
I was curious about what was being made, so I thought of a lab that could be deployed anywhere.
I tried to make it first.
On the front of the Media Lab is my own lab with 30 sensors per plant.
If you know anything about the genome or genetic engineering, this is the so-called phenomenon.
It is derived from the word "and phenomenon".
For example, "Mexican strawberries are a favorite" actually means strawberries grown in a climate that suits your taste.
So if you program and create that climate, you program a combination of carbon dioxide and oxygen levels to program the taste, nutrient, size, shape, color, and toothpaste of plants as a recipe.
This requires data and we have installed a number of sensors to know the situation. Thinking of indoor garden plants, you'd be very sad to look at this, "Why are you dying?
And farmers have the most amazing eye ability to predict plant growth in their late 60s and early 70s.
When plants die, they know that the reason is a lack of nitrogen, a lack of calcium, or a need for moisture.
This amazing eye-power is not inherited.
This is data already stored by a farmer in the cloud.
and track changes in data over time.
We will take these data and relate them to individual plants.
These are the IP addresses of a lab brokerage employed by a day's work.
IP addresses are a viable broker.
(Applause) If you think the wonder is still lacking, click here and look at the profile of the plant.
The data on the growth of plants so far is available for download, and not only when they are eaten, but probably more than you can imagine.
When and how much nutrition is needed?
It predicts the timing of the taste of the food.
Are you drinking too much water?
Don't you take up too much sunlight?
And it also sends out a warning.
He speaks to me, he is intelligent, he has words in common with me.
(Applause) I even think that the plant world's number one Facebook user is me.
The first step is to look at the profile of the plant and the plant starts making friends.
Other plants that consume less nitrogen, more lime, and less potassium are plants that consume less nitrogen.
It should be a good comparison, but so far we have learned the complexity of the plant-to-plant relationship that is hard to guess.
The plants may not recognize us as friends, but it is possible that it depends on our actions.
This is my current lab.
I have experience in setting up data centers in various hospitals and have some knowledge of creating managed environments.
And then, in this environment, I try all kinds of experiments.
This method of aeration was developed by NASA to reduce the amount of water carried into space for the Milky Way space station.
Here we are providing the plants with what they need - water, minerals and oxygen - just as they need it.
The root growth is simple and can only be done by providing the necessary ingredients.
And plants seem to have two hearts.
Because they have two hearts, they grow four or five times faster.
And it is a perfect world.
Over the years, humans have advanced technology and have been able to grow in harsh environments.
We have already grown a variety of plants.
This type of tomato was not commercially produced for 150 years.
Did you know that humans already have a rare and ancient seed bank?
And the seed storage.
And that's wonderful.
Some species have survived and no one has ever spoken of their reproductive system.
I am the only person who has ever eaten this tomato in the lab.
The problem is that this is a tomato sauce and I don't know how to cook it.
And using protein, I tried to grow a variety of things.
Even humans - they may or may not be able to do it - but they haven't really done it.
What I've learned is that the device is large and very expensive.
I wanted to spread it around the world, but it became a device that cost about ten million yen.
It's hard to find someone who can make ten million yen, so I decided to make something small.
This project was actually one of my students, and undergraduate student Kamil, who studied mechanical engineering, was advancing it.
Camille and I, together with colleagues, experimented repeatedly during the summer months, aiming to create something that works cheaper, better, and more easily, and that anyone can create.
Then I brought this to middle school and high school.
If you want to be exposed to people, please teach your child something.
I went to school and said, "Set the humidity to 65%".
A middle school student asks, "What is humidity?"
I replied, "It's about the water in the air".
He replies, "There is no water in the air, it's not stupid".
I'll also reply, "You don't have to believe me.
And you don't have to believe it.
Try setting it to 100% and so on".
He set it to 100% - what happens?
The water is concentrated and misted, and the water drops eventually fall.
He said, "Well, humidity is about rain.
Why didn't you tell me that?"
We've already created a game-like input screen.
It is a 3D display, and you can log in from anywhere in the world, whether from a smartphone or tablet.
The boat can handle a variety of devices and sensors.
Choose the recipe that other children around the world have made.
When you select and activate the recipe, seedlings can be planted.
And changes are made during growth.
"Why do plants need CO2 if it's harmful, but it kills people?"
What a word to say.
And if the CO2 levels are increased, plants die.
Lowering CO2 will make the plants very healthy.
Once plants are harvested, new digital recipes emerge.
It is a process of designing, developing and exploring repeatedly.
I can download data on the new plants they have developed and new digital recipes, and what changes have been made - effective or vice versa?
Consider these as a core part of the development process.
We will learn a lot already.
This is what we call the food computer and the three weeks in school.
In three weeks, it grows so much.
Perhaps even more importantly, this child first thought, "Can I become a farmer myself?" or "I want to be a farmer".
So we opened up all the data.
Everything is online and let's try to assemble a food computer at home.
It may be a little difficult, but...
It's a fresh start, but everything is set.
And being easily accessible is very important.
I'll go with something closer to it.
They are farmers, electrical engineers, mechanical engineers, environmental engineers, computer scientists, plant scientists, economists and urban planners.
On one platform, you do your best work.
In this lab, the work has become very limited.
And this is the new facility I've just started using.
Warehouses like this are everywhere.
And that's why I chose it.
And I'm trying to make something like this in my warehouse.
This is already a reality.
Please see here.
There's already a place here too.
Each has grown green vegetables and an Ebola vaccine.
One of the reasons these plants won the National Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Grand Challenge is that they were leading the way in Ebola research.
This plant produces proteins that are resistant to Ebola.
From pharmaceuticals, to dietary supplements to lettuce.
It is not quite like the regatus, but this is the field I am studying.
It differs in every respect.
We are still in the early chaos of the world - as if "it's our black box".
"No, I have a very valuable intellectual property right.
Don't be a jerk and buy me one".
In fact, it is just the beginning and society is about to change.
While seeking more affordable food, they are increasingly seeking more environmentally friendly food of good quality.
The fact that McDonald's has released the contents of the Chicken Nuggets, which were considered the most bizarre food ever, suggests that they are marketing in line with the changing world.
Let us look at the modern world.
Personal food computers, food servers, and food data centers are run in an open-ended phenomenon.
Unlike the open genome, we are like a wiki with a little added climate recipe, which can be activated, expanded and enlarged by selecting from the drop-down menu.
And how will this attempt look globally?
Do you remember the world being connected by a line?
First, install the trigger and set the trigger.
Instead of sending food itself, they start sending information about food.
And it's not just my fantasy, it's already spreading in places like this.
Food computers, food servers, and food data centers are also created, and sharing information connects people.
The future food supply is not about fighting the internal defects.
And I know what I am missing.
The future food supply is a network that will connect the next billion farmers and, by providing a platform, will enable them to raise and solve problems "if"....
Thank you very much.
And sometimes, as Europeans, I lose my deepest affection for myself.
Over the past year, more than a million people have arrived in Europe seeking help.Our response to this has been, frankly, rude.
It's really already full of contradictions.
Although we mourned the tragic death of 2-year-old Alan Kurdija, since then more than 200 children have drowned in the Mediterranean.
While recognizing the shared responsibility for refugee reception in the international agreement, the international community is silent about the fact that the number of refugees in Lebanon is increasing in the whole of Europe.
We already regret the presence of a ship, but we have left it as the only route of exile to Europe.
It excludes people who are underemployed and economically and demographically fit for human needs from accepting people who are not fit for human needs.
While promoting liberalism against Islamic fundamentalism, it has pursued a repressive policy of detaining young refugees, separating children from their families, and seizing refugees' property.
Don't you think it's weird?
Why is there such a lack of humanitarian response to the humanitarian crisis?
I don't think it's because people are indifferent, or at least I don't want to believe that's why.
I think politicians and politicians lack a vision to adapt international refugee policy, created more than 50 years ago, to a changing globalist era.
So I want to go back to basics and ask two very basic questions that we should all consider.
First of all, why is the current system not working?
And how can we fix this?
The modern refugee system was created by these people shortly after World War II.
The original purpose was to provide a place where people could live in safety and dignity until they returned when a state collapsed or, at worst, when they were given a knife to their citizens.
It was designed to prepare for the situation that is seen in Syria today.
The 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, an international agreement signed between 147 governments, and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, an international organization, pledged to accept refugees into their own countries through the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
But today, this system is not working.
And in theory, refugees have the right to seek asylum.
In reality, our immigration policies are blocking the path to security.
In theory, refugees have the right to seek asylum and to return home.
In reality, we are stuck almost forever.
And theoretically, refugees share responsibility in countries around the world.
In reality, the countries that are neighbouring conflict zones are hosting the vast majority of refugees worldwide due to geographical problems.
And the system doesn't work because the rules are wrong, not because the rules are wrong.
And because the rules are not properly applied in a changing world, we should rethink that.
Here's how the current refugee system actually works.
Let me explain a little bit.
But, from the institutional point of view, I will not describe it from the top-down perspective, but from the refugee perspective.
First, imagine a Syrian woman who is a Syrian.
Let's call her Aja Amira.
And the woman who symbolizes the many people in the area.
Amira is a woman and a child, as 25% of the world's refugees are.The reason she can't return home is because the street she lived in is in this condition.As you can see, Amira's street, Homs, was once a beautiful and historic street but is now buried in rubble.
It's not a situation where you can go home.
But Amira has no way of resettling in a third country, as it is a lottery-like situation where only 1% of the world's refugees can get a place.
So, Amira and her family are forced to make an almost impossible choice.
And there are only three basic options.
The first is to take your family and enter a refugee camp.
While there is help, the future of Amira and her family is almost impossible.
The refugee camps are a barren, barren land, much of it in the desert.
In the Zataari refugee camp in Jordan, at night, gunfire sounds can be heard on the border with Syria.
Economic activity is limited by its limits.
The quality of education is also poor.
And around the world, about 80 percent of the refugees in camps will continue to live in this state for at least five years.
Life there is miserable, perhaps that is why only 9% of Syrians actually choose this path.
There is also the option of targeting the next city, Anman or Beirut in neighboring countries.
And this is the option chosen by 75% of Syrian refugees.
But even there, he faces great difficulties.
As refugees, they usually do not have the right to work in these urban areas.
And help is almost impossible to get.
In this case, Aamir and his family are living in poverty in the city, with almost nothing left after they had exhausted their previous savings.
The third option is that more Syrians choose this option.
It is a phenomenon seen in Europe today where people risk their lives to seek a little hope for their families and embark on a very dangerous journey to another country.
This is the first choice that the world has ever made for refugees, and they are limited to three options: camping, urban poverty, and dangerous travel.
And for refugees, this is the very nature of the international refugee system.
But it is an illusion to think that this is the only way.
I think there is room for reconsideration.
The reason these options are limited is because in our minds we think that this is the only path a refugee can take, but that is wrong.
Politicians and other people believe that the refugee problem is a "zero-sum" problem, that is, that if something is done for refugees, the burden will be on the citizens.
We have a common premise and often think that refugees are a burden or a burden on society.
On the contrary, there are ways in which refugees can contribute to society.
What I'm saying is that while expanding the range of refugee choices, there is a way to benefit everyone - the host country, the community, our society, and the refugees themselves.
I believe that the four ways we will discuss them can fundamentally change the way we think about refugees.
One thing they all have in common is how globalization, mobility and market opportunities have been used to change our approach to refugee issues.
The first idea is to create an environment for refugees, starting with a very basic understanding that refugees are human beings just like everyone else, but are only placed in unusual situations.
I started researching in Uganda with a colleague at Oxford University to investigate the economic activities of refugees.
Uganda was chosen not because it was a welcoming country representing the world.
Because they have very good policies.
Unlike other host countries around the world, Uganda has provided economic opportunities for refugees.
It gave refugees the right to work and freedom of movement.
This has already produced amazing results for both refugees and refugee settlements.
In the capital Kampala, 21% of refugees own businesses and employ workers, and 40% of those hired were nationals of the host country.
In other words, refugees were creating jobs and employing nationals of the host country.
Even in refugee camps, there were excellent examples of active personal endeavors.
For example, in the Nakhivale refugee settlement, Congolese refugees engaged in the business of selling digital music.
A project started by a Rwandan refugee was to provide computer games for teenagers using recycled gaming machines and televisions.
Despite the harsh environment, innovative initiatives are being undertaken.This photo is of a Congolese man named Demukay.
When I arrived in the residential area, it was almost intact, but I was looking for a filmmaker.
He has already opened a community radio station with friends and colleagues and is now producing video with a video camera.
I've co-produced two documentaries with my team and have made my business a success with a few hands.
And based on these examples, we should decide how we respond to refugees.
Instead of seeing refugees as necessarily dependent on humanitarian assistance, we need to provide opportunities to thrive as human beings.
Of course, clothing, clothing, shelter, food, etc. are all important in an emergency, but we need to look ahead.
We are also providing opportunities for communication, electricity, education, labour rights, access to capital and banking.
It is natural for us to benefit from the global economy, and it is possible and should be possible for refugees.
The second is the idea of an economic zone.
Unfortunately, not all refugee-hosting countries around the world follow the same policies as Uganda.
Most countries do not accept refugees as part of their economy in a way similar to Uganda's.
But there are practical cases that can be used.
In April last year, I went to Jordan with my colleague, the development economist Paul Collier, who was doing a brainstorming session during his stay, discussing with the international community and the Jordanian government in a manner consistent with Jordan's domestic development strategy.
Jaja came up with a way to give Syrians jobs, with the idea of an economic zone, which explored the possibility of hiring refugees alongside the Jordanian nationals of the host country.
Just 15 minutes from the Zataari refugee camp, where 83,000 refugees live, there is an economic zone called King Hussein bin Talal Development Zone.
The Jordanian government has invested more than $1 million to connect the region to the power grid and road network, but two things are missing: labor and internal investment.
What if the refugees could work here, not be trapped in camps, feed their families, learn skills through vocational training, and then return to Syria?
Jordan considered this to be beneficial to Jordan, because Jordan's development strategy as a middle-income country requires the development of domestic manufacturing.
It is also beneficial for refugees, but it also contributes to the reconstruction of post-conflict Syria, based on the understanding that both are necessary for the protection and education of refugees, who will be the best human resource for rebuilding Syria.
The political magazine Forlin Affairs published the case in a recent post.
King Abja's eyes were closed.
Two weeks ago, at a conference in London to support Syria, it was announced that this summer it would be piloted.
(ja applause) The third idea I would like to propose to you is a matching system between the country and the refugees that leads to happy results like this photo of a Syrian refugee taking a selfie with Prime Minister Angela Merkel.
It is not often that we ask refugees what they want or where they want to go, but we can all get it by listening to them.
The concept of matching theory, developed by economist Alvin Rossja, is that the final combination is determined by the selection of the participants.
Colleagues Will Jones and Alex Titelboim explored how to apply this concept to refugees: asking refugees to list their desired destination in order of acceptance, and at the same time asking the host country to prioritize the desired type of refugee in terms of job skills and language, matching the two.
Well, although the terms of the acceptance framework should of course also take into account factors such as diversity and vulnerability, it is also possible to think of this as a way to increase matching rates.
The concept of matchmaking is well used in areas such as the university's acceptance frame for students, kidney donors and patients, and the algorithm used in dating sites.
Why not incorporate this into the wider refugee options?
And domestically, because one of the biggest challenges we face is convincing the local community to accept refugees.
Now, for example, in my native England, I often do the ridiculous thing of sending engineers to the country and farmers to the city.
So, by matching the market, we can match the expectations of both and hear the needs and demands of both the residents of the former host country and the refugees.
And the fourth idea is a humanitarian visa.
Most of the tragedies and chaos that are taking place in Europe are entirely avoidable.
This is because of a fundamental contradiction in European refugee law, namely that to be a refugee in Europe, you must arrive on a dangerous journey without any prior preparation, but why is such a journey necessary?
In today's era of airline and consular services, such travel may be completely unnecessary, but last year it killed more than 3,000 people on European borders and within Europe.
In simple terms, it is inevitable that refugees will be allowed to travel to Europe as refugees if they are allowed to do so in a normal way, and this is achieved by a method called humanitarian visa, which allows them to obtain a visa at the embassy or consulate of a neighbouring country and simply to issue their travel documents and travel to Europe by ferry or plane.
The smugglers used 1,000 euros to cross the Greek islands from Turkey to Greece.
The price of the GAN ticket from Bodrum to Frankfurt is 200 euros.
And there are great advantages to freeing refugees from such options.
The refugee smuggling industry itself is going to be a commercial success, and the chaos on the European front lines, like the Greek islands, will disappear.
And what is preventing such a move is not rational measures, but policy.
And this idea is actually being incorporated.
Brazil pioneered this approach, with over 2,000 Syrians obtaining humanitarian visas to enter Brazil and at the same time as arrival, gaining refugee status.
All Syrians who have already used this system have been granted refugee status and have been formally recognized as refugees.
There are also historical precedents.
Between 1922 and 1942, the Nansen Passport was used as an international identity card, allowing 450,000 Assyrians, Turks, Chechens to move within Europe and apply for asylum in other European countries.
The International Organization for Refugees (IORF) of Nanja Nansen has won the Nobel Peace Prize, and this realistic strategy has been recognized by the world.
All four ideas I have just mentioned are ways to increase Amira's options for temporary refugees, who have come to the forefront.
And it's a way to expand the range of options for refugees, without necessarily limiting themselves to the three irrational options I mentioned earlier, and so benefiting others.
In conclusion, we need a new vision that is clear: a vision that understands that while expanding the refugee's options, it does not have to be a burden.
And the idea that refugees are inevitably a burden is wrong.
Although it is a humanitarian obligation, refugees are people with the skills, talents and willpower to contribute to society even if given the opportunity.
In the future, the world will not be left behind by immigrants.
What is happening in Europe will continue for years to come.
Refugees continue to move and to wander in search of accommodation, and rational and realistic ways to deal with this situation should be sought, not based on the old theory of humanitarian aid or the idea of charity, but on ways to seize the opportunities that globalization, market mobility, and other factors can create.
I would like to appeal to all of you and to all politicians to wake up and take this challenge to a standstill.
Thank you very much.
I have been fascinated by the sea since I was a child.
It is a wonderful place full of color and life, home to amazing creatures like aliens.
He imagined a large shark dominating the food chain or a graceful shark swimming across the coral reef.
I have gone from being a marine biologist to being a photographer, so I have devoted much of my career to exploring the magical places I dreamed of as a child.
As you can see, I have been exploring underwater since I was quite young.
But the first time I really went underwater was when I was about 10 years old.
I still remember swimming hard, trying to touch an old cannon over a shallow coral.
And when I finally caught it and looked up, I was immediately surrounded by fish of all colors.
Thomas Peschak, conservation activist photographer who has lived on Earth for 40 years, I have had the precious opportunity to explore the magnificent sea for National Geographic and Save Our Seas Foundation.
I've photographed everything from the enormous size of a shark to the cute, hand-woven shark.
On the edge of the cold Great Bear Rainforest in Canada, a very stinky, highly venomous caterpillar whale came to the scene just 30 centimetres away to feed.
It also coincided with the end of the Aouimigamaja shark crossing in the Mozambique Channel.
The sea and the people on earth have been affected by the same thing.
And finding the sea of untouched waters that I dreamed of as a child is becoming increasingly difficult.
They are increasingly being stalked and threatened.
We humans have been and continue to be the dominant predators on Earth, but I have witnessed and photographed the impact of this ever-expanding effect.
I've long wanted to be noticed by being shocked by a shocking photograph.
Although this effort has its advantages, I'm back to square one.
He thought that the best way to bring about change was to appeal to love.
I may be a kind of companion, but as a photographer I have had the privilege of revealing the entire animal and ecosystem hidden beneath the sea.
And if you do not know that it exists, you cannot cherish it or defend it.
And revealing the hidden identity is the power of photography for protection activities.
I have visited hundreds of marine waters, but a few have been particularly deeply touched.
The first time I experienced such excitement was 10 years ago, off the rocky, unopened coast of South Africa.
Every year in June and July, a huge herd of Ijawassi makes a large northward migration called the Sardinian Run.
There is a good reason for this.
Because a fast-track catcher who is already starving is chasing him in secret at a tremendous speed.
Dolphins generally hunt in groups and separate some eagles from the herd to form a ball-shaped herd called the Beatball.
They hunt fish to the surface of the sea and become part of this living, moving meal.
Just behind him is a shark.
While many dolphins and sharks believe that dolphins and sharks are enemies of each other, the Sardinian ranks actually coexist.
Dolphins help sharks to feed efficiently.
Without dolphins, the bait balls are more scattered, and the shark can't get anything out of the so-called sardine donuts, which contain water in its mouth.
Well, I've also been through exciting moments with sharks in Sardinian Lanja, and I realize that they don't see me as a prey.
But at this ridiculous feast, they are beaten and beaten with a horn, like other fish.
Moving east from the coast of Africa, across the vast Indian Ocean, we reach the coral-shaped islands of the Maldives.
During the intense southwestern monsoon season, onion macchiae come from all over the islands to the very small portion of the bear atoll called the honeycomb.
With a molar in the habitat of the plankton, the Oniotmachiae feeds on its own and repeatedly hovers backwards, much like a puppy chasing its tail.
But when plankton is concentrated in one place, the Eys line up and form a long chain for feeding. Even if the nearest Eys in the front escape a little bit of the plankton, the next Eys will surely swallow it up.
As the quantity of plankton increases, the Eys swim closer together, this unique action is called cyclone feeding.
The Eja-ey rotates in a solid array, forming a layered cylinder that spins plankton to collect and suck into its own cavity-like mouth.
Diving experiences surrounded by hundreds of A.I. groups are truly unforgettable.
When the first footage was shot in Hanifal, it was not protected and was threatened by development.
Working with NGOs such as Mantaja Trust, my photography eventually helped make the honeycomb a marine protected area.
Fishermen on the nearby island once caught the aija for the traditional drumming of the aija with its skin.
Now they are more active in protecting the environment than anyone else, and thanks to AI, they have earned more than $8 million a year in revenue in the Maldives.
I always wanted to go back to a time when the map was almost empty or when it read, "There's a dragon here".
The closest I have ever been to the seas of that era was the atoll in the western Indian Ocean.
When you dive into such seas, far away from sea lanes and fishing boats, you can feel the ancient sea as if it were a painful feeling.
Most people have probably never heard of the small coral reef in the Mozambique Strait called Basus da India.
Its coral reef is protected by a wall and the reef lake inside is a breeding ground for the Galapagos shark.
This shark is not very cowardly, even during the day.
I had a feeling that I would be more daring at night and come out more often.
Have you ever encountered so many sharks on the edge of a coral reef?
Capturing and sharing moments like this reminds me of why I took this path.
This year I already worked for National Geographic in Baja California Peninsula.
Where the Pacific half of the peninsula has been reached, there is the San Ignacio Lagoon, which is important as a breeding ground for the Cocos whale.
This coastline is where mass killing continued for 100 years, killing more than 20,000 whales and only a few hundred survived.
Now the descendants of the whales push their young into the sea, playing or even interacting with us.
This breed has experienced a truly amazing resurgence.
Now, on the other side of the peninsula is a quiet fishing town called Cabo Pulmo.
It was on the brink of collapse after decades of overfishing.
In 1995, local fishermen demanded that the sea be designated as a marine protected area.
And what happened after that was a miracle, beyond all description.
In 2005, despite the fact that only 10 years have passed since the protection began, the number of fish has recovered to an unprecedented level.
But look at it with your own eyes, let's go with it.
Let's take a deep breath and swim through the largest and densest herd of fish I've ever encountered.
Everyone can and will generate hope.
Through my photographs, I want to show that it is not too late to protect our oceans.
I want to focus on the resilience of nature especially when we are faced with 7.3 billion people.
My hope is that in the future, without further investigation, such photographs will not be possible and will be used as a model for coexistence with the ocean.
And I just hope that it becomes a daily occurrence.
To survive and thrive in my profession, I must be a very optimistic person.
I always work under the assumption that a great photo that promotes change is right there in the corner, or across the coral, or in the reef lake or on the other side.
When I moved to Harare in 1985, social justice was at the heart of Zimbabwe's healthcare policy.
It was only after the long war of independence that a new government emerged and immediately declared a socialist policy, that medical services, primary education, etc. became essentially free.
The regional healthcare system has been significantly increased, with about 80% of the population having access to healthcare facilities within two hours' walk.
In 1980, when Zimbabwe became independent, the national childhood immunization rate was 25 percent.
And just ten years later, in 1990, it reached 80%.
I was really proud to be involved in this great reform.
The excitement and the end of the people was so visible.
I felt that I was joining the ranks of the very talented scientists, doctors, and activists in the area to become part of the public health movement, which was not only leading the independence movement in Africa but also the world.
But there was a terrible problem.
In 1985, the year I arrived, the first HIV case was reported in Zimbabwe.
In the early 80s, I had seen a number of AIDS patients at Harlem General Hospital, where I was a trained physician, but I had no idea what was coming to Africa.
The HIV infection rate in the early days of my stay was about 2%.
It was 17 years after I left Harare that it soared, with one in four adults infected.
By the mid-1990s, I had informed hundreds of people working hard that I was HIV positive.
I have experienced the death of colleagues and friends, and have witnessed the death of students and patients.
In response, I and my colleagues set up a clinic.
Exercise and practice how to use condoms.
Starting a sex education in school and workplace.
They can conduct case studies or instruct the partner of the infected person on prevention.
I was working hard and I thought I was doing my best at the time.
I was going to do a good treatment, but it was rough now.
But there was no activity calling for structural reform.
Former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan has openly denied his own failure to carry out the genocide in Rwanda.
In 1994, when the genocide occurred, he was the UN Secretary General of the UNPKO.
At the 10th anniversary commemoration of the massacre, he looked back, "I was sure I was doing my best at the time, but I realized that the massacre had happened, and that there was more to be done, and more to be done, and that there was more to be done to sound the alarm, and to cooperate".
The AIDS epidemic has caught the attention of the medical community, and I am not the only one who regrets that the World Health Organization predicts that 39 million people have died of AIDS so far, and that we should have acted more quickly now.
But during his stay in Zimbabwe, he did not consider himself a change advocate or a political position.
I came here as a clinician and as an epidemiologist to use my professional skills.
In my heart, I thought my role was to care for patients, to conduct research and to gain a better understanding of the infection patterns of the population, and thus to stop the spread of the virus.
And he knew that the vulnerable in society were at a higher risk of contracting AIDS and dying.
More than any modern corporate organization, Satoukibi Farm, 60 percent of pregnant women were HIV positive in the feudal era.
And I taught that the person who is infected is not a simple man, but rather a product of a male-dominated culture, forced labor seasons, or colonial rule.
The white population was hardly affected.
As healthcare professionals, we were painfully powerless, only begging them to reduce our sexual activity, such as using condoms, changing personal behavior, or using condoms.
The infection rate was rising, and the West developed drugs to treat AIDS, the most effective treatment yet available to any public sector in Africa.
I was silent, not saying anything about the lack of equal access to life-saving drugs or the political and economic system that underpinned the AIDS epidemic - the mechanisms that have led to the massive outbreak so far.
I justified my silence and said to myself, 'I am not a resident of this country, and if I sound the alarm, I will not be able to get a good job that could even result in deportation, patients will not be diagnosed, and the necessary research will not be possible.'
So I kept quiet, not commenting on the government's policy on AIDS at the time.
He was not sufficiently concerned about his own concerns.
And many doctors and healthcare professionals will think I never fell for it.
The Hippocratic Oath, a promise to the doctor and the patient, and its other version set forth the sacredness of the relationship between the doctor and the patient.
I did everything I could to help my patients, and I did my best.
But I realized that such a pandemic reflected a distortion of society, not based on biological reasons, but rather rooted in practices of exclusion, exclusion and discrimination against the vulnerable, based on race, gender, sexuality, social class, etc.
The AJAZ applies to this.
The same was true of the recent Ebola outbreak.
Medical anthropologists such as Paul Farmer, who has been campaigning against AIDS in Haiti, call it "structural violence" because inequality is embedded in the political and economic fabric of our society and often invisible to those with privileges and power, and call it "violence" because the deaths, suffering and illnesses that this phenomenon brings in young people are violent.
If you want to be of some use to your patient, you should not ignore the awareness of these social inequalities.
Calling attention is the first step to making public health work, and thus bringing together partners to pave the way for real change.
So, lately, I've been keeping my mouth shut, too.
I speak up about a lot of things, even when the listener feels uncomfortable, and even when I feel uncomfortable speaking out.
In many cases, racial inequality and institutionalized racism are things that should no longer exist in this country, and are not even allowed in the medical field or public health.
As a price for its existence, people are losing their lives without living a lifetime.
So, to sound the alarm about racial discrimination in American health care, the ongoing systemic violence against people, the violence against people of color, and the 250 years of slavery that left a painful legacy for America, 90 years of Jim Crow and 60 years of unequal inequality, is at the heart of my mission as New York City Health Officer.
The rate of youth mortality in New York City under the age of 65 is 50% higher for black men than for white men.
In 2012, the rate of maternal mortality among black women was more than 10 times that of white women.
Although the survival rate of infants has improved dramatically, black infants are still nearly three times more likely to die within a year of birth than white infants.
New York City is not the only place that is special.
Similar statistics can be found everywhere in the United States.
According to a recent analysis by The New York Times, 1.5 million black men across the United States are underserved.
According to the article, more than one in six black men aged 25-54 today disappears from the daily scene - either in prison or in their youth.
There is a tremendous amount of injustice, including the violence that is the subject of protests known as the #BlackLivesMatter, which is the unjust violence that happens every day to young black men.
But it is important to remember that although the incidence rates vary, the incidence and outcome of common diseases - such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and AIDS - are slowly slow to slowly die, and the younger deaths from these diseases are causing more deaths among blacks.
When the #jaBlackLivesMatter movement began, I felt regret and anger because the medical community has avoided even using the word "racism" in research and work.
I wonder if you've ever thought of something when I used that word.
Most of the medical community was silent and ignored by the students of medicine who were disguised as corpses in white robes, while the remaining discrimination still continues to affect the appearance of disease and mortality rates.
The modern trend toward individualized health care and precision medicine is that the daily environment in which people live, grow, work and love is the most impactful to people's health and is affecting the health of too many people.
As healthcare professionals, we are witnessing tremendous injustice in our daily work, both in clinics and in research, where homeless people are unable to follow doctor's instructions because of more precise priorities.
As a medical professional, the role of a doctor is to be the lead singer of attention, call for change, and not just to diagnose patients.
The doctor has a considerable amount of weight in his or her speech, regardless of his or her legal status in society, and should not waste it.
I have regretted not raising my voice in Zimbabwe and have vowed to myself as New York City Health Director to use my opportunity to the maximum extent possible to raise awareness and call for cooperation in improving health inequality.
I will also be a force when you fight against racial discrimination and I will also be a force for any other form of inequality.
Now is the time for us to stand up and speak out as a group against structural inequality.
And you don't have to know all the answers to call for change.
It just takes courage to do it.
The health of our patients and the health of all of us is already at stake.
If I may raise my hand, have you ever removed a friend on Facebook because he or she made some unpleasant remarks about politics, religion, parenting, or food?
Who says there is at least one person who avoids talking and doesn't want to talk?
Once upon a time, to have a polite conversation, I wish I had spoken of weather and health in the words of Professor Higgins in My Fair Lady.
Recently, climate change and anti-vaccination issues have become less of a safe topic.
In a world in which we live, any conversation can turn into a dispute, where politicians are unable to talk to each other, and where even the most trivial issues are fiercely debated, it is not normal to argue for or against.
A Pew Research Center study of 10,000 American adults found that people are now more polarized than ever before in history.
Everyone is not willing to compromise, and they are not willing to listen.
And we decide where we live, who we marry, and who we make friends with based on what we already believe.
This again means that they have no hearing.
Talking and listening need to be balanced, but we lost that balance somewhere.
And the development of technology is also a factor.
And the cell phone is probably still in your hand or is within reach of your hand.
According to the Pew Research Center, one-third of teens send more than 100 messages a day.
And most of them probably text more often than they do face-to-face.
to the Atlantic magazine.
There's an interesting article written by a high school teacher named Paul J. Barnwell.
He already presented the student with a communication challenge.
I wanted to teach them how to talk about a particular topic without using a memoir.
He writes, "I have realized it".
"And conversational skills are the most overlooked skills a teacher is trying to teach.
Students spend hours each day communicating with ideas and others through the screen, but have little opportunity to hone their interpersonal skills.
And it may sound strange, but we should ask ourselves, is there anything more important in the 21st century than the ability to communicate with confidence and reason?"
I'm working on speaking, I'm a Nobel laureate truck driver billionaire kindergarten teacher and head of state plumber.
I talk to people I like and people I don't like.
Personally, I talk to people who disagree with me completely.
Still, I can have a wonderful conversation with them.
In the next 10 minutes, I'll show you how to talk and listen.
You've probably heard a lot about the secret to conversation: looking into someone's eyes, thinking ahead of time about a topic of interest, looking at them and smiling at them to show that you're listening carefully, repeating their words or making a promise.
Forget all about that.
It's no longer useful because it's useless.
You don't have to learn how to show the wind that you're listening carefully if you're actually listening carefully.
(ja applause) I still use my skills as a professional interviewer in my everyday life.
I'll teach you the technique of interviewing, but it will also help to improve conversations.
We've all had some great conversations.
We know what kind of things they are.
A conversation that feels like a break-up when you're fully understood and you've made a real connection with the person who's been inspired and engaged.
There is no reason why most conversations should not be such.
Let's take a look at the 10 basic rules of conversation together and if you master any of them, you'll enjoy a better conversation.
The first is "Don't be a jerk while you're at it".
Not only will we stop handing out cell phones, tablets, and car keys.
It means that my body and mind are there.
It makes you feel like you're in the moment.
Don't even think about arguing with your boss.
And don't worry about what to do with dinner.
If you want to get out of the conversation, please get out, but please stop participating in only half of it.
The second is "not to speak unilaterally".
If you want to make your point without any reaction, discussion, criticism or opportunity for growth, you should blog.
And the reason I don't put someone who speaks exclusively on my show is because it's boring.
If you're a conservative, you hate Obama, food stamps, and abortion.
If you were a liberal, you'd hate big banks, oil companies, or Dick Cheney.
And I know what to say.
And it won't have to be that way.
We need to enter the conversation with the attitude that something should be learned.
As the famous therapist M. Scott Peck says, "To truly listen, you need to put yourself aside".
This means that sometimes you need to put your own opinions aside.
"By feeling accepted, the speaker will not feel defenseless and will be able to show the listener to the depths of his heart".
And I repeat, let's come to the learning attitude.
As Bija Bil-Nay says, "Everyone you meet knows something you don't know".
I would say, "Anyone who is an expert in something".
Number three is "free to ask questions".
Let's learn to be journalists.
We ask questions that start with when/where/who/what/why/how.
And even when you ask a complex question, you only get a simple answer.
If you were to ask, "Were you scared?"
The answer to the most impressive word in the question is "yes" or "no", and in this case "scared".
"And were you angry?" "Yeah, I was very angry".
Let's let the other person explain it, because that's where we know.
I ask a question like, "How did you look?"
"And how did you feel?"
Then the other person will have to stop and think about it and then an even more interesting answer will come back.
The fourth is "to let the flow flow".
The thoughts that come to mind must be let out.
You may have heard of interviews often where guests ask questions after a few minutes of conversation, and the host is completely irrelevant or answers them earlier.
The conductor stopped listening two minutes ago, thought up a clever question and decided that this was something that had to be said.
We are doing exactly the same thing.
While sitting and talking to someone, she recalls meeting actor Hugh Jackman at a coffee shop.
And then they stop listening.
Stories and ideas can come to mind, but they can't.
Let's just let it go if it floats.
And 5 "If you don't know, say you don't know".
Radio broadcasters, especially on NPR, are careful when they say they are experts in something or know something for sure, as they know that what they say will be recorded.
Do the same for all of you, but be careful.
And we should not underestimate the value of conversation.
Chapter 6: "Don't compare the experience of others to your own".
When someone else is saying that he or she has lost a family member, do not bring up the story of losing a family member.
When the other person is talking about problems at the company, don't say how much you hate your job.
Your experience with your partner is completely different.
And every experience is individual.
More importantly, I am not telling my own story.
And you don't have to take the opportunity to show how great and how hard you are.
When asked about IQ, Stephen Hawking reportedly replied, "Well, IQ pride is about being a loser".
Conversations are not an opportunity to promote themselves.
"How are you today?" "Look at the blog!" and "Don't say the same thing over and over again".
We're all tired and bored, but we're all good at it.
Especially in conversations at work and with children, you change words and repeat them to prove your claim is correct.
Please don't do that.
The 8th is "I don't mind the details".
And frankly, the person doesn't care about the details, like age, surname, or date, which you may find hard to remember.
The other person is not interested in you; what interests him is you.
What are you and what do you have in common?
So let's forget the details, it's not necessary.
9 This is not the last, but the most important.
"And listen to the people".
As many great men have said this, listening is the most important skill anyone can develop.
The words of the Buddha, I quote a little, "When you open your mouth you learn nothing".
"No one is fired for hearing", said the silent and famous President Calvin Coolidge.
Why don't we ask each other questions?
One is that we want to talk rather than listen.
When talking, you have the authority to lead.
And there's no need to listen to what you're not interested in.
Be attentive to the attention.
You can strengthen your identity and strengthen your identity.
But there is another reason to be distracted.
The average person speaks 225 words per minute, but we can hear up to 500 words per minute.
Our consciousness is trying to fill 275 words of surplus power.
It certainly takes effort and energy to keep your attention on the other person, but if you can't do that, you won't be having a conversation.
Two people are in the same place, just yelling at each other unrelated words.
We need to listen to each other.
Writer Stephen Covey makes a wonderful statement about this.
"And many people don't listen to you to try to understand.
and are asking to answer".
And there is another rule, and ten of them are "shortly".
[and my sister says, "Good conversation is like a mini skirt, short enough to be interesting but covering the most important thing as long as possible".] (Applause) All of what has been said so far can be summed up in one thing: "to be interested".
I grew up with a very famous grandfather, who was a regular in my home.
A lot of people came to talk to my grandparents and after the guest came home, my mother came and asked, "Do you know who that person is?"
She became the second Miss America.
That guy is the mayor of Sacramento.
She is a winner of the Pulitzer Prize and he is a dancer with the Russian Ballet.
So I thought that everyone had something hidden and something wonderful.
I've come to believe that this is what makes me a good conductor.
I look forward to closing my mouth as much as possible and opening my heart and being impressed with it, never before have I ever been disappointed by it.
Please do the same for all of you.
Go out and talk to people, listen to them, and most importantly, expect to be impressed.
Thank you for listening.
Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, and hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, and hello, hello, hello, and are you are here
I declare to Matthew Williams that I am the champion.
He won a medal in the 3rd Canadian National Games in basketball, participated in a world-class match and had the honor of representing Canada at the World Games.
(Applause) I've been practicing basketball and speed skating five days a week and I've been supported by top-notch coaches and mental performance consultants to do my best at the game.
By the way, this is all about the Special Olympics.
Will that change the way you look at me and my achievements?
The world doesn't always consider people like me champions.
Until recently, people like me were marginalised and out of the public eye.
Although the Special Olympics began in 1968 and have changed dramatically, in too many cases people with intellectual disabilities are invisible to the wider world.
I don't think it's wrong to use discriminatory language in front of me.
They use the word "disappointed" derisively.
So I don't think about how much I or my colleagues will be hurt.
Don't think I'm here to be a target of pity.
I am here because there are still serious problems with the world's view of people with intellectual disabilities, and not because in too many cases, the problem is that nothing is seen.
Did you know that this year there was a World Cup?
I was one of 6,500 athletes with intellectual disabilities who came to LA from 165 countries to compete.
More than 62,000 spectators watched the opening ceremony and sports television broadcasts were broadcast live on Sports TV's TSN and ESPN.
You didn't know about that convention, did you?
What do you think of seeing someone like me?
Is this a challenge to you guys, and will we be seen as equals?
Special Olympics will change the identity of athletes with intellectual disabilities and the values of all those who watch.
And, for the uninitiated, Special Olympics is about athletes with intellectual disabilities.
Paralympic parading is different from the Paralympic Games or the Olympic Games.
High-level sporting competitions are held throughout the year for people with intellectual disabilities, and the lives and values of those involved change.
This changed my life and the lives of so many others.
And the world's eyes on the mentally disabled have changed.
I was born with a cognitive disability.
I played hockey from a very young age until I was 12 years old.
And as I grew older, it became increasingly difficult for me to keep up with everyone, and I was bothersome and annoying.
For a while, I was completely away from sports, with few friends, and saddened by being left behind.
In those days, people with intellectual disabilities were a hidden entity from society.
No one thought they could participate in sports or even be a valuable part of society.
It wasn't until the 1960s that Dr. Frank Hayden, a scientist at the University of Toronto, studied the effect of regular exercise on the motor ability of children with intellectual disabilities.
Using a strictly scientific research method, Dr. Hayden and other researchers concluded that "a child with intellectual disabilities is only less physically able simply because they do not have enough opportunities to participate in sports".
I believe that sports programs and participation in sporting events are beneficial for people with intellectual disabilities.
Not many believed in it, but the pioneers - Dr. Hayden and Special Olympics founder Eunice Kennedy Shriver - did not give up, and the athletes have proven themselves right more than 4.5 million times.
(Applause) Before I entered the Special Olympics, I was nervous because I knew people young and old, and I had no confidence in myself, and I had few friends.
But when I tried, everyone encouraged me and supported me, and I was able to be myself without being seen by others.
I am now a basketball and speed skater who has competed in state and national competitions, and this year I competed in the Summer World Cup in LA. I represented Canada as a member of the first-ever World Cup-ranked Canadian basketball team.
(Applause) I am one of over 4.5 million athletes worldwide, and I have heard a lot of similar stories.
As Special Olympics athletes, we are restoring pride and dignity.
Special Olympics also caters to the health needs of athletes that are critical to their health.
According to research, the average life expectancy of men with intellectual disabilities is 13 years shorter than that of healthy men and 20 years shorter for women.
But at the Special Olympics, you can stay healthy by getting in shape and competing.
The coaching staff also teaches me about nutrition and health.
Special Olympics offers free health diagnostics for athletes with difficulty communicating with doctors or who are unable to access medical care.
At the 2015 Summer World Cup, my team Canada faced off against the Nigerian basketball team.
On the day before the game, the Nigerian team received a health check performed in the hall and seven of the 10 members received a free payment for hearing aids, thanks to which they were born with a clear ear.
(Applause) The players have made a remarkable change.
He was playing more vigorously and enjoying the game with confidence because he was now able to communicate with the coach in a fleshly voice.
And emotions were also high because the sound of a ball was heard, and the sound of a flute and the cheers of the fans standing on the stand, sounds that everyone can hear and understand.
Special Olympics athletes not only compete in the Games but also in the Olympics.
And life outside the arena will change.
According to a survey this year, nearly half of U.S. adults say they have no knowledge of a mental disorder, or even a single one, and 44% of Americans say they have a very low receptivity to it and a very negative view of it.
Furthermore, the high use of discriminatory language in these cases is evidence that people with intellectual disabilities are still invisible to too many people.
Everyone uses it as a light expression or as a slang term.
The word "smarter" has been tweeting more than nine million times last year, but it is a word that deeply hurts me and the 4.5 million athletes around the world.
I don't think everyone is being insulted, but that's wrong.
My colleague John Franklin Stevens, a global messenger, wrote a letter to a political commentator who used discriminatory language to describe people: "One day you'll come to the Special Olympics.
And try to see if you can go home unmotivated".
(ja applause) At the 2015 World Championships this summer, people lined up for hours to watch the final day of the weightlifting competition.
In the middle of everyone's attention, my teammate Jackie Barrett, nicknamed the "Big Deer of Newfoundland", lifted 297kg in the deadlift and 277kg in the squat - (Applause) significantly updating the Special Olympics record.
Jackie is the record holder for the Newfoundland Island heavyweight title, and is among the all-time heavyweight athletes at the Special Olympics.
He became a big star in LA and ESPN tweeted his new record live, impressed by Jackie's performance.
Almost 50 years ago, almost no one thought that an intellectually disabled person could do such a thing.
This year, 60,000 spectators filled the famous LA Memorial Coliseum to watch the opening ceremony of the World Championships and to support athletes from 165 countries around the world.
We were honored with the support of the people, not as hidden beings.
Special Olympics teach athletes to be confident and proud.
And the world's people are learning that people with intellectual disabilities deserve respect and acceptance.
(Applause) I have accomplished and dream of competing, have a great coach, have respect and dignity, and am now looking to become a healthier and more successful personal trainer.
(Applause) I am no longer a hiding place or a bully, and I am giving a TED talk here.
(Applause) The world has changed thanks to the Special Olympics, but there is still a long way to go.
The next time you see someone with a mental disability, I want you to show that person's abilities.
And if you see someone who uses discriminatory language, I want you to show them how bad the word is.
And I want you to think about participating in the Special Olympics.
(ja applause) To conclude, I would like to say one more word.
As Nelson Mandela said, "Sports have the power to change the world".
Special Olympics are changing the world, and 4.5 million athletes are being reborn, given a place to be confident, made friends, unprejudiced, and feel like champions, and become true champions.
Thank you very much.
Kenema, Sierra Leone, Alara, Nigeria, have you ever heard of such a place name?
That is the most remarkably rare place for me.
In the local hospital, nurses, doctors, scientists have quietly fought for years against one of mankind's most formidable enemies, the virus of the Raspberry Pi.
The Lassaja virus is very similar to the Ebola virus.
It causes high fever and sometimes even kills.
But they are protecting us all by protecting the people of the local community while putting their lives at risk every day.
But when I visited many years ago, the most surprising thing was that they started singing every morning, every day, in the very rough first line.
Everyone gathered together to express joy.
And show their vitality.
Over the years, we've been visiting each other, meeting with everyone, singing and making songs, and it's really fun because we're not just there to pursue science, but we're connected by human love.
I think you can imagine that as the situation changes, it becomes something very important and indispensable.
That changed dramatically in March 2014, when an Ebola outbreak was declared in Guinea.
This was the first outbreak in West Africa, near the border of Sierra Leone and Liberia.
We are afraid of the...
In fact, for a while, Lassa and Ebola were more contagious than expected and thought they might reach Kenema one day.
So my team members immediately acted and joined Dr. Hummer Kahn's team, where they prepared a highly sensitive virus RNA detector to detect Ebola when it crossed the border and reached Sierra Leone.
Already using such a device against the Rassaja virus, the team knew the procedure and were very good at it.
They should have only provided them with tools and a place to test Ebola.
But unfortunately, that day came.
On May 23, 2014, a woman was admitted to the hospital's maternity ward and a team of researchers tested for viral RNA, confirming the first case of Ebola fever in Sierra Leone.
Their work was extremely fine.
The JAJ immediately identified the case and began a contact tracking investigation to make sure the patient was treated safely.
This may have prevented the spread of the infection early.
But by that time, the outbreak had already been going on for months.
Hundreds of cases have occurred, outpacing previous outbreaks.
When we reached Sierra Leone, it was not just another case, but a tsunami.
To combat the infection, we worked with the international community, the Ministry of Health and the Office of Kenema, and the following week 31 cases and 92 to 147 cases were reported, all of which were transferred to Kenema, as Sierra Leone has limited facilities for the treatment of the disease.
We did our best to save patients 24 hours a day, and then did another simple thing.
The patient's blood sample, which had been collected to detect Ebola, was of course disposed of, and it was fortunate that it was discarded.
Instead, he used drugs to deactivate the virus, packed blood samples into boxes and sent them across the ocean to other research facilities.
I sent my team to Boston, where I already have a team.
Then he continued working day and night, working daily shifts, and quickly analyzed the genomes of 99 Ebola viruses.
And the genome of the virus is a blueprint of it.
The genome is a person's property.
It represents the nature of all that makes up us and contains a wealth of information.
The results of such work are simple yet powerful.
By observing and comparing the 99 viruses and the three genomes previously published in Guinea, we were able to understand that the outbreak began in Guinea months ago, first after infection in humans and then spread through human mediums.
This is very important to understand how to intervene, but it is important to follow up on contacts.
We also confirmed that the virus varies as it infects humans.
It is very important to observe each of these variants because diagnostic machines, vaccines, treatments, etc. are all basically arranged based on a genome sequence.
International health experts need to respond to this and to continue to adjust all the results so far.
At the time, my job as a scientist was to first store data in my hands, then spend months or months in the lab, carefully analyzing the data, and repeatedly interacting to publish a paper.
This is the current state of the scientific research flow.
But couldn't you have done that?
And what my friends were at the forefront of, and very clearly knew, was that I needed help, and I needed a lot of help.
So the first thing I did was read the genomic sequence and immediately posted it on the website.
I simply sent the data to the world and said, "Please help me".
And then help came.
Soon, I was surprised to see that the data was being published and contacts were received from people all over the world.
The world's most successful virus tracking team suddenly joined us.
We started working with virtual, and we continued to communicate by phone and email, and we decided to track the virus and figure out how to stop the spread of the virus.
There are many ways to build a community for something like this.
Especially when the outbreak began to spread worldwide, everyone actively investigated, participated and helped.
I hope everyone wants to get involved.
The capabilities of such people around the world are truly amazing, and the Internet connects us all.
So imagine that instead of seeing each other as a threat and avoiding each other, everyone is "let's do this".
"And let's work together to solve this".
The problem was that the data we all used was limited and insufficient to find only on the Internet.
At that time, so many possibilities and opportunities are lost.
At the beginning of the Kenjaema infectious disease epidemic, 106 cards were assembled and were to be released worldwide.
And our laboratory has proven that by using a computer-based learning system from 106 of those cases, we can predict the prognosis of Ebola patients with almost 100% accuracy, and provide it to healthcare professionals working on the ground.
We created an app to provide, but to prove that the app is effective enough to do so.
In 106 cases, there was not enough data to wait for even more data to come out before the release.
But the data did not come in handy.
Everyone was researching, thinking and waiting for each other, but they were all trapped in a silo and didn't use their cooperation.
But this is not going to happen.
You all think so, don't you?
Our lives are at stake.
In fact, many lives were lost. Health care professionals and my dear colleagues also included five: Bar Foney, Alex Mogboy, Dr. Hummer Khan, Alice Koboma, and Mohamed Fuller.
They are five of the many healthcare workers who have died in Kenema and its surroundings, and while the world was waiting for us, we were quietly working on the mess.
Ebola bleeding, like its threat to humanity, increases suspicion and tension in the heart and legs.
When we build walls and fight each other, the virus becomes more powerful.
But unlike other natural threats, the fight against Ebola is equally relevant to all of us.
We are already fighting together.
If someone is infected with Ebola, they may quickly spread to others.
Now that our lives are equally fragile, with the same vitality, with the same fears and hopes, I hope we can cooperate joyfully together in such a situation.
One of the graduate students who was mentored by Kenema read a book about Sierra Leone and learned that the name "Kenema", the name of the city where we work, actually means "clear as a river, transparent to the eyes of all".
I felt the deepest sense of it because before I knew it, we always respected the Kenema people, shared information and worked together in an open environment.
That's what's important.
Because when an outbreak occurs, we are required to share information without hiding it from ourselves or anyone around us in order to fight it together.
This is never the first Ebola outbreak, nor is it the last, and there are still many microorganisms lurking in the area, such as the Lassavirus.
And the next time a pandemic occurs, it could be in a big city with millions of people.
It could be a virus that infects the air.
The virus may be deliberately spread.
This is a very scary thing, of course, but at the same time, what this experience has taught us is that we have the technology and the ability to overcome it: to win and stand out in the battle against viral infections.
But that will be possible only if we work together and do so with joy.
Dr. Khan, who died fighting infectious diseases, and the people who lost their lives on the front lines, have always fought with us, and we will continue to fight with them.
Let us work together with billions of warmhearted and compassionate people to help the world shine a light on the world so that the world is not turned upside down by a single virus.
Thank you very much.
