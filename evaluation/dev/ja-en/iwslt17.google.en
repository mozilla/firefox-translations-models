This is the story of how we acquire knowledge.
The main character of the story is this woman, Natalia Rybczynski.
I&#39;m a paleontologist who specializes in digging up ancient carcasses.
Natalia Rybczynski: People used to call me &quot;Dr. Corpse.&quot;
Latif Nasser: I thought it was particularly interesting because the excavation site is in the remote Canadian tundra, far north of the Arctic Circle.
One day in the summer of 2006, she was at an excavation site called File&#39;s Reef Bed, less than 10 degrees latitude from the magnetic north pole.
Natalia: You might think it&#39;s boring, because you&#39;re walking around all day with a backpack on your back, a GPS and a notebook, picking up what looks like fossils.
Latif: One day she realized something.
Natalia: An old, reddish-brown, palm-sized thing.
It was on the ground.
Latif: At first I thought it was just a piece of wood, because fragments of ancient plants are often found in File&#39;s Reef Bed.
However, when I returned to camp that night...
Natalia: When I got out my magnifying glass and looked a little closer, I saw that there were no annual rings.
This may be due to the state of preservation, but the more I look at it, the more I see it.
It was a bone
Latif: She returned to this site many times over the next four years, and ended up collecting 30 identical bone fragments, most of them very small.
Natalia: There aren&#39;t that many. They can fit into a small plastic bag.
Latif: I tried to put the pieces together like a puzzle.
It was really hard work
Natalia: It was cracked and shattered, so I tried using sand and putty, but it didn&#39;t work.
So I ended up using a 3D scanner.
Latif: That&#39;s amazing! Natalia: Right?
Latif: It&#39;s much easier to work on a screen.
Natalia: I was a little impressed when it all came together.
Latif: How confident were you that you assembled it correctly?
Is it possible that it would turn out differently if I put it together differently? Was it actually a parakeet?
Natalia: No, definitely.
Latif: What she discovered was a tibia, a leg bone, that belonged to an artiodactyl, a member of the cow and sheep family.
However, this bone could not have been from a cow or sheep.
It was too big.
Natalia: It was extra large. It&#39;s a really big animal.
Latif: What kind of animal was it?
Stuck, she showed one of the bone fragments to a colleague in Colorado, and that&#39;s when she had an idea.
Natalia: When we sawed into the ends of the bones, there was a distinct smell.
Latif: It smells like burnt meat.
It was the same smell that Natalia smelled in the creepy autopsy room when she cut open the skull: collagen.
Collagen plays a role in maintaining bone structure
It usually decomposes over time, but
In this case, the Arctic climate acted as a natural refrigerator for preservation.
A year or two later, when Natalia was attending a conference in Bristol, a fellow academic named Mike Buckley was demonstrating a new process called ``collagen identification.&#39;&#39;
Every animal has a slightly different collagen structure, so if we can characterize the collagen in an unknown bone, we can compare it with that of an animal we already know about, and maybe even identify it.
So I sent a piece of bone by courier.
Natalia: I wanted to track it down because it&#39;s important.
Latif: He processed bone fragments and compared them to 37 modern mammals.
Found matching animal
Who is the owner of the 3.5 million-year-old bones that Natalia unearthed in the high Arctic?
It was a camel
Natalia: I thought, &quot;Huh?&quot; If it&#39;s true, that&#39;s amazing.
Latif: We tested many bone fragments, and they all gave the same results.
However, judging from the size of the bones discovered, this camel was 30% larger than the one we see today.
It was approximately 2.7 meters tall and weighed approximately 1 ton.
that&#39;s right
What Natalia discovered was a ``giant arctic camel.&#39;&#39;
When you hear the word camel, what comes to mind is the Bactrian camel, which lives in East and Central Asia?
The postcard image in my head is probably this dromedary. When you think of desert creatures, this is it. It lives in the hot deserts of the Middle East and the Sahara, stores water in a large hump on its back for long journeys through the desert, and uses its big, wide legs to crawl through the dunes. I will step forward and move forward
So how did such an animal end up in the Arctic Circle in northern Canada?
In fact, scientists have known for a long time, even before Natalia&#39;s discovery, that camels originate from America.
I was born here.
Camels have been around for about 45 million years, and for almost 40 million of those years, they lived only in North America, and there were about 20 species, maybe more.
Latif: If you put them all side by side, could you tell the difference?
Natalia: Yes, body sizes vary.
Some species had very long necks, probably similar to those of giraffes.
Latif: There were some that looked like crocodiles.
Natalia: Early primitive camels were very small, about the size of a rabbit.
Latif: Huh? Is it a rabbit-sized camel?
Natalia: It&#39;s an early type.
You wouldn&#39;t know it even if you looked at it.
Latif: I would like to raise rabbits and camels.
Natalia: Yeah, it&#39;s definitely great.
Latif: Then, between three and seven million years ago, herds of camels descended into South America and became llamas and alpacas, and other species crossed the Bering Land Bridge and went to Asia and Africa.
Camels in North America became extinct at the end of the last ice age.
This is what we already know, but it doesn&#39;t completely explain why it was discovered so far north.
For example, in terms of temperature, it&#39;s the exact opposite of the Sahara Desert.
Indeed, temperatures 3.5 million years ago were on average 22 degrees warmer than today.
So it may have been a coniferous forest, similar to what is now the Yukon River Valley or Siberia.
But even then, winter would continue for six months and the pond would freeze over.
If there is a blizzard
There were times when darkness lasted 24 hours a day.
So what&#39;s the whole thing?
How did this Saharan desert superstar survive the arctic climate?
Natalia and her fellow scholars think they&#39;ve found the answer.
And that&#39;s a great answer
What if the camel traits that we used to think were adapted to places like the Sahara desert actually evolved to help them survive winter?
What if our wide feet weren&#39;t meant for walking on sand, but instead on snow, like snowshoes?
The hump on your back, which I didn&#39;t know and was surprised to know, is filled with fat instead of water. What if that hump helps you survive six months of winter when food is scarce?
What if, some time later, after crossing the overpass, we could use our winter-friendly traits to adapt to the hot desert environment?
For example, humps may be useful in hot climates, because if you store all your body fat in one place, like a backpack, you don&#39;t have to cover your entire body with fat that acts as an insulator.
This will make it easier to dissipate the heat.
With this extraordinary idea, what was thought to be prime evidence of desert adaptation could actually be evidence that they once lived in the high-latitude Arctic.
I&#39;m not the first person to tell this story.
Others have used this story to illustrate the wonders of evolutionary biology and help us understand future climate change.
But the reason why I like this story is different.
For me, this is a story about ourselves, our worldview, and how it changes.
I was trained as a historian.
What we&#39;ve learned is that scientists are also, for the most part, historians.
They also try to understand the past
We talk about the history of the universe, planets, and life on Earth.
And as a historian, you start by thinking about how the story will unfold.
Natalia: We create stories and stick to them, like the story of the camel in the desert.
It&#39;s a very well-written story, and the camel is perfectly adapted.
I&#39;ve been in the desert forever
Latif: But maybe someday we&#39;ll find some small piece of evidence.
Understanding the little things can help you reframe everything you believed.
Such is the case here: A scientist&#39;s discovery of a wood-like fossil led science to come up with an entirely new and unconventional hypothesis for why this creature straight out of a Dr. Seuss picture book looks the way it does. is
The way I think about camels has completely changed.
The view changed from seeing them as extremely special animals that can only adapt to a specific environment, such as the desert, to seeing them as animals that happen to live in the Sahara Desert, but can actually live anywhere in the world.
(Applause) This is Azzurri.
Hello Azzurri Hello
Hey, let&#39;s eat
The Azzurri usually perform at Radio City Music Hall.
It&#39;s not a joke
Now, this Azzurri is living proof that the stories we tell about our world are dynamic.
We have to reframe and reimagine our stories.
Isn&#39;t that so? Azzurri
There&#39;s a new way of seeing the world on the other side of a single piece of bone.
thank you
Modern computers are so good that we don&#39;t even realize how bad they are.
Today, I would like to talk about this issue and how it can be &quot;repaired&quot; using neuroscience.
That frosty night in Harlem in 2011 had a profound impact on me.
At a bar outside Columbia University, where I studied computer science and neuroscience, I was having a meaningful conversation with a fellow student about the power of holograms, which will one day replace computers.
As our conversation reached its climax, his smartphone lit up.
He pulled out his phone, looked at it, and started typing.
Then she looked up at me with just her eyes and said, ``Continue listening.&#39;&#39;
But of course, his gaze went blank, and the moment lost its meaning.
At that moment, across the bar, another student had a smartphone and held it up to a group of friends.
They were laughing out loud as I swiped through my Instagram photos.
I started thinking about how they were happy with the same technology while I was dissatisfied with it.
As I thought about it, I realized that the &quot;bad guy&quot; wasn&#39;t the digital information itself; it was simply the display device that separated me from my friends, while also bringing them together.
They bonded around something, much like our ancestors who developed social cognition by telling stories around a campfire, and I think that&#39;s what this tool is for.
It should be an extension of the body&#39;s functions.
The opposite is happening with today&#39;s computers.
When you&#39;re texting your wife, composing a symphony, or comforting a friend, you&#39;re doing exactly the same thing.
I&#39;m bending over and manipulating this endless array of square icons and menu buttons.
I think this is wrong, and I think we can start using much more natural machines.
We should use machines that bring these tasks back into the real world.
By applying neuroscience principles, we should use machines that expand rather than limit perception.
Now, I brought such a machine here.
This is &quot;Meta 2&quot;
Let&#39;s try it
Right now, I can see you all in front of me, and I can also see my hands.
So 3, 2, 1, you&#39;re about to enter an immersive hologram experience, where a very realistic hologram is floating right in front of my eyes, right in front of the headset I&#39;m wearing.
Of course, what you&#39;re looking at could be a product you&#39;re shopping for, or it could be a learning material, and you can use your hands to precisely control and manipulate it.
Iron Man would be proud.
I&#39;ll show you this again shortly.
(Applause) If you think like me, you&#39;re excited to think about the possibilities of what we can do with this kind of technology. So let&#39;s take a look at some of them.
My mother is an architect, so the natural idea that came to me was to create a three-dimensional blueprint for a building instead of a two-dimensional drawing.
My mother is currently using the video to choose the interior decor.
This was all shot through the headgear using a GoPro camera.
This next use case is a very personal one: the Glass Brain project, courtesy of Professor Adam Gazzaley at the University of California, San Francisco.
As a neuroscience student, I always dreamed of learning and remembering using a machine that would allow me to touch and manipulate these diverse and complex brain structures.
What we&#39;re looking at now is augmented reality, but it&#39;s part of a much larger idea: how digital devices can augment our physical capabilities, instead of limiting them.
here we go…
I think humanity will reach a turning point in the next few years.
All digital information will begin to be expressed in the real world.
Just imagine for a moment that this is a storyteller, a painter, a neurosurgeon, an interior designer, and what does this mean for us here?
What we need to do as a community is to imagine how we can create new realities that extend the human experience, and not just gamify reality or clutter it up with digital information. is to
I&#39;m very passionate about this.
Now, I&#39;ll let you in on a little secret.
In about five years, this is not a small device, but in about five years, all of these things will be like thin glasses that project holograms.
When we choose a smartphone, we tend to focus less on the hardware and more on the basic software, but as a neuroscientist, I&#39;ve always dreamed of creating an &quot;iOS for the mind,&quot; so to speak.
Getting this right is extremely important, because we may end up spending at least as much time with these systems as we do with Windows screen interfaces.
I don&#39;t know about you, but living inside Windows is scary.
We used neuroscience as the core of our design to come up with the most intuitive interface out of all possibilities, instead of forcing designers to argue in boardrooms.
And the principle at the heart of this is something called the &quot;neural pathway of least resistance.&quot;
Constantly connecting the ``iOS of the mind&#39;&#39; to the human brain - for the first time, the human brain controls the iOS.
In other words, we&#39;re trying to build a computer that you don&#39;t have to learn how to use.
We are creating a system that allows users to naturally understand how to use it.
Here are the three main principles we used to create a brand new design for user experience:
The most important thing is that &quot;the user is the OS&quot;
Traditional file systems are complex and abstract, and it takes a lot of brain work to even understand them.
It&#39;s doing the opposite of the &quot;neural pathway of least resistance.&quot;
But in augmented reality, if you put a hologram TED panel here, and you put the hologram email on the other side of the desk, your spatial memory adapts to this, and you can reach out and retrieve the information.
I can hologram anything from the Tesla car I want to buy to anything my legal team requests from me before I go on stage.
Okay, now your brain knows how to retrieve information.
The second guideline for interfaces is ``see and touch.&#39;&#39;
What&#39;s the first thing your baby does when she sees something that interests her?
I try to reach out and touch it
This is how a &quot;natural machine&quot; should work.
The visual system receives its basic stimulation from something called proprioception, a sensation that occurs deep within the body.
So by touching the work directly, you not only have better control over it, but you can also understand it more deeply.
That&#39;s why we &quot;see and touch&quot;
But this alone is not enough for the experience.
Humans are primates, social creatures by nature.
That brings us to the third guideline, which is the holographic version of the bonfire example from earlier.
The primate mirror neuron subsystem shows that if we can see each other&#39;s faces and hands three-dimensionally, we can better coordinate and work together.
If you watch the video behind me, two Meta users working with the same hologram, looking at each other without being distracted by the device, and connected through this object.
Now, let&#39;s try this again with neuroscience in mind.
Our favorite “iOS of the heart”
Let&#39;s take this one step further and pick up this headset and put it in this spot next to my desk.
I&#39;m here with you right now, and in this moment we&#39;re all connected.
My spatial memory kicks in, and when I grab the headset and take it back, I realize that I&#39;m the OS.
And then my proprioceptive sense kicks in and I disassemble this headset into thousands of parts and touch the sensor that scans my hand.
But seeing this on my own isn&#39;t enough, so now my co-founder, Ray, is going to call me in 3D shortly - Ray?
(Ring tone) Hey Ray, how are you?
Everyone, I can see him in three dimensions right in front of me.
As realistic as a photo
(Applause) Thank you.
My mirror neuron system tells me that this will soon replace the cell phone.
Ray, how are you doing?
Okay, we&#39;re having a live conversation right now.
(Applause) Ray, let me show you the hologram brain that I saw in the video earlier.
Ladies and gentlemen, this isn&#39;t just going to change the phone, it&#39;s going to change the way we work together.
thank you
Ray thank you
you&#39;re welcome.
(Applause) This is the message I found in that bar in 2011: The future of computing is not confined to flat screens.
It&#39;s here inside us.
(Applause) If I could choose just one idea and leave you with one idea today, it would be that &quot;natural machines&quot; are not some invention of the future; they are here now in 2016.
So by TED2017, all 100 people working at Meta - administrative staff, management, designers, and engineers - will have thrown away their monitor screens and are using truly &quot;natural machines.&quot;
thank you
(Thank you for applause
thank you
(Chris Anderson) So let me ask you this: There have been several demonstrations of augmented reality over the past few years.
There is sometimes a debate among engineers as to whether they are seeing the real thing on a big screen.
There was also a point about the field of view, where the demo gave a wider field of view than what you would see when you put on the actual headset.
Is that the actual video you showed me?
Of course it&#39;s real
Not only that, but when I created the video I showed you, I was especially creative and shot it through the lens of a GoPro camera.
We wanted everyone to have a simulated experience of the real thing that they see through the headgear.
Thank you for introducing it to me
thank you
I&#39;m from the most liberal, tolerant, progressive place in all of America - Seattle, Washington.
I grew up in a wonderful Seattle family.
My mother is an artist and my father is a university professor, and I&#39;m very grateful for the environment in which I grew up, because I was always able to freely decide how I wanted to live my life.
I actually didn&#39;t follow the path that my parents had envisioned for me.
Dropped out of college when I was 19 - I don&#39;t care if you dropped out or dropped out.
And I started touring all over the place as a professional horn player, which was something I had always dreamed of doing.
He toured all over the United States and Europe playing chamber music, and for several years worked with Charlie Byrd, a great jazz guitar player.
By the end of his 20s, he was a member of Spain&#39;s Barcelona Symphony Orchestra.
What a good life
My parents never complained
He supported me all the time.
It wasn&#39;t their ideal.
She told neighbors and friends, ``My son is on a gap year -- about 10 years.&#39;&#39;
But, I did have one awkward conversation about my lifestyle, so let me tell you about it.
I was 27 years old, on my way home from Barcelona, home for Christmas, and my mom and I were cooking in the kitchen, just the two of us.
My mother has become silent, too silent.
I thought something was wrong
“Mom, what are you thinking?” I asked.
My mother said, ``We&#39;re really worried about you.&#39;&#39;
“What do you mean?” I wondered what it meant now.
&quot;Be absolutely honest with me — you don&#39;t vote Republican, right?&quot;
Now, the truth is, I was just a horn player who wasn&#39;t that interested in politics.
I realized something, and when my parents realized it, they were a little confused.
I had become an ardent supporter of capitalism, and I&#39;ll tell you how that happened.
It comes from something that I&#39;ve always been interested in, which may come as a surprise, but it&#39;s poverty.
As a child in Seattle, I remember seeing real poverty for the first time.
My family was lower middle class, but of course we weren&#39;t really poor.
It was far from
The first time I saw poverty and poverty was in the early &#39;70s, when I was six or seven years old.
It was a normal, ordinary experience like everyone else&#39;s.
This is a picture in National Geographic of a kid my age from East Africa, his face covered in flies and his belly swollen.
It was clear that I couldn&#39;t survive, but there was nothing I could do.
Some of you may remember that photo, even if it&#39;s not the same photo, but something similar.
This is a photo that showed Western countries the picture of poverty that continues to plague the world.
That picture was burned into my eyes. Even as I grew up, went to school, dropped out, went back to school, and started a family, I still couldn&#39;t forget it.
I was wondering what happened to that child.
I wonder what happened to people like that child all over the world.
So I started researching, and even though I wasn&#39;t in college at the time, I was looking for answers: What happens to the people in the world&#39;s most poverty-stricken areas?
Has it gotten worse? Has it improved? What happened?
I found the answer and it changed my life, and I&#39;m going to share it with you.
Now, most Americans think that poverty has gotten worse than it did when they were kids -- when that photo was taken.
If you ask Americans whether global poverty has gotten worse or better, 70% will say that hunger has gotten worse since the early &#39;70s.
Let me tell you the truth.
This is the enlightenment that changed my worldview.
Between 1970 and today, the proportion of the world&#39;s population living in hunger - people living on less than a dollar a day - adjusting for inflation, of course - has declined by 80%. did
The world&#39;s worst poverty is 80% lower than it was when I was a child.
I didn&#39;t even know that
Everyone, this is a miracle.
it&#39;s something to be happy about
This is the greatest achievement in human history in fighting poverty, and it happened in our generation.
(Applause) When I learned this, the question came to mind: What helped us achieve this?
If you don&#39;t know why it happened, you can&#39;t reproduce it.
If we could recreate this and lift another two billion people out of poverty, because that&#39;s what we&#39;re talking about, from my childhood until now, two billion of our brothers and sisters, the Biblical &quot;little ones,&quot; would be lifted out of poverty. I&#39;m getting out
I want to know so I can save another 2 billion people.
So I started looking for answers
Politics had nothing to do with the answer, it didn&#39;t matter to me.
I&#39;m still not interested
I wanted the best answers from mainstream economists, whether they were on the right, left or center.
tell me the answer
There are 5 success factors
To date, two billion of our brothers and sisters around the world have been lifted out of poverty.
The first is globalization
The second is free trade
The third is property rights.
The fourth is the rule of law.
The fifth is starting a business.
Since the 1970s, the world has become a free enterprise system, and this has become possible. Since the 1970s, the world has become a free enterprise system, and this has become possible.
But I&#39;m not simple either.
We know that free enterprise is not perfect, and we know that we need more than free enterprise to build a better world.
But it&#39;s amazing
This is an issue that goes beyond politics.
What I learned and what I realized
Capitalism is about more than just the accumulation of wealth.
The best thing about capitalism is that it has ambition, and a lot of people talk about ambition on this stage, and it&#39;s ambition that comes from desire, and it&#39;s deeply tied to the free enterprise system.
We must spread this aspiration even further.
Now, let me tell you about the second enlightenment, which is related to the first one, and which brings about progress, not just around the world, but here in this city. is what brings about
Of all the quotes I&#39;ve ever heard, the one that best sums up the idea of poverty alleviation that I just talked about is this: ``No system in human history has created more wealth than the free market.&#39;&#39;
It has lifted billions of people out of poverty.&quot;
Who said those words?
Sounds like Milton Friedman or Ronald Reagan.
wrong
This is President Barack Obama.
Why can you say it out loud?
Because I was told it directly
you won&#39;t believe it
What came out of my mouth was &quot;Banzai!&quot;
And on top of that, I thought, ``What an amazing opportunity.&#39;&#39;
You know what I was thinking?
In May 2015, during an event on this topic at Georgetown University.
I thought this was the solution to the biggest problem facing America. What?
Whether you&#39;re a liberal or a conservative, it&#39;s about reaching out to those who need us most, believing that free markets are the solution to poverty.
You probably don&#39;t have to tell me that the crisis in America and around the world is because of political polarization.
We have now reached a critical situation.
This is an unpleasant situation. This shouldn&#39;t happen.
Last year, a paper was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the most prestigious scientific journal published in the West, the most prestigious scientific journal published in the Western world.
In my 2014 paper, the topic was ``Asymmetry of Political Motivation.&#39;&#39;
What this means is that, as psychologists define it, your own ideology is born of love, but your enemy&#39;s worldview is born of hate.
common in world conflicts
For example, we see this phenomenon between Palestinians and Israelis.
What the authors of this paper discovered: In America today, a large majority of people, both Republicans and Democrats, are suffering from an asymmetric mindset of political motivation.
The vast majority of politically engaged people in America today believe that they are driven by love and their opponents are driven by hate.
Please think about it
Most people think, ``My ideology is based on very basic tolerance, and I want to help people, and these other people are the bad guys trying to get me.&#39;&#39;
As long as we have these kinds of asymmetries, we can&#39;t move forward as a society.
It&#39;s impossible
So what&#39;s the solution?
Let&#39;s be honest first, it&#39;s normal to have differences.
Don&#39;t underestimate the differences: It&#39;s not that simple.
There&#39;s a lot of good research on this.
My friend Jonathan Haidt, a veteran TED speaker,
I&#39;m a professor of psychology at New York University.
We study the differences in ideology, values, and morals of various people.
He says, for example, conservatives and liberals have very different views on what&#39;s important.
For example, according to Haidt, 59% more liberals are concerned about poverty than are concerned about economic freedom.
Among conservatives, 28% more people say economic freedom is important than people who care about poverty.
This difference does not seem to be narrowing.
Are you saying we can never get along? That&#39;s wrong
This is diversity, and this is where our strength lies.
Do you remember what saved the poor?
The obsession with poverty spread throughout the world through the means of free economics.
So we need each other, if we want to lift the next two billion people out of poverty and help them.
there is no other way
Now
How can we achieve this?
It&#39;s difficult, isn&#39;t it?
requires innovative thinking
There are many on this platform
Social entrepreneurship—yes, it&#39;s definitely the best.
We need sustainable, ethical, ethical and responsible overseas investment.
Exactly! But what do you really need?
It&#39;s a new world with flexible ideologies.
We need more surprises
Right?
Have you ever felt like your ideology has become too conventional?
Does it sound kind of commonplace?
Do you feel like you only listen to people who have the same opinion as you?
Why is this dangerous?
Because when you talk about the economy in this country, you have conservatives on the right who just talk about taxes and regulation and big government.
On the left, there are liberals, and when they talk about the economy, they&#39;re always talking about income inequality.
Both are important, both to me and to you.
This gets in the way when it comes to lifting people out of poverty who are hungry and in need today.
We should use the best tools at our disposal to work together on the best way to alleviate poverty.For conservatives, it&#39;s liberals and their obsession with poverty; for liberals, it&#39;s conservatives. This is possible only when we both recognize that we need people and their commitment to free markets.
This diversity, if we embrace it, will become one of America&#39;s strengths in the future.
So how can we make this happen together?
I need a list of activities, not just for you, but for myself.
Number 1 - Item 1. Please remember that it is not enough to just tolerate people who have different opinions.
That&#39;s not enough
We need to remember that we need people who disagree with us, because there are people who are still waiting for these tools that our diversity can provide.
Now, what should I do? How should I tell you?
Where does it start? Here it is.
All of us in this room, we are blessed.
I&#39;m blessed to have people who listen.
Blessed with success and leadership
If you talk about an ideology you don&#39;t even think about, they might listen.
Progress may begin from there.
That&#39;s the first one, then the second one.
There&#39;s a certain type of person that I want you to be, and I want to be like, especially someone who can blur the lines, someone who is indifferent and difficult to fit into a mold.
If you&#39;re a conservative, you&#39;re a conservative who always talks about poverty, you talk about your moral obligation to fight for the poor.
If you&#39;re a liberal, you&#39;re a liberal who always talks about the virtues of free markets, when used responsibly, to solve our problems.
This will accomplish two things.
One, we can start helping the next two billion people, and we can continue to work on the solutions we need in the future, as we&#39;ve seen so many times in the past.
Two, we can turn the horrifying and sacrosanct ideological battle that we&#39;re experiencing in this country into a competition of ideas based on a sense of solidarity and mutual respect. can be turned into a competition of ideas based on
And then maybe, just maybe, we&#39;ll realize that the big differences that we think are not so big after all.
thank you
In college, I majored in politics, so I had to write a lot of reports.
When an average student writes a report, the amount of work will probably be distributed like this.
This way, it&#39;s slow at first, but you can make enough progress in the first week, and then the second half is a bit more demanding, but still orderly.
I would like to do it like that too.
As planned
I plan to start working on it right away, but when it comes to actually writing the report, it ends up looking like this in my case.
This happens every time
Then I had to write a 90-page thesis, which I had to spend a year writing.
I knew that business as usual wouldn&#39;t work.
Too big
So I made a plan and decided to do it like this.
This is a one year plan.
It starts out light, rises a little in the middle, and has a spurt towards the end, like a gentle staircase.
going up these stairs
It won&#39;t be difficult
But something strange happened.
the first few months
It came and went, but nothing could be done.
So the plan changes to:
And then -- the middle period went by, and I couldn&#39;t write, and I was like this.
Two more months turned into one month, which turned into two more weeks.
I woke up one morning, and the deadline was only three days away. I hadn&#39;t written a word yet, and I had no choice. I had to write a 90-page paper in 72 hours, and I stayed up two nights in a row. The human body is designed to do that. I didn&#39;t finish it, but I raced across campus as fast as I could, and time turned into slow motion, and I submitted it at the deadline.
I thought it was all over then.
A week later, I got a call from the university.
&quot;Is that Tim Urban?&quot;
&quot;yes&quot;
&quot;I would like to talk to you about the paper you submitted.&quot;
“Yes.”
Then he said, ``I&#39;ve never seen such a wonderful graduation thesis.&#39;&#39;
nothing happened
That was an absolutely terrible article.
I just wanted everyone to think, ``Isn&#39;t this person a genius?&#39;&#39; even if it was only for a moment.
This is an absolutely terrible article
Currently I am a writer
I write a blog called ``Wait But Why.&#39;&#39;
About two years ago, I decided to write about procrastination.
My behavior was always confusing to those around me, so I wondered what was going on in a procrastinator&#39;s head and why we were the way we were.
I wanted to explain this to people who aren&#39;t procrastinators. I thought there must be a difference between the brains of procrastinators and the brains of non-procrastinators.
To find out, I decided to find a place that would do MRIs of my brain and the brains of people who were definitely not procrastinators, and compare them.
I&#39;m bringing the results here today.
I want you to pay attention and see if you can tell the difference.
It&#39;s a hard difference to understand unless you&#39;re a brain expert, but just take a look.
This is the brain of someone who is not a procrastinator.
[Rational decision maker] In response to this
My brain —
[Monkey who wants an immediate reward] This is the difference between the two.
Both brains have a &quot;rational decision maker,&quot; but the procrastinator&#39;s brain has an additional &quot;monkey that wants an immediate reward.&quot;
How does this relate to procrastination?
All is well until this happens.
&quot;I think I should do some work.&quot; &quot;No way.&quot; A rational decision maker makes a rational decision to do something productive, but the monkey doesn&#39;t like it, so he takes control. And they say, ``Okay, let&#39;s read the Wikipedia article about the Nancy Kerrigan and Tonya Harding incident, because I remember that happening.&#39;&#39;
And then — I have to go check the fridge and see if anything has changed since the last 10 minutes.
After that, a YouTube spiral awaits, starting with a video of Richard Feynman talking about magnets and ending much later with an interview with Justin Bieber&#39;s mom.
I&#39;m sorry, but I&#39;ve got my hands full for the time being.
There&#39;s no room for work.&quot;
What&#39;s happening?
Monkeys are not the people you want at the helm.
I live only in the present moment
I have no memories of the past, no knowledge of the future, and I only care about two things: ease and fun.
There&#39;s nothing wrong with that in the animal world.
If you&#39;re a dog, spending your time doing only things that are easy and fun would be a very successful way of life.
To monkeys, humans are just another type of animal.
It may have been fine when we lived in primitive times, when all we had to do was eat well, sleep well, and produce the next generation.
It&#39;s not like we&#39;re living a primitive life now.
We live in an advanced civilization, but monkeys don&#39;t know what it is.
That&#39;s why we have an extra &quot;rational decision maker&quot; in our brains, giving us abilities not found in other animals.
we imagine the future
can see the big picture
You can make long-term plans
A rational decision maker takes everything into account.
I&#39;m trying to get you to do what you need to do now.
Sometimes it makes sense to do something easy and fun, like at dinner, when you go to bed, or during your leisure time.
There is some overlap between the two
Sometimes we agree
But in the grand scheme of things, sometimes it makes sense to do something that&#39;s difficult and not very fun.
That&#39;s when conflicts arise
If you&#39;re a procrastinator, this conflict always tends to end in one way, and you end up spending a lot of your time in the orange area, which is the easy, fun thing that doesn&#39;t make sense to do.
I call this realm the &quot;Dark Playground.&quot;
The dark playground — a place all procrastinators know all too well.
This is where you&#39;ll end up playing when you&#39;re not playing.
Fun in the dark playground isn&#39;t actually fun, it&#39;s fun you shouldn&#39;t have, and it&#39;s filled with the familiar feelings of procrastination: guilt, fear, anxiety, and self-loathing.
The question is, with monkeys at the helm, how can procrastinators move into blue territory, the less comfortable places where the really important things happen?
In fact, procrastinators have a guardian angel who is always watching over them, even at the worst of times.He is also known as the &quot;panic monster.&quot;
[Panic Monster] The Panic Monster sleeps most of the time, but suddenly wakes up when a terrible outcome approaches, such as a deadline approaching, a loss of face, or a professional crisis.
The important thing is that that&#39;s the only thing the monkey is afraid of.
Very recently, I had the privilege of doing so, and six months ago, the folks at TED contacted me and asked me to give a TED Talk.
Of course I said, &quot;I&#39;ll do it.&quot;
It&#39;s been a long-time dream of mine to be able to say, ``I gave a TED talk a long time ago.&#39;&#39;
[I&#39;ve done this with TED Talks] Amid all this excitement, rational decision makers have other things on their minds.
&quot;Do you know what you&#39;ve accepted?
Do you know what will happen on a certain day in the future?
I need to sit down and get started right now! ”
The monkey replies, ``I totally agree, but I think if you open Google Earth, zoom in on the bottom of India to 60 meters above ground, scroll for two and a half hours, and get to the top, you&#39;ll get a better idea of India.&#39;&#39;
So I did that all day.
Six months turned into four months, which turned into two months, which turned into one month, and TED released a list of speakers.
When I opened that page, there was my face staring back at me.
So who woke up?
The panic monster went frantic, and soon the entire system was thrown into chaos.
Remember the monkey is afraid of the panic monster, so he runs away up the tree.
Now that a rational decision maker was finally at the helm, I began preparing my talk.
Panic Monster explains the erratic behavior of procrastinators, who go from spending two weeks not being able to write a single line at the beginning of a report to miraculously awakening to a strong work ethic and spending all night writing eight pages. things also happen
So this is the whole situation that these three characters are in, the procrastinator&#39;s system.
It&#39;s not pretty, but it works in the end.
This is what I decided to write on my blog two years ago.
When I started writing about it, I was surprised by the response to my blog.
We received literally thousands of emails from all over the world, from so many different people.
Nurses, bankers, painters, engineers, and many, many graduate students.
Everyone was saying the same thing: ``I have the same problem.&#39;&#39;
But the lightness of that blog post contrasted with the weight of the email I received.
It was written with great frustration at the effect that procrastination was having on their lives, and what they were going through because of the monkey.
When I saw that, I thought, ``What is it about the procrastinator&#39;s system that works?&#39;&#39;
Why are they in such a gloomy state?
What I learned is that there are two types of procrastination.
In the example I mentioned, there was a deadline.
Deadlines limit the effects of procrastination to a short period of time, and the panic monster emerges.
But there&#39;s another kind of procrastination, and it doesn&#39;t have a deadline.
When you&#39;re doing entrepreneurial work, like being a self-employed person or an artist, you don&#39;t have deadlines in the beginning, because nothing happens until you go out and do something and get off the ground and hit the ground running.
And outside of work, there are many important things that don&#39;t have deadlines, such as visiting family, exercising and staying healthy, building relationships, and ending a relationship that isn&#39;t working.
If the only mechanism that procrastinators use to do these difficult things is the panic monster, then there&#39;s a problem, because the panic monster doesn&#39;t show up when there&#39;s no deadline.
Without anything to wake you up, the effects of procrastination are not limited, and you will continue to procrastinate forever.
This long-term type of procrastination is less visible and less talked about than the humorous, short-term, deadline-based procrastination, and is usually left to suffer in silence.
Long-term, major unhappiness and regret
That could be the source, and I thought that&#39;s why those people wrote those emails, and why they&#39;re in such a terrible situation.
It&#39;s not like I&#39;m stuck with some project.
Long-term procrastination makes you feel like a bystander in your own life.
Their frustration is not that they can&#39;t achieve their dreams, but that they can&#39;t even begin to pursue them.
As I was reading those emails, I had an epiphany: There is no one out there who isn&#39;t a procrastinator.
We&#39;re all procrastinators
Even if you&#39;re not as crazy as I am, you may have a healthy relationship with deadlines, but keep in mind that monkey problems are most unpleasant when there are no deadlines.
There&#39;s one last thing I want to show you.
&quot;Life Calendar&quot;
Each box represents a week in your 90 years of life.
There aren&#39;t that many of them, and besides, we&#39;re already using them quite a lot.
I think we should all take a close look at this calendar.
What are you really procrastinating about? Everyone must be procrastinating about something at some point.
You need to be aware of the monkey&#39;s need for an immediate reward.
this is a job for all of us
Considering we don&#39;t have that many boxes, we should probably start this job today.
Well, even if it&#39;s not right away today.
if you can
in the not too distant future
thank you
At that time, I was in a Texas church, crowded with souls and bodies, waiting in fear for the final moments of my life.
In a venue just like this one, I was seated in a ramshackle wooden chair covered in red rags, with an organ to my left, a choir behind me, and a baptismal trough further back.
There is no difference
An overwhelming sense of tension, a desperate wish for salvation, sweaty palms, and people sitting in the back who don&#39;t seem to be very interested.
December 31, 1999, the night of Christ&#39;s second coming, when I believed the world would end.
That year, I turned exactly 12 years old, the age at which I was officially recognized as a full-fledged person according to the scriptures.
I wanted to complain that it wasn&#39;t fair that the world was ending, but now that it&#39;s over, I was forced to reconsider my future plans.
Change your mind and go to church as much as possible
I prayed so earnestly that I forgot the passage of time, and I was desperate for God to notice my unbelief and for His coming to come sooner than expected.
I was even more careful to read books like ``Please Save Me,&#39;&#39; which were popular at the time.
One day, I found something in a text that says that if one person lacks faith at a fateful time, further tragedy awaits.
In any case, the task before me is to control all desires, to overcome the devil and inertia, to overcome my own unbelief.
It&#39;s difficult for a 12 year old. Believe that you can do it.
The time is finally approaching
23:50
With 10 minutes left, the pastor gathered us in front of the altar to welcome the moment when the clock&#39;s hands pointed to the fateful hour with deep prayer.
People of all denominations come together
The choir remains in its pews, and the deacons and their wives - the bourgeois churchmen, if you will - take their places in the front rows of the altar.
As you know, in America, even the Second Coming of Christ has VIP seating.
(Applause) Right behind those VIPs are elderly people. I think of their young backs as they worked in the cotton fields in the scorching East Texas sun. Their tanned, wrinkle-free skin looked like the earth. These are the people who dreamed of living a different life, but whose expectations were betrayed over and over again.
They&#39;re really the main characters for me.
They have devoted their entire lives to this moment, just as their medieval predecessors looked forward to the arrival of the last days, making the daily 4 o&#39;clock talk show their reason for living.
Like my grandmother, she walked to the altar, and I followed her closely, convinced that she was going to heaven.
I was thinking that if I held her hand during prayer, maybe we could all go to heaven together.
I held your hands, closed my eyes, listened, and prayed.
The pastor&#39;s voice is rough
The prayers in response become a cry that echoes throughout the church.
The melody on the keyboard increases its momentum
The accompanying heat surrounds the church.
I grab my grandmother&#39;s hand again so she won&#39;t leave me behind.
Faced with the horror of my fate, I ran into the darkness behind my eyelids.
And that voice pours out, &quot;Amen&quot;
it&#39;s over
The hands of the clock
The fateful time has already passed
No savior appeared, and I watched, my eyes swimming, as they tried not to realize their disappointment.They had closed their eyes so deeply and for so long that they were unable to even notice new possibilities.
My heart ached when I saw them like that.
They were deceived, they were deceived victims, and I was one of them.
I&#39;ve been praying and trying not to give in to temptation.
I went through that baptism of trial not once, but twice, and I believed it.
Until then, certainly
When I got home and turned on the television, Peter Jennings was celebrating the beginning of a new millennium, and the news was being broadcast all over the world.
At that moment, a strange thought crossed my mind: Could God come to us again and again, paying attention to the time difference?
This epiphany was so stupid and so cruel.
But I never stopped believing.
And I have a new faith: the faith that there is more than one answer.
My answer was wrong, the question itself was wrong, and this is my belief in facing the absurdity.
New sunlight shines on the frozen, motionless winter mountain of &quot;faith.&quot; The thaw water of possibility has begun to flow toward unseen landscapes.
I still think back to that night when the Savior didn&#39;t come, the moment when everything I believed in was destroyed in an instant, and I knew that even if it wasn&#39;t a lie, it wasn&#39;t the truth.
Among the many people who celebrated the millennium in very different ways, some may find themselves here after a similar journey to the one I followed, beginning with the dawn of a new millennium. Since that day, my mother left, I couldn&#39;t contact my father, and even God rejected me.
I reached out my hand, hoping to grab something I could believe in this time.
At the age of 18, I entered Yale University, and what I thought at the time was my chance to break away from all the dark past I had seen in Oak Cliff, Texas, all the shattered dreams and hopeless people I had seen.
But one day during my winter vacation, I found myself face down on the floor of my house, my hands tied tightly behind my back, a robber holding a gun to my head, and it dawned on me: Education wasn&#39;t going to save me. There isn&#39;t one
In 2008, I reached out for my next help, a company called Lehman Brothers.
With a bright future ahead, I hurriedly called home and said, ``I don&#39;t have to worry about money anymore.&#39;&#39;
But even that financial hub collapsed before my eyes, and even the business abandoned me.
I won&#39;t give up and will reach out to my next hope as a youth staff member in Washington.The voices I hear from Illinois are shouting loudly, ``The time has come!&#39;&#39; ``Change is coming to America.&#39;&#39;
But Congress faltered, the nation&#39;s hopes were torn apart, and &quot;change&quot; became a funny joke. The second coming of politics did nothing. There was no relief.
I did swear allegiance at that altar called the American Dream, and I knelt to the god of capitalism, for success, wealth, and power.
And yet, as the date changes, I open my eyes and wonder if there really is no God.
I decided to face that night again, not because I was brave, but because I had no choice but to die or believe.
And so I moved on to my next sacred place: Harvard Business School.I knew I wasn&#39;t going to settle for the sound of relief offered to me.
I feel like my efforts are still not enough
One night, not long into the harsh Cambridge winter, I was sitting in a quiet corner of a busy party with three friends, and a topic came up that every young person had experienced at least once. Because I was young, it was a common topic: ``Shall we go on a trip?&#39;&#39;
I had no idea where I should go or how I should go.
But I was obsessed with Jack Kerouac&#39;s novels, and we set out to find out what was going on in this country, where it disappeared into the night.
Of course, there were many voices of opposition, and above all, they were extremely reasonable, but I took the first step anyway.
In the summer of 2013, I embarked on an 8,000-mile journey around the United States, passing through the meadows of Montana, the ruins of Detroit, and the swamps of New Orleans. Everywhere I went, I met people who lived their daily lives doing business to make a living.
To me, trained in the highest academia of capitalism, it was rather innovative.
This idea grew into a non-profit organization called MBAs Across America, and it was this wave that brought me to the TED stage.
How hungry is our generation for purpose and meaning?
We realized that this wave was coming, and that we needed a little more support for the thousands of entrepreneurs who are behind the scenes, creating jobs and driving change.
We finally realized, and to be honest, the other important thing is that I also tried to make waves.
There was certainly an idea in the past that as many people as possible could think that each social enterprise could heal the wounds of this crumbling country and help it stand up again.
But this missionary journey has led me to a new gospel, and that&#39;s why I&#39;m standing here today.
It happened one evening, about a year ago, when I was in New York at the Museum of Natural History at a Harvard Business School alumni gathering.
Beneath a life-size replica of a whale hanging from the ceiling, we sat together with the world&#39;s greatest heroes of the era and celebrated our classmates&#39; accomplishments and spirit of social contribution.
It was a space filled with pride, with the network of people gathered there and their assets worth well over $500 billion.
If you look around at all our accomplishments, they&#39;re all beautiful.
But that&#39;s not all. Two days later, I was in the Harlem area, sitting on a farm that had been built on what was once an empty lot, and listening to a man named Tony tell me about the children who come to the farm every day. Ta
This is a story about children living below the poverty line.
Even when they sleep, they hold their belongings in their arms so they don&#39;t get stolen at homeless shelters.
Those kids come to Tony&#39;s program, called Harlem Grown, for one meal of the day.
After 20 years as a taxi driver, Tony cut into his pension and started the program.
He didn&#39;t get paid, because even as his activities expanded, he was running out of money.
He said he would cling to any straw.
And I decide to be that straw.
On the way home, a dull sound echoed in my chest, and tears just flowed down my face.
I was so ignorant that under one roof a replica of a whale was floating, and the people who moved $500 billion gathered, and two days later, just 50 blocks to the north, under the sky, a man was working without pay to provide for his children. I was
I didn&#39;t cry because of inequality. I didn&#39;t cry out of pity for the hungry or homeless. I didn&#39;t cry out of anger at the wealth of the 1% or pity for the poverty of the 99%.
I was just upset, faced with the fact that I was on a dialysis machine in a country with kidney disease.
I realized that my story was for the people who had to keep going, even if they didn&#39;t have shoes, to bring meaningful aid to the overlooked areas of Harlem, Appalachia, and New Orleans. That&#39;s why my organization exists, my voice, and what it was meant to be: all the voiceless voices that have been seen as uneducated and innocent.
That epiphany made me feel completely ashamed, and then I remembered that Peter Jennings&#39;s new century had been deceived and lied to, over and over again, with its unreasonableness.
I was being lied to
But this time, I was the false savior myself. I had come a long way from that altar that night, when I believed the world was ending. That suffering was my repayment to God, that God&#39;s word was everything. That the Bible is the truth
After a long journey from that world I believed in, I&#39;m standing at the starting point again.
The times we live in now are not times of unbelief; in fact, we believe just as much as we have in the past.
Brené Brown Some people are going to take her at her word, maybe Tony Robbins.
&quot;The New Yorker&quot; &quot;Harvard Business Review&quot;
I&#39;m sure there are people who believe in these things. Above all, aren&#39;t we praying right now in a church called TED? We want to believe, and we need to believe.
We all want leaders like us who can solve all our problems.
They believe that suffering is a necessary evil in the god of capitalism; they believe that the sacred text of technological progress is absolute.
But when we are so afraid that our beliefs will be shaken from their foundations that we fail to question each element of those foundations, we overlook the human cost.
If something you have to accept is holding you back, it&#39;s time to stop and ask questions.
The gospel of creativity, innovation, and social, environmental, and economic responsibility is not my domain.
I&#39;m not actually trying to spread some doctrinal gospel here.
The gospel of doubt exists. That&#39;s why I&#39;m here.
This gospel doesn&#39;t tell you to stop believing, it just asks for a new attitude, one that thinks there is more than one answer.
Accept the mistakes you&#39;ve made so far and leave room for the absurdity of the question itself to be wrong.
This gospel of doubt suggests that everything we do in this place, in this space, could be wrong.
“Why?” That question is the gospel.
Why should we give up our power to ask questions and let people suffer for nothing?
This belief in questioning led me to make a decision regarding my work, MBAs Across America, and to make it a non-profit.
We reduced our organization&#39;s staff, stopped new hires, and made our business model publicly available and shared with anyone who needed it.
Questioning why asked me to abandon the role of savior that people had placed on me. Faced with the truth that miracles don&#39;t happen, we have too much time left to wait once more for Christ&#39;s return. Because it&#39;s too short
This gospel of doubt should encourage you, give you hope, and illuminate the way forward even when you feel hopeless and there seems to be no end. Even in difficult and painful times, don&#39;t get lost in the cessation of thinking called blind faith. Dare to question your inner self. Your voice is small and faint, but it becomes an irreplaceable light that illuminates the darkness. Be it a whisper.
Even if it&#39;s just a cry, it&#39;s simply saying, ``There&#39;s got to be another way.&#39;&#39;
thank you
food crisis
It&#39;s been in the news everyday
What does that mean?
In some parts of the world, food is either in short supply or in oversupply.
Meanwhile, GMOs are saving the world.
GMOs may also have problems.
Excess agricultural runoff pollutes oceans, introduces toxins and reduces nutritional value.
This kind of thing goes on and on.
I&#39;m very disappointed in today&#39;s debate about the environment.
How can we use our knowledge to solve this problem?
Let&#39;s take a look at the food problem of apples
I&#39;m sure you all ate an apple last week.
How long do you think that apple was picked?
Two weeks?
2 months?
11 months - average for apples in American grocery stores
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s that different in Europe or the rest of the world.
Apples are picked and stored in a refrigerator, which is then filled with a preservation gas. There are records of workers entering these preserves and dying trying to pick apples, because the air that slows down the decomposition of the apples is toxic to humans. is
Why didn&#39;t anyone know about this?
Why didn&#39;t I know?
90% of the antioxidant content in apples is lost by the time you eat them.
This is just a lump of sugar.
Why are we so ill-informed? What can be done to improve it?
Because we lack a platform.
When I think of platforms, I think of computers.When I was young, I did some really bad things on the internet.
We did it on this platform.
But I was also able to meet people and express myself.
How do you express yourself using food?
If you have a platform, you will be free to ask &quot;What if...&quot;
My question was: What if the climate was equal for everyone?
This is a world climate map.
High productivity areas are shown in green, low productivity areas are shown in red.
The colors move and change, and the agricultural center that used to be in California has now moved to Mexico.
China grows better food on Brazilian soil, and we submit to the climate.
What if each country had a climate suitable for production?
How will it change people&#39;s lives?
Will it change the quality of life and nutrition?
For previous generations, the problem was getting more food at a cheaper price.
Welcome to the world of global farms
Humanity has built gigantic analog farms.
The lines drawn here represent food transportation connected by cars, planes, and trains.
It&#39;s miraculous that the food that supports a population of 7 billion people is produced by such a small percentage of people.
If···
What if you could build a digital farm?
A digital farm that spans the world
What if we could take this apple, somehow digitize it, propagate it as particles through the air, and reassemble it somewhere else?
If···
I read what was written here and was inspired to start this research.
Number one: Japanese agriculture has no young labor, no water, no land, no future. Seeing this, I headed to Minamisoma, just north of Fukushima, where the earthquake had hit. It was
Because the land was contaminated, children moved to Sendai and Tokyo. Japan already relies on imports for 70% of its food.
Food problems are not limited to Japan.
In the United States, 2% of the population is involved in agriculture.
No matter what country you are in, there is only so much you can do with 2%.
If you look at other countries - 50% of Africa&#39;s population is under the age of 18.
80% of them don&#39;t want to be farmers.
Agriculture is hard labor
The lives of small-scale farmers are miserable.
flowing into urban areas
In India, where farmers don&#39;t even have water or electricity, the number of farmers who committed suicide this year was the highest in a decade.
It&#39;s really disgusting
Where will the farmers go?
It&#39;s an urban area
Young people are not staying in their hometowns and are all moving to urban areas.
So how can we build a platform that inspires young people?
Introducing the new tractor!
This is the combine I created
Many years ago, I went to a grocery store or DIY store and started crafting.
So I started making weird stuff, trying to make plants dance, and when I connected them to a computer, they all died, and there were so many of them.
Finally, I was able to keep it from drying out.
I built what would become one of the most intimate relationships of my life: I began to understand the language of plants.
If you want to grow bigger
They said, “Come on!
There&#39;s just an old electrical lab that no one wants to go in here.
What do you think you can do? ”
My colleagues and I built a farm at the MIT Media Lab, which has traditionally been known as a laboratory for digital life, not biology.
In this 6 square meter space, we produced enough food for 300 people each month, which isn&#39;t a huge amount...
There&#39;s a lot of interesting technology being put into it.
What is the most interesting thing about it?
Beautiful white roots, dark green vegetables and monthly harvest
Is this a new type of cafeteria?
A new retail experience?
A new grocery store?
One thing we can say for sure: this is the first time we&#39;ve ever plucked something from the roots at the Media Lab.
There&#39;s a salad in the bag, but there&#39;s nothing wrong with it.
But what happens when you have an image processing expert, a data scientist, a robotics researcher, and you pick something up by the roots and think, ``This is what I can do with what I know, so let&#39;s try it.&#39;&#39;
Before we take these plants out, we try to keep them in the lab, because we don&#39;t want to throw away what we&#39;ve grown, because they&#39;re precious.
My tongue is strange, and I taste it first, and I don&#39;t want anyone else to eat it until I&#39;m sure it&#39;s legit.
So I eat lettuce every day, and the pH of lettuce can be determined to within 0.1.
&quot;Oh, that&#39;s PH6.1. I can&#39;t eat today.&quot; Something like this
The lettuce that day was extremely sweet.
When a plant is under stress and trying to protect itself, a chemical reaction takes place internally, which makes it very sweet. ``I don&#39;t want to die.&#39;&#39;
The cries of these plants give it a very sweet taste that I like.
A scientific engineer who turned to plant physiology...
I wanted to make this experiment available to other people.
I&#39;m curious about what they&#39;re going to create, so I thought of a lab that could deliver it anywhere.
I tried making it first
My lab is right in front of the media lab, and each plant has about 30 sensors attached to it.
If you know anything about genomes and genetic engineering, this is what&#39;s called a phenome.
Derived from the word &quot;phenomenon&quot;
For example, if you say ``I like strawberries from Mexico,&#39;&#39; you actually prefer strawberries that are grown in a climate that fosters the flavor you like.
So if you create that climate with a program, you use combinations of carbon dioxide and oxygen concentrations as a recipe, and then program the flavor, nutrients, size, shape, color, and texture of the plants.
We need data to do this, and we&#39;ve installed a lot of sensors to tell us what&#39;s going on, and if you think about your indoor garden and you&#39;re looking at this, you&#39;re going to get really sad, saying, &quot;Why are they dying? Talk to me.&quot;
Farmers develop an amazing ability to predict plant growth in their late 60s to 70s.
When a plant is dying, they can tell whether it&#39;s due to lack of nitrogen, lack of calcium, or need for moisture.
This wonderful vision cannot be inherited.
This is data that a farmer saved on the cloud.
Track changes in data over time
We correlate these data with individual plants.
These are the broccoli in the laboratory one day expressed by IP address
It&#39;s broccoli that can be given an IP address.
(Applause) If you think this isn&#39;t weird enough, click here to see the plant profile.
This is downloadable data about the growth of those plants, probably more than you might imagine, not just when they&#39;re ready to eat.
The time when you can get the nutrition you need
Predicts when the taste will reach your preference
Are you using too much water?
Are you letting in too much sunlight?
Also issues a warning
He speaks to me. He&#39;s intelligent. He shares a language with me.
(Applause) I think I&#39;m the plant world&#39;s first Facebook user.
So what we saw earlier is a profile of a plant, and that plant starts making friends.
Less nitrogen, more phosphorus than other plants that consume less potassium
We&#39;re learning about the intricacies of plant-to-plant relationships, which we can only speculate about right now.
Plants may not accept us as friends - but it&#39;s possible, and it depends on our actions.
This is my current lab
It&#39;s a little more orderly than it used to be.I have experience setting up data centers at various hospitals, so I know a little bit about creating a controlled environment.
And then I try all kinds of experiments in this environment.
This method of aeroponics was developed by NASA for the Mir Space Station to reduce the amount of water transported into space.
Here, we give plants exactly what they need: water, minerals, and oxygen.
Root growth is simple, just give it what it needs and it will grow beautifully like this.
It&#39;s like plants have two hearts.
Because it has two hearts, it grows four or five times faster.
it&#39;s a perfect world
Humans have advanced technology over the years, and now we have seeds that can grow in harsh environments. As technology continues to innovate, we have now created a new way of doing things. It&#39;s a perfect world.
we grew different kinds of plants
This type of tomato hasn&#39;t been commercially produced for 150 years.
Did you know that humans have a rare and ancient seed bank?
It is a storage for seeds.
That&#39;s wonderful
There are some species whose germ plasm is preserved alive and no one has ever tasted it.
I&#39;m the only one in the lab who ate this tomato.
The problem is, these are sauce tomatoes, and I don&#39;t know how to cook them. I&#39;ve tried sauce tomatoes, but they don&#39;t taste good.
I tried growing various things using protein.
Even humans can do it, but they don&#39;t really do it.
Now, what we&#39;ve learned is that the equipment is large and very expensive.
I wanted to spread it around the world, but the device ended up costing about 10 million yen.
It&#39;s hard to find people who can afford 10 million yen, so I decided to make something small.
This project was actually led by one of my students, Camille, who is an undergraduate mechanical engineering student.
Camille, my friends and I spent the whole summer experimenting, trying to come up with something that was cheaper, worked better, and that anyone could make.
Then I brought this to middle school and high school.
If you want people to make fun of you, try teaching your child something.
I went to school and said, &quot;Set the humidity to 65 percent.&quot;
A first-year middle school student asks, &quot;What is humidity?&quot;
I said, &quot;It&#39;s water in the air.&quot;
He retorts, &quot;There&#39;s no water in the air, don&#39;t be stupid.&quot;
I reply, &quot;You don&#39;t have to believe me.
You don&#39;t have to believe
Try setting it to 100%.&quot;
He sets it to 100% - what happens?
The water condenses, becomes mist, and finally drops of water fall.
He said, ``What, humidity means rain?
Why didn&#39;t you say that? ”
We created an input screen that looks like a game.
It&#39;s a 3D display. You can log in from anywhere in the world. You can use your smartphone or tablet.
You can operate the bot&#39;s various devices and sensors.
You can choose recipes made by other children around the world.
Select a recipe and start it, and the sapling will be planted.
Changes can be made even during growth.
&quot;Why do plants need CO2? Isn&#39;t it harmful? It can kill people.&quot;
I also hear words like
If you increase CO2 concentration, plants will die.
Plants become much more energetic when CO2 is lowered.
Once the plants are harvested, a new digital recipe is created.
It&#39;s an iterative process of designing, developing, and exploring.
You can download data about new plants that they&#39;ve developed, new digital recipes, and what changes they&#39;ve made -- are they effective or have they been negative?
Think of these as the core of the development process.
we will learn a lot
This is what we call the food computer. Three weeks at school.
It grows so much in 3 weeks
What&#39;s more important is that this child was the first to think, ``Maybe I can become a farmer, too.&#39;&#39; Perhaps, ``I want to be a farmer.&#39;&#39;
So we opened up all of our data.
It&#39;s all online. Build your own food computer at home.
It might be a little difficult, but-
It&#39;s just a beginning, but everything is in place.
It&#39;s very important that it&#39;s easily available.
I will make it more familiar
They are farmers, electrical engineers, mechanical engineers, environmental engineers, computer scientists, plant scientists, economists and urban planners.
Do what you do best on one platform
This lab is getting too small.
This is a new facility that I just started using.
Warehouses like this can be found anywhere.
That&#39;s why I chose it
I&#39;m trying to make something like this in my warehouse.
this already exists
Please look
This also already exists
They grow green vegetables and Ebola vaccines, respectively.
One of the reasons these plants won the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency&#39;s Grand Challenge is because they were ahead of the curve in Ebola research, which is great.
This plant produces a protein that is resistant to Ebola.
From pharmaceuticals and nutritional supplements to lettuce.
It doesn&#39;t look anything like lettuce, but this is my field of research.
different in all respects
We&#39;re still in early chaos, and it&#39;s like, ``This is our black box—&#39;&#39; ``Buy mine.&#39;&#39;
&quot;No, I own the very valuable intellectual property rights.
Don&#39;t buy his. Buy mine.&quot;
The truth is, we&#39;re just getting started, and society is changing.
People want more food at a lower price, but they also want better quality food that is more environmentally friendly.
The fact that McDonald&#39;s has revealed the contents of chicken nuggets, which have always been considered the most questionable food, shows that they are adapting their marketing to the changing world.
Let&#39;s take a look at the modern world.
A personal food computer, food server, and food data center run by an open phenome.
Unlike Open Genome, ours is like a wiki with a few climate recipes that you can select from a drop-down menu to launch and grow.
What will this effort look like globally?
Do you remember that the world was connected by lines?
First, install the oscillator
Instead of sending food itself, we will start disseminating information about food.
It&#39;s not just my fantasy, it&#39;s already being promoted in places like this.
Food computers, food servers, and food data centers will be created, and people will be connected by sharing information.
The future of food supply is not about fighting inherent shortcomings.
I know what the shortcomings are
The future of food supply is about a network that connects the next billion farmers, providing a platform that allows them to ask questions and provide solutions, asking, &quot;What if...&quot;
thank you
Sometimes I feel very sorry for myself as a European.
More than a million people have reached Europe in the past year seeking help, and our response has been, frankly, poor.
It&#39;s really full of contradictions.
We all mourned the tragic death of two-year-old Alan Kurdi, but since then more than 200 children have drowned in the Mediterranean Sea.
Even though international agreements recognize the sharing of responsibility for accepting refugees, they are silently acknowledging the fact that Lebanon, a small country, accepts more refugees than Europe as a whole.
As much as we deplore the existence of smugglers, we have made them the only route to asylum in Europe.
We have a labor shortage, but we&#39;re excluding people who fit our talent needs economically and demographically.
Despite its opposition to Islamic fundamentalism and professing liberalism, it still employs repressive policies that detain young asylum seekers, separate children from their families, and seize their belongings.
Don&#39;t you think it&#39;s strange?
Why have we turned to such inhumane responses to humanitarian crises?
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s because people don&#39;t care, at least I don&#39;t want to believe that&#39;s the reason.
I think it&#39;s because of a lack of vision on the part of politicians to adapt international refugee policy, which was created more than 50 years ago, to the changing times of globalization.
So I&#39;d like to go back to basics and ask two very fundamental questions that we should all be thinking about.
First, why is the current system not working?
And how can I fix this?
The modern refugee system was created by these people right after World War II.
The purpose in the first place is to give people a place to go when a country collapses or, in the worst case scenario, turns on its people, and a place where they can live in safety and dignity until they return home.
It was designed for exactly the type of situation we&#39;re seeing in Syria today.
Through the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, an international agreement signed between 147 governments, and the international organization Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, they commit to the mutual admission of refugees into their territories. and accepting people fleeing persecution.
But today, this system is not working.
In theory, refugees have the right to seek asylum, but
The reality is that our immigration policies are blocking our path to safety.
In theory, refugees have the right to seek assimilation and return to their homes.
In real life, you&#39;ll be stuck almost forever.
In theory, the responsibility for refugees should be shared among countries around the world.
In reality, due to geography, countries adjacent to conflict zones host the vast majority of the world&#39;s refugees.
The reason the system isn&#39;t working is not because the rules are wrong.
We&#39;re not adapting the rules properly enough to keep up with the changing world, and we need to rethink that.
How does the current refugee system actually work?
Let me explain a little.
But I&#39;m going to explain it from a refugee perspective, not from a top-down system perspective.
First, imagine a Syrian woman.
let&#39;s call me amira
She&#39;s a woman who represents many people in that region.
Amira, like 25 percent of the world&#39;s refugees, is a woman with children, and the reason she can&#39;t go home is because the city she lived in is in such a state. As you can see, Amira&#39;s city, Homs, was once a beautiful and historic city, and now it is. is buried in rubble
I&#39;m not in a position to go home
But Amira doesn&#39;t have a chance to be resettled in a third country, a lottery that only 1% of the world&#39;s refugees ever win.
So Amira and her family are forced to make an almost impossible choice.
There are only three basic options
The first step is to bring your family to a refugee camp.
There, even with help, Amira and her family&#39;s future is next to none.
Refugee camps are desolate, barren places, often in the desert.
At night in Jordan&#39;s Zaatari refugee camp, you can hear the sound of bullets on the border with Syria.
There are restrictions on economic activity.
The quality of education is also not good
And about 80% of refugees in camps around the world have been in these conditions for at least five years.
Life there is miserable, which is probably why only 9% of Syrians actually choose this path.
Then there&#39;s the option of heading to a city, like Amman or Beirut, in neighboring countries.
This is the option chosen by 75% of Syrian refugees.
But there, too, we face great difficulties.
Refugees typically do not have the right to work in these urban areas.
I don&#39;t receive much help.
In this case, Amira and her family will be left with almost nothing after all their savings and a life of poverty in the city.
A third option—more and more Syrians are choosing this option.
This is a phenomenon we are seeing today in Europe, where people risk their lives on extremely dangerous journeys to reach other countries in search of a sliver of hope for their families.
Refugees around the world are faced with these impossible choices, and limited to three options: detention in camps, living in urban poverty, and dangerous travel.
For refugees, this is what the international refugee system is all about.
But it&#39;s an illusion to think that this is the only option.
I think there is room for reconsideration.
The reason we&#39;re limited to these options is because in our heads, we think that these are the only paths available to refugees, and that&#39;s not true.
Politicians see the refugee crisis as a zero-sum problem, meaning that doing something for refugees comes at a cost to citizens.
Our common assumption is that refugees are a burden, a burden on society.
Conversely, there are ways for refugees to contribute to society.
What I&#39;m trying to say is that there are ways to expand options for refugees and still benefit everyone: host countries and communities, our societies, and refugees themselves.
I think that in the four ways that I&#39;m going to talk about, we can fundamentally change the way we think about refugees.
All four have one thing in common: they&#39;re ways of capitalizing on the opportunities created by globalization, liquidity, and markets, and they change the way we look at refugee issues.
The first idea is to create an environment for refugees, and it starts with a very basic understanding: refugees are people like everyone else, just in an unusual situation.
My colleagues and I at Oxford University started research in Uganda, looking at the economic activities of refugees.
We didn&#39;t choose Uganda because it&#39;s one of the world&#39;s leading host countries.
Because they have very good policies.
Unlike other host countries around the world, Uganda has created economic opportunities for refugees.
It gave refugees the right to work and freedom of movement.
This is having incredible results, both for refugees and refugee settlements.
In the capital, Kampala, 21% of refugees own businesses and employ workers, and 40% of those employed are nationals of the host country.
In other words, refugees were creating jobs, employing nationals of the host country.
Even within refugee camps, we saw great examples of thriving private businesses.
For example, in a refugee settlement called Nakivale, Congolese refugees are involved in the business of buying and selling digital music.
A Rwandan refugee started a business to provide computer games to young people using recycled game consoles and televisions.
Despite the harsh environment, innovative efforts are being made. This photo is taken by a Congolese man named Demoukey.
When I arrived at the settlement, I was pretty much broke, but I wanted to be a filmmaker.
He started a community radio station with friends and colleagues, borrowed a video camera, and is now making videos.
I co-produced two documentary films at the request of my team, and I&#39;ve made it a success with very little capital.
Cases like these should inform our response to refugees.
Rather than viewing refugees as necessarily dependent on humanitarian aid, we need to provide them with opportunities to thrive as human beings.
Of course, clothing, bedding, a place to sleep, and food are all important in an emergency situation, but we need to think beyond that.
Opportunities such as communications, electricity, education, labor rights and access to capital and banking.
We have to offer the benefits of the global economy, which we take for granted. Refugees can and should too.
The second idea is about economic zones.
Unfortunately, not all refugee-hosting countries around the world adopt policies like Uganda&#39;s.
Most countries don&#39;t welcome refugees into their economies the way Uganda does.
But there are practical solutions that can be adopted.
Last April, I went to Jordan with my colleague, development economist Paul Collier, and while we were there we brainstormed and talked with the international community and the Jordanian government in a way that was consistent with Jordan&#39;s national development strategy.
We came up with a way to give jobs to Syrians, an idea about economic zones that explored the possibility of employing refugees alongside employing Jordanian nationals in the host country.
Just 15 minutes from Zaatari refugee camp, home to 83,000 refugees, there is an economic zone called the King Hussein bin Talal Development Zone.
The Jordanian government has invested more than $1 million to connect the area to electricity and road networks, but two things are missing: labor and inward investment.
What if refugees could work here? What if you could raise your family, gain skills through vocational training, and return to Syria instead of being trapped in a camp?
We thought this would be beneficial for Jordan, because Jordan&#39;s development strategy as a middle-income country requires the development of domestic manufacturing.
It&#39;s not only beneficial for refugees, but it&#39;s also contributing to the post-conflict rebuilding of Syria, recognizing that we need to protect and train refugees, who will eventually become the best human resource to rebuild Syria.
This proposal was published in the political magazine Foreign Affairs.
It caught the attention of King Abdullah.
Two weeks ago, at the Syria Support Conference in London, it was announced that it would be piloted this summer.
(Applause) The third idea that I would like to propose to you is a matching system between countries and refugees that can lead to happy outcomes like the one in this photo, where a Syrian refugee takes a selfie with Chancellor Angela Merkel.
We rarely ask refugees what their hopes are or where they want to go, but we can all benefit from listening to their voices.
The concept of matching theory, developed by economist Alvin Ross, is to determine the final combination based on the preference ordering of the parties.
My colleagues Will Jones and Alex Teitelboim looked at how to apply this concept to refugees by asking refugees to list the host countries they would like to go to, in order of preference, and also asking the host country to identify the type of refugee they want, such as job skills and language. The method is to ask them to prioritize based on their conditions and then bring the two together.
Now, of course, you should consider factors such as diversity and vulnerability when deciding on quotas, but you can also think of that as a way to increase your match rate.
The concept of matching has been used successfully, for example, in university admissions for students, kidney donors and patients, and it&#39;s also in the algorithms used on dating sites.
Why not incorporate this to expand options for refugees?
It can also be used on a national scale, because one of the big challenges we face is convincing local communities to accept refugees.
Now, for example, in my country, the United Kingdom, we often do this stupid thing where we send engineers to the countryside and farmers to the cities.
If we do market matching, we can match the wishes of both parties and listen to the needs and desires of both host residents and refugees.
And the fourth idea is humanitarian visas.
Most of the tragedies and chaos happening in Europe are completely avoidable.
It&#39;s caused by a fundamental contradiction in Europe&#39;s refugee rules, which means that in order to become an asylum seeker in Europe, you have to take a perilous journey and arrive unprepared. Is it necessary?
In this day and age of low-cost airlines and consular services, these trips should be completely unnecessary, but last year they killed more than 3,000 people on European borders and within Europe.
Quite simply, this could be avoided if refugees were allowed to travel normally to Europe and become asylum seekers.The way this is accomplished is through what are called humanitarian visas, where visas are issued at embassies and consulates in neighboring countries. And you can simply pay your own travel expenses and take a ferry or plane to Europe.
It costs 1,000 euros to cross from Turkey to the Greek islands with a smuggler.
Cheapest flight from Bodrum to Frankfurt for 200 euros
There are significant benefits to opening up these options to refugees.
Many lives will be saved, the refugee smuggling industry itself will become more profitable, and chaos will disappear from front lines in Europe, like the Greek islands.
What prevents these measures is not rational policy, but policy.
This idea has been implemented in practice
Brazil pioneered this approach, allowing more than 2,000 Syrians to enter Brazil on humanitarian visas and receive refugee status upon arrival.
All Syrians who have used this system have achieved refugee status and received official refugee status.
There are also historical precedents.
Between 1922 and 1942, 450,000 Assyrians, Turks, and Chechens moved around Europe and applied for asylum in other European countries, using the Nansen Passport as an international form of identification. Ta
Nansen International Refugee Office won the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of this pragmatic strategy.
All four of the ideas I just talked about are ways to increase the options available to Amira, the hypothetical refugee mentioned at the beginning.
It&#39;s a way to expand the range of options available to refugees, so they don&#39;t have to limit themselves to the three impossible options I mentioned at the beginning, and others benefit.
In short, we desperately need a new vision, one that expands options for refugees but understands that it doesn&#39;t have to be a burden.
The idea that refugees are necessarily a burden is wrong.
It&#39;s a humanitarian imperative, but refugees are skilled, talented and motivated human beings who, if given the opportunity, have the potential to contribute to society.
In the future, there will be no end to the number of people immigrating around the world.
What&#39;s happening in Europe will continue for years to come.
Refugees continue to be on the move, wandering in search of a place to belong, and there are rational, practical ways to deal with this situation that are not based on the old theories of humanitarian aid or the idea of charity, but that are created by globalization, markets, liquidity, etc. We should look for ways to take advantage of opportunities.
I appeal to all of you, and to all politicians, to wake up and face this challenge.
thank you
I&#39;ve been fascinated by the sea since I was a child.
It&#39;s a wonderful place, full of color and life, and home to strange, alien-like creatures.
I imagined large sharks dominating the food chain, and graceful sea turtles swimming across coral reefs.
As a marine biologist turned photographer, I&#39;ve dedicated most of my career to finding magical places like the ones I dreamed about when I was little.
As you can see, I&#39;ve been exploring underwater ever since I was very young.
But the first time I really went underwater was when I was about 10 years old.
I still vividly remember swimming furiously, trying to touch an old cannon above the shallow coral.
And when I finally got hold of it and looked up, I was immediately surrounded by colorful fish. That was the day I fell in love with the ocean.
Thomas Pesczak Conservation Photographer After living on Earth for 40 years, I have had the unique opportunity to explore the wonders of our oceans for National Geographic and the Save Our Seas Foundation.
I&#39;ve photographed everything, from gigantic sharks to adorable creatures that fit in the palm of your hand.
In the frigid waters of Canada&#39;s Great Bear Rainforest, a very fishy-breathed humpback whale was spotted feeding just 30 centimeters away.
I have also been present at the mating site of green sea turtles in the Mozambique Channel.
Every person on earth and the ocean have influenced each other.
And the pristine oceans I dreamed of as a child are becoming increasingly difficult to find.
They are being cornered and threatened.
We humans have been the planet&#39;s primary predators, and I&#39;ve witnessed and photographed the growing effects firsthand.
For a long time, I wanted to get people interested by shocking them with shocking photos.
This approach has its merits, but I have returned to the basics.
I thought the best way to bring about change was to appeal to love.
Maybe I&#39;m a matchmaker of sorts.As a photographer, I&#39;ve had the unique opportunity to reveal the entirety of the animals and ecosystems hidden beneath the ocean&#39;s surface.
If you don&#39;t know it exists, you can&#39;t value it or defend it.
The power of conservation photography is to reveal hidden aspects.
I&#39;ve visited hundreds of bodies of water, but there are a few that particularly impress me.
The first time I experienced such excitement was 10 years ago, off the rocky, unexplored coast of South Africa.
Every June and July, huge swarms of sardines make the northward migration known as the sardine run.
There&#39;s a good reason for this.
Because a fast, hungry hunter is secretly pursuing it with great force.
Generally, dolphins hunt in groups, separating some sardines from the group to create spherical schools called bait balls.
Drive the fish to the surface and enjoy this living, moving feast.
There&#39;s a shark right behind me
Many people believe that dolphins and sharks are natural enemies, but in Sardine Run they actually coexist.
Dolphins help sharks forage more efficiently
Without the dolphin, the bait ball would be more dispersed, and the shark would get stuck in what&#39;s called a sardine donut, with a mouthful of water and nothing to gain.
Now, I had some exciting moments with sharks at Sardine Run, and I can tell you that they don&#39;t see me as bait.
But in this wild feast, they get bumped and finned like any other fish.
If you travel east from the coast of Africa and cross the vast Indian Ocean, you&#39;ll find yourself in the coral islands of the Maldives.
During the intense southwest monsoon, manta rays come from all over the archipelago to a tiny part of Baa Atoll called Hanifaru, where large numbers of crustaceans, often smaller than a human eye, are their staple food.
When the plankton is unevenly distributed, the manta ray forages alone, then somersaults backwards over and over again, much like a puppy chasing its own tail.
However, when plankton is concentrated in one place, the rays line up in a long chain to forage, and even if the ray near the front loses some of the plankton, it will inevitably be swallowed by the next ray.
As plankton abundance increases, the rays swim closer to each other, a unique behavior called cyclone feeding.
The rays circle in tight formations, turning into multi-layered columns that collect plankton in vortices and suck them into their cavernous mouths.
The experience of diving surrounded by hundreds of rays is truly unforgettable.
When I first photographed Hanifaru, it was unprotected and threatened by development.
By working with NGOs like Manta Trust, my photography eventually helped Hanifaru become a marine protected area.
Fishermen from nearby islands used to catch stingrays to make traditional drums from their skins.
Now they&#39;re the fiercest conservationists of anyone, and the stingrays bring in $8 million more in income each year in the Maldives.
I&#39;ve always wanted to go back in time and go to a time when maps were mostly blank and it said, &quot;Here lies a dragon.&quot;
The closest I&#39;ve ever been to an ocean from that era was an atoll in the western Indian Ocean.
Diving into waters like this, far away from shipping lanes and fishing fleets, gives you a keen sense of what the sea used to be like.
Most people have probably never heard of Basas da India, a small coral reef in the Mozambique Channel.
The coral reef acts as a barrier, and the lagoon inside is a breeding ground for Galapagos sharks.
This shark is not very timid, even during the day.
I had a hunch that they would get bolder and come out in greater numbers at night.
Have you ever encountered so many sharks in one coral outcrop?
Capturing and sharing moments like these remind me why I started this path.
Already this year, I worked for National Geographic on the Baja California Peninsula.
About halfway down the Pacific side of the peninsula is San Ignacio Lagoon, an important breeding ground for gray whales.
This coast was the site of a 100-year massacre in which more than 20,000 gray whales were killed and only a few hundred survived.
Now, the descendants of those whales even gently nudge their young to the surface to play and interact with us.
This species has made a truly remarkable comeback.
Now, on the other side of the peninsula, there&#39;s a quiet fishing town called Cabo Pulmo.
It was on the verge of collapse after decades of overfishing.
In 1995, local fishermen campaigned for the ocean to be designated as a marine protected area.
What happened next was nothing short of miraculous.
In 2005, after only 10 years of protection, fish populations made an unprecedented recovery.
But see for yourself, let&#39;s go together.
Take a breath, dive deep, and swim into the largest, densest school of fish I&#39;ve ever encountered.
Everyone can create hope
Through my photography, I want to show people that it&#39;s not too late to protect our oceans.
In particular, I want to focus on nature&#39;s resilience in the face of 7.3 billion people.
My hope is that in the future, you won&#39;t be able to take photos like this unless you look very closely, and that I will continue to take photos that will serve as examples of coexistence with the ocean.
I just hope that it becomes a daily occurrence.
To survive and advance in my profession, I have to be a hopeless optimist.
I always work under the assumption that great photos that inspire change are just around the corner, beyond that coral, in that lagoon, or just beyond that. I think
When I moved to Harare in 1985, social justice was at the core of Zimbabwe&#39;s health policy.
At the end of the long war of independence, a new government emerged and immediately declared socialist policies, making medical services, primary education, etc. essentially free.
We have significantly increased the number of local medical facilities, and have achieved a remarkable result: approximately 80% of the population can reach a medical facility within a two-hour walk.
When Zimbabwe gained independence in 1980, child immunization rates in the country were 25%.
Just 10 years later, in 1990, it reached 80%.
I was really proud to be a part of this big change.
The excitement and unity of the people was palpable.
I was able to sit side-by-side with some of the most talented local scientists, doctors, and activists, and I felt like I was part of not just an African independence movement, but a world-leading public health movement.
But there was a terrible problem.
The year I arrived, in 1985, Zimbabwe&#39;s first case of AIDS was reported.
I had seen some AIDS patients at Harlem General Hospital, where I was a medical resident in the early 1980s, but I had no idea what was looming over Africa.
At the beginning of my stay, the HIV infection rate was around 2%.
Seventeen years after I left Harare, that number had skyrocketed to the point where one in four adults was infected.
By the mid-&#39;90s, I had told hundreds of prime-age people that I was HIV positive.
I experienced the deaths of colleagues and friends, and witnessed the deaths of students and patients.
In response, my colleagues and I started a clinic.
Demonstrate how to use a condom
Start sex education at schools and workplaces
Conducting case investigations and instructing partners of infected people on preventive measures
I worked hard, and at the time I thought I was doing my best.
I thought I was providing excellent treatment, but now that I think about it, I was doing a poor job.
But they weren&#39;t really pushing for structural reform.
Former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan candidly said that his failures led Rwanda to genocide.
In 1994, when the massacre occurred, he was the United Nations Peacekeeping Secretary General.
At a memorial service marking the 10th anniversary of the massacre, he reflected on the time and said, ``At the time, I believed I was doing my best, but when the massacre happened, I realized that I could and should have done more.&#39;&#39; I sounded the alarm and asked for cooperation. I realized that I had something to do.&quot;
The AIDS pandemic caught the medical community by surprise, and now that the World Health Organization estimates that 39 million people have died from AIDS, I regret not acting sooner. Not only
But while I was in Zimbabwe, I didn&#39;t really see myself as an advocate for change or a political position.
I came as a clinician and an epidemiologist to put my specialized skills to use.
In my mind, I thought my role was to take care of the patients, to conduct research, to better understand the patterns of infection in the population, and to help stop the spread of this virus.
I was aware that socially vulnerable groups were disproportionately at higher risk of developing AIDS and dying.
On sugar plantations, more like feudal manors than any modern corporate structure, 60% of pregnant women were HIV positive.
We taught that just because someone is infected doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re a slut; rather, they&#39;re a product of a male-dominated culture, forced seasonal labor, and colonialism.
White people suffered almost no damage.
As health care workers, we were painfully powerless to ask individuals to change their behavior, to use condoms, to have fewer sexual partners.
Infection rates continued to rise, and treatments were developed in the West, which remains the most effective treatment for AIDS, but were out of reach for public sectors throughout Africa.
I remained silent about the lack of equal access to life-saving drugs, and about the political and economic systems at the root of the AIDS epidemic that allowed it to spread on such a large scale. I didn&#39;t say it
I justified my silence by telling myself, ``I&#39;m not a citizen of this country, and if I raise the alarm, I could even be deported. I won&#39;t be able to do a good job, I won&#39;t be able to see patients, and I won&#39;t be able to see patients.&#39;&#39; The research that is being done will no longer be possible.”
That&#39;s why I kept quiet, without expressing my opinion on the government&#39;s policy on AIDS at the time.
I didn&#39;t advocate my concerns enough
Many doctors and medical professionals will probably think it was my fault.
A promise between a doctor and a patient, the Hippocratic Oath and its versions establish the sanctity of the relationship between doctor and patient.
I did everything I could to give every one of my patients the best they could.
But I also realized that an outbreak of this magnitude reflected social distortions, not only due to biological causes, but also because of practices that marginalized, excluded, and discriminated against the vulnerable. Discrimination based on race, gender, sexuality, social class, etc.
This applies to AIDS
The same thing happened recently with Ebola.
Medical anthropologists such as Paul Farmer, who has been working on the fight against AIDS in Haiti, call this &quot;structural violence.&quot; And when we say &quot;structural,&quot; we mean that inequality is a political force in our society. We call it violence because it&#39;s embedded in economic structures, and often invisible to people with privilege and power. And we call it violence because it&#39;s a phenomenon that leads to premature death, suffering, and because disease is violent
If we want to be of any help to patients, we must be aware of these social inequalities.
Raising awareness is the first step to making public health work, so we can gather allies, lead the way together, and create real change.
So lately, I haven&#39;t been silent either.
We speak out about a lot of things, even things that make the listener uncomfortable, and even things that make us feel uncomfortable speaking.
A lot of the time, it&#39;s about racial disparities, about institutionalized racism, things that should no longer be allowed in this country, much less in medical care and public health.
Because of its existence, people are dying at the cost of not living up to their full potential.
So we should be sounding the alarm about racism in American health care and the ongoing systemic and interpersonal violence that people of color are subjected to, including the 250 years of slavery that left America with a painful legacy. A central part of my mission as New York City&#39;s health commissioner is to sound the alarm on the violence that has grown after 90 years of Jim Crow and 60 years of imperfect equality.
In New York City, black men are 50% more likely to die under the age of 65 than white men.
In 2012, the maternal mortality rate for black women was more than 10 times that of white women.
Although infant survival rates have improved dramatically, black infants are still nearly three times as likely to die in the first year of life as white infants.
New York is not the only special place.
Similar statistics can be found all over America.
According to a recent New York Times analysis, there is a shortage of 1.5 million black men across America.
The article says that today, more than one in every six black men between the ages of 25 and 54 disappear from daily life, either because they are incarcerated or because they die at a young age.
There is gross injustice, the unjust violence that is happening to young black men every day, the kind of violence that is being protested, known as #BlackLivesMatter.
But it&#39;s important to remember that common diseases continue to occur, albeit at different rates, and their consequences: heart disease, cancer, diabetes, AIDS, and other slow, silent killers of black people who die prematurely from these diseases. are losing even more lives.
When the #BlackLivesMatter movement started, I felt frustrated and angry because the medical community has avoided even using the word &quot;racism&quot; in research and work.
Every time I use this word, I&#39;m sure you all have something in mind.
While medical students dressed up as corpses in white coats protested, most people in the medical community stood by and did nothing. The discrimination that remains today continues to affect the appearance of disease and mortality rates. What I&#39;m worried about is
Modern trends toward personalized and precision medicine mean that in the pursuit of more individualized treatments and biological and genetic research, we may inadvertently lose sight of the big picture, and that we may be losing sight of the big picture in our daily environment—the environment in which people live. The everyday environment in which we grow, work, and love each other is what has the greatest impact on human health, and which is damaging the health of far too many people.
As health care professionals, we see gross inequities in our daily work, both in the clinic and in research. Homeless people are unable to do what their doctors tell them to do because they have far more pressing priorities. Young people consider suicide because of a society that is so callous that single mothers are responsible for their children&#39;s well-being.
As health care professionals, doctors&#39; roles are not just to treat patients, but to be advocates for attention and change.
Because of their social status, regardless of their legitimacy, what doctors say carries a lot of weight, and we shouldn&#39;t let it go to waste.
I regret that I didn&#39;t speak up in Zimbabwe, and I made a vow to myself: I will use every opportunity I have as New York City&#39;s health commissioner to raise awareness and encourage people to work together to address health disparities.
We also stand up against racism, and we need your help. When you stand up against gender discrimination, I stand strong, and I stand strong against all other forms of inequality.
Now is the time for us to stand up and collectively speak out against structural inequality.
You don&#39;t have to know all the answers to call for change.
It just takes courage.
The health of our patients and the health of all of us depend on it.
I&#39;d like to ask for a show of hands. Has anyone ever unfriended you on Facebook? Because that person said something offensive about politics, religion, parenting, food.
Do you have at least one person you avoid because you don&#39;t want to talk to them?
In the past, in order to have a polite conversation, all you had to do was follow the words of Professor Higgins in My Fair Lady and talk about the weather and your health.
Nowadays, with climate change and anti-vaccination sentiment, it&#39;s no longer a safe topic.
We live in a world where any conversation can turn into a controversy, where politicians can&#39;t talk to each other, where even the most trivial issues have people vehemently arguing for and against them. That&#39;s not normal.
A Pew Research Center survey of 10,000 American adults found that people are now more polarized and conflicted than ever before in history.
People aren&#39;t willing to compromise and don&#39;t listen.
And we decide where to live, who to marry, and who to be friends with based on what we already believe.
This also means not listening.
Conversation requires a balance between speaking and listening, and somewhere along the line we&#39;ve lost that balance.
Advances in technology are also a factor.
Your cell phone is probably still in your hand or within reach.
According to the Pew Research Center, one-third of teens send more than 100 messages a day.
Most of them probably text each other more than they do face-to-face.
In the magazine &quot;Atlantic&quot;
There&#39;s an interesting article written by a high school teacher named Paul Barnwell.
he gave his students a communication task
I wanted to teach people how to talk about specific topics without using notes.
He writes, “I realized—”
&quot;Conversation is the most overlooked skill that teachers fail to teach.
Students spend hours every day exposed to ideas and other people through screens, but have little opportunity to develop their interpersonal skills.
This may sound strange, but we have to ask ourselves: Is there a more important skill in the 21st century than the ability to have a coherent and confident conversation?
I&#39;m a Nobel laureate, a truck driver, a billionaire, a kindergarten teacher, a head of state, a plumber.
I talk to people I like and people I don&#39;t like.
Personally, I talk to people with whom I don&#39;t agree at all.
But you can still have great conversations with them.
In the next 10 minutes, I&#39;ll teach you how to speak and how to listen.
You&#39;ve probably heard all the secrets to conversation, like looking someone in the eye, thinking about a topic you&#39;re interested in beforehand, looking at the other person, chiming in, and smiling to show that you&#39;re paying attention to what they&#39;re saying. Repeat or summarize —
Please forget all about that
It&#39;s not useful
You don&#39;t need to learn how to appear as if you&#39;re paying attention, as long as you&#39;re actually paying attention.
(Applause) I use the skills I have as a professional interviewer in my everyday life.
I&#39;m going to teach you interview techniques, which will also help you become a better conversationalist. Learn how to have a conversation that doesn&#39;t waste each other&#39;s time, doesn&#39;t bore you, and doesn&#39;t hurt the other person.
We&#39;ve all had great conversations.
I know what it&#39;s like
It&#39;s the kind of conversation that makes you feel drawn in and inspired by the conversation, that you&#39;ve made a real connection with the other person, that you&#39;ve completely understood them.
There&#39;s no reason why most conversations can&#39;t be like that.
Let&#39;s take a look at the 10 basic rules of conversation. If you master even one of them, you&#39;ll be able to enjoy better conversations.
Part 1: “Don’t do “while””
It&#39;s not just about stopping playing with things like cell phones, tablets, and car keys.
It means that your body and soul are there.
Try to be in the moment.
Don&#39;t think about the argument with your boss.
Don&#39;t think about what to have for dinner.
If you want to leave the conversation, please do so, but please don&#39;t participate in only half of the conversation.
Part 2: Don&#39;t talk unilaterally
If you want to express your opinion without reaction, argument, counterargument, or opportunity for growth, write a blog.
The reason I don&#39;t put opinionated people on my show is because they&#39;re boring.
If you&#39;re a conservative, you hate Obama, you hate food stamps, you hate abortion.
If you&#39;re a liberal, you hate big banks, you hate oil companies, you hate Dick Cheney.
I completely understand what you&#39;re saying.
It won&#39;t have to be like that.
We need to approach the conversation with the attitude that we have something to learn.
Renowned therapist M. Scott Peck says, ``To really listen, you have to put yourself aside.&#39;&#39;
This means that sometimes you need to put your own opinions aside.
&quot;Feeling accepted makes the speaker feel less vulnerable and allows the listener to see the deepest parts of their hearts.&quot;
I repeat: Be ready to learn.
Bill Nye said, &quot;Everyone you meet knows something you don&#39;t know.&quot;
I would say, &quot;Everyone is an expert in something.&quot;
Part 3: Ask open-ended questions
Follow the example of a journalist
Ask questions starting with when/where/who/what/why/how
Even if you ask a complex question, you&#39;ll only get a simple answer.
If you ask me, &quot;Were you scared?&quot;
They respond to the most memorable word in the question, in this case &quot;I was scared,&quot; and the answer is either &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no.&quot;
&quot;Were you angry?&quot; &quot;Yes, I was very angry.&quot;
Let the other person explain it, because they are the ones who know.
The question I ask is, &quot;What was it like?&quot;
&quot;How did you feel?&quot;
That way, they&#39;ll have to stop and think, and you&#39;ll get a much more interesting answer.
Part 4: “Go with the flow”
Thoughts that come into your head must be let go.
You&#39;ve probably heard interviews like this one, where the guest has talked for several minutes, and then the host asks a question that&#39;s completely irrelevant or has been answered before.
The host must have stopped listening two minutes ago, thought of some clever question, and decided he had to ask it.
we are doing exactly the same thing
I was sitting down talking to someone, and I remember running into actor Hugh Jackman in a coffee shop.
and stop listening
Stories and ideas come to mind
Just let it float and disappear
Part 5: “If you don’t know, say you don’t know.”
People who appear on radio, especially on NPR, know that what they say will be recorded, so they&#39;re very careful when they say they&#39;re an expert on something or that they know something for certain.
Everyone please do the same. Just be careful.
Don&#39;t cheapen your story
Part 6: Don&#39;t equate someone else&#39;s experience with your own.
Don&#39;t bring up the story of losing a family member when the other person is talking about losing a family member.
Don&#39;t start telling people how much you hate your job when they&#39;re talking about problems at work.
My experience with the other person is completely different.
Every experience is individual.
More importantly, I&#39;m not talking about myself.
You don&#39;t have to take the opportunity to show how great you are or how needy you are.
When Stephen Hawking was asked about his IQ, he said, ``Well, bragging about your IQ is what losers do.&#39;&#39;
Conversation is not an opportunity for self-promotion [Conversation in the 21st Century]
&quot;How are you doing today?&quot; &quot;Check out my blog!&quot; Part 7: &quot;Don&#39;t say the same thing over and over again.&quot;
I&#39;m tired of being patronizing, but everyone tends to do it.
Particularly in conversations at work or with children, we repeat things in different words to prove that we&#39;re right.
please don&#39;t do that
Part 8: “Don’t pay attention to details”
Frankly, they don&#39;t care about the details, like the year, the name, the date, even though you might have a hard time remembering it.
They&#39;re not interested, they&#39;re interested in you.
Who are you and what do you have in common?
So let&#39;s forget the details, we don&#39;t need them.
Part 9: This is not the last thing, but it is the most important.
&quot;To listen&quot;
I can&#39;t tell you how many great people have said this, but listening is the most important skill anyone can develop.
This is a quote from Buddha, slightly paraphrased: ``When your mouth is open, you learn nothing.&#39;&#39;
Calvin Coolidge, the famously taciturn president, said, ``No one ever got fired for asking.&#39;&#39;
Why don&#39;t we listen to each other?
One is that I would rather talk than listen.
When I am speaking, I am in control.
You don&#39;t have to listen to things you&#39;re not interested in.
Be the center of attention
strengthen your identity
But there&#39;s another reason, too, because it&#39;s a distraction.
The average person speaks at a rate of 225 words per minute, but we can hear up to 500 words per minute.
Our consciousness tries to fill in the remaining 275 words.
It certainly takes effort and energy to keep someone&#39;s attention, but if you can&#39;t do that, you&#39;re not having a conversation.
It&#39;s just two people in the same place shouting unrelated words to each other.
we have to listen to each other
Author Stephen Covey puts it perfectly:
&quot;Many people do not listen to understand, but
I&#39;m listening and trying to answer.&quot;
There&#39;s another rule, number 10: Be concise.
[My sister says, &quot;Good conversation is like a miniskirt: short enough to be interesting, but long enough to cover the important points.&quot;] (Applause) Everything I&#39;ve said so far can be summed up in one thing. ``Being interested in someone&#39;&#39;
I grew up with a very famous grandfather, and it was a routine in my family.
A lot of people would come over to talk to my grandparents, and after the guests left, my mother would come over and ask, ``Do you know who that person is?&#39;&#39;
She became runner-up Miss America.
That person is the mayor of Sacramento.
She&#39;s a Pulitzer Prize winner and he&#39;s a Russian Ballet dancer.
That&#39;s why I believe everyone has something hidden and amazing.
I&#39;ve come to believe that this is what makes me a good presenter.
I try to keep my mouth shut and open my heart as much as possible, hoping to impress them, and I&#39;ve never been disappointed by that.
Everyone please do the same
Go out there, talk to people, listen, and most importantly, expect to be impressed.
thank you for listening
Hello
My name is Matthew Williams, and I&#39;m a champion.
I have won medals in three sports at national championships in Canada, participated in world-class basketball competitions, and had the honor of representing Canada at a world championship.
(Applause) I practice basketball and speed skating five days a week, and have a team of top coaches and mental performance consultants to help me do my best in competition.
By the way, this is all about the Special Olympics.
Will hearing that change the way you look at me and my achievements?
The world doesn&#39;t necessarily see people like me as champions.
Until recently, people like me were marginalized and not seen in public.
Much has changed since the Special Olympics began in 1968, but in too many cases, people with intellectual disabilities remain invisible to the wider world.
People don&#39;t think it&#39;s a bad thing to use discriminatory words in front of me.
They use the word &quot;retarded&quot; in a derogatory way.
I don&#39;t think about how much it will hurt me and my friends.
Don&#39;t think I&#39;m here to pity you.
I&#39;m here because there are still serious problems with the way the world views people with intellectual disabilities, and the problem is that in too many cases, we&#39;re blind.
Did you know that there was a world championship this year?
I was one of 6,500 athletes with intellectual disabilities from 165 countries who came to LA to compete.
More than 62,000 spectators watched the opening ceremony, which was broadcast live on sports television stations TSN and ESPN.
You didn&#39;t know about such a tournament, did you?
What do you think when you see someone like me?
My challenge to you is: can you see us as equals?
Special Olympics transforms both the self-identity of athletes with intellectual disabilities and the values of everyone who watches it.
For those who don&#39;t know, Special Olympics is for athletes with intellectual disabilities.
It&#39;s different from the Paralympics and the Olympics.
High-level sports competitions are held throughout the year for people with intellectual disabilities, changing the lives and values of those involved.
This changed my life and the lives of so many other people.
And the way the world views people with intellectual disabilities has changed.
I was born with epilepsy and an intellectual disability.
I played hockey from a young age until I was 12 years old.
As I grew older, it became more and more difficult to keep up with everyone else, which was frustrating and infuriating.
I completely stopped playing sports for a while. I didn&#39;t have many friends and I felt left out and sad.
In the past, people with intellectual disabilities were hidden from society.
None of us thought we could participate in sports, much less that we were valuable members of society.
In the 1960s, Dr. Frank Hayden, a scientist at the University of Toronto, studied the effects of regular exercise on the motor skills of children with intellectual disabilities.
Using rigorous scientific research methods, Dr. Hayden and other researchers concluded that children with intellectual disabilities have poor motor skills simply because they lack opportunities to participate in physical activity. ”
Exercise programs and participation in sports can be beneficial for people with intellectual disabilities.
Not many believed, but the pioneers, like Dr. Hayden and Special Olympics founder Eunice Kennedy Shriver, never gave up, and the athletes proved them right more than 4.5 million times. I got it
(Applause) Before I joined the Special Olympics, I was nervous because I was young, shy, lacked self-confidence, and didn&#39;t have many friends.
But when I went there, everyone encouraged me and supported me, and I was able to be myself without worrying about what other people thought of me.
Now, I&#39;m a basketball and speed skater, and I&#39;ve competed in state championships, national championships, and this year, I made it to the summer world championships in LA, the first Canadian basketball team to make it to the world championships. was a member of
(Applause) I&#39;m one of over 4.5 million athletes in the world, and I&#39;ve heard so many similar stories.
Being a Special Olympics athlete gives us back our pride and dignity.
Special Olympics also addresses important health needs for athletes.
Research shows that the average life expectancy for men with intellectual disabilities is 13 years shorter than for healthy people, and for women it is 20 years shorter.
But you can stay healthy by staying active and participating in the Special Olympics.
Our coaches will also teach you about nutrition and health.
Special Olympics offers free health checkups for athletes who have difficulty communicating with a doctor or have limited access to medical care.
At the 2015 Summer World Championships, my team, Team Canada, played against the Nigerian basketball team.
The day before the game, the Nigerian team underwent an on-site health check, and seven of the 10 members received free hearing aids, allowing them to hear clearly for the first time in their lives.
(Applause) There have been some incredible changes in the players.
I was able to enjoy the game more lively and play with confidence because I was able to communicate verbally with my coach.
Emotions were running high because I could now hear the ball, the whistle, and the cheering of the fans in the stands, sounds that we all deserve to hear.
Special Olympics athletes not only compete
Life outside the stadium will also change.
A survey released this year found that nearly half of American adults don&#39;t know anyone with an intellectual disability, and 44 percent of Americans have very low acceptance and negative attitudes toward people with disabilities. It seems that he is looking at it
Furthermore, the prevalence of such derogatory terms is evidence that people with intellectual disabilities are still invisible to too many people.
Everyone uses it casually or as a derogatory term.
The word &quot;retarded&quot; was tweeted over 9 million times last year, but it&#39;s a word that hurts me and my 4.5 million fellow athletes all over the world.
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s an insult to anyone, but I&#39;m wrong.
My fellow Global Messenger, John Franklin Stevens, wrote an open letter to political commentators who use derogatory language to say, ``Please come to the Special Olympics someday.&#39;&#39;
Please try it and see if you can go home without being moved.&quot;
(Applause) At the 2015 Summer World Championships, people lined up for hours to watch the final day of weightlifting competition.
With everyone standing, my teammate, Jackie Barrett, aka &quot;The Newfoundland Elk,&quot; deadlifted 297kg and squatted 277kg - (applause) significantly breaking her Special Olympics record.
Jackie is the Newfoundland weightlifting record holder, not just among Special Olympics weightlifters, but among all weightlifters.
He became a big star in LA, and ESPN live-tweeted his new record, so blown away by Jackie&#39;s performance.
Fifty years ago, almost no one thought that people with intellectual disabilities could do such things.
This year, 60,000 spectators filled the famous LA Memorial Coliseum to watch the opening ceremony of the world championships and to cheer on athletes from 165 countries around the world.
Far from being hidden, we were cheered on and celebrated.
Special Olympics teaches athletes to have confidence and pride.
It tells the world that people with intellectual disabilities deserve respect and inclusion.
(Applause) I now have athletic accomplishments and dreams, I have a great coach, I have respect and dignity, I am healthier than ever, and I aspire to be a personal trainer.
(Applause) I&#39;m no longer hiding or being bullied. I&#39;m here now giving a TED talk.
(Applause) Special Olympics has changed the world, but we still have a long way to go.
Next time you see someone with an intellectual disability, please take a look at their abilities.
If you see someone using a discriminatory word, please tell them how terrible it is.
And I want you to think about getting involved with the Special Olympics.
(Applause) I&#39;d like to say one last thing.
Nelson Mandela said, ``Sport has the power to change the world.&#39;&#39;
Special Olympics is truly changing the world, giving 4.5 million athletes the opportunity to reinvent themselves, have a place to feel confident, make friends, avoid being judged, feel like a champion, and actually become a champion.
thank you
Kenema in Sierra Leone Arua in Nigeria Have you ever heard of such place names?
It&#39;s the most unique place for me.
In hospitals there, nurses, doctors, and scientists have been quietly fighting for years against one of humanity&#39;s deadliest enemies: the Lassa virus.
Lassa virus is very similar to Ebola virus
It causes high fever and can sometimes be fatal.
But by risking their lives every day to protect people in their local communities, they protect us all.
But when I went there many years ago, the thing that struck me most was that every morning they would begin their very grueling days on the front lines with a song.
Everyone comes together to express joy
Show your vitality
It&#39;s been so much fun visiting each other over the years and getting together and singing and writing songs, because we&#39;re not just there to pursue science, we&#39;re all connected through a love of humanity.
I think you can imagine that as the situation changes, that becomes very important and essential.
That all changed in March 2014, when an Ebola outbreak was declared in Guinea.
This was the first outbreak in West Africa, near the border between Sierra Leone and Liberia.
we are afraid
In fact, for a while we thought Lassa and Ebola were more widespread than we thought, and that they might someday reach Kenema.
So members of my team jumped into action and joined Dr. Huma Khan&#39;s team to prepare sensitive viral RNA detection equipment to detect Ebola once it crossed the border into Sierra Leone.
We were already using equipment like this to fight the Lassa virus, so we knew how to do it, and our team was very talented.
All they had to do was give them the tools and the location to test for Ebola.
But unfortunately that day has come.
On May 23, 2014, a woman was admitted to the hospital&#39;s maternity ward and the team tested her for viral RNA, confirming Sierra Leone&#39;s first case of Ebola.
their work was very good
We immediately identified this case, treated the patient safely, and began contact tracing to understand the situation.
This could have stopped the spread of infection early.
But by that date, the outbreak had already been going on for months.
Hundreds of cases have occurred, surpassing previous outbreaks.
By the time we reach Sierra Leone, it&#39;s no longer just one case; it&#39;s a tsunami.
We worked together with the international community, the Ministry of Health, and Kenema authorities to fight this epidemic, and the next week we had 31 cases, then 92, then 147 cases - all of them coming to Kenema. Because there are limited facilities to treat this disease in Sierra Leone.
We worked 24 hours a day to do everything we could to save patients, raise awareness, and do one other simple thing.
Of course, the patient&#39;s blood samples that were collected to detect Ebola should have been discarded.
Instead, they inactivated the virus with chemicals, packaged the blood samples in boxes, and shipped them across the ocean to other research facilities.
I sent them to Boston, where my team is.
And then I worked day and night, working shifts every day, and quickly analyzed 99 Ebola virus zynoms.
The viral zynom is that blueprint.
Jimom is something that everyone has.
It represents the nature of everything that makes up who we are and contains a huge amount of information.
The results of this kind of work are simple but very powerful.
So by looking at these 99 viruses and comparing them to the three zynoms previously announced in Guinea, we were able to figure out that the outbreak started in Guinea many months ago, first infecting humans and then transmitting it from person to person. has spread
This is really important to figure out how to intervene, but then what&#39;s important is contact tracing.
We found that the virus mutates as it spreads between humans.
It&#39;s very important to look at each of these mutations because diagnostic equipment, vaccines, treatments, all of these things are fundamentally built on dinomy sequences.
Global health experts need to develop countermeasures and recalibrate all of their achievements.
At that time, how I worked as a scientist was to first accumulate data, then spend months upon months in the laboratory, carefully and carefully analyzing the data, and publishing research papers over and over again. After repeating this process, it was decided that once the paper was published, the data would be made public.
This is the current state of research flow among scientists.
But you couldn&#39;t have done that, could you?
My friends were on the front lines, and what was very clear was that we needed help, and we needed a lot of help.
So the first thing we did was, as soon as the zinom sequence was read, we published it on our website.
I just sent the data out to the world as is and said, ``Please lend me your help.&#39;&#39;
And help came
In the blink of an eye, we were hearing from people all over the world who were shocked to see the data published.
The world&#39;s best virus tracking team suddenly joins us.
We began collaborating virtually, continuing to exchange phone calls and emails, tracking the virus minute by minute and figuring out how to stop its spread.
There are many ways to create a community during such an emergency.
Especially as the outbreak began to spread globally, everyone was actively looking into it, getting involved, and trying to help.
I wanted everyone to be involved.
The capabilities of these people all over the world are truly amazing, and the Internet connects us all.
Imagine, instead of seeing each other as a threat and avoiding each other, everyone said, ``Let&#39;s do this.&#39;&#39;
They say, ``Let&#39;s work together to solve this.&#39;&#39;
The problem was that the data we were all using was very limited and insufficient, just from internet searches.
When that happens, so many possibilities and opportunities are lost.
At the beginning of the Kenema outbreak, we had collected 106 medical records, and we decided to share them with the world.
And in our lab, we were able to demonstrate that by training a computer to learn from those 106 cases, we could predict the prognosis of Ebola patients with near 100% accuracy.We then passed this information on to medical personnel working in the field.
We&#39;ve created an app to provide this service, but in order for that app to be fully effective and to prove it,
106 data was simply not enough, so we were waiting for more data to arrive before release.
But the data didn&#39;t come easily.
Everyone was researching, thinking, and waiting on their own, but everyone was stuck in silos and not using the power of collaboration.
But something like this can&#39;t happen.
Don&#39;t you think so? I&#39;m sure you all think so too.
our lives are at stake
In fact, many lives were lost, including medical personnel and five of my dearest colleagues: Bal Fony, Alex Mogboi, Dr. Huma Khan, Alice Koboma, and Mohamed Fuller.
They were five of the thousands of medical personnel who died in and around Kenema, and while the rest of the world waited, we all worked together in silence.
Ebola, like other threats to humanity, thrives on suspicion, drag, and discord.
When we build walls between us and fight each other, the virus grows stronger.
But unlike other natural threats, the fight against Ebola concerns us all equally.
we are fighting together
If one person gets Ebola, they can quickly spread it to someone else.
Now, our lives are just as fragile, we have the same vitality, we have the same fears and hopes, and I hope that we can work together with joy.
One of the graduate students I supervised read a book about Sierra Leone and discovered that the word ``Kenema,&#39;&#39; the name of the city where our hospital is located, is actually a word from the Mende people of Sierra Leone, ``Clean as a river. I learned that it means ``It also appears transparent.&#39;&#39;
And that had a very deep meaning to me, because even before I knew it, we had always tried to respect the people of Kenema, to share information and work together in an open environment.
that&#39;s important
When an outbreak occurs, we need to openly share information with ourselves and those around us in order to fight it together.
This is by no means the first Ebola outbreak, nor will it be the last. There are many other microbes out there, like the Lassa virus.
And the next outbreak may occur in large cities with millions of people.
May be an airborne virus
Viruses may be spread intentionally
This is very frightening, and of course it is, but at the same time, what this experience has taught us is that we have the technology and the capacity to overcome it, and that we can win the battle against viral infections and gain the upper hand.
But it&#39;s only possible if we work together, and let&#39;s do it with joy.
Dr. Khan, who died in the fight against infectious diseases, and all those who lost their lives on the front lines, they have been fighting alongside us, and we will continue to fight this battle together with them.
Let us illuminate the world with the cooperation of billions of warm hearts and compassion so that the world will not be swayed by the destruction caused by a single virus.
thank you
