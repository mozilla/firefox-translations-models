For Marly, it's the fifth CEP in four years.
Last month the President's Committee recommended the resignation of their former European Commission as part of the steps to move the country toward a new election.
This committee was a counter-resistence protest that began in October, and it was a counter-resident that President Martinez struck at the spread of the opposition protest.
This protest action, which sometimes becomes violent, was triggered by the failure of the scheduled elections, and it took place after 2011.

In a survey of 1,400 people before the federal election in 2010, there was an 8% increase in opposition to Australian republicization than in 2008.
The temporary Prime Minister Julia Girard insisted that Australia should move to the Republic after the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign in the federal election in 2010.
In a poll, 34 percent agree with this opinion, and Queen Elizabeth II wants to be Australia's last monarch.
In a poll, 29 percent of people who think that Australia should be a republic as soon as possible should not be a republic, 31 percent and both extremely extreme.

Professor Curtis Cooper of computer science, a mathematician at Central Missouri University, discovered on January 25 the largest prime number known.
This discovery was verified by early February by a few people using different hardware and software and released on Tuesday.
Comets may have formed proteins, carried life-supporting organics, and provided water for the earth.
Scientists want to understand how planets formed and especially the earth formed since comets collided with Earth long ago.
Mr. Toy, 53 years old, who started his post as governor earlier this year and signed a bill for legalizing same-sex marriage last month.

It is estimated that he will run for president in 2016.
The FAA claims that NextGen is a system that allows aircraft to fly a short-range route, save millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
In contrast with conventional ground radar technology, controllers are able to identify aircraft more accurately and provide more accurate information to pilots.
There is no special transportation, and trains on the ground don't stop in Wembley, and there are no parking lots or park and slide facilities on the ground.
Concern about the lack of transportation has led to the possibility that the team's porters will be forced to compete in a closed room without a gathering.
A study published in Science magazine Thursday reported that new species of birds were born in the Galápagos Islands in Equestria.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that this new species evolved in just two generations, but it was thought that this process would take longer than that, since it was a breeding process of unique species of Galápagos Finch and native Osson Finch.
Gold is a metal that can be made into all shapes. It can also be rolled into small pieces.
You can pull it into wire, twist it, and weave it. If you push it or hold it back, it can also be a board.
You can stretch it very thin and paste it into other metals. You can also make it thin enough to be used for decorations in a hand-drawn drawing drawing called "color copying."
This is called a chemical pH. You can make a test paper out of a purple cabbage juice.
The cabbage juice reacts to chemicals and changes color depending on whether it is acidic or alkaline.
The pH level is shown by the amount of hydrogen ions in the tested chemicals.
The hydrogen ions are protons that have removed electrons, because the hydrogen atoms are made up of protons and electrons.)
I'm going to come up with two dry powders, and I'm going to grab them with my clean, wet hands.
The water in your hand reacts to the outer layer, makes you feel strange, and forms a kind of shell.
In the cities of Halarpper and Mohejodillo, sewers were maintained, and almost every home had a toilet.
The remains of sewers have been found in homes in the cities of Minoa on the Greek island of Crete and Santoliny.
There were bathrooms in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, it was also set up as part of a crowded bathhouse.
If you call someone who is thousands of miles away, it automatically becomes a call via a satellite.
The satellites in space receive calls and reflect them almost instantly.
The satellite was sent by rocket to space. The reason scientists use telescopes in space is because the earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and view that penetrates the human view.
To launch satellites and telescopes into space, you need a giant rocket 100 feet high or more.
This wheel has changed the world incredibly. The greatest achievement this wheel has brought to us is that it has made transportation much more comfortable and fast.
Trains, cars, and many other means of transportation came from there.
Below it are many middle-class cats that eat the medium-sized prey from rabbit to deer and deer.
Finally, there are a lot of insects, rodents, lizards, birds, and so on.
The secret of the success is the concept of Nitch, which means that each cat has a special job to do and doesn't compete with other cats.
Lions are the most social cats and live in large groups called pride.
Pride consists of males and more than 30 females and children who are related to one another.
Usually, the females are related to each other and form large families of sisters and daughters.
The pride of lions shows a behavior similar to that of a pack of wolves and dogs, while animals resemble amazing lionesses and other big cats, and do not miss prey.
A very balanced, athletic tiger can climb, swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the force of a tough man.
The tiger belongs to the same animal group as lions, leopards and Jaguars. Only these four large cats can fly.
The tiger's sting is not a lion's cry, but rather a threatening threat.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, birds, and so on. Most of the game they hunt is much smaller than they are.
Scientists believe that the ocelot finds and pursues a place where the ground smells like a prey.
I'm extremely good at night vision, and I'm very good at sneaking around. Ocelots melt around, fly on prey, and hunt.
If (the number of small groups of creatures) were to move away from the large population that belonged to them, such as mountain ranges and rivers, to new islands that could not be easily returned, then you will often find yourself in a different environment.
In this new environment, there are competitors different from different resources, so new groups may need different features and adapts and be powerful competitors.
The original group hasn't changed at all, and it still needs to adapt as it used to be.
As new groups begin to adapt to new environments, as the years go by, they begin to look different from other groups.
In the end, after thousands of years and millions of years, two groups of people will look so different.
We call this process species formation, which simply means the formation of a new species. The formation of species is an inevitable result and an important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe, and take in carbon dioxide that they throw out (as a breath of air by humans).
Plants make food from the sun by photosynthesis. They also make shade.
We make our homes out of plants and clothing from plants. Much of the food we eat every day is plants. Without plants, animals cannot live.
Mossor salmon was the top predator of that era, so there was no one else to be afraid of but Mossalus.
That long jaw has more than 70 sharp teeth, and the palate has another set of teeth, which means there is no way out of here.
I don't know for sure, but he may have been two-toned, branched tongues. He may have eaten turtles or big fish, or had a common meal, or other Moss salmon.
And they will attack anything that comes into the water, and they will not oppose giant dinosaurs like Tyrannosaurs.
Most of their food is familiar to us, but the Romans ate poor goods and exotic tastes, such as warthogs, jackals, snails, and rodents called rats.
Another difference is that while the poor and the women sat down to eat, the rich men preferred a banquet where they slept and ate at ease.
The ancient Roman diet could not have included food from America and Asia to Europe in the centuries to come.
For example, there were no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, no ancient Romans who tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built their first temple to each of the gods, and it was considered a house of the gods.
People sacrificed sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to fulfill the gods' wishes through rituals and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then only a priest could enter it.
As part of the temple, a special pyramid - type tower - called a ziggurat - was built.
The topmost part of the tower was a special sanctuary for God.
Houses weren't so important to people living in the mild climate of the Middle East.
The Hebrew family lived mostly outdoors.
The women cooked in the garden, and the shops were just a stand on the street. Stones were used in the architecture of the house.
Because there was no large forest in the land of Canaan, wood was very expensive and valuable.
Greenland was a remote area, according to the tradition of northern Europe, when the red-headed Reek was expelled from Iceland for murder and when he went west, he discovered Greenland and was named Greenland.
But regardless of his findings, the Eskimo tribes already lived there at the time.
No country can be "Scandinavia," but there was a significant difference between Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Iceland's nationality, monarchy, customs and history.
Anyone who has seen the movie "The National Trader" may think there is a treasure map in the back of the American Declaration of Independence.
But it wasn't. There was something on the back, but it wasn't a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence was the title "The Original Book of Independence on July 4, 1776. "
I don't know who wrote it, but it turns out this large parchment was stored in its early practical form, 29.75 inches by 24.5 inches.
That's why it tends to be added simply as a label.
The D-day landing plan and the subsequent battle have freed northern France, but the South has not yet been released.
The governors were the French from Bissie. They were the French who, in 1940, made peace with the Germans and did not fight the invaders but helped the invaders.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, and their invasion was called Operation Drogoon.
In just two weeks, the U.S. Army and the Free French had released southern France and were on their way to Germany.
A civilization is a culture, or society, shared by large groups of people who live and work together.
The term civilization comes from the Latin word civiris, meaning citizens, its Latin noun for citizens, its Latin noun civivis, its city or city state, and its noun cyavitas, which defines the scale of society in some way.
A city nation is the predecessor of a nation. A culture of civilization means a succession of generations of knowledge, a survival of cultural footprints, and a fair spread of cultural footprints.
Cultures that fall from mainstream sources often disappear without being recognized as a formal civilization, and there is no historical evidence left.
During the Revolutionary War, 13 states first formed a weak central government based on joint agreement, which was the only component of the Congress.
Even though Congress didn't have the authority to tax taxes, and there were no state agencies or legal agencies, they relied on state authorities to do all the things they did, often the state authorities were uncooperative.
We didn't even have the authority to disable tax laws and tariffs between states.
Reconciliation of the terms required agreement from all states, but each state looked down on the central government, so it was often absent from delegates.
The Italian soccer champion, along with the German representative, is the second best team in the world and has won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
The popular sports include soccer, basketball, ballet balls, water balls, football, football, hockey, ice hockey, roller hockey, F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are very popular in the northern part of the country, giving Italian players to compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has some 7,000 islands, the largest in the state and the seventh largest in the world.
Since Japan is an island group, geographically it is often referred to as "City Island."
Taiwan began in the 15th century when European sailors called this island "Irha Formosa" (a beautiful island).
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company founded itself in the Southwest of Taiwan, changed native grain production, and hired Chinese workers to work on the rice and sugar plans.
In 1683, the forces took control of the western and northern coasts of Taiwan and declared Taiwan to be the Ministry of Purification in 1885.
After the defeat of the First True War in 1895, in 1894, the government signed a subcommittee treaty and gave the sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures: the sundial, the Intiwatana, and the Temple Tower of the Sun, and the Temple of three windows.
Most of the buildings at the edge of complex facilities were rebuilt so that tourists could learn more about their old ways.
Machu Picchu has been restored to 30 percent by the time of 1976 and is still being restored.
For example, the world's most popular static film format was 35 mm, which by the end of the analog period was the main film size.
It's still being produced today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio inherits the image sensor format of a digital camera.
It's confusing, but the 35 mm test is actually the size of 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
Therefore, it is said that the simplest total number ratio divided by the aspect ratio of this form is 3:2.
Many of the general form of recording (e.g. APPS, for example) are equal or closer to this aspect ratio.
Although some people seem to take it lightly, it's a simple way of creating dynamicism while maintaining video order.
The most effective position to place the main subject is to see a partial example around the intersection of a line divided by a three-thirds vertical.
The Catholic Church, which has become rich and powerful in European history, has come to have a hard look at this time.
Christianity has united European countries of different languages and customs for over a thousand years.
The universal power affected everyone from the king to the common people.
One of the main doctrines of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's fund is special for that purpose.
The central power of the church has been in Rome for over a thousand years, and the concentration of power and money has led many people to question whether its doctrine is being met.
Not long after the opposition had begun, Britain began to seal the sea against Germany.
Although this strategy is effective and cuts off vital military and civilian supplies, it violated international laws that were generally recognized by international agreements of the past two centuries.
In order to prevent the ships from entering the sea, Britain set lightnings on public seas and even threatened neutral ships.
Because of the limited response to this tactic, Germany assumed a similar reaction to the unlimited underwater battle.
In the 1920s, the ideas prevalent in most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolation.
When the nations saw the misery and cruelty of the war during World War I, they hoped that they would not get into that situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla went to America to get a job with Edison in New York.
From a collection of poems and pre-workers Charles Batcher's letter to Thomas Edison, I passed it on to the United States with almost nothing.
Ancient China had its own age difference, and each stage of Chinese history, or family in power, became a distinctive dynasty.
Also, there was a time of instability between separated regions. The best known of these times is the three-king period, which lasted for 60 years, between China and China.
In times like these, many noblemen fought fierce battles over the throne.
Three-nations were one of the bloodiest years in ancient Chinese history. Thousands of people fought in the struggle for the highest position in the Great Palace of West Shore.
There were many social political influences, including the adoption of the metric system, the transfer from absolute to republic, the belief that the country belongs to the people, not to a single ruler.
After the revolution, jobs became public applicants, qualified all men, and the most eager and successful people could get a job.
The same can be said in the military, because it's not a class based on the military class, but it's a class based on ability.
The French Revolution stimulated many of the oppressed working classes in other countries, and revolutions began in different countries.
Muhammad was deeply interested in problems beyond his daily life. For meditation, he often visited a cave called "Hera" in the mountain of Noor.
The caves that have remained beyond the ages are a vivid reminder of Muhammad's spiritual devotion.
The cave is at the top of the mountain north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the outside world.
In fact, it's not easy to find a cave even if you know it exists. Once you enter it, it's a completely quarantined space.
There is nothing to be seen except the clear, clear sky above and the many mountains surrounding it. Out of the cave, you can hardly see the outside world, and you can hardly hear the outside world.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only surviving thing in the Seven Wonders.
The Great Pyramid built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.
There are many pyramids, the largest of them, and small graves, temples, and great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid is a huge tomb built in honor of King Pharaoh Koff, and many of the small pyramids, tombs, and temples around it honor the wife and family of the King Khu.
The up-bow mark looks like a V letter, and the lower bow mark is like missing a hockey needle or a base of a rectangle.
Up is to press the bow from the tip and down is to pull the bow from the position where the bow is held by the frog hand.
The up bow usually makes soft sounds, the bow lowers itself, the bow is stronger, and produces a voice that makes a point.
You can write a sign freely with a pencil, but let's keep in mind that there are musical reasons for the bow-shaped match that has been written. You should usually follow it.
On October 6, 1789, frightened King Louis XI, Queen Marie Antawanet and her two young children, age 11 Marie Terrez and 4-year-old Louis Charl, and his sister Elizabeth, the princess, was forced back from the palace of Versiail, by women in the market to become a mob.
In their carriages, they returned to Paris surrounded by mobs screaming at the king and queen and shouting threats.
The mob forced the king and the queen to open the carriage window.
Once, in front of the terrified queen, one of the mob shook the head of the royal guards who had been killed in the Palace of Versailles.
The Philippines paid for the conquest of the Philippines in the American imperial war.
They were forced to pay interest on bonds that had been sold under the name of the Philippine government through the Wall Street bank.
Of course, the surplus from long-term Filipino exploitation would have been the basis for U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Knights of Temple, we need to understand the context in which that order came.
The period in which this event occurred is called the Middle Ages, and it is generally the equivalent of the period in European history of the 11th, 12th, 13th century C.E., 1000 C.E.
It is customary to think of the medieval period as a historical segment between the Middle Ages and the Middle Ages, and that the Middle Ages ended by 1500.
Technological decision theory is a term that includes a broad range of ideas, beginning with technical advancements and technical norms, and that human destiny is driven by the exact meaning of the underlying logic in scientific laws and technology.
Most of the interpretations of technology decision theory share two generalities. For one, the development of technology itself is in itself a course far beyond cultural and political effects.
For example, it might be said that cars inevitably lead to road development.
However, since only a handful of cars do not match national road networks, new production methods are being developed to reduce car ownership costs.
The increase in car ownership leads to an increase in road accidents and, as a result, new technologies will be developed in the medical field to treat injured bodies.
Romanticism had a major element of cultural decision-making formed by writers from Goethe, Fhiste, and Schögel.
In the Romantic context, geography formed an individual, and as time went by, there were customs and cultures associated with the geography, and it was better than laws that harmonized with society and were forced by force.
Just as Paris is known in the modern world as the center of fashion, in Europe during the time of the seals, the Constantinol flourished as the center of fashion.
The fame as the center of a luxurious costume continued from around 400 B.C. and until about 1100 B.C.
In the 12th century, the rank was reduced mainly because crusaders returned with gifts of silk, spices, and other things that were more valuable than the market in Bizantin.
It was at this point that the title of the center of fashion moved from Constantinol to Paris.
The heyday of the Gothic period was in the 14th century by the 10th century.
The original appearance was strongly influenced by the Eastern Babylonian culture.
But because of the slow way of communication, Western styles may be 25 years behind 30 years.
Toward the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest advances of the time as a result of the Crusades was that I started using buttons to close clothes.
Self-sufficient farming is the form of farming that produces only enough food for farmers and their families.
Self-sufficiency farming is a simple system that combines the stored seeds that grow in ecological areas with ringmaking and other relatively simple technologies to maximize their yield, and often organic ones.
Historically, most farmers are self-sufficient farmers, and in many developing countries, they still tend to do so.
Sub-criticism is a culture where people of the same race, who feel that they are out of harmony with social standards and are neglected, come together to develop their own identity.
Sub-cartures can be determined by the age, ethnicity, class, location and gender of members.
The properties that determine sub-charging features may be language, beauty, religion, politics, geography, or combination of these elements.
Sub-carture members often show themselves to be part of a symbolic style, including fashion, manneticism, and hiding language.
One of the most common ways used to show the importance of socialization is to introduce a few unfortunate cases of children who, as adults, have been prevented from adapting to society by growing up, through neglect, misfortune, or willful abuse.
Children like these are called "Needs" or "Ferrardy Kid." They may be locked up in [their own] parents. They may also be caused by such neglect by parents who reject children with severe mental and physical disabilities.
Wildlings may be experiencing severe child abuse and trauma before they are abandoned or run away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals, while others are said to have lived in the wild on their own.
Animals that grow up in non-human animals, such as fear of humans or indifference to humans, show almost the same physical range of behavior.
The project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, but the scanner falling will go one step ahead.
It's not a way to learn, it's a way to use a new computer program, start a new project, and support those who have a new learning experience.
In other words, the teacher is a form of the scanner falling, and so is the Microsoft office clipboard.
The virtual scanners are built into this software and are designed to allow students to ask, instruct, and explain procedures that may be difficult for one another.
The reasons why children are put in foster homes range from child abuse to abuse and even blackmail.
Every child should grow up in an environment of child care, care, and education, but children grow up in an environment where they don't.
We recognize the foster system to be a safe zone for these children.
The foster system provides safe homes, loving children, sure education, and reliable health care.
In the foster system, we're supposed to provide all the essentials that were scarce in families before they were adopted.
The Internet is an environment with two elements: mass communication and human communication.
An outstanding feature of the Internet can lead to additional dimensions in terms of the approach to use and satisfaction.
For example, there's an important motivation for using the Internet: learning and socialization.
"Public Relationships" and "President Relationships" were identified as aspects of a new motivation when Energy & MacCordic) investigated the audience's response to the website.
The use of video recordings leads to important discoveries in interpreting facial expressions, or facial movement, which lasts only a few milliseconds.
In particular, he claims to be able to detect if the person is lying by interpreting the small expression correctly.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper "The President's Speech," points out that anyone with brain problems who can't understand his speech can appreciate honesty properly.
He even suggests that such ability to interpret human behavior may be common to dogs and other animals.
Studies in the 20th century have shown that genetic mutations have two gene pools of what is hidden and what has appeared.
Mutations add new genetic mutations and remove them from the mutiny pool where they are produced by selection.
Dwelling and modifying occur as they move between two pools each generation.
It's difficult for primates with digestive systems like humans to take in essential amino acids from the plant resources available in the savanna's environment.
And if you neglect it, it leads to such serious situations as growth control, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most readily available plant resources are proteins found in leaves and beans, which are hard to digest for primates like us.
On the other hand, animal food ants, termites and eggs are easily digested and also a good protein source containing all essential amino acids.
With all the points in mind, it's no wonder that our ancestors solved the protein problem like the chimpanzees in the savanna today.
A sleep interruption is a process of deliberately waking up during normal sleep hours and then falling asleep after a period of ten minutes.
It's easy to do this by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you back to consciousness without being completely awake.
When you realize that you will unconsciously stop the alarm, there are ways to put your watch on the other side of the room and try to keep it from getting out of bed.
Other ways based on biomass are to consume a lot of water before you go to sleep, especially water and diuretic tea, so that you have to get up to urinate.
The degree to which people show their peace of mind is the opposite of the degree of physical and mental tension.
The less tension, the more positive life force. Everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can open their senses. The only thing that will stop this goal is its own anxiety and negative feelings.
Although Tibet is a Buddhist religion based on Budda's teachings, it is extended by taking in a lot of technology from the mercy of the Great French Buddha and from yoga in India.
In principle, Tibet is a very simple Buddhist religion. It is made up of the way of love, which embraces Kundaniyoga, meditation, and everything.
Kundani yoga is a combination of yoga poses, breathing, mantras, moods, and so forth, to awaken Kundani (his soul).
The center of Tibet meditation is a divine yoga. By visualizing various gods, the energy channel will be cleansed, the chakra will be activated, and the consciousness will be created.
In World War II, Germany was a common enemy, and it led to the cooperation of the Soviet Union and the United States. After the end of the war, the two countries were at odds with each other through institutions, processes, and cultural conflicts.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies became enemies, and soon the Cold War began.
Then it went on for 40 years, and there was a real fight by a substitute army on the battlefields of Africa, Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and so on.
By September 17, 1939, Poland's defense had been broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reassemble along Romania's bridgehead.
But these plans became things of the past almost overnight, after more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Reds invaded the Eastern European region in violation of the R&amp;D, Soviet-inviolable and other international treaties.
Transporting goods by ship is the most efficient way to transport people and goods across the sea.
More than usual, the navy's job was to maintain its ability to transport its own people and goods and also to interfere with its ability to transport enemy people and goods.
The United States has tried to transport personnel and goods across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy was mainly using U-boats to stop this transport.
If the Allies had been defeated, Germany would probably have conquered England as well as any other country in Europe.
It is said that goat cattleization began about 10,000 years ago and centered in the west of Iran in the Zagros Mountains.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to have goats that were easy to take in easy access to milk, hair, meat, and skin.
Although cattle goats were generally left to pasture in hilllands and other pastures, goats usually were boys in charge of flocks. This custom continues today.
By the 16th century, in England, the road had already been set up.
The freight road was made of planks lined up in parallel, but by the horse pulling it, we were able to carry our luggage faster than the rough roads of those days.
The pillow tree was introduced quite early in order to hold the line track in place. In time, it became apparent that it would be more efficient if you set up an iron tip at the top.
This has become common, but iron caused the wear of the carriage's wooden wheels to go on.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first complete iron rail was introduced.
The first known means of transportation is walking, and mankind's upright walk began two million years ago at the appearance of Homo Erextas.
In Australopithecus, the direct ancestor, it wasn't the custom to walk upright for a period of time or longer.
Although Sahelandlops may have walked on two legs seven million years ago, the characteristics of bipeds have been identified by the fossilized Australopithecus, 3.9 million years ago.
You can start a more environmentally friendly life, join an environmental movement, and become an activist to reduce the suffering of the future to some extent.
In many cases, this is like a symptom therapy. However, we need not only to seek temporary solutions, we need to find the root cause of the problem and inert it.
It is quite clear that the progress of human technology has changed the world greatly, and that problems have been expanded due to overpopulation and a luxurious life.
After the election on July 4th, the handwritten drafts signed by President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thompson were sent to the printing of John Dunlap Company in a few blocks.
In one night, two hundred pieces were replicated, and now they're called "Dump Broadside."
The first public reading of this document was done by John Nixon in the garden of the Independent Memorial on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6 and was read to the military in New York on July 9. The other came to London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap Broadsides that are known to exist are the oldest copies of the existing works. The original manuscripts by hand are not present.
Today, many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survive and are alive today. We call them birds.
Many people don't think they're dinosaurs because they have wings and can fly.
But birds still look like dinosaurs in many ways.
I have scales and claws on my feet, I'm an embryo, and I walk with two hind legs, like Tyrannosaurs.
Practically all computers used today are based on the operation of information signed by binary numbers.
The binary numbers are represented by either the two values (0 or 1) and these numbers are called binary numbers or bits because they use computer terms.
Internal addiction can't be immediately revealed. It can't be diagnosed immediately, since vomiting and so on are common symptoms.
The most obvious sign of internal addiction is that drugs and toxic household chemicals are open.
Look at the label of the poison and see if there's any first aid instructions for that particular poison.
Entomologists use the term insect species in a formal sense.
This name comes from the fact that bedbugs have spread to bed from ancient times as an insect that has a high capacity for adapting to human beings.
The sea turtles and bedbugs are both habitable, adapted to living in host nests and shelters.
The known cases of multiple sclerosis in the United States are said to be about 400,000, and they are known as the typical neuropathy of young and middle-aged people.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system of the brain, the spinal cord, and the optic nerve.
Studies have shown that women have twice as much chance of developing multiple sclerosis as men.
Some couples will decide that raising a child is of no benefit to either parent or child.
A couple like this can use an adoption system for the baby.
In the adoption relationship, the real parents lose custody and another couple can become the parents of the child.
The main purpose of science is to figure out how the world works by scientific means. In fact, this method is almost the key to scientific research.
But that's not all. Experiments are tests that are used to eliminate more than one possible hypothesis, and questions and observations are also the key to scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers were focused on classical books, especially the Bible in Latin.
What was accepted was the view of Aristotle on every subject of science, including psychology.
As Greek knowledge declined, I realized that the Western world was cut off from the roots of Greek philosophy and science.
Much of the rhythms observed in physiological and behavioral sciences are often determinedly dependent on the existence of an internal cycle and how it is carved through the internal clock.
Periodic rhythms are recorded on most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, not just on a periodic response from outside.
The internal clock is an independent shaker that, without external signals, continues to circulate freely for a period of time.
Her and Chase's experiments were one of the most powerful experiments that suggested that DNA is a genetic material.
The DNA was implanted in the bacteria by using (Hacey and Chase's Purge virus).
They tried two experiments, one marked Farge's DNA with radioactive phosphorus, and the other experiment marked his protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the fragment of the affected genetic material, or whether the affected cells are reproductive cells.
The only mutations that occur in reproductive cells are mutations inherited by the child, and mutations in other parts may cause cell death or cancer.
Tourism, which emphasizes contact with nature, attracts people interested in visiting the natural regions for the purpose of enjoying the scenery, including wild plants.
For example, local activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird-watching, parks, and information research on ecosystems.
For example, you can visit or take pictures or learn from Orangutan on the island of Volneo.
Those who leave a small country town every morning and head to work are different from those who have a job near their destination.
In this dynamic round and round transport, everyone is connected and supported in some way by a system based on his own car.
Science now shows that by means of this massive carbon economy, science has removed from one of the stable conditions that has contributed to man's evolution over the past two million years.
Every social worker uses transportation. Almost all of them are dissatisfied with the transportation system.
In developed countries, little is heard of complaints about water quality or the collapse of bridges.
Why does the transportation system create such complaints and break down on a daily basis? Is it just a poor transportation engineer? Or is there a more fundamental problem?
Traffic Research is a study of the interaction between individual drivers and vehicle movements between the two points.
Unfortunately, the driver's behavior cannot be predicted with 100% probability, so it's difficult to study the flow of traffic.
Fortunately, the driver tends to act within a reasonable and consistent range, so the flow of traffic tends to have some reasonable consistency, and it can be expressed mathematically in large measure.
The relationship has been established between the three main characteristics: flow, density, and speed, to make the traffic flow more appropriate.
These relationships are useful in planning, designing, and running road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly in the sky. Their ability to fly helped them avoid enemies and find food and companions efficiently.
Most insects are able to fold their wings along their bodies.
This spreads the width of the narrow space to hide from predators.
At present, the only insects that can't repeat the wings are the tonbo and the kaguero.
Thousands of years ago, a scholar named Alice Talcos said that the solar system moves around the sun.
Some people recognized his theory as correct, but many people believed that the sun and other stars (in the solar system) move around the earth.
Since it doesn't feel like the earth is moving, this makes sense, doesn't it?
The Amazon is the second longest and largest river on earth. The water is more than eight times as large as the second largest.
The Amazon is the largest river on earth, and in some places it is six miles wide.
Twenty percent of the water flowing from the river on earth to the sea flows from the Amazon.
The main stream of the Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers long. 3,980 miles. This river collects water streams from thousands of small rivers.
The construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the old kingdom, but Giza's pyramids exceeded others with the technical superiority of their size and construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the new kingdom were amazed at the architecture of their predecessors, which was then built over a thousand years ago.
The population of Vatican City is about 800. It's the smallest independent country in the world and also the smallest.
In Vatican City, Italian is used for law and official communication.
The everyday language used by most people working in Vatican City is Italian, and Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
The basic chemical elements, such as gold, silver, and copper, have been found to have been highly prized from ancient times, and they can both be found in natural forms and can be mined relatively easily with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle said that everything is made up of a mixture of more than one of the four elements. The four elements are soil, water, air and fire.
His theory also suggested that they transform into new materials to form something that looks like this world.
A alloy is basically a mixture of more than one kind of metal. Please remember the many elements on the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are metals such as silver and gold.
Also, those that contain very small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon, are classified as alloys.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
An atom is too small to imagine, so it could contain trillions of atoms in the last period of this sentence.
So, when the pencil came out, it was a good friend for many people.
Unfortunately, with the advent of a new writing system, the position and use of pencils began to decline.
Now more people enter messages on the computer screen and no more pencil sharpeners are needed.
I wonder what would happen to the keyboard if there were more new things to come.
A nuclear bomb works on the principle that a nucleus needs energy to collect many protons and neutrons.
It's like rolling a heavy cart and climbing up a hill. If you split the nucleus again, some of its energy will be released.
Some atoms have unstable nucleuss, and their nucleus tends to divide even if they do little or nothing.
The moon's surface is made of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The thickness of the earth's crust is about 70 kilometers to the front and about 100 kilometers to the back.
The sea is thin and the high ground is thick.
The earth's crust is thin, so sometimes the oceans will increase in the neighborhood. The lava has made it easier to float up.
The content theory is centered on finding something that tickles people's minds and appeals to them.
These theories suggest that as people mature during their adult life, they have certain needs and desires that are built into them.
In these theories, we're going to consider why some people want to do certain things on a daily basis and environmental factors that they wouldn't want to do or let them do certain things.
The popular theory of content is the two factors in the U.S. law of desire and Hertsberg theory.
Generally speaking, if management is leading a former partner, there may be two ways to act. One is to try to remain "one of your partners."
Administrators of this type are not good at making decisions that will buy a bad name, and such things as punishment, performance assessment, responsibility, and identification of responsibilities.
On the other hand, what's at the other end of it is that those who feel that they have to change everything that the team's been doing have to do with their own hands are going to change into individuals that they can't recognize.
After all, the leader will eventually take responsibility for the failure of the team.
This behavior often causes cracks between the leader and the rest of the team.
The virtual team requires the same level of superiority as the traditional team, but there's a subtle difference.
The members of the virtual team often act as the window for the immediate physical group.
Virtual teams sometimes hold meetings to fit in with the time zone, but because that's hard to understand by the management on the ground, members are more likely to be autogenic than traditional team members.
The real "invisible Team" is also a unique element of the virtual team.
An invisible team is a management organization that is the head of each member. An invisible team sets the criteria for each person.
Why does an organization want to pass through a slow process of establishing a learning organization? One of the purposes of implementing the concept of organization learning is innovation.
If all available resources are used effectively across the functional sector of the organization, creativity and initiative may be born.
As a result, the process in which organizations work together to overcome obstacles may lead to a new and innovative process to meet customer needs.
For an organization to be innovative, leadership must create an innovation culture as well as a sharing of knowledge and organization learning.
Angel describes a continuous approach as a way to help the organization reach a higher level of performance in 2006.
The neurobiological data provides physical evidence for the theoretical approach to cognitive research. This narrows the area of research and allows more accurate research.
The correlation between brain disease and behavior supports the research of scientists.
It's been found for a long time that brain damage, trauma, disease, tumor impacts behavior and changes part of mental function.
New technologies have enabled me to see and examine brain structures and processes that have never been revealed.
This gives us a lot of information and materials that will help us to build simulation models to understand human mental processes.
Even though AI has a strong SF meaning, it forms a very important field in computer science, and machines handle behavior, learning, and intellectual adaptivity.
AI studies involve the making of machines that automate tasks requiring intelligent behavior.
To give an example, there are controls, planning, schedules, responses to customer diagnostics and questions, as well as handwriting, audio, and facial recognition.
Such things have become another field of focus on solving real life problems.
At present, the AI system is built into a part of a home computer and video game software, while it is used at high frequency in economics, medicine, engineering, and military fields.
Most of the class is in the suburbs. The teacher will try to take the students to places where they can't go on a bus trip quite often.
Technology provides you with a method of learning through virtual social studies. Students can be in their classrooms and see museum crafts, visit aquariums, and admire beautiful art.
It's also a wonderful way to share foreign learning in a virtual way, to look back on your trip and to share experiences in future classes.
For example, the Bennett School students in North Carolina make weekly websites on travel to the state capital. The websites are revised every year, but the old sites are stored online so that they can view them as scrapbooks.
Blogs can also help improve the student's writing ability. Students who have just started writing a blog tend to be more grammar and spelling, but reading makes a difference.
Since students are often the most critical readers, blog writers begin to try to improve their writing so as to avoid criticism.
And writing a blog allows students to become more familiar with the world around them. (Tototo, 2004)
A blog is a tool to promote collaboration and encourage students to extend their learning range beyond traditional classrooms.
With proper use of blogs, "the students' analysis and criticism will improve. By actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their position in the context of others and show their own views on specific issues."
Ottawa is the attractive capital of Canada, where two languages are spoken, and there are many museums and museums that introduce Canada's past and present.
Then there's Niagara Falls in the south, and there's Muscoka in the north and other unaided beauty in the north.
Thanks to all of this, the state of Ontario is considered by third party to be a very Canadian-like state.
There are also large areas in the north where there are few populations and few native populations.
A surprising population comparison by many: The number of African-Americans living in the United States is greater than the number of Canadians.
The East African Islands are in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest island in the group, and its own continent as a habitat for wildlife.
Most of the small islands are independent countries or countries related to France, and there are also famous high-end beach resorts.
And the Arabs brought Islam to this land, which was widely accepted by the Comoros and the Malaysians.
In the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the route to India through the Cape of Good Hope from Europe, European influence and colonialism began.
The north connects the Sahel border, and the south and the west are surrounded by the Atlantic.
It is recommended that female tourists declare themselves married, regardless of their actual marriage relationship.
It's effective if you keep (the ring doesn't look too expensive).
Women should recognize that cultural differences tend to lead to what is called harassment, and it is not uncommon for women to be tailed or to grab their arms.
(When you refuse a man's invitation, don't hesitate to take your stand firmly.) (You don't need to take on a strong invitation, whether there's a difference in culture or not.))
The foundations of Casablanca's modern city were built in the 10th century B.C. by the Berbers fishermen called Anfa. Then the Cypriots, the Romans, and the Melnids used it as a strategic port.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it and named it Casa Blanca, but after the earthquake in 1755, they finally abandoned the city.
The city was rebuilt by the Sultan of Morocca as Darl Buddy, and was named Casablanca by the Spanish trade trader who founded a trading base.
Casablanca is one of the most difficult places to enjoy shopping in Morocco.
It's easy to find places around old Medina to sell the traditional products of Moroccans, like taddin, pottery, leather products, hooks, and so on, but they're all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city of the Democratic Republic of Congo in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of Niragongo volcano, and most streets, especially the center of town, were buried.
Goma is quite safe, but if you visit a place other than Goma, you need to look into the battle situation that follows in North Kivu.
This city is the base of mountain climbing to Nyragongo volcano and is one of Africa's lowest places to track mountain gorillas.
You can use the Bodaboda bike taxi for moving in Goma. The fare is about 500 Congofinos at a short distance.
The name "Tinbuktu" has become a metaphor for exotic and faraway lands, as well as a place that is not easy to reach.
Today Timbuktu is a tourist attraction from its reputation, and it has airports, but it's a poor town.
In 1990 it was added to the list of dangerous world heritages to protect itself from desert sand threats.
It was one of the main stopovers at the PBS special show by Henry Lewis Gates.
This city has more Arabic than African cities, and it is in contrast with other cities in the country.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa, runs along the border of Mozambique in the east and Zimbabwe in the north, and the southern border is the Crocodil River.
The area of the park is divided into 14 ecosystems across a distance of 1,500 km and 14 miles, and there are different wildlife living in different regions.
This is one of South Africa's main tourist attractions and is described as the eyepiece of South Africa's National Park.
Like all national parks in South Africa, this park costs protection and entrance fee every day.
Buying wildcards can be useful. You can enter the main park in South Africa or all national parks in South Africa.
Hong Kong Island is, according to its name, Hong Kong's territory and a place where many tourists visit as a tourist attraction.
The buildings that line Hong Kong's horizon are likened to a grisly bar graph by the presence of Victoria Harbour's water.
To see the best view of Hong Kong, let's get off the island and head for the Waterfront of the Nine Dragon.
The urban development of Hong Kong Island is concentrated mostly on the drylands along the north coast.
This is where the British colonial rulers took their territory, so if you want to look for proof of colonialism, you should start here.
The Sundalbans are the world's largest coastal mangrove, extending from the coast to the interior regions of Bangalore and India (80 km / 50 miles).
The Sundalban Mountains are registered to the world heritage of Yunesko. Part of the forest in India is called Sundarbans National Park.
This forest is not just a swamp where mangroves grow. The forest includes the last place to find the vast jungles that once covered the Hindu plains.
The area of the Sundarbans is 3,850 km (2,850 mi) and about a third of it is covered by water and swamp.
Since 1966, Sondahl has become a wild game reserve, and now estimated at 400 Royal Bengaltra and some 30,000 Axic deer live in it.
The bus leaves (through the central bus station and the river) all day long, but most buses, especially those headed east to the bus, and those traveling to Jakarl/ Bumtan, will depart between 6:30 a.m. and 7:30 a.m.
It is recommended to buy a bus ticket by the end of the few days, since the bus is often full.
Most of the districts have a Japanese coaster bus running, and they are both comfortable and sturdy.
If you want to move to a nearby location, it's convenient to use a taxi.
The Oyapok River Bridge is a slope bridge. This bridge on the Oyapok River connects Brazil's Oyakok and the city of San Jolju de Loyoc in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 m high and 378 m long, while the bridge has two lanes 3.50 meters wide.
The upper space below the bridge is 15 meters. It was built in August 2011 and was not opened until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to open in September 2017, and it is expected that the Brazilian customs checkpoint will be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous people living in what is now east of Paraguay. They lived as a hunting people of the semi-driven people and a self-sufficient farming family.
The Chaco area was inhabited by other indigenous peoples, the Guayckles and the Pajaguas, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, because of the encounter between the Spanish conqueror and the indigenous peoples, Paraguay was born.
When the Spanish colonial era began, it was three centuries into the future.
Ever since Asunion was founded in 1537, Paraguay has left much of its native properties and uniqueness behind.
Argentina is famous for having the world's best polo team and polo athletes.
The biggest convention this year will be held in December at the Polo Stadium in Alaskanitas.
Small tournaments and counterfights can also be watched here at other times.
Please check with Argentina de Polo about the schedule of the Polo tournament and where to buy tickets for the game.
Falkland's official currency is the FKP of the Falkland Islands (FKP), and a pound is fixed to the equivalent of a pound of one English pound.
The exchange can be made from the only bank on the island in Stanley, across from the FIC West.
British pounds are generally available anywhere on the island, and Stanley's credit cards and American dollars are often available.
On the remote island, you can use currency from Britain and the United States, but you probably can't use credit cards. Let's check with the owners in advance how you can pay them.
Since it's impossible to change Falkland currency after leaving the island, let's change it before leaving it.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it becomes summer in the Northern Hemisphere and winter in the Northern Hemisphere.
Montevideo is in the subtropics, and in the summer it is common to exceed 30 degrees Fahrenheit.
It's rarely below freezing, but the relationship between wind and humidity sometimes makes it feel colder than the temperature measured.
The rain season and the dry season are not particularly regular, but throughout the year the amount of rain is almost constant.
Many animals in the park are familiar with humans, but wild animals are so wild that you shouldn't feed them or be surprised.
Park authorities say that at least 100 yards from bears and wolves, and 25 yards from other wild animals!
Even if it looks like an adult, it can happen to Jason, the moose, the deer, the bear, and almost all the big animals.
Tens of tourists are injured because they didn't keep the right distance every year. Since these wild animals are big and potentially dangerous, let's keep them out of the territory.
Also, to attract wild animals, such as bears, avoid carrying and cooking smelly food and consider clean camps.
Apier is the capital of Samoa. This town is on Upolo and has fewer than 40,000 people.
Apier was built in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
This port is a famous place where the navy met when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave in 1889.
Except for one ship in England, all ships were sunk. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans were killed in this battle.
During the independent struggle organized by the Mau movement, the chief executive of the town's peaceful assembly, Tupua Tatassearofi III, was murdered.
Auckland has two ports and lots of beaches. The popular beach is divided into three areas.
The North Shore Beach North Harbor region is facing the Pacific Ocean, and it extends north from Long Bay to Devonport in the south.
Most of you can swim safely on the beach, and the shade of the popchikwa tree will shade you from the sun.
The tatki drive beach is located at Mission Bay and St. Heliès port.
These are sometimes crowded beaches for families, and there are many stores on the beach. You can swim safely.
The main local beer is called "No. 1" and is not an elaborate beer, but it is refreshing and comfortable. Another local beer is called "Manta."
It's easy to get French wine, but I'm going to try New Zealand and Australia wine because it's a busy trip.
There's no problem drinking water at all, but if you're afraid, you can easily get a bottle of water.
The concept of coffee is foreign to Australians. Short black is "Expresso" and cappuccino is not foam. The tea is served without milk.
Warm chocolate is a drink that meets Belgium's standards. It's expensive but very delicious.
Travel to the reef has been made all year long, and injuries caused by the above causes on coral reefs are rare.
Still, let's get advice from the authorities, guard all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
They live in 1770 north of October and April, near the coast and near the river entrance. I've seen them more than this time of year.
They are there, but they rarely attack humans. Most of them swim away in fear of humans.
The salt krill is not a place of activity in the sea, but its main habitat is the river mouth, north of Rockhampton.
If you make a reservation ahead of time, it will give the traveler a sense of security that he has a place to sleep when he reaches his destination.
Many travel agencies have signed with a specific hotel, but camps and other accommodations can also be reserved through travel agencies.
Normally, travel agencies provide breakfast, transportation arrangements to connect hotels with airports, or packages that combine airline tickets and hotels.
You can also reserve a reservation if you need time to get the time to think about your offer (such as other paperwork visas to take to the destination).
However, please contact the travel agency first, rather than the hotel directly for changes and requests.
According to the Festival, the majority of the participants at the concert are supposed to camp within the hall, and most of them consider it part of the important experience here.
If you want to experience a real experience, you have to establish a camp site where you can arrive early and hear the performance.
After the main stage music is over, remember that there may be sections in the festival that continue to play late into the night.
In some places, the festival has a special camp place for young children and their families.
If you want to cross the Northbalt Sea in the winter, please check your cabin position. In the cabin that is most affected by going through the ice, there's a terrible noise.
St. Petersburg's cruise includes staying in the city. Please check your visas.)
In casinos, we usually insist on having our guests spend as much time and money as possible on their guests. Normally, there are no windows, no clocks, and there are times when it's difficult to find a way out.
In casinos, we usually provide special drinks and entertainment. To make our guests comfortable, stay inside the facility.
In some places, we offer alcohol. But when we get drunk, our judgment is impaired. We know that it's important for any good gambler to stay sober.
If you drive through high latitudes and passes, you need to consider the possibility of snow, ice, and sub-ice.
Snowy roads and frozen roads have fewer frictions and can't drive on the asphalt road.
In a snowstorm, enough snow will fall in just a short time.
It can also be snowfalls, blows, and car windows covered with dew and ice, restricting vision.
On the other hand, in many countries ice snows are common, but traffic continues almost continuously all year round.
Safari is probably the best tourist attraction in Africa and is a sightseeing attraction for many tourists.
A Safari refers to a trip on land to observe wild animals in Africa, especially wild animals in savannas.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars, so you can observe clearly with standard equipment.
Lions, Chitors, and leopards are surprisingly timid, so they're going to use binoculars to make them look better.
I'm going to go around the Safari Zone for a few hours or even a few days.
Paralyn Pick is scheduled to be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some games are held throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only city in Asia that hosted the Summer Olympics twice since its opening in 1964.
If you have reserved a 2020 flight ticket or shelter before the delay was announced, you could get into trouble.
The canceling policies vary, but by late March most corona virus-related cancellation policies will not be extended until July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled.
The event ticket is a price zone of 130,000 yen, and the usual ticket is expected to be about 7000 yen.
In many hotels, ironing clothes makes it easier to dry. In many hotels, even if there are no irons and irons in the room, they will lend it to you if you ask them.
For example, if you don't have an iron or you want to iron it, you might want to use a dryer if you have a dryer.
(Be careful that the material doesn't get too hot. It causes the condensation, or if extremely hot, it's burned.)
There are various ways to clean water disposal, and there are advanced methods that are effective against certain risks that threaten the water quality of drinking water.
Some areas boil in one minute, others take minutes to boil.
While the effects of filters vary, if you care, consider buying a bottle of water from a trusted company.
Travelers sometimes encounter diseases unknown to them in their home areas.
Insects can destroy food, stab skin, cause allergic reactions, spread poisons, and transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves and dangerous animals that kill people by force usually don't apply to harmful organisms.
A tax-free shopping is an opportunity to buy items that are tax-free in certain places.
Travelers who visit highly taxed countries can save a lot of money, especially on goods such as alcohol and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont often passes through the remote wilderness in the most isolated section of the highway link between Buffalo and Pittsburgh.
If you're not used to driving a country road, watch out for steep gradients, narrow lanes, steep curves, and don't be distracted.
The speed at which it is presented is clearly lower than the speed at which it is presented, and generally it is 3540 miles per hour (5664 kilometers per hour), and strict adherence to that limit is more important than the rest of the district.
But, oddly enough, mobile phone services are good here compared to many other districts (such as Pennsylvania Wyles).
The German petries are very delicious. In the state of Bermuda, they look like the ones in the south of Austria, and they have a lot of variety.
Fruited sweets are common, apples are cooked for the whole year's supply, and in summer they come in Sakranbos and plums.
Many German sweets use fruit from such trees as almonds and Hezernuts. The popular cake fits very well with the strong coffee.
If you want to eat a thick, small petri dish, try what is called a verrina, puencogen, or clapfen.
Curry is a dish where meat and vegetables are boiled, based on herbs and spices.
The curry is classified either as a dry or a wet depending on the volume of water.
In the interiors of North India and Pakistan, we often use yogurt for curry, and in the coastal regions of South India and the subcontinent, we often use coconut milk.
The Indian food that you can choose from 17,000 island dishes is the main name of a wide variety of local dishes found throughout this country.
But if you use it without any further modifiers, it's the word for cooking from central Java to east.
Jawa food, now so prevalent throughout the islands, has a very simple flavor, and the main flavors are peanut, pepper, sugar, and so on.
That's the part where you hang down on both sides of the saddle and support the rider's foot.
This gives the driver a pretty stable ride, but because of the possible presence of the passenger's foot, there may be safety concerns.
If you're stuck in a horse's throwout the moment it's thrown out, you may be dragged by a horse trying to escape. You can take a number of safety measures to minimize this danger.
First of all, most of the riders wear horse shoes with heels and smooth, fairly narrow-eyed soles.
Next, there are safety bars on some saddles, especially British saddles, and when the rider is about to fall off and is pulled backward, the skin of the dog falls off the saddle.
Cochamo Valley - uphills in Chile's highest mountain, called Yosemite in South America, there are large walls and rocks of granite.
Looking from the top of the mountain, you can see a breathtaking view. The mountaineers around the world continue to be surrounded by walls with infinite potential and to establish new routes.
