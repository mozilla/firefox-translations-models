Let's catch fish in the lake named Hamama 湖西海湖館恒例事件 静岡新聞新聞
Children enjoying fishing experiences = Lake City Zoo in the new town of Hwaseong, Hwaseong.
The "Hee Lakes Hall", a tourist facility in the new town of Husaini, in the city of Husaini, is a fish and crab fishing experience in the beachfront of Lake Hamana.
The 24 days of the holiday were also sunny, and it attracted popularity among parents and their children.
The annual event is organized by the Tourism Association of the New Nassau Town.
The water is then pumped into the pond, including the unjaji, the seaweed, and the seaweed taken from the lake.
And after being caught in the pond, they can be cooked and tasted.
You can also enjoy the experience of making ugly and grilled coconut.
For 24 days, the family was seen from within the province and beyond.
The children were fascinated by the fish hunt and the catch and were delighted to show the guardian how they were doing.
Catching a rabbit is a must.
And 4,000 yen for food.
Fish catch is a cost of 400 yen plus the experience food, and meals such as salt and fries are around 400 yen per 100 gram.
And the experience is only 600 yen.
There is also a silk-frying experience for 200 grams and 1,500 yen per day.
The opening hours are Saturdays and holidays from July 23 to August 18.
The reservation is for the sea lake museum.
Butler once again praised the young warrior, Tyler-hero who is responsible for the future of hit-making, "the way of thinking is not rookie".
The first leg of the first leg was against the Kings.
In this game, which was a quick win of 104-98, Duncan Robinson scored 18 points in team high, Tyler Hero followed that up with 15 points and a backcourt performance.
Robinson, the league's top-ranked shooter, obviously, will be a key factor in the heats as the rookie, hero, and stepping-up of the entire draft's 13 nominees.
The hero, who missed 15 games from February to March due to a leg injury, entered the season on a long hiatus, ending the March 12 comeback against the Hornets.
The hero says that "it was time enough to get back to 100% condition, the best feeling I ever had", but that the performance in the scream was more convincing than words.
The delay in the merger of Kendrick Nunn, the pioneering point guard, led to an increased hero playtime, a form of opportunity.
The 15 points scored in a different role and a great performance are of great value.
And team leader Jimmy Butler praised the hero of 'Favourite' once again.
"He can handle, score, defend, and be a player who can do anything for the team, because the thinking is not rookie-like in any position, and he is watching videos and researching, and he is beating his head about where his teammates move and how they become free, and what he should do about it".
Just before the season opener, Butler has been enjoying the hero's rookie-like, unstoppable strength and stingy attitude toward basketball.
That's why I've been inviting you to practice, starting at 4 a.m., and training together.
Butler once said that "he will not give up his opinion to anyone; such a struggle can be respected".
Butler, who always thinks that what he thinks is the kind of thing that he always talks about, is for the team, and he's aware of the possibility of a conflict and faces tough opinions.
Because it has also led to deteriorating relationships with teammates in the past.
Butler is probably overshadowing himself as a hero.
The character of the batter, sometimes too harsh for a teammate, can be a good guide for those with enough guts to come up with.
If the relationship between two students who respect each other spreads to the whole team, the Heat should become a team that can even go higher.

Tsunja-po is convinced that "from now on the level of the opposing bettor will rise; I will come with the intention of returning the runner".
Saitama, who was also a regular, threw six shutouts in a row, and he never set foot twice, but he kept his three-year goal to the ground.
And the number 10 is a well-intentioned take on the idea that "two years of going out will stimulate three more years, if it leads to victory".
The team that finished third in the last three years of the Shipoka Conference and is aiming for the fourth best finish in the last three years will not be able to remember the rest of the games.

"and to find out as soon as possible where and what kind of disaster or accident occurred!"
This is not only needed by media outlets such as TV and newspapers, but also by many social infrastructure companies and municipalities.
The corresponding service is Spectee's Spectrum, which is AI-powered information analytics.
With the alert from the Spectre, a team of experts will determine the authenticity of social media information.
Now, the first means for people to know about disasters and accidents is moving from television to online information, social media.
Social media such as Twitter and other social media platforms have become important means of communicating information immediately after disasters or accidents occur.
But keeping an eye on the information that is coming in and extracting useful information from it is difficult for humans.
Spectacle has the ability to detect and analyze natural disasters and accidents from information streamed on social media such as Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, and other platforms, and then use it to distribute to businesses to determine the truth of the information.
"The broadly positioning of events with a negative impact that will stop/stagnate social activity as a 'crisis' (村上建治郎, CEO) is a crisis management support service that visualizes the various crises that are occurring at home and abroad".
The NHK, which was the first major use case of the spectrum during the Kumbhumbai earthquake in April 2016, has since spread rapidly among businesses.
It is said that more than 350 national companies, including TV stations and news agencies, as well as companies that support social infrastructure such as electricity, gas and transportation, and local authorities across the country, are now using Spectrum.
■ and analyze posts to determine the type and location of "crisis".
Specetti distributes information through four steps: "gathering information", "analysis and classification of content", "titling", and "false determination".
The companies that use the data must specify in advance the areas where the information is collected (e.g. metropolitan areas, towns and cities), the categories of crisis (e.g. disasters and accidents).
Spectacle collects posts that fall under its designation using the social media API.
Then, analyze and classify the text, images, and videos contained in the collected posts.
For example, if a video shows a fire truck, black smoke rising from a building, or an orange flame coming from a room, it is classified as "fire".
Besides, images of overturned cars are classified as "traffic accidents" or images of roads covered with water as "road crown water".
Spectacles also estimate the location of disasters and accidents.
"And since we often don't know the location from the post, we're making estimates by combining different types of information", says the CEO of the village.
For example, if images or videos contain road signs or signs, extract geographical information from them, compare them with a geographical database and identify the location.

"Just messing around" doesn't mean "we are not"...?
I've heard from people in the prefecture "words I didn't really think were dialect" (ねとらぼ) - Yahoo! News
I am a native of Chiba Prefecture, near Tokyo.
He has lived in the same province for less than 30 years since his birth.
"Zul shuffle", which means "to cross", was used in a conversation with a university friend in Tokyo, and was instantly taken for granted.
I could understand the meaning of the flow and the sense of the language, but I was told by the people of Tokyo, 玉 prefecture, "Don't use it".
― ―ja really "zl mingmi→zl and cross the border? "
Since it is connected to and is thus, in some way, possible to guess the meaning.
And then, yes, another one.
This is not something that was pointed out and noticed, but the expression "my home" means "my home" and was not used at all when reading books or asking friends or even when growing up to see if it was a dialect.
"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah" was right?
I also use it in my local area, but I didn't realize that I would naturally lose it as an adult.
The Japanese "cold and Chinese" is not a Chinese joke...?
"Cold and cold cooking" is not a popular term for modern business. - Yahoo! News
In China, it is called "Japanese frost".
As mentioned at the beginning, coldja and shū is a Chinese dish (Japanese Chinese) that originated in Japan, conceived on the basis of Chinese "涼面" (リャンバンミエン/冷やし混ぜそば) ".
So, since it originally did not exist in China, the variety of food is becoming more and more popular in summer Japanese food stores.
Also recently, the Japanese system of baking has also featured arrangements labeled 'Japanese rice cold face/Chinese rice cold face/Chinese rice cold face/Sichwa wind chicken cold face/Chinese rice cold face'.
On the other hand, pushed by popular punchy Chinese cuisine such as Sichuan cuisine and Hunan cuisine, Japanese Chinese are not as popular in China at all.
Of course, the flavor of Japanese jaja is often familiar to Chinese too.
So, while not unpleasant, it tends to be criticized as lacking in impact.
"Cold China" is no exception, and China still has a minor presence.
For this reason, the Chinese name for cold in China is "Japanese cold".
For the Chinese, it is recognized as one of the Japanese cuisines.
The summer's theme is "Kurija Lianpi".
In China, when it comes to summer-feeling cuisine, isn't it "涼皮 (リャンピー) "?
Although many people in Japan may not be familiar with it, the涼皮 is a flat-bottomed shrimp made from wheat flour, rice flour, denpon, and other ingredients that originated in the Shanxi province.
And it is said to have a 2,000-year history.
In the customized B-grade snacks that are also sold in the store, the price is 1020 yuan (150300 yen) front and back, very affordable.
The word "ja涼" is in it, but it never gets cold in Japanese or Chinese, like ice cream.
Rather, the normal temperature is the basic.
On top of the onion, cut corn, onions, and tomatoes, top your favorite ingredients, and add flavorings such as patty, cinnamon, raisins, and onions.
Finally, mixed with a specialised seasoning, including olive oil, garlic, yogurt, peanut butter, and other spices.
The more often the throat is thrown, the more it puts on, the more often the sour and the more dense the bitter tares are entangled, the more often the summertime flavor is swollen, even when the appetite is not present.
Also, as it is pervasive throughout China, there are various toppings and flavors, and the rich variety is also a feature of the cooler skin, and one of the pleasures.
And expert explanations!
"A cold shower" is a benefit to the body and mind. - Yahoo! News
It also helps to control inflammation, such as muscle soreness.
A study published in The North American Journal of Medical Sciences that examined the effectiveness of hydrotherapy found that both physical and mental healing effects can be expected.
And by taking cold water after exercise, you can reduce the effects of muscle pain and other inflammation.
According to Douglas Kasa, professor at the University of Connecticut and head of the Korean Stringer Institute for Sports Medicine, "It's important to exercise and take a cold shower without wasting as much time as possible.By lowering body temperature immediately after exercise, recovery from exercise-induced inflammation and fatigue is quicker".
It also reduces fatigue.
When exercising at high temperatures, the heart, muscles, and skin usually require more blood flow.
"When exercising, the heart rate increases, blood flow to the heart increases, muscle flow increases, and blood flow to the skin increases, as the heart rate increases, and muscle contraction requires energy.
"A cold shower can help control the flow of blood to the skin as the skin temperature drops; instead, blood is sent to the intestines, such as the stomach and intestines, so that moisture and nutrients can be absorbed more easily after exercise; as a result, fatigue after exercise can be reduced".
Expect the Holjaemis effect.
Drosefsky also explains that by pouring cold water, one can expect the "Hormis effect" to start.
The HoljaMiss effect is the idea that it is better to have a little bit of harmful substances or stress than nothing at all.
"Low-oxygen exercise, a Puja fast, and a cold-water shower are all examples of what can be expected for health as a form of homicide. By taking a cold-water shower, hormones and neurotransmitters are stimulated and physical and physical strength and resilience can be enhanced".

and Osaka-sama-san, 2 Battle of the Seventh!
矢野 director "jaja style has been watching" (サンケイスポーツ) - Yahoo!News
(セ・リーグ, 中日2-5阪神, 7 rounds, 4勝3敗, 24日, nagasōyaD) The fourth round is unstoppable.
The ball, which was dancing high and high, was shot into the middle of the left-wing seat.
The Great Wall has two consecutive battles of archery, a week of diamonds.
When he returned to the bench, he had his white teeth.
"And while I was swinging well, I was able to narrow the target ball and deliberately swing".
Four 0-2s, he came in first place.
He was actively swinging from the opening ball to the second after Fowle.
He didn't miss out on the 134kg slide that was so much fun for the big boy.
The ball hit in the center of the ball was perfect enough to convince me that the moment I hit it was a stand-in.
A two-match series following the Battle of Hiroshima on 23rd of the previous day was a blow to the counterattack.
It was also a valuable piece of paper that was struck by someone who was struggling.
Against Osaka, he played against Osaka on 17th at the Aidan Stadium, where he scored 9 and struck out 4 in the first innings.
But, as far as Nagaodao is concerned, the previous 12-game schedule allowed 7 wins, 1 loss and 1 hold, and it had been plagued by seven consecutive losses since August 23, 2013, when it was drawn.
From such a difficult opponent, the 23 innings in the Nagaoyadome did not pass the game, robbing the score with a fast run, which was also a one-innings draw.
Director Yayoi Yajō also said, "It's a high level to keep the ball tight, look and style, and the timing of the game is in the mood, and I think it's still going to hit".
On one occasion, he was hitting right-handed, marking a six-game hitting streak and three-game hitting streaks.
The opening game was a slow start, but 7 home runs, 16 runs scored and 16 stolen bases are already working out as a team leader and fourth.
And for the sake of victory, we will continue to leave the results behind.

The head coach of Japan's men's rugby sevens team, HC, said in response to an online press interview on 25th, that he was determined to "unite and work together towards the goal of winning a medal" for the Tokyo Five, which was postponed to next year.
After the five-round draw was postponed, Sanja Hirotsu, the 2016 Rio de Janeiro World Championships representative, and Fukuoka Tokugawa, who also represented the 15-man World Cup in the same tournament, withdrew from the team.
The commander added, "Of course the impact is great, and players who can fight together are moving forward".
From this date, the team will be split into Tokyo and BJA and will begin to represent the candidate accommodation.
Although accommodation with accommodation will be available from March until March 28, no contact training will be conducted as a precautionary measure to prevent infection with the new coronavirus.
Although the representatives of the top-ranked group were set to return to the full World Series of Seven starting next season, and the WS itself was not transparent about the tournament, the IACC revealed that it was negotiating a narrowing of the number of opponents in the country that would allow the entry of representatives, and a strengthening of the match.

And that means that four people in a family of "intense contact" with mild symptoms have no symptoms.
The women were working until 16 and had not been able to confirm visits outside the prefecture for the two weeks prior to the onset.
And the pathways of infection are currently under investigation.
The Red Cross Hospital, which was the first hospital for women to report infection, said it had staff infected 24 hours a day.
Although there are no "intense contacts" in the hospital, it means that all contacts are screened for PCR, the women's associated ward, etc. are closed and thoroughly disinfected.

There is no registration fee or admission fee, and the exhibition is free of charge for the viewer and the artist who wants to open the exhibition.
And online presentations can also attract attention.
And moving the painting is one of them.
In the permanent exhibition "It's moving again" by Claude Monet, clouds, flowers, meadows, etc. are digitally processed to move.
"I want to get people who are not interested in art involved" (野代表) makes me feel like I'm in a painting.
The representative of ja野 and the artistic expression of the art form began when he was a primary school student.
When he and his family visited the newly completed Aosun Prefectural Museum, he was shocked by the urgency of seeing three huge paintings of Mark Shaggar's "Aleko".
From the next day on, art classes turned into fun times, and after college, I started to fly, and after graduation, I started to walk to galleries and other places.
At the same time, I felt that many people had little opportunity to experience art from various points of view, such as the lack of museums nearby, the large-scale exhibitions in the capital, the difficulty of parenting and going out, etc.
So I started a website where I could spend about two months working for an IT-affiliated company and see art on the Internet.
The number of users reached an average of 10,000 per month in the first 10 months, and after the spread of the new coronavirus infection, it increased to about 30,000.
If anyone could see art in a free way, whenever they want to see it, then --
The Azeri's goal has been embraced by more people, even though the coronavirus has not.
The representative of ja野 emphasizes that art viewing enriches the imagination about the meaning of art.
"And as your imagination becomes richer, you will be able to reach out to those in need.
By bringing art closer, we want it to be a better society".
The simple reason why the quality era of China and Japan is coming to an end is simple:
The pandemic has resulted in a shift in values.
There are many predictions and discussions about the post-pandemic world.
On the business side, the changes described in the July 8 article "The jobs of managers are starting to disappear in Japan now...!that cruel reality" and the July 4 article "In a post-coronavirus world, the Japanese manufacturing industry is likely to have a major resurgence!!" could be expected.
The real body of "Japan's strength" that only the Japanese know about... the unexpected reality seen in Asia.
Also, in a spiritual sense, the June 26 article "The 'True Burning Mind' given to those who have become aware of the end of life with corona" and the June 10 article "Coronary, riot-filled right now, let's review the use of 'God's Prayer in the Time of Trouble' seem to be becoming mainstream".
And, as the two "material" and "spiritual" aspects of the business are combined, we seem to see clearly the great flow of "Chinese quality to Japanese quality".
For example, it is annoying to have a bad or flawed T-shirt or digital camera, but the life of the person who bought it is not different.
In contrast, the recent high-quality Chinese-made masks and respirators, which have been the subject of much discussion, are deadly in products that directly link life and safety.
And no matter how cheap such goods are, they cannot be bought.
And at a reasonable price, they will seek products of "Japanese quality".
Of course, this flow is not just happening in Japan.
Western countries, which are in a difficult situation due to lack of masks and medical equipment, are still very bad at "Chinese quality" and have repeatedly "returned" their goods.
Security is more important than safety.
Also, goods such as automobiles are also goods that can be defective and fatal (accident death).
The reason why, despite the aggressive efforts of the countries that started with the sale strategy of "Ain't it bad or bad?" is that the Japanese manufacturer was ultimately unable to overcome the situation described in the June 16 article "Are the world's automakers still going to win alone, are they going to bow to Toyota?" is that the automotive product is highly demanded for "Japanese quality".
And, as the pandemic has reminded us, many other products need "reassurance and safety".
Also, safety is important not only in "Japanese quality in manufacturing" but also in "Japanese quality in services such as logistics".
Like toilet paper noise, even if the production capacity is adequate, the middle flow may be stuck and not reaching the hands.
Moreover, as in the April 17 article "Who are the real criminals without masks! Don't Forgive the Fireplace Thieves of the Chinese Communist Party Regime", self-sufficiency in Japan was also felt as an important element of "reassurance and security".
It is very important that every country, when it comes to its own priorities, be able to get basic supplies such as masks and food from home.
South Korea's new coronavirus infections have been 115 days since 100+ = 86 outbound arrivals, the most of any country.
The Central Office of the Central Bureau of Epidemic Control in South Korea announced on 25th, that the number of new coronavirus cases reported today at 0:00 a.m. had increased to 113 from 0:00 a.m. the previous day, reaching a total of 14,092 people.
The number of new cases per day exceeded 100 for the first time in 115 days since April 1.
In addition to the fact that 32 crew members were infected on a Russian ship that had arrived at the port of Yusan, 32 of the 293 workers who returned from Iraq on the 24th are believed to have tested positive.
The number of new cases in South Korea was 30 to 60 with the exception of 20 days.
Of the new cases reported on 25 January, 86 were foreign nationals, the most since the first case in South Korea on 20 January.
The highest number of immigrants came from Iraq was 36, 34 from Russia, 5 from the Philippines, and 3 from the United States.
Meanwhile, 27 cases have been confirmed in the city, 11 in Seoul and Jingyi Road respectively, and five in Yangsan City.
Five people in the city of ja山 were employees of a repairman who sailed aboard Russian ships.
The death toll remained the same from the previous day, reaching a total of 298.
The player from Nagoya-Myawara was diagnosed with coronavirus after the league reopened.
The football J1's Nagoya house announced that a positive response to the new coronavirus had been confirmed on 25th, February, in DF Miyagi and also in players [24].
After the Jja Liga resumption, the players' positive reaction was the first.
Among the players at the same club, the third was GK Mitchell Langelack of Australia, who was infected with FW Kinzaki Dream生 (born 31 June) and was infected in June.
Two of them have already been treated and returned to the game.
This season's Miyagi-Jia came on the bench in the J1 Grand Final, which was held on 22nd Jan. at the Sho Shogunate Dome.
In an online press conference on the 25th, Nagoya revealed that he had tested 60 players and staff on the same day.
98% are reflective.
The tejafron processed flyspan is found to be a white paint, heat-discharge, and cooling effect enhancer!
A great discovery!
This year was a rainy season with an unprecedented amount of rainfall, but it is clear that the hot summer will be more standardized.
Those days of so much heat that it's hot and hot and even the cold room is worse... just imagine, right?
Global warming is a major global problem, and humanity has been shrinking in wisdom about how to get through the hot summer even a little more comfortably.
One way is to wear thin, white clothes.
Well, why don't you wear a black dress that absorbs heat in the summer?
And, as the same principle applies to the construction of homes, there are more and more cases of white paint being used.
Whether white can be painted with a characteristic color that reflects more light and absorbs less heat was also the latest area of research.
The Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science at UCLA, in collaboration with researchers at Columbia University's Department of Applied Physics and Applied Mathematics, has discovered a white paint blending method that can best efficiently repress solar heat and increase the cooling effect inside buildings.
And it is intended for early implementation.
The highest reflection rate of sunlight ever was white paint, which used titanium oxide, which reached 85% reflection rate.
White paint, which already uses titanium oxide, is being applied to rooftops in high-temperature environments, and is used to block solar heat and increase cooling efficiency.
However, the newly discovered paint is a white paint derived from polytratrache-alloyethylene (PTFE) phosphate resin, which is used in some of those tephron-processed flys, etc.
With the white paint that applies this Tejaferon effect, it is thought to be able to significantly reduce heat by reflecting sunlight to almost 98% of the time.
And even in the hot summer, thanks to the unexpected white painting using tephron, the interior is easy to pass without being exposed to the heat.
Perhaps that time is coming soon, isn't it?
It's interesting that the roof of Japanese jacas has a lot of dark colors, but from now on, will white be the mainstream?
When is the annual Amazon Amazon sales, this year's event?
On July 21, MiCNBC reported that Mija Amazon.com had revealed the extension of the annual large-scale sale "Prime Day".
It is held annually in July, but this year it was reported that the new coronavirus infection was forced to be postponed due to the spread of the virus.
■ and a public relations officer, "details will be announced soon" Amazon's public relations officer said in a statement:
"And Prime Day has become a special celebration event that we have been looking forward to for the past five years, and this year it will be held later than usual, while ensuring the safety of employees and supporting customers and suppliers".
However, he did not specify a specific date for the event, stating only that "details will be announced soon".
Meanwhile, I decided to hold it in India.
He posted a press release on his country's website.
He explained that the implementation of the 48-hour program will take place from 08:00 am on August 6th.
Although Prime Day has been held simultaneously around the world, this year may be an unusual one.
■ Amazon, a large event that will sell 76 billion yen in two days, launched a large sale to this membership in 2015 as a way to promote sales in the summer months, which will reduce sales.
Initially, it was a 24-hour event, but has expanded each year to a larger scale, last year it was held in 18 countries, including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, India, Japan, China, Australia, and elsewhere, from 08:00 am on July 15th to 48 hours.
Last year, the company said, two days of sales exceeded previous sales records for Black Friday and Cyber Monday.
The event also contributed to the acquisition of new members of the premium, with last year's first-day registration as the highest number of one-day entries, followed by the next day.
Last year, it sold 175 million items worldwide.
In this regard, the Internet Retailer, a specialist magazine in the online retail industry, reported that the total global sales in the two days were $71.6 billion, up 70% from the previous year.
I've been having trouble with the mobile number transfer, and I'm struggling with excessive withdrawal.
What about the hand fee and the point payout?
(and news) - Yahoo! news
The General Ministry is standardizing the consideration of a review of the same number transfer system (MNP) that will retain the traditional phone number when changing mobile phone companies.
At the 21st Knowledge Conference, the Council outlined a policy to amend the 2004 MNP guidelines.
Specific arguments have been made on a wide range of issues, including the way in which MNP fees are calculated and whether to withdraw from the transferring party.
While feedback from telecommunications companies is also expected, attention is focused on whether it can be linked to promoting healthy market competition.
The original user fee was 2000 yen in 2006, when the black MNP was introduced by telecommunications companies, far from being the mobile switchover topic.
The MNP fee revenue of the three largest mobile phone companies is estimated to be around 15.9 billion yen annually.
The General Ministry of Communications on 21st, at a meeting of experts discussing the competitive environment of the telecommunications market, and others, listed the current state of affairs regarding the MNP.
The issuance of the MNP reservation number, which is required when a consumer moves to another telecommunications company, is given in the time, time, and manner in which the issuance is made.
Although the major mobile telecommunications companies are accepting on the web, and for convenience of operating the basic system, the acceptance timeframe is mainly 9-20 hours.
The WjaG documentation sets out the principle of day-to-day response as a direction for future consideration.
For those who wish to transfer to MjaNP, mobile phone companies are also having trouble with trying to hold back by giving points.
This is because of the judgment that excessive retention can hinder fair competition.
The North Jun Jun Jun of the North Noshima General Research Institute, a member of the WG, suggests that "we will be able to give a brief explanation of the economic benefits offered or obtain permission from the user, and the numbering of the unauthorized users will be promptly terminated.
But, among a series of arguments, the structural problem of the MNP fee is that "the higher the customer, the more difficult it is to get out, the more difficult it is to actively reduce the motivation" (a spokesman for the General Ministry) to work.
There is also concern that if there is an operator who leads the way in lowering the MNP fee, the company will increase the customer flow and the company's efforts will not be rewarded.
The General Ministry also points out that many overseas countries do not charge users a user fee for MNP, and it is likely that Japan will do the same.
The General Ministry is planning to compile the results of the WG in a report by September-October, and then begin the process of revising the MNP guidelines.
And the period of time when the amendment is made will be considered after 21st century.
Mobile and telecommunications companies are likely to be a source of headaches, including sales and customer support.
Midja-Japan-Sungino, six times without losing, won and lost, but never got the right to bet (Sankay Sports) - Yahoo! News

In the match against Fujiaja, which he met here, he was chased by two goals, and finally by a fork.
He took three shots in a three-ball tie, and pitched a scoreless inning.
Ōja-jin-ino scored 83 goals after completing six, but at the same time as the midfield game ended, he and his manager, Tenda, came off the bench and switched pitchers.
The pitcher, who scored 108 goals at the same time, was unable to secure the right to win the first game of the season, as he was the first to get off the mound.

What is the possibility of J1 debuting at the Kobe Battle?
Director 宮本 宮ja "The scoring power stands out" (スポーツ報知) - Yahoo!ニュース
Gja Osaka's director, Miyaben Hengjusung, responded to an interview before the 25th, four-game Kobe battle, expressing his expectations for FW唐山翔, a high school freshman who made the top team for the first time in the previous season.
Commander Daonja, who rose to the top of the jump this season, was on the bench for the 22nd Battle of Hiroshima.
Although he was not given the opportunity to play, so far J3 has ordered the striker who has three goals and three points in five games this season, "There is a high point in scoring, but I want to do more at Gamshara, even at 17 years old. I have seen players go abroad so far young, but I want them to play with a high level of consciousness and determination".
唐山 played 10 games and scored 8 goals in J3 last season, as a special designated player.
At 178 cm, 65 kg and thin, but with instantaneous movements, taking the back of the DF, the sensation-dense opponent's calmness to the shot shown in front of the goal, and weapons, J3 boasts 15 games11 goals and an amazing score.

A stolen Ferrari from 26 years ago is found at the bottom of the river and has never been restored to working condition.
In 1994, there was a case of the theft of a Ferrari Mondial in the Netherlands.
Time passed and the police couldn't solve it, but 26 years later, the mondial was miraculously discovered.
The first thing that inspired the discovery of the Ferrari, which was found at the bottom of the Jaja River, was the fire department's diving training.
On July 8, a trained diver discovered something of a wedge shaped boat sinking under the river, and the police, including the Dutch army, took action and raised the thing.
By matching the VIN number to the database of the stolen car, we were able to link this Ferrari to the 1994 event.
The car is then handed over to the insurance company, which is the legal owner of the car, and then to the scrap dealer.
Scrap dealer Loja van DE Ooyevaar says that "there are still some remaining parts, but they are for the art of decorating. I've already received many requests from people who want to make a table out of a broken-down mondial. I use engine blocks and glass plates".
In the meantime, no concrete sales were considered, and scrappers were kept as objects.
