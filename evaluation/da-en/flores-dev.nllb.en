The need for zoomlinser, the focal complexity and the number of lens elements, is greater than the need for a larger, larger end for the main lens.
This becomes less problematic as lens manufacturers become more standardised in lens production.
This has enabled zoomlinsers to produce images of a quality comparable to that achieved by lenses, which has a fast burnvidde.
Another disadvantage of zoomlinser is that at lens maximum blænding (speed) is usually lower.
This makes cheap zoomlinser difficult to use in mild conditions without a blitz.
