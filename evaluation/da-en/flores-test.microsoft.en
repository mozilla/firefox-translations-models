In the PALM trial, ZMapp acted as a control, meaning the researchers used it as a baseline and compared the other three treatments with it.
USA Gymnastics supports the U.S. Olympic Committee's letter and accepts the Olympic family's absolute need to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with USOC's statement that it is in the best interests of our athletes and clubs, and their sports, to move forward with meaningful changes within our organization rather than decertification.

This not only confirms that there were at least some dinosaurs that had feathers, a theory that is already widespread, it also provides details that fossils generally cannot, such as the color and three-dimensional arrangement.
. Scientists say that the plumage of this animal was chestnut-brown at the top with a light or carrot-colored underside.
The finding also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers don't have a well-developed shaft, called a feather shaft, but have other characteristics from feathers — rays and bee rays — the researchers inferred that feather shaft was likely a later evolutionary evolution than these other characteristics.
The removable structure suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature control or for decoration. The researchers believed that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows an adult plumage, and not the down of a chicken.
The scientists believe that the sample from the tail of the young dinosaur shows the plumage of an adult individual, and not the down of a chicken.
A car bomb detonated at police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning, killing two police officers and wounding more than twenty other people.

They found that the sun operates on the same basic principles as other stars: the activity of all the stars in the system turned out to be driven by their brightness, their rotation, and nothing else.
The brightness and rotation are used together to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to the plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in terms of magnetic reversals.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was designed to simulate observations of the SagDEG galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be a result of tide-like forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the Moon exerts a pull on Earth and causes tides, so does the Milky Way exert a force on the galaxy SagDEG.
The researchers were able to conclude that the dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory states that most dark matter around a galaxy is found around the galaxy in a kind of ring and consists of lots of small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered the extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
He said in an interview that the new variant was "very worrying and that there was cause for alarm because of its very high mortality rate."
Some patients may have contracted the virus in the hospital, Dr. Moll believes, and at least two were hospital health care professionals.
In a year's time, an infected person can infect between 10 and 15 close contacts.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the entire human group with tuberculosis still seems low; 6,000 of the total 330,000 infected people in South Africa at any given time.

In France, voting has traditionally been low-tech: voters isolate themselves in a box and put a pre-printed piece of paper indicating their choice of candidate in an envelope.
Once officials have verified the voter's identity, the voter puts the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voting list.
The procedure is codified very precisely in French electoral law.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been transparent, so voters and observers can see that the ballot boxes do not contain ballot papers at the start of voting and that no ballot papers other than those that are correctly counted and come from approved voters are added.
Candidates can send representatives as witnesses to all parts of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision and according to specific procedures.

Four skiers in the women's group of seated athletes did not finish the race, and 45 out of a total of 117 skiers in giant slalom did not rank in the race.
Madhya Pradesh police found the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said: "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and we have found her mobile phone and laptop".
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people in the house when the car hit it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the accident took place was temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged in Edinburgh Sheriff Court with murdering his son.
She is in custody awaiting trial and trial, but eyewitness evidence may be flawed because her photo has been widely publicized.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish courts operate differently and courts have considered the publication of images potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee comments that "it certainly seems that journalists should be careful if they publish pictures of suspects and the like."
The Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for prosecution, has indicated to reporters that no further comment will be made, at least until the indictment is known.
According to the leak, the document will refer to the border conflict that Palestine wants based on the pre-Six-Day War borders of 1967.
Other topics covered reportedly include the future state of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both countries, as well as the problems surrounding the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a constant military presence in the valley for ten years once an agreement has been signed, while the Palistinene authorities agree to leave the valley for only five years.
Shooters in the supplemental pest control trial had to be closely followed by park rangers as the trial was monitored and its efficacy evaluated.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the acting director of conservation and heritage at NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first firing operation received extensive safety and training instruction.
A new nine-member provisional electoral council (CEP) was sworn in yesterday by Martelly.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the former CEP's resignation was recommended by a presidential commission as part of a package of measures designed to move the country towards new elections.
Martelly's response to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October was the commission.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which had not been held since 2011.
In approximately 60 reported cases, defective iPods have overheated, causing a total of six fires and minor burns for four people.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it had been aware of 27 accidents involving the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of another 34 cases of overheating, which the company called "non-serious."
The department responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "quite regrettable."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (09:19 GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Office announced that no damage had been reported in the nation.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman has taken tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took an elderly lady's place when she needed to go to the bathroom. Mendoza was gunned down.
Following in his father's footsteps, Liggins started a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and in 1959 began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching early births in his spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone was given, it would accelerate the development of the baby's lungs in the embryonic stage.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two "black box" aircraft recorders on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna died on the night of two moons. Pretty unique, just like herself. Strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as wild as me... maybe even more... love her and will miss her... Hopefully she's in a better place now."
Out of 1,400 people polled ahead of the 2010 federal election, the number of those opposed to Australia becoming a republic grew by 8 per cent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the campaign for the 2010 federal election that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those surveyed share this view and want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
In the various extremes of the poll, 29 percent of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim in the style 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, there have been doubts about his condition.
He could not take the medication needed to combat his pain, as these are prohibited during the Games.
Curtis Cooper, mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25.
Several people confirmed this discovery in early February using different hardware and software, and on Tuesday it was announced.
Comets may have been a source of water on Earth, along with organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, and in particular how Earth was shaped since comets collided with Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, became governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumours as "political tinkering and foolishness".
One wonders if he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, allows aircraft to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel per year and reduce CO2 emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, unlike older technology based on radars on the ground, to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No extra transport will be put in and above-ground trains will not stop in Wembley, and car parking and park-and-ride options will not be available on the ground.
The fear of lack of transport raised the possibility that one would be forced to play the match behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the formation of a new bird species in the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although it had been thought that this process would have taken much longer due to mating between the endemic Darwin finch geospiza fortis and the invasive cactus finch Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be processed into all sorts of shapes. It can be rolled into very small shapes.
It can be pulled out to a thin cable, which can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into plates.
It can be made very thin and put on other metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The cabbage juice changes colour, depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH value is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Shake the two dry powders together, then squeeze them together into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which will feel strange and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flushing toilet connected to a sophisticated sewage system in almost every house,
Remains of sewage systems have been found in houses in Minoan towns in Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women stayed together in mixed company.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and reflects it back down almost immediately.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
Putting a satellite or telescope into space requires a giant rocket that is over 100 feet tall.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The biggest thing the wheel has done for us is that it has given us much easier and faster transportation methods.
It has given us the train, the car and many other means of transport.
Below them there are several medium-sized cats, which eat medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including loose domestic cats) that eat the much more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret to their success is a concept of the niche, a special task each cat has that keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social felines and live in large groups called flocks.
The flocks consist of one to three related adult males as well as up to thirty females and young.
The females are usually closely related to each other and are a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion packs react much like wolves or dogs in packs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
The tiger is a good athlete who can climb (though not well), swim, jump far and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones who can roar.
The roar of the tiger is not like the loud roar of a lion, but sounds more like a phrase of snarling, shouted words.
Ozelotts prefer small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they have the opportunity. Almost all the animals that the ozelot hunts are much smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that ocelots follow and find animals eating (prey) via smell, by sniffing where they have been on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and they also move around very quietly. Ozelotts hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then pounce on their prey.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) becomes separated from the main population they came from (such as if they move across a mountain range or river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily move back), they will often find themselves in a different environment than they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population needs to have other features or customizations to be a stronger competitor than had previously been necessary.
The initial population has not changed at all. It still needs the same adjustments as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, they begin to resemble the rest of the population less and less.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two population groups will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Species are an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants make oxygen that humans inhale, and they take up carbon dioxide, which humans exhale (i.e. exhale).
Plants make their food from the sun by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses from plants and make clothes from plants. Most foods we eat are plants. Without plants, animals would not be able to survive.
Mosasaurus was the top of the food chain in its day, so it feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws had more than 70 razor-sharp teeth and an extra set at the top of its mouth, meaning there was no escape route for anything crossing its path.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a split tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked everything that got into the water. Even a giant dinosaur like a T. rex could do nothing against it.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans ate a number of strange or unusual things, including wild boars, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called a seven-sleeper.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate their food while sitting on chairs, rich men liked to have large feasts together, lying on their sides while eating.
Ancient Roman meals could not have contained foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes or cocoa, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built each of their gods a primary temple, which was considered the home of the god.
People made sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and an inner shrine that only the priests were allowed to enter.
Sometimes pyramid-shaped towers, so-called ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine to the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
The Hebrew family lived most of its life outdoors.
Women made the food in the yard; The shops were just open counters facing the street. Stone was used to build houses.
There were no large forests in Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was settled with few people. In the Norse sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and as he traveled further west he found Greenland and called it Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, Inuit tribes already lived in the area at that time.
Although each country was "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map is drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the American Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776". The text appears at the bottom of the document when it is turned upside down.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in its lifetime, the large parchment document (it measures 293/4 inches x 241/2 inches) was rolled up for storage.
So it is likely that the annotation was simply attached as an addition.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles had liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
It was ruled by the French Vichy government - there are French who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with them instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, Allied troops invaded southern France; the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were focusing on Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a larger, significant group of people living together and cooperating, a community.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, and is related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state; And it also somehow defines the size of society.
City-states are the forerunners of nations. A culture of civilization involves the transmission of knowledge across generations, long-term cultural influence, and fair dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence, and are not recognized as real civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government—with Congress as the only component—under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and because there was no national executive or judiciary, they relied on state authorities, who were often uncooperative in enforcing all actions.
Nor did it have any right to override tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles required the unanimous approval of all the states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italy national football team, along with Germany's national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and became FIFA World Cup champion in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motorsport.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often designated, from a geographical point of view, as an "archipelago"
Taiwan's history begins as far back as the 15th century, when European sailors on their way past the island named it Ilha Formosa or the beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a change in original grain production practices, employing Chinese workers to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing dynasty (1644-1912) troops take control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal areas, declaring Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after a defeat in the 1st Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, with which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, ruling over the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures: Intihuatana, Temple of the Sun and Temple with the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and excavations continue to this day.
For example, the most common photograph format in the world for still images is 35 mm, which was the most widely used film size at the end of the era of analog films.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been inherited by sensor formats in digital cameras.
The 35mm format is actually, which may seem confusing, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format is therefore 3:2 (divided by twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio).
Many common formats (such as APS formats) are equal to or close to this image format.
The widely abused and often ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while keeping some order in an image.
It says that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and influential, was looked at.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion bound European countries together, despite different languages and customs.
Its all-encompassing power affected everyone from king to ordinary citizens.
One of the most important Christian dogmas is that prosperity should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that church funds be used specifically for this purpose.
The central authority of the Church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this dogma was properly adhered to.
Shortly after hostilities broke out, Britain imposed a blockade at sea against Germany.
The strategy proved effective, preventing critical military and civilian supplies from arriving. This blockade was contrary to the recognized international laws codified in several international agreements in the last two centuries.
Britain laid mines in international waters to prevent ships from entering entire sections of the ocean, which was a danger even for neutral ships.
Since there was little response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, most citizens and nations' attitudes leaned toward pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents on him, a collection of poems, and a written recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his boss from his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, different time periods were shown in a unique way; Each Chinese time period or family in power was a separate dynasty.
In addition, between each dynasty there was an unstable period of divided provinces. The best-known of these periods was the Three Kingdoms epoch, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasty.
During these periods, there was fierce war between many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient China's history. Thousands of people died fighting to sit in the highest seat of the Great Palace of Xi'an.
There are a lot of social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not one ruler.
Also after the revolution, the professions were open to all male applicants, which allowed the most ambitious and successful to do well.
The same goes for the military, because instead of class-based ranking in the army, ranking was now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class people from other countries to start their own internal revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond worldly life. He used to visit a cave that became known as "Hira" on the mountain "Noor" (light) to immerse himself in his thoughts.
The cave itself, which has survived through time, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca and completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not at all easy to find at all, even if you know it exists. When you are inside the cave, it is a total isolation.
Only the clear beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains can be seen. Very little of the outside world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders still standing today.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E. and is one of many large pyramid structures built in honor of the dead pharaohs.
The Giza plateau, or "Giza necropolis" in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, contains several pyramids (of which the world-famous Great Pyramid is the largest of them all), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created to honor the pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The "up-arc" mark looks like a V and the "down-arc mark" looks like a staple, or a square missing its bottom side.
Up means you should start at the tip and push the bow, and down means you should start at the frog (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
Strokes usually produce a softer sound, while strokes sound stronger and more powerful.
You can always insert your own markings, but remember that the inscribed bow markings are determined for musical reasons, which is why they should usually be respected.
The terrified King Louis 16, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles) and the king's sister, Mrs. Elizabeth, were forced back to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789, by a crowd of market women.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a screaming group of people shouting threats at the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep the windows of their carriage wide open.
At one point, a member of the mafia presented the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles to the frightened queen.
The war costs of US imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
The Philippines had to pay taxes to the American colonial power to raise money for most of the expenses, and bond yields ran through Wall Street banks in the name of government.
Of course, the super-profits from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the fundamental gains of US imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, one needs to understand the context that underpinned the founding of the order.
The period in which these events took place is commonly known as the High Middle Ages, the part of European history that took place in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000–1300 e.Kr.).
The High Middle Ages preceded the early Middle Ages, which was followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ends around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technology as a driving force or technological necessity, to a narrow idea that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic related to scientific laws and the way they translate into technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a route largely outside cultural or political influence, and that technology, in turn, has an "impact" on societies that is hereditary and not socially conditioned.
For example, it can be said that the motor car necessarily leads to the development of roads.
But a nationwide road network is not economically viable for just a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
When many people own cars, accidents also occur on the roads, leading to inventions of new techniques in the field of health to heal bodily injuries.
Romanticism contained a large element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, it was geography that shaped the individual, and over time, customs and cultures related to geography emerged, and these were in harmony with the location of society and were therefore superior to arbitrarily imposed laws.
In the same way that Paris today is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It is known to be an epicenter of luxury since approximately 400 e.kr. and lasted until about 1,100 e.kr.
Its status declined in the twelfth century, mainly because crusaders had returned with gifts such as silk and spices that had a greater value than what the Byzantine markets could offer.
It was at that time that the title of fashion capital passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style was most prevalent in the period between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th centuries.
In the beginning, the clothes were largely inspired by the Byzantine culture of the East.
However, as a result of the slow communication channels, Western styles could lag behind by 25-30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments of the time as a result of the Crusades was that people began to use buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence farming is agriculture that is carried out for the production of sufficient food simply to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence farming is a simple and often organic system that uses stored seeds native to the ecoregion, in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques, to maximize yields.
Historically, most farmers have been engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel overlooked by societal standards, and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinctive due to the age, ethnic background, social class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The qualities that govern a subculture as being distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of several factors.
People belonging to a subculture often signal their belonging through a distinct and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, mannerisms and slang.
One of the most common ways to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw on the few unhappy cases where, through failure, unhappiness, or willful neglect, children have not been socialized by adults in their childhood.
Such children are called "feral" or wild. Some feral children have been detained by humans (most often their own parents); In some cases, this child failure was caused by the parents' rejection of a child's serious intellectual or physical impairments.
Wild children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or ran away.
Others are claimed to have been raised by animals; Some are said to have lived in nature on their own.
When raised by non-human animals, the feral child exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) that are almost identical to the animal that has shown care for the child, such as its fear or lack of interest in humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but a support for people who need to learn new things - e.g. using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is the little paperclip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is internalized in the software, and aims to question, ask for, and explain procedures that may have been too challenging for the student to handle alone.
Children come into foster care for a wide variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even blackmail.
No child should grow up in an environment without nourishment, care and education, but they do nonetheless.
We see the foster care system as a safe zone for these children.
Our foster family system must provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
A foster family is tasked with providing all necessities that did not exist in the home from which they were removed.
The Internet combines mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The specificities of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of use and satisfaction approach.
For example, it is suggested that "learning" and "socialization" are important motives for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal complicity" and "sustained relationships" were also identified as new motivational factors by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they examined audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the understanding of microexpressions, which are facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can identify whether or not a person is lying by interpreting micro-expressions correctly.
In his article The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks indicated how people who are unable to understand speech due to a brain injury are nevertheless able to assess sincerity with great accuracy.
He even believes that such abilities to interpret human behavior can also be found in pets such as dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two distinct pools of genetic variation: the invisible and the visible.
New genetic variation is added via mutation and it is removed from the pool of exact variations via selection."
Separation and recombination mix the variation back and forth between the two pools with each generation.
Out on the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like humans to satisfy its need for amino acids from available plant sources.
In addition, there are serious consequences of non-compliance: impaired growth, malnutrition and, ultimately, death.
The most readily available plant resources would have been the proteins found in leaves and legumes, but for primates like us, these are difficult to digest unless cooked.
Conversely, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest. It also provides large amounts of protein, which contains all the essential amino acids.
All in all, it shouldn't surprise us if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way that savannah chimpanzees do today.
Sleep disturbance is the process of consciously waking up during your normal sleep period and falling asleep a short time later (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you find that you turn off the watch while sleeping, you can place it at the other end of the room, forcing you to stand up to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options involve drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) prior to sleep, forcing one to stand up and urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is quite the opposite to the amount of tension a person possesses in body and mind.
The lower the voltage, the more positive the life force. All people have the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can learn to understand. The only thing standing in the way of achieving this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha but was expanded by the love path Mahayana and with a lot of techniques from Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-encompassing love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy is brought to life (enlightenment energy) through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the Divinity Yoga ("Deity Yoga"). Through the visualization of various divinities, the energy channels are purified, the chakras are activated, and the Enlightenment consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War 2, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. When the war ended, the difference in countries' system, process and culture led to countries opposing each other.
Two years after the end of the war, the former Allies now became enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years and would be fought in earnest by proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already been broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight when over 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading Poland's eastern regions in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Polish-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships for freight transport is the most efficient way to transport large quantities of both people and goods across the oceans.
The Navy's job has traditionally been to ensure that your country continues to have the ability to move your people and goods, while affecting your enemy's ability to move its people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign in World War II. The Americans tried to transport soldiers and materials across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German fleet, which mainly used submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain like the rest of Europe.
As far as is known, goats were domesticated for the first time about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them so that they could have easy access to milk, fur, meat and skins.
House goats were generally kept in herds that roamed hills or other pastures, often watched by goat herders who were often children or teenagers, similar to the more commonly known shepherds. These herding methods are still used today.
As early as the 16th century, carriage roads were built in England.
Although the wagon tracks consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they meant that horses could pull heavier loads faster than on the slightly rougher roads of the time.
Sleepers were invented quite early, to keep the tracks in place. Gradually, however, it was realized that tracks would be more effective if they had an iron piece on top.
This became common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the carts.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first rails were used, which were made entirely of metal.
The first known method of transportation was walking, humans began walking upright two million years ago with the advent of Homo Erectus (meaning erect man).
Their predecessors Australopithecus did not usually walk upright.
There are bipedal specializations in Australopithecus fossils that are 4.2-3.9 million years old, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can begin to live more environmentally friendly, we can become part of the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is in many cases like treating symptoms. However, if we do not want just a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problems and deactivate them.
It is obvious that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological progress of mankind, and problems have become greater due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of man.
After Congress passed it on July 4, a handwritten draft was signed by Speaker of Congress John Hancock, and Secretary Charles Thomsen was then sent to John Dunlap's printing press a few blocks away.
Throughout the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now known as "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was conducted by John Nixon on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6, and on July 9 he had it read to his soldiers in New York. On August 10, a copy reached London.
The 25 Dunlap sheets still in existence are the oldest surviving edition of the document. The original handwritten version no longer exists.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive. We call them birds.
Most people don't see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
There are many things about birds that resemble dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, such as 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits - or bits, to use computer language.
Internal poisoning may not be visible immediately. Symptoms such as vomiting are far too general for an immediate diagnosis to be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open medicine container or toxic household chemicals.
See the label for specific instructions on first aid for the specific poison.
The term bug is used by entomologists as a formal description of this group of insects.
This term comes from ancient knowledge of bedbugs, which are insects that largely live as parasites on humans.
Both predatory ticks and bedbugs are nidicholess, which means they are adapted to living in their host's house or nest.
Across the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the largest neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system consisting of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are two times more likely to get MS than men.
A couple may decide that it is not best for them or their child that they have a baby.
It is possible for these couples to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In the event of adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can take them over.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works via the scientific method. This method is actually used in most scientific studies.
However, it does not stand alone, experimentation, and an experiment is a test used to dispel one or more possible hypotheses. Asking questions and making observations also leads to scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of Greek disappeared, the West felt cut off from its Greek roots in philosophy and science.
Many of the observations made in physiology and behavior often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and natural biological production.
Periodic rhythms, which are not reactions to external periodic signals, have been documented for most living beings such as bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-propelled oscillators that will continue a period of free-running cycles, even without external signals.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading suggestions that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
They made two experiments where they marked either the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of enjoying the landscape, plant and animal life.
Examples of activities on site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visits to parks, as well as studying information about the ecosystem.
One example is visiting, photographing and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
In the morning, people leave small villages by car to go to their place of work, and are passed by others whose places of work are the place that they have just left.
On this dynamic transport ferry, everyone is connected to, and supports, a transport system based on private cars.
The decarbonized economy has detached the biosphere from the stable phase that has supported human evolution for a few million years, science now believes.
Everyone is part of society and uses the transport systems. Almost everyone complains about the transport systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear as many complaints about water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why do transport systems give rise to such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transport engineers just incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is a study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, and their interaction with each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flows, because the behavior of motorists cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers typically behave fairly consistently; Thus, traffic is also typically fairly consistent and can be calculated mathematically.
To better represent the flow of traffic, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) power, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These conditions help plan, design and operate road construction.
Insects were the first animals to take to the skies. Their ability to fly helped them dodge enemies more easily and find food and partners more efficiently.
Most insects can fold their wings along the body.
This gives them a greater choice of small places where they can hide from predators.
Today, the dragonfly and the diurnal fly are the only insects that cannot fold their wings back.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system moved around the Sun.
Opinions were divided on his theory - some thought he was right, while many thought the opposite: that the solar system, including the sun (and even the other stars), revolved around the earth.
That seems sensible, because we can't feel the earth spinning, do we?
The Amazon River is the largest and second longest river on earth. It contains over 8 times as much water as the second largest river on Earth.
The Amazon River is also the world's widest river, and in some places is up to six miles (about 9.6 km) wide.
As much as 20 percent of the water flowing through the planet's rivers and into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River collects water from thousands of smaller rivers, but the main river itself is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long.
Although pyramid building with stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in the size and technical expertise of their constructions.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed at the monuments of their ancestors, which at that time were well over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world, and the country with the lowest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the colloquial language spoken by most of those who work in the state, while Latin is often used for religious ceremonies.
All residents of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known about the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper since ancient times because they are found in nature in their natural form and are relatively easy to dig for if you have the right tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything consists of a mixture of one or more of four elements. Namely, earth, water, air and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he had also had a theory that they change into new substances, to form what we see.
Alloys are basically mixtures of two or more metals. Do not forget that there are many substances in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter consists of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit into the period that ends this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil was a good friend for most people when it was published.
Unfortunately, the pencil has lost status and is being used less since new writing methods have appeared.
People now write messages through computer screens and never have to come near a sharpener.
One can only guess what will become of the keyboard when something new comes along.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to put together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
A bit like pushing a heavy cart up a hill. When the nucleus splits again, some of the energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break down under little or no influence.
The surface of the moon is made of rock and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the front and 100 km thick on the back.
It is thinner under the maria and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more lunar seas at the front, as the crust here is thinner. It was easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are centered on figuring out what makes people react or what appeals to them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they become more mature and reach adulthood.
The theories investigate what it is about certain people that causes them to perform certain actions and what elements of their environment cause them to perform or not perform certain actions.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's theory of the pyramid of needs, and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, two behaviors can occur when a manager begins to manage his former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is trying to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of leader has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, performance evaluations, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
At the opposite end of the spectrum, you transform into an unrecognizable individual who feels he or she must change everything the team has accomplished and make it his or her own.
After all, the manager is ultimately responsible for the successes and failures of the team.
This behavior often results in problems between the managers and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams have the same expectations for excellence as conventional teams, but there are slight differences.
Virtual team members often act as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have greater autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams can meet in different time zones, which their local management may not understand.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique part of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each of the members reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? One of the goals of putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
Creativity and ingenuity begin to show when all available resources are used effectively across an organization's functional departments.
As a result, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new, innovative process that meets the customer's needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, leaders must create a culture that fosters innovation, knowledge sharing and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method that can help organizations reach a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. Therefore, it narrows the field of research and makes it much more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain injuries, trauma, lesions and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes that we have never seen before.
This gives us lots of information and materials to build simulation models with that can help us understand our mental processes.
Although artificial intelligence is often associated with science fiction, it constitutes a very important branch of computer science that deals with behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research into AI includes being able to manufacture machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include checks, scheduling and schedules, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwritten recognition, voice and facial recognition.
Such things have become separate disciplines, focused on providing solutions to real life problems.
The AI system is now widely used in the economic, medical, engineering and military industries, as it has been built into numerous home computers and video game software applications.
Field trips are a big part of any class. Quite often, a teacher would love to take his students to places where it is not possible to travel by bus.
Technology offers solutions with virtual excursions. Students can look at museum artifacts, visit aquariums, or admire beautiful artwork while sitting in the classroom.
Sharing an excursion virtually is also a good method to evaluate an excursion and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, and every year the website is remodeled, but old versions still exist online as a kind of scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing skills. Although students often begin their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally corrects this.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog's author begins to strive to improve in writing to avoid criticism.
In addition, blogging "forces students to become wiser about the world around them." The requirement to give audiences what they want inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to expand their learning far beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "can help students become more analytical and critical; by providing active responses to Internet materials, students can define their roles in relation to what others have written, as well as describe their own perspectives on particular topics (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital and has a number of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
Further south is Niagara Falls, and the northern part is home to Muskoka and other areas' untapped natural beauty.
All of these things, as well as more, highlight Ontario as what is considered truly Canadian by outsiders.
Further north, there are large areas that are quite sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that surprises many: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and is a continent unto itself when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or are associated with France and known for their luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the country, and the religion quickly spread in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism started in the 15th century with the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama's discovery of the Cape route between Europe and India.
In the north, the region borders the Sahel, and in the south and west the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: it is recommended that all female travelers say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It makes sense to wear what may look like a wedding ring (it just shouldn't look too expensive.
Women should realize that cultural differences can result in what they would consider harassment, and it is not uncommon to be persecuted, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firm when rejecting men, and don't be afraid to say no (cultural differences or not, it's not okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century f.kr. and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to leave it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, and it was named Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs and a variety of knick-knacks, but it is very touristy.
Goma is a tourist resort in the Democratic Republic of Congo and lies to the east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, particularly in the city center.
Despite the fact that Goma is reasonably safe, all visits outside Goma should be investigated to understand the fighting taking place in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing Nyiragongo volcano as well as one of the cheapest places to track mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorbike taxi) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for the short trip.
Together with the city's relative inaccessibility, this has made "Timbuktu" a metaphor for exotic, remote places.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered World Heritage Sites due to the threat posed by the desert sands.
It was one of the major stops during Henry Louis Gates' special Wonders of the African World for PBS.
The city stands in sharp contrast to the rest of the country's cities because it has a more Arab flair than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east and Zimbabwe to the north, while the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions in South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in all South African national parks, there are daily conservation and admission fees to the park.
It can also be advantageous to purchase a Wild Card, as this either gives access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the territory of Hong Kong its name, and is the place that many tourists consider the primary area of focus.
The Hong Kong skyline is a group of buildings that, by their reflection in the waters of Victoria Harbour, are often compared to a glittering bar chart,
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the Kowloon waterfront on the opposite side.
Most of Hong Kong's urban development is densely packed together on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonizers made their own, so if you're looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 km from the coast and into Bangladesh and India's hinterland.
Sundarbans have been added to the UNESCO World Heritage List. The part of the forest that is within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, forests are not just mangrove swamps — they include some of the last remaining stands of the mighty forests that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which about a third is covered by water/marshland.
Sundarbans has been a game reserve since 1966 and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal king tigers and around 30,000 chital deer in the area.
Buses run from the interregional bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since buses in the district are often full, it's a good idea to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small, Japanese buses, which are both comfortable and robust.
Taxi sharing is a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Now) and Punakha (200 Now).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable bridge. It stretches across the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters high, the bridge is 378 meters long and has two lanes that are 3.50 m wide.
The vertical ground clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The building was completed in August 2011. It first opened to traffic in March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaranís were the most important indigenous group living in what is now eastern Paraguay, and they lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also farmed to survive.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurús and Payaguás, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly known as the "great province of India", was born in the 16th century as a result of the meeting between Spanish conquerors and indigenous peoples.
The Spaniards started the colonization period that lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain a lot of its original character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the world's best polo teams as well as some of the world's best players.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Also, smaller tournaments and matches can be watched here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments as well as where to buy tickets, please inquire at Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), the value of which is set equal to the value of one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands, and within Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On the outlying islands, credit cards are unlikely to be used, although British and American currencies may be usable; Check with owners ahead to find out which payment method is accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland's currency outside the islands, so be sure to exchange your money before you leave the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; during the summer months it is normal to have temperatures above 30°C.
Winter can be deceptively cool: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the wind and humidity combined make it feel colder than what's written on the thermometer.
There are no particularly "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rain remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, stay at least 100 yards/meter away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meter from all other wildlife!
No matter how docile they look, bison, moose, bears, and virtually any large animal can attack.
Every year, a lot of visitors get injured because they don't keep proper distance. These animals are large, wild and can be dangerous, so give them space.
In addition, be aware that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid bringing or preparing food that smells and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is Samoa's capital. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been Samoa's official capital since 1959.
The port was the scene of a notorious naval confrontation in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk except for one British cruise ship. Nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence, which was organized by the Mau movement, there was a peaceful gathering in the city that resulted in the assassination of Supreme Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches because Auckland is close to two ports. The most popular are located in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) are located in the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches with safe swimming, and most get natural shade from pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches can be found at Waitemata harbour in the exclusive suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good selection of shops along the sea. It is safe to swim here.
The most widespread local beer is "Number One", which is not a complicated beer but is pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines to drink, but the New Zealand and Australian wines are perhaps better to transport.
It's perfectly safe to drink the local tap water, but it's easy to find bottled water if you're concerned.
For Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is alien. A "short black" is called "espresso", cappuccino has lots of cream on top (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but in return excellent.
Many people visit the reef all year round, and people are rarely injured on the reef for these reasons.
Always listen to government advice, read and heed advice on signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Sea wasps occur near beaches and near estuaries from October to April north of 1770. They can occasionally also be found outside these times.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and want to swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live their active life in the sea, their main habitat is in estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Advance booking gives travelers peace of mind that they have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have offers on certain hotels, although it may be possible for you to book other types of accommodation through a travel agent, such as campsites.
Travel agencies tend to offer packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to/from the airport, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to consider the offer or provide other documents for your destination (e.g. a visa).
However, changes or requests should be directed to the tour operator first and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the majority of participants at music festivals choose to camp on site, and many participants consider it a crucial part of the experience.
If you want to be where it's going on, you have to go in early to get a tent pitch close to the music.
Remember that even though the music on the big stages is over, there may still be parts of the festival that play music until late in the evening.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
Check where your cabin is if you're crossing the Baltic Sea in winter, as sailing through ice can be quite noisy for those closest to you.
Cruise ship passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see terms), which is nice to know as cruises to Saint Petersburg give passengers time to see the city.
Casinos do everything they can to make sure that guests spend as much time and money as possible. Windows and clocks are usually not present and it can be difficult to find an exit.
They usually have special offers on food, drink and entertainment to keep guests in a good mood and keep them in the house.
In some places, alcoholic beverages are available at the house's expense. But drunkenness impairs judgment, and all true gamblers know how important it is to stay sober.
Everyone who will be driving at high latitudes or over mountain passes should take into account the possibility of snow, ice and sub-zero temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, there is low friction and you cannot drive as you normally would on dry asphalt.
During a snowstorm, enough snow can fall in a very short time to get you stuck.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or blowing snow, or by condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are common in many countries, and traffic mostly flows undisturbed all year round.
Safaris are the highlight for many and are perhaps what draws the most tourists to Africa.
The term safari is often used to refer to land travel to see the great African wildlife, especially on the savannah.
Some animals such as elephants and giraffes tend to approach the cars, and standard equipment is therefore enough to see the animals.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and you can better see them with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk", "walking safari" or "safari on foot") consists of hikes that take either a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held elsewhere in Japan.
Tokyo becomes the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, as it also hosted the Games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you could face problems.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies won't extend until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most tickets for the event will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with typical tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Ironing damp clothes can help to dry them. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board that you can borrow even if there isn't one in the room.
If you can't use an iron, or if you don't like wearing ironed socks, try using a hair dryer if available.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (which can cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, burn marks).
There are different ways to purify water, with some being more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, it is enough to boil water for a minute, in others several minutes are needed.
Filters vary in efficiency and if you are concerned you should consider purchasing your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests that they do not know from home.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritations or, in worse cases, cause allergic reactions, spread poison or transmit diseases.
Infectious diseases per se, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill humans, are not usually perceived as pests.
Duty-free shopping is the ability to buy goods in certain places that are exempt from taxes and duties.
Travelers heading to countries with a high tax rate can sometimes save significant amounts, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont offers the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, which often passes through isolated terrain in the hinterland.
Be wary if you're not used to road driving: steep hills, narrow lanes and sharp turns abound.
The speed limits set are remarkably lower than on pre- and after-route routes — typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) — and precise compliance with them is even more important than usual.
Curiously, the coverage on mobile phones is much stronger here than along many other stretches of the route such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German cakes are quite good, and in Bavaria they are very flavorful and varied, just like in Germany's southern neighbor, Austria.
Baked goods with fruit are common: apples are baked into cakes all year round, and cherries and plums make their appearance during the summer.
Many German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. Popular cakes and a strong cup of coffee often go hand in hand
If you fancy some small but full-bodied cakes, try what, depending on the region, is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices along with either meat or vegetables.
A curry is either "dry" or "wet" depending on how much liquid is in it.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries. In southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, it is common to use coconut milk.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is a general term that covers a huge variety of regional food cultures found throughout the country.
However, if the term is used without further elaboration, it typically refers to the food that originated in the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now Javanese cuisine is widely available throughout the archipelago; It consists of a variety of single spicy dishes, with the most popular spices being peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang down on each side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but can cause safety concerns due to the possibility of a rider's feet getting stuck in them.
If a rider falls off the horse but has a foot caught in the stirrup, he or she can be dragged along if the horse runs away. To minimize this risk, some safety precautions can be taken.
First, many riders wear riding boots with a heel and a soft, narrow sole.
Next, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow stirrup straps to detach from the saddle if pulled backwards by a falling rider.
Cochamó Valley - Chile's top climbing destination, known as South America's Yosemite, has a series of large granite walls and cliffs.
Mountain peaks present absolutely breathtaking views from the peaks for all visitors. Mountaineers from all over the world are continuously establishing new routes among its infinite potentials for new climbing walls.
Alpine winter sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports activities that involve riding down snowy terrains with skis or a snowboard strapped to your feet.
Skiing is a great travel activity with many enthusiasts - sometimes known as "ski bums" planning their entire holiday around skiing in a particular area.
People have been skiing for thousands of years - cave paintings dating back to 5,000 AD f.Kr show people skiing!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking on skis: This activity is also known as backcountry skiing, ski tours or ski hiking.
It is related to, but does not usually involve, alpine-style ski tours or mountaineering. The latter is performed on steep terrain and requires much stiffer skis and boots.
You must see the ski route as if it were a similar hiking route.
In good conditions, you will be able to cover somewhat greater distances than if you walk – but it is only very rare that you get the same speed as on cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack and on prepared tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, travelling through several countries would mean having to go through visa applications and passport control several times.
In this context, however, the Schengen area functions more or less as one country.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can usually cross borders without having to go through passport control again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you don't have to apply for a separate visa for each Schengen country, saving time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition for what manufactured goods are considered antiques. Some tax authorities define items older than 100 years as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit may be smaller in, for example, North America than in Europe.
Handmade products can be categorized as antiques, even if they are younger than similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer husbandry is an important livelihood for the Sami, and the culture around it is also important for many Sami people with other occupations.
Even traditionally, however, not all Sami kept reindeer on a large scale, but they lived by fishing, hunting and the like and mainly used the reindeer as draft animals.
Today, many Sami work in modern trades. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sami region.
Although the word "gypsy" is often used, especially among non-Romans, it is often considered offensive because of its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Roma population.
If travel advice occurs in the country you're visiting, your travel insurance or cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may also want to get advice from governments other than your own, but their advice will be designed for their own citizens.
One example is that American citizens in the Middle East may face a different situation from Europeans or Arabs.
The advice is only a brief overview of the political state of a country.
The views expressed are often with a sustained view of the matter, general and simplistic compared to the more detailed information that can be found elsewhere.
Extreme weather conditions are the general term for all dangerous weather phenomena that can cause damage or serious disruption to society or cost human lives.
Extreme weather events can occur all over the world, and there are different types, which can depend on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, extreme rainfall and wildfires are forms of, and effects of, severe weather like thunderstorms, tornadoes, cloud pumps and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, freezing rain, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of any risk of severe weather conditions that may affect their area, as it could affect any travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that can be considered a war zone should undergo professional training.
A search on the Internet for "Course in hostile environment" is likely to return the address of a local business.
A course will usually cover all the topics discussed here with much more detail, usually with practical experience.
A course will usually last from 2-5 days and will involve role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes there will be weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with wilderness survival are common, but there aren't many publications dealing with war zones.
Travelers planning gender reassignment surgeries abroad must make sure to bring valid documents for the return journey.
The willingness of governments to cooperate varies when it comes to issuing passports with unspecified gender (X), or documents that are updated to give a person a desired name and gender.
The willingness of foreign governments to respect these documents varies just as much.
Searches at security checks have also become more urgent in the period since 11 September 2001.
Transgender passengers who have not had surgery should not expect to get through the scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
The current of waves returning and breaking on the beach, often at a reef or equivalent, is called a countercurrent.
Due to the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper sections, and a fast flow to deep water can be formed there.
Most deaths happen as a result of fatigue trying to swim back against the current, which can be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, it's no harder than usual to swim back.
Try aiming somewhere where you won't be caught again, or, depending on your skills and whether you've been detected, you may be able to wait for you to be rescued.
Homecoming shock comes faster than culture shock (there is not to the same extent a period of excitement about the new), lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travelers who had an easy time adapting to the new culture sometimes find it very difficult to adapt to their own culture.
When you come back home, after living abroad, you have adapted to the new culture and lost some of your habits from your home culture.
When you traveled abroad for the first time, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that a traveler in a brand new country needs to adapt.
People do not necessarily expect patience and understanding to be necessary when returning home.
The pyramid sound and light show is one of the most interesting activities in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show begins.
Usually you always hear the sounds of tourists and vendors. The story of sound and light is like a storybook.
The Sphinx is set as a background and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are shown on the pyramids and the different pyramids light up.
The South Shetland Islands, which were discovered in 1819 and claimed by many nations, have the most bases, sixteen of which are active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception, where an active volcano's flooded caldera provides a spectacular natural harbor area.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the peninsula bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here the mountains of the peninsula meet on the plateau and form the 360 km long chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, which is divided in two by the Minnesota glacier.
The northern part of the Sentinel Range holds Antarctica's highest mountains, the Vinson Massif (also called Mount Vinson), which peaks at 4,892 m.
In remote areas without mobile coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone, as you must be outside and have a clear view of the satellite to make a phone call.
This service is often used by shipping, including pleasure craft, as well as expeditions that need remote data and voice.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide you with more information about connecting to this service.
One option that is becoming increasingly popular for those planning a gap year is to travel and learn.
This is especially popular among school leavers as it allows them to take a year off before university without compromising their education.
In many cases, a course abroad during your gap year can actually improve your chances of getting a place in higher education in your home country.
There will typically be a tuition fee to enroll in these programs.
Finland is a great destination for sailors. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands in the lakes as well as in the archipelagos along the coast.
In the archipelagos and lakes you do not necessarily need a yacht.
Although the coastal archipelago and largest lakes are large enough for any yacht, you get a different experience in a smaller boat or even a kayak.
Sailing is a national hobby in Finland, where there is one boat for every seven or eight people.
This is somewhat reminiscent of Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise it is quite unique (e.g. in the Netherlands the number is one to forty).
On most Baltic cruises, an extended stay in St. Petersburg in Russia is offered.
This means you can visit the historic city for a few full days, going back and sleeping on the ship at night.
If you only go ashore with the ship's excursions, you do not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some cruises have Berlin, Germany in the brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not at all close to the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Flying by air can be a daunting experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they haven't flown before or if they've experienced a traumatizing event.
It's nothing to be ashamed of: it's no different from the fear and hatred of other things that many people suffer from.
For some, understanding how an airplane works and what happens in flight can help overcome a fear based on the unknown or not being in control.
Delivery companies take good pay to deliver quickly. Often time is very important when it comes to business documents, goods or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes the larger airlines have their own aircraft, but on other routes and in smaller companies there was a problem.
If they were shipping things via air freight, on some routes it may have taken days to get through unloading and customs clearance.
The only way to get it through faster was to send it as checked baggage. The rules of airlines do not allow them to send baggage without a passenger. That's where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to put out a big pile of money to get the opportunity (or better yet, have your company do it for you).
However, this is not cheap: as a rough rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the economy class normal price for business class and eleven times the price for first class!
Generally speaking, there is no need to look for discounts on business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that certain core groups of passengers are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting there quickly and comfortably, and they set their prices accordingly.
Moldova's capital is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognised by any member states of the United Nations.
Economic relations have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova despite the breakdown in political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is Turkey's third largest city with a population of approximately 3.7 million, the country's second largest port after Istanbul, and a very large transport hub.
What was once the old city of Smyrna is now a modern, developed and bustling commercial town nestled around a large bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, glass façade buildings and modern shopping malls are surrounded by traditional red tiled roofs, the old 18th-century market and old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere more Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík overlooks the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery there are interesting marble sculptures of pigeons over some tombstones.
It's worth spending half an hour walking around the exciting village.
To the north and within easy reach is the romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, made famous among foreigners after a laudatory account of its magnificence by Lord Byron.
Scotturb Bus 403 runs regularly to Sintra and stops at Cabo da Roca.
In the north, you can also visit the great sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (altar), which is the site of world-famous Marian spirits.
Remember that you are actually visiting a mass burial site. A place that is of crucial importance to a large part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive who survived their time here, and many more who had loved ones murdered or worked to death there, both Jews and non-Jews.
Please treat the place with all the dignity, solemnity and respect that it deserves. Don't tell jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not disfigure the place with markings or by scratching graffiti on the structures.
Barcelona's official languages are Catalan and Spanish. About half prefer to speak Catalan, the vast majority understand it and almost everyone can speak Spanish.
However, most signs are only indicated in Catalan because it has been established by law as the official language.
Nevertheless, Spanish is also widely used, in public transport and other facilities.
General announcements in the metro are only given in Catalan, but unforeseen changes are communicated via an automated system in several different languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians possess a reputation of being self-absorbed, rude and arrogant.
Although this is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get along with people in Paris is still to behave as nicely as possible, you should behave like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-behaved). This will make it significantly easier to get around.
The cool exterior of Parisians evaporates quickly if you show basic courtesy.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is filled with woodlands - mainly with beech and coniferous trees - and offers a mix of both alpine and Mediterranean plants.
It has a remarkably wide variety of plant communities due to its many microclimates, different soil types, and varying elevation levels.
The area is also home to an extremely wide variety of animals and bird species.
Here, along with many more common species, you will find rare fauna such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat and capercaillie.
During visits to monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover their knees, while also having their shoulders covered.
Most of the monasteries have scarves for women who show up unprepared, but if you bring your own and especially some with bright colors, you will get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear pants that cover their knees.
This can be borrowed from the warehouse at the entrance, but the clothes are not washed after each use, so you may not be completely comfortable wearing these skirts. One size fits all men!
Mallorcan cuisine, like other similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and the use of a great deal of olive oil.
A simple, popular dinner, especially in summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomato and any kind of available side dishes such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, including the word Sie for you, always begin with a capital, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and intendixes
It undoubtedly also makes reading easier, although writing is somewhat complicated by the need to find out whether a verb or adjective is used in a noun form.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to look out for are c and g, as their pronunciation varies depending on the trailing vowel.
Also, be sure to pronounce r and rr differently: caro means dear, while carro means chariot.
Persian has a relatively easy and mostly common grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammatical primer will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand sentences.
Just so you know, if you know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, people who know a little Spanish can quickly conclude that Portuguese is similar enough to it that you don't have to study it separately.
Premodern observatories are usually obsolete today and remain as museums or places of education.
Since light pollution in its heyday was not the kind of problem it is today, it is usually found in cities or campuses, where it is easier to reach than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities in remote areas with good atmospheric conditions.
Looking at blossoming cherry trees, known as Hanami, has been a tradition in Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China, where flowers from plum trees were the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom feasts were held by the emperor for only himself and other members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.
Plants look best when they are in a natural environment, therefore you need to resist the temptation to "take just one specimen".
If you visit a publicly accessible garden, you will be thrown out without discussion if you collect "samples".
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to visit and very easy to navigate, and you can buy almost anything after you arrive.
But when you are in the "high tropics", just a few degrees north of the equator, you have to deal with both heat (all the time) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, which is more rare).
There are also a few buses heading north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives.
Be sure to check if the bus you're considering taking goes into Hebron, and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
The inland waterways can be a good theme to base a holiday around.
For example, visiting castles in the Loire Valley or the Rhine Valley, cruising to interesting towns on the Danube or sailing along the Erie Canal.
They also define routes for popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of Christianity's most important holidays and is celebrated as Jesus' birthday.
Non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians from all over the world have embraced many of the traditions of the holidays.
There is a tradition to stay awake on Easter night to watch the sunrise in an exposed place.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may well be a spring and fertility ritual from before Christianity.
The more traditional churches often hold Easter vigils on Saturday evenings during Easter weekends, with congregations often bursting into celebration at midnight to celebrate Christ's resurrection.
All animals that originally arrived on the islands came here either by swimming, flying or floating.
Due to the long distance from the continent, mammals could not make the journey, making the giant tortoise the primary grass-eating animal in the Galapagos.
Since the first humans came to the Galapagos, many mammals have been imported such as goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit Arctic or Antarctic areas in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun will not rise above the horizon.
This provides a good opportunity to see polar lights, as the sky will be dark more or less around the clock.
Since not many people live in the areas and light pollution is therefore often no problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners are used to.
Suits are standard business attire, and colleagues address each other by their last name or job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is important, thus emphasizing group effort rather than praising individual achievements.
Workers often need their superiors to approve every decision they make, and they are expected to obey their superiors' instructions without question.
