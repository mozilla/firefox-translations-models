While an experimental vaccine appears to be able to reduce the death rate from Ebola, so far no drugs have been shown to be used to treat an existing infection.
The antibody mixture ZMapp first showed promise in the field, but formal studies indicated it was less effective than expected in preventing deaths.
In the PALM trial, ZMapp served as a control, meaning the researchers used it as a baseline and compared the other three treatments to it.
USA Gymnastics supports the United States Olympic Committee&#39;s letter and agrees with the Olympic family&#39;s imperative to promote a safe environment for all of our athletes.

Not only does this confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widely held, it also provides details that fossils generally cannot, such as the color and three-dimensional arrangement.
. Scientists say this animal&#39;s plumage was chestnut brown on top with a light or carrot colored underside.
The find also provides insight into the development of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, called a quill, but have other characteristics of feathers—rays and bi-rays—the researchers deduced that quills were probably a later evolutionary development than these other characteristics.
The structure of the fins suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or for decoration. The researchers believed that although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows adult plumage and not a chicken&#39;s down.
The researchers believe that the sample from the tail of the young dinosaur shows the plumage of an adult individual and not the down of a chicken.
A car bomb detonated at police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty other people.

They found that the Sun works on the same basic principles as other stars: the activity of all the stars in the system turned out to be driven by their brightness, their rotation and nothing else.
The luminosity and rotation are used together to determine a star&#39;s Rossby number, which is related to the plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in terms of magnetic reversals.

The work performed was mostly theoretical, but the program was designed to simulate observations of the SagDEG galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be a result of tidal-like forces between the galaxy&#39;s dark matter and the Milky Way&#39;s dark matter.
Just as the Moon exerts a pull on the earth and causes tides, so the Milky Way exerts a force on the SagDEG galaxy.
The researchers could conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory states that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is found around the galaxy in a kind of ring and consists of lots of small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
He said in an interview that the new variant was &quot;very concerning and cause for alarm because of its very high mortality rate.&quot;
Some patients may have contracted the virus in the hospital, Dr. Moll, and at least two were hospital health workers.
In a year&#39;s time, an infected person can infect between 10 and 15 close contacts.

During the day they are cooler than the surrounding surface and at night they are warmer.
&quot;Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Surveys (USGS) Astrogeology Team and Northern Arizona University, Flagstaff, Arizona said: &quot;Their thermal behavior indicates that they are quite deep holes in the Earth, although they do not behave as stably as large holes on Earth , which often maintains a fairly constant temperature throughout the day.&quot;
In France, voting has traditionally been low-tech: Voters isolate themselves in a box and put a pre-printed piece of paper indicating their choice of candidate into an envelope.
Once officials have verified the voter&#39;s identity, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voting list.
The procedure is codified very precisely in French electoral law.
Ballot boxes have been transparent since 1988, so that voters and observers can see that the ballot boxes do not contain ballots at the start of voting and that no other ballots are added than those that have been correctly counted and come from approved voters.
Candidates may send representatives as witnesses to all parts of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under close supervision and according to specific procedures.

Huhne has resigned and will be replaced in the Cabinet by MP Ed Davey. MP Norman Lamb is expected to take over the job of trade minister that Davey is leaving.
Huhne and Pryce will appear at Westminster Magistrates Court on the 16th. February.
The dead were Nicholas Alden, 25, and Zachary Cuddeback, 21. Cuddeback was the driver.
Edgar Veguilla received arm and jaw wounds, while Kristoffer Schneider was left needing reconstructive surgery to his face.
Uka&#39;s weapon failed while pointed at a fifth man&#39;s head. Schneider is in constant pain, is blind in one eye, is missing part of his skull and has a face that has been reconstructed with titanium.
Schneider testified via video link from a USAF base in his home country.
In addition to Wednesday&#39;s event, Carpanedo competed in two individual races at the championships.
Her first was the slalom where she did not complete her first run. 36 of the 116 participants got the same result in the race.
In her second race, which was giant slalom, she finished tenth in the women&#39;s sitting group with an overall time of 4:41.30. 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first-placed woman, Austria&#39;s Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than Hungary&#39;s Gyöngyi Dani, who finished ninth.
Four skiers in the women&#39;s seated group did not complete the race, and 45 out of a total of 117 giant slalom skiers did not qualify in the race.
Police in Madhya Pradesh recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General DK Arya said: &quot;We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and we have found her mobile phone and laptop&quot;.
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people in the house when the car hit it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the accident happened was temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke&#39;s Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged at Edinburgh Sheriff Court with murdering her son.
She is in custody awaiting arraignment and trial, but eyewitness evidence may be flawed because her photo has been widely published.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish courts operate differently and the courts have viewed the publication of images as potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee comments that &quot;it certainly seems that journalists need to be careful if they publish images of suspects etc&quot;
The Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for prosecutions, has indicated to reporters that no further comment will be made, at least until the indictment.
According to the leak, the document will refer to the border dispute that Palestine wants based on the borders from before the 1967 Six Day War.
Other topics covered reportedly include the future state of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both countries, as well as the issues surrounding the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years once an agreement is signed, while the Palestinian Authority only agrees to leave the valley for five years.
Shooters in the supplemental pest control trial had to be closely monitored by park rangers as the trial was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association&#39;s hunting program.
According to Mick O&#39;Flynn, the NPWS Acting Director of Conservation and Heritage, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received extensive safety and training instruction.
A new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) of nine members was yesterday sworn in by Martelly.
It is Martelly&#39;s fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the former CEP&#39;s resignation was recommended by a presidential commission as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
Martelly&#39;s response to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October was the commission.
The sometimes violent protests were sparked by the failure to hold elections, some of which had not been held since 2011.
In approximately 60 reported cases, defective iPods have overheated, causing a total of six fires and minor burns to four people.
Japan&#39;s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents involving the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of another 34 cases of overheating, which the company called &quot;non-serious.&quot;
The ministry responded by calling Apple&#39;s postponement of the report &quot;quite regrettable.&quot;
The earthquake hit Mariana at 07:19 local time (09:19 GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office announced that there were no reports of injuries in the nation.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Philippine policeman has taken tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages including children and the elderly were released early and so were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the place of an elderly lady as she went to the toilet. Mendoza was shot down.
Liggins followed in his father&#39;s footsteps and started a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and in 1959 began working at Auckland&#39;s National Women&#39;s Hospital.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching early births in his spare time.
His research showed that if given a hormone, it would speed up the development of the baby&#39;s lungs in the fetal stage.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two &quot;black box&quot; flight recorders on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said &quot;Luna was the first queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna died on the night of two moons. Pretty unique, like herself. Strong woman.&quot;
Dustin &quot;Goldust&quot; Runnels commented that &quot;Luna was as crazy as me... maybe even more... love her and will miss her... hopefully she&#39;s in a better place now.&quot;
Of 1,400 people polled ahead of the 2010 federal election, the number of those opposed to Australia becoming a republic grew by 8 per cent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II&#39;s reign.
34 percent of those in the survey share this view, and want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia&#39;s last monarch.
At the opposite extremes of the poll, 29 percent of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was due to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints his condition has been in doubt.
He could not take the medication needed to combat his pain, as these are prohibited during the Games.
Curtis Cooper, mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered on January 25 the largest known prime number to date.
Several people confirmed this discovery in early February using different hardware and software, and on Tuesday it was announced.
Comets may have been a source of water on Earth along with organic matter that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, and especially how Earth was formed since comets collided with Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, became governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as &quot;political backbiting and foolishness&quot;.
One wonders whether he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, enables aircraft to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel per year and reduce CO2 emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, as opposed to older technology based on ground-based radars, to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more precise information.
No additional transport will be deployed and the aboveground trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and park-and-ride facilities will not be available at the ground.
Fears of a lack of transport raised the possibility that the game would be forced to be played behind closed doors without the team&#39;s fans.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported on the formation of a new species of bird in the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the US and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the new species developed in just two generations, although this process was thought to have taken much longer due to mating between the endemic Darwin&#39;s finch geospiza fortis and the invasive cactus finch geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into all sorts of shapes. It can be rolled into very small shapes.
It can be pulled out to a thin cable which can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and applied to other metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted pictures in books called &quot;illuminated manuscripts&quot;.
This is called the pH value of a chemical. You can make an indicator by using red cabbage juice.
The cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH value is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Shake the two dry powders together, then press them together into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which will feel strange and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet connected to a sophisticated sewage system in almost every house,
Remains of sewage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities on Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women stayed together in mixed company.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and reflects it back down almost immediately.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because Earth&#39;s atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
Putting a satellite or telescope into space requires a giant rocket that is over 100 feet tall.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The biggest thing that the wheel has done for us is that it has given us much easier and faster methods of transportation.
It has given us the train, the car and many other means of transport.
Below them are several medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelope and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including loose domestic cats) which eat the much more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret to their success is a concept of the niche, a special task each cat has that keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social felines and live in large groups called packs.
Flocks consist of one to three related adult males and up to thirty females and young.
The females are usually closely related to each other and are a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion packs react much like wolves or dogs in packs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
The tiger is a good athlete who can climb (though not well), swim, long jump and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones who can roar.
The tiger&#39;s roar is not like the loud roar of a lion, but sounds more like a string of snarling, shouted words.
Ocelots prefer small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they have the opportunity. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that ocelots follow and find animals to eat (prey) via smells, by sniffing where they have been on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision and they also move around very quietly. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from which they came (as if they move across a mountain range or river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily move back), they will often find themselves in a different environment than they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population needs to have different features or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than previously needed.
The original population has not changed at all. It still needs the same adjustments as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, they begin to resemble the rest of the population less and less.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Species are an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants make oxygen, which humans inhale, and they absorb carbon dioxide, which humans exhale (ie breathe out).
Plants make their food from the sun by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses from plants and make clothes from plants. Most of the foods we eat are plants. Without plants, animals would not be able to survive.
Mosasaurus was the top of the food chain in its time, so it feared nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws had more than 70 razor-sharp teeth and an extra set at the top of its mouth, meaning there was no escape for anything that crossed its path.
We don&#39;t know for sure, but it may have had a split tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that entered the water. Even a giant dinosaur like a T. rex would be nothing against it.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans ate quite a few strange or unusual things, including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called a heptapod.
Another difference was that while the poor and the women ate their food sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to have large feasts together, lying on their sides while they ate.
Ancient Roman meals could not have included foods that came to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had neither corn, tomatoes, potatoes, nor cocoa, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built each of their gods a primary temple, which was considered the home of the god.
People brought sacrifices to the gods and the priests tried to fulfill the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple court and an inner sanctuary that only the priests were allowed to enter.
Sometimes pyramid-shaped towers, so-called ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
The Hebrew family lived most of its life outdoors.
Women cooked the food in the yard; the shops were just open counters facing the street. Stone was used to build houses with.
There were no large forests in Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was settled with few people. In the Norse sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled further west he found Greenland and called it Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, there were already Inuit tribes living in the area at the time.
Although each country was &quot;Scandinavian&quot;, there were many differences between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you&#39;ve seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map is drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Even if something is written on the back of the document, it is not a tax card.
Written on the back of the American Declaration of Independence were the words &quot;Original Declaration of Independence, Dated July 4th, 1776&quot;. The text appears at the bottom of the document when it is turned upside down.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in its life the large parchment document (it measures 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for safekeeping.
So it is likely that the annotation was simply added as an addition.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles had liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
It was ruled by the Vichy French government - there are French people who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with them instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, Allied troops invaded southern France; the invasion was called &quot;Operation Dragoon&quot;.
In just two weeks, the Americans and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were focusing on Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a larger, significant group of people living together and cooperating, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, and is related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state; and it also somehow defines the size of society.
City-states are the forerunners of nations. A culture of civilization implies the transmission of knowledge across generations, long-term cultural influence and fair dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence, and are not recognized as real civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government—with Congress as the only component—under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and because there was no national executive or judiciary, they depended on the often uncooperative state authorities to enforce all actions.
Nor did it have any right to override tax laws and tariffs between states.
The Articles required the unanimous acceptance of all the states before they could be amended, and the states took such lenient effect on the central government that their representatives were often absent.
Italy&#39;s national football team is, together with Germany&#39;s national football team, the second most successful team in the world and became FIFA World Champion in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motorsport.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to, from a geographical point of view, as an &quot;archipelago&quot;
Taiwan&#39;s history begins as far back as the 15th century, when European sailors passing by the island named it Ilha Formosa, or the beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a change in indigenous grain production practices, employing Chinese laborers to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) troops take control of Taiwan&#39;s western and northern coastal areas, and in 1885 declare Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after a defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Peace of Shimonoseki Treaty, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been re-established, and excavations continue to this day.
For example, the most common photographic format in the world for stills is 35mm, which was the most common film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been inherited from sensor formats in digital cameras.
The 35mm format is actually, confusingly, 36mm wide and 24mm tall.
The aspect ratio for this format is therefore 3:2 (divided by twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio).
Many common formats (for example the APS formats) are equal or close to this aspect ratio.
The much abused and often ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline which creates dynamism and at the same time keeps a certain order in an image.
It says that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and influential, was scrutinized.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion bound European countries together despite different languages and customs.
Its all-encompassing power affected everyone from king to commoner.
One of the most important Christian dogmas is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church&#39;s financial resources are used specifically for this purpose.
The central authority of the Church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this dogma was being properly lived up to.
Shortly after hostilities broke out, Britain launched a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective, preventing important military and civilian supplies from arriving. This blockade was in violation of recognized international laws codified in several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain laid mines in international waters to prevent ships from entering entire sections of the sea, which was a danger even to neutral ships.
Since there was limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the attitudes of most citizens and nations leaned toward pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents on him, a collection of poems and a written recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his boss from his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, different time periods were displayed in a unique way; each Chinese time period or each ruling family was a distinct dynasty.
In addition, between each dynasty there was an unstable period of divided provinces. The most famous of these periods was the Three Kingdoms era, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods there was fierce war between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history. Thousands of people died in the struggle to sit in the highest seat in the Grand Palace in Xi&#39;an.
There are a lot of social and political effects, such as the use of the meter system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to one ruler.
Even after the revolution, the professions were open to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to do well.
The same applies to the military, because instead of class-based ranking in the army, ranking was now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working class people from other countries to start their own internal revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond worldly life. He used to visit a cave known as &quot;Hira&quot; on the mountain &quot;Noor&quot; (light) to immerse himself in his thoughts.
The cave itself, which has survived through time, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad&#39;s spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca and completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find at all, even if you know it exists. When you are inside the cave, it is total isolation.
Only the clear beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains can be seen. Very little of the outside world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders still standing today.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE and is one of many large pyramidal structures built in honor of the dead pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or &quot;Giza Necropolis&quot; in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, contains several pyramids (of which the world-famous Great Pyramid is the largest of them all), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created to honor the pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu&#39;s wives and family members.
The &quot;up-bow&quot; mark looks like a V and the &quot;down-bow&quot; mark looks like a staple, or a square missing its bottom side.
Up means you start at the tip and push the bow, and down means you start at the frog (where your hand holds the bow) and draw the bow.
Upstrokes usually produce a softer sound, while downstrokes sound stronger and more powerful.
You can always insert your own markings, but remember that the entered bow markings are determined for musical reasons, so they should usually be respected.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles) and the King&#39;s sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced back to Paris from Versailles on 6 October 1789 by a bunch of market women.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a screaming mob of people shouting threats at the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep the windows of their carriage fully open.
At one point, a member of the mafia displayed the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles to the frightened queen.
The war expenses of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
The Philippines had to pay taxes to the American colonial power to raise money for the bulk of the expenses, and the bond interest ran through the banks on Wall Street in the name of the government.
Of course, the super profits from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the basic gains of American imperialism.
In order to understand the Knights Templar, one has to understand the context in which the order was founded.
The time period in which these events took place is commonly known as the High Middle Ages, the part of European history that took place in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages preceded the Early Middle Ages, which were followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ends around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that includes a wide range of ideas in practice from technology as a driving force or technological necessity, to a narrow idea that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic that is connected to scientific laws, as well as the way they materialize in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a route largely outside of cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has an &quot;impact&quot; on society that is heritable and not socially conditioned .
For example, one can say that the motor-driven car necessarily leads to the development of roads.
But a nationwide road network is not economically viable for just a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
When many people own cars, there are also more accidents on the roads, which leads to the invention of new techniques in the field of health to heal body injuries.
Romanticism contained a large element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, it was geography that shaped the individual, and over time, customs and cultures arose that were related to geography, and these were in harmony with the location of society and were therefore better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
In the same way that Paris is known today as the capital of fashion in the modern world, Constantinople was considered the capital of fashion in feudal Europe.
It is known for being an epicenter of luxury since approximately AD 400. and lasted until around AD 1,100.
Its status declined in the twelfth century, mainly because crusaders had returned with gifts such as silk and spices that were of greater value than what the Byzantine markets could offer.
It was at that time that the title of capital of fashion passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style was most widespread in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries. century and the 14th century.
In the beginning, the clothes were largely inspired by the Byzantine culture in the East.
However, as a result of the slow communication channels, the Western styles could lag behind by 25-30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest developments of the time as a result of the Crusades was that people started using buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence farming is farming done to produce enough food to simply meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple and often organic system that uses stored seeds native to the ecoregion, in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques, to maximize yields.
Historically, most farmers have been engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel overlooked by societal standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinctive because of the age, ethnic background, social class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The qualities that regulate a subculture as distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of several factors.
Individuals who belong to a subculture often signal their affiliation through a distinct and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, manners, and slang.
One of the most common ways to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw on the few unfortunate cases where children, through failure, accident or willful neglect, have not been socialized by adults during their childhood.
Such children are called &quot;feral&quot; or feral. Some feral children have been deprived of their liberty by humans (most often their own parents); in some cases this child failure was caused by parental rejection of a child&#39;s severe intellectual or physical impairments.
Feral children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or run away.
Others are claimed to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild on their own.
When raised by non-human animals, the feral child exhibits behavior (within physical limits) almost identical to the animal that cared for the child, such as its fear or lack of interest in humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but a support for people who have to learn new things - e.g. to use a new computer program or start a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real, in other words a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is the little paper clip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is internalized in the software, and aims to question, ask for and explain procedures that may have been too challenging for the student to handle alone.
Children enter foster care for a wide variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment without nourishment, care and education, yet they do.
We see the foster care system as a safety zone for these children.
Our foster care system must provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
A foster family is tasked with providing all necessities that were not available in the home they were removed from.
The Internet combines mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The special characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions regarding the use and satisfaction approach.
For example, it is suggested that &quot;learning&quot; and &quot;socializing&quot; are important motives for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
&quot;Personal involvement&quot; and &quot;enduring relationship&quot; were also identified as new motivational factors by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the understanding of microexpressions, which are facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can identify whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
In his article The President&#39;s Speech, Oliver Sacks indicated how people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are nevertheless able to judge sincerity with great accuracy.
He even believes that such abilities to interpret human behavior can also be found in pets such as dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two distinct pools of genetic variation: the invisible and the visible.
New genetic variation is added via mutation, and it is removed from the pool of exact variations via selection.&quot;
Segregation and recombination shuffle the variation back and forth between the two pools with each generation.
Out on the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to satisfy its need for amino acids from available plant sources.
In addition, there are serious consequences for non-compliance: reduced growth, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The most readily available plant resources would have been the proteins found in leaves and legumes, but for primates like us, these are difficult to digest unless cooked.
Conversely, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easy to digest. It also provides large amounts of protein, which contains all the essential amino acids.
All in all, it shouldn&#39;t surprise us if our own ancestors solved their &quot;protein problem&quot; in much the same way that chimpanzees on the savanna do today.
Sleep disturbance is the process of consciously waking up during your normal sleep period and falling asleep a short time later (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself turning off the clock while you sleep, you can place it across the room, forcing you to get up to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options involve drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) prior to sleep, forcing one to get up and urinate.
The amount of inner calm a person possesses is the exact opposite of the amount of tension a person possesses in body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force. All people have the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can learn to understand. The only thing standing in the way of achieving this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the Buddha&#39;s teachings, but was expanded by the Mahayana path of love and with a lot of techniques from Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-encompassing love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy is brought to life (enlightenment energy) through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of divinity (&quot;Deity Yoga&quot;). Through the visualization of various divinities, the energy channels are cleared, the chakras are activated, and the enlightenment consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. When the war ended, the difference in the countries&#39; system, process and culture led the countries to oppose each other.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies now became enemies, and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and would be fought in earnest by proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defenses were already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian beachhead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight when over 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union&#39;s Red Army occupied and established the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after invading Poland&#39;s eastern regions in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Polish-Soviet non- non-aggression pact as well as other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is the most efficient way to transport large quantities of both people and goods across the seas.
The navy&#39;s task has traditionally been to ensure that your country continues to have the ability to move your people and goods, while at the same time affecting your enemy&#39;s ability to move his people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign in World War II. The Americans tried to transport soldiers and materials across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, which mainly used submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany probably would have been able to capture Britain as well as the rest of Europe.
As far as is known, goats were first domesticated approximately 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes started keeping them so they could have easy access to milk, fur, meat and hides.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that roamed hills or other pastures, often overseen by goat herders who were often children or teenagers, equivalent to the more commonly known shepherds. These herding methods are still used today.
As early as the 16th century, carriage roads were built in England.
Although the carriageways consisted simply of parallel wooden planks, they meant that horses could pull heavier loads faster than on the slightly rougher roads of the time.
Sleepers were invented quite early, to keep the tracks in place. Eventually, however, it was realized that tracks would be more effective if they had an iron piece on top.
This became common practice, but the iron caused more wear and tear on the wagons&#39; wooden wheels.
Eventually wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first rails were used that were made entirely of metal.
The first known method of transportation was walking, humans began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (meaning upright man).
Their predecessors Australopithecus did not usually walk upright.
Bipedal specializations are found in Australopithecus fossils that are 4.2-3.9 million years old, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can become part of the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to reduce the future suffering to some extent.
In many cases, this is just like treating symptoms. But if we don&#39;t want just a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problems and disable them.
It is obvious that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological progress of mankind, and problems have increased due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of man.
After Congress passed it on July 4, a handwritten draft was signed by Speaker of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomsen was then sent to John Dunlap&#39;s printing office a few blocks away.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made during the night, which are now known as &quot;Dunlap broadsides&quot;.
The first public reading of the document was performed by John Nixon on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6, and on July 9 he had it read to his soldiers in New York. On 10 August a copy reached London.
The 25 Dunlap sheets still in existence are the oldest surviving version of the document. The original handwritten version no longer exists.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive. We call them birds.
Most people don&#39;t see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
There are many things about birds that resemble dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, e.g. 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits - or bits, to use computer parlance.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms such as vomiting are far too general for a diagnosis to be made immediately.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open medication container or toxic household chemicals.
See the label for specific first aid instructions for the specific poison.
The term bug is used by entomologists as a formal description of this group of insects.
This term comes from old knowledge of bed bugs, which are insects that largely live as parasites on humans.
Both roaches and bed bugs are nidiculous, meaning they are adapted to live in their host&#39;s house or nest.
Across the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system consisting of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may decide that having a baby is not in the best interest of them or their child.
It is possible for these couples to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can take them over.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works via the scientific method. This method is actually used in most scientific studies.
However, it does not stand alone, experimentation, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses. Asking questions and making observations also lead to scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle&#39;s views on all scientific matters, including psychology, were accepted.
As the knowledge of Greek disappeared, the West felt cut off from its Greek roots in philosophy and science.
Many of the observations made in physiology and behavior often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and natural biological production.
Periodic rhythms, which are not responses to external periodic signals, have been documented for most living things such as bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-running oscillators that will continue for a period of free-running cycles, even without external signals.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading proposals that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages or viruses to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
They did two experiments in which they marked either the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the landscape as well as the flora and fauna.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visiting parks as well as studying information about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, photographing and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Where in the morning people leave small villages by car to go to their place of work, and are passed by others whose places of work are the place they have just left.
On this dynamic transport ferry, everyone is connected to, and supports, a transport system based on private cars.
The decarbonized economy has loosened the biosphere from the stable phase that has supported human development for a few million years, science now believes.
Everyone is part of society and uses the transport systems. Almost everyone complains about the transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear as many complaints about water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why do transport systems give rise to such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers just incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is a study of the movements of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, and their interaction with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flows is difficult because drivers&#39; behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers typically behave fairly consistently; thus the traffic is also typically reasonably consistent and can be calculated mathematically.
In order to better represent the traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These conditions help to plan, design and operate road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to fly into the air. Their ability to fly helped them evade enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects can fold their wings along the body.
This gives them a greater variety of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the goldsmith and the mayfly are the only insects that cannot fold their wings back.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system moved around the Sun.
Opinions were divided about his theory - some believed he was right, while many believed the opposite: that the solar system, including the sun (and even the other stars), revolved around the earth.
It seems reasonable, because we can&#39;t feel the earth spinning, can we?
The Amazon River is the largest and second longest river on earth. It contains over 8 times as much water as the second largest river on earth.
The Amazon River is also the world&#39;s widest river, being up to six miles (about 9.6 km) wide in some places.
As much as 20 percent of the water that flows through the planet&#39;s rivers and into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River collects water from thousands of smaller rivers, but the main river itself is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long.
Although stone pyramid building continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in the size and technical excellence of their constructions.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed by the monuments of their ancestors, which at the time were well over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is around 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world, and the country with the lowest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language spoken by most of those working in the state, while Latin is often used for religious ceremonies.
All residents of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known about the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper since ancient times because they are found in nature in their natural form and are relatively easy to mine if you have the right tools.
The philosopher Aristotle had the theory that everything consists of a mixture of one or more of four elements. Namely earth, water, air and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he had also theorized that they change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basically mixtures of two or more metals. Don&#39;t forget that there are many substances in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course there are also metals such as silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit into the period that ends this sentence.
That&#39;s why the pencil was a good friend to most people when it came out.
Unfortunately, the pencil has lost its status and is used less since new writing methods have appeared.
People now write messages through computer screens and never need to come near a pencil sharpener.
One can only guess what will become of the keyboard when something new comes along.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it requires energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
A bit like pushing a heavy cart up a hill. When the nucleus splits again, some of the energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning they tend to break apart under little or no impact.
The surface of the moon is made of rock and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick at the front and 100 km thick at the back.
It is thinner under the maria and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more moon gardens on the front, as the crust here is thinner. It was easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are centered on finding out what makes people respond or what appeals to them.
These theories propose that people have certain needs and/or desires that have become internalized as they mature and reach adulthood.
The theories examine what it is about certain people that causes them to take certain actions, and what elements in their environment cause them to perform or refrain from performing certain actions.
Two popular content theories are Maslow&#39;s theory of the pyramid of needs, and Hertzberg&#39;s two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two types of behavior can occur when a manager starts to manage his former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is trying to remain &quot;one of the guys&quot; (or girls).
This type of leader has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary actions, performance evaluations, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the opposite end of the spectrum, one turns into an unrecognizable individual who feels that he or she must change everything the team has accomplished and make it their own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team&#39;s successes and failures.
This behavior often results in problems between the leaders and the rest of the team.
The same expectations for excellence are set for virtual teams as conventional teams, but there are slight differences.
Virtual team members often serve as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams may meet in different time zones, which their local management may not understand.
The presence of a true “invisible team” (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique part of a virtual team.
The &quot;invisible team&quot; is the management team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? One of the goals of putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
Creativity and ingenuity begin to emerge when all available resources are used effectively across the functional departments of an organization.
As a result, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that meets the customer&#39;s needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, managers must create a culture that promotes innovation as well as knowledge sharing and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method that can help organizations reach a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. Therefore, it narrows the field of research and makes it much more precise.
The connection between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and examine brain structures and processes that we have never seen before.
This gives us lots of information and materials with which to build simulation models that can help us understand our mental processes.
Although artificial intelligence is often associated with science fiction, it constitutes a very important branch of computer science that deals with behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in AI includes being able to make machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include checking, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting recognition, voice and face recognition.
Such things have become separate disciplines, focusing on providing solutions to real life problems.
The AI system is now commonly used in the financial, medical, engineering, and military business fields, as it has been incorporated into numerous home computers and computer game software applications.
Field trips are a big part of any class. Quite often a teacher would love to take his students to places where it is not possible to travel by bus.
The technology offers solutions with virtual excursions. Students can look at museum pieces, visit aquariums or admire beautiful works of art while sitting in the classroom.
Sharing a field trip virtually is also a good way to evaluate a field trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, each year students from the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, and each year the website is redesigned, but old versions still exist online as a kind of scrapbook.
Blogging can also help improve students&#39; writing skills. Although students often begin their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally corrects this.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog&#39;s author begins to strive to improve his writing in order to avoid criticism.
Additionally, &quot;blogging forces students to become more aware of the world around them.&quot; The requirement to give the audience what they want inspires students to be clever and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning far beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs &quot;can help students become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their roles in relation to what others have written as well as describe their own perspectives on certain topics (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada&#39;s charming, bilingual capital and has a number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada&#39;s past and present.
Further south is Niagara Falls and the north is home to Muskoka and other areas of untapped natural beauty.
All of these things and more highlight Ontario as what is considered truly Canadian by outsiders.
Further north there are large areas which are quite sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that surprises many: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is clearly the largest and is a continent unto itself when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or are associated with France and known for their luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the country, and the religion quickly spread on the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism started in the 15th century with Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama&#39;s discovery of the Cape route between Europe and India.
In the north, the region borders the Sahel, and in the south and west the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: it is recommended that all female travelers state they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It makes sense to wear what may look like a wedding ring (it just shouldn&#39;t look too expensive.
Women should realize that cultural differences can result in what they would consider harassment, and it is not unusual to be stalked, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firm when rejecting men and don&#39;t be afraid to say no (cultural differences or not, it&#39;s not okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC. and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya and it was named Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs and a wide range of trinkets, but it is very touristy.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and is located in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city&#39;s streets, particularly in the city center.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, any visit outside of Goma should be researched to understand the fighting taking place in North Kivu province.
The city is also a base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano as well as one of the cheapest places to track mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for the short trip.
Coupled with the city&#39;s relative inaccessibility, this has made &quot;Timbuktu&quot; a metaphor for exotic, faraway places.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered World Heritage Sites due to the threat of the desert sands.
It was one of the major stops during Henry Louis Gates&#39; special Wonders of the African World for PBS.
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country&#39;s cities, because it has more of an Arab flair than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east and Zimbabwe to the north, while the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which supports different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions in South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in all South African national parks, there are daily conservation and park entry fees.
It can also be advantageous to buy a Wild Card, as this either gives access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all of South Africa&#39;s national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the territory of Hong Kong its name, and is the place that many tourists consider the primary area of focus.
Hong Kong&#39;s skyline is a group of buildings that, by their reflection in the waters of Victoria Harbour, are often compared to a glittering bar chart,
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the Kowloon waterfront on the opposite side.
The majority of Hong Kong&#39;s urban development is tightly packed on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonizers made their own, so if you&#39;re looking for evidence of the area&#39;s colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 km from the coast into the hinterland of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been added to the UNESCO World Heritage List. The part of the forest that is within Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not just mangrove swamps — they include some of the last remaining stands of the mighty forests that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km², of which about one-third is covered by water/marshlands.
The Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now 400 royal Bengal tigers and around 30,000 chital deer in the area.
Buses run from the inter-regional bus station (across the river) throughout the day although most, especially those going east and to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
As the buses in the district are often full, it is a good idea to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese buses, which are both comfortable and robust.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l&#39;Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters high, the bridge is 378 meters long and has two lanes that are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres. Construction was completed in August 2011. It only opened to traffic in March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational by September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important group of indigenous people living in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who also farmed for survival.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurús and the Payaguás, who survived by hunting, gathering and fishing.
Formerly known as the &quot;Great Province of India&quot;, Paraguay came into being in the 16th century as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and the indigenous population groups.
The Spanish started the period of colonization that lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the world&#39;s best polo teams as well as some of the world&#39;s best players.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where to buy tickets, you can ask the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), whose value is set equal to the value of a British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands, and within Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On the outer islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although British and American currency may be accepted; ask the owners ahead of time to find out what payment method is accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falklands currency outside the islands, so make sure you exchange your money before you leave the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; in the summer months it is normal to have temperatures above 30°C.
Winter can be deceptively chilly: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than what the thermometer says.
There are no particularly &quot;rainy&quot; and &quot;dry&quot; seasons: the amount of rain remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park officials, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals!
No matter how docile they look, bison, moose, bears, and pretty much any large animal can attack.
Every year, a lot of visitors are injured because they don&#39;t keep a proper distance. These animals are large, wild and can be dangerous, so give them space.
Additionally, be aware that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid bringing or cooking food that smells and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Founded in the 1850s, Apia has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the setting for an infamous naval confrontation in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All the ships were sunk except for one British cruiser. Nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, there was a peaceful assembly in the town that resulted in the killing of the paramount chief, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches because Auckland is close to two harbours. The most popular are located in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbor district) lie in the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches with safe swimming and most get natural shade from pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located at Waitemata Harbor in the exclusive suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good selection of shops along the seafront. It is safe to swim here.
The most common local beer is &quot;Number One&quot;, which is not a complicated beer but is pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called &quot;Manta&quot;.
There are many French wines to drink, but the New Zealand and Australian wines are perhaps better to transport.
It&#39;s perfectly safe to drink the local tap water, but bottled water is easy to find if you&#39;re concerned.
For Australians, the idea of a &quot;flat white&quot; coffee is foreign. A “short black” is called “espresso”, cappuccino has lots of cream on top (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate lives up to Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many people visit the reef all year round and people are rarely injured on the reef for these reasons.
Always listen to advice from the authorities, read and obey advice on signs and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Sea wasps occur near beaches and near estuaries from October to April north of 1770. They can occasionally be found outside these times as well.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live their active lives in the sea, their primary habitat is in estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Advance booking gives the traveler peace of mind that they have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have deals on specific hotels, although it may be possible for you to book other types of accommodation through a travel agent, such as campsites.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to/from the airport, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to consider the offer or obtain other documents for your destination (eg a visa).
However, changes or requests should be addressed to the tour operator first and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the majority of music festival attendees choose to camp on site, and many attendees consider it a crucial part of the experience.
If you want to be where the action is, get in early to get a tent spot close to the music.
Remember that even though the music on the big stages has ended, there may still be parts of the festival that play music late into the evening.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
Check where your cabin is if you are crossing the Baltic Sea in winter, as sailing through ice can be quite noisy for those closest to you.
Passengers on cruise ships are exempt from visa requirements (see terms and conditions), which is nice to know as cruises to St. Petersburg give passengers time to see the city.
Casinos do everything they can to ensure that guests spend as much time and as much money as possible. Windows and clocks are usually not present, and it can be difficult to find an exit.
They usually have special offers on food, drink and entertainment to keep guests in a good mood and keep them in the house.
In some places, alcoholic drinks are offered at the house&#39;s expense. But drunkenness impairs judgement, and all true gamblers know how important it is to be sober.
Anyone who must drive in high latitudes or over mountain passes should take into account the possibility of snow, ice and freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, there is low friction and you cannot drive as you normally would on dry asphalt.
During a blizzard, enough snow can fall in a very short time to get you stuck.
Visibility can also be limited by falling or blowing snow, or by condensation or ice on the vehicle&#39;s windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are common in many countries, and traffic flows mostly undisturbed all year round.
Safaris are the highlight for many and are perhaps what draw the vast majority of tourists to Africa.
The term safari is often used to refer to overland travel to see the beautiful African wildlife, especially on the savannah.
Some animals such as elephants and giraffes tend to approach the cars, so standard equipment is enough to see the animals.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and you can see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a &quot;bush walk&quot;, &quot;walking safari&quot; or &quot;safari on foot&quot;) consists of walks that either take a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held elsewhere in Japan.
Tokyo will become the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, as it also hosted the 1964 Games.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may run into problems.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not extend to July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most tickets for the event will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with typical tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Ironing damp clothes can help dry them. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board that you can borrow, even if there isn&#39;t one in the room.
If you don&#39;t have access to an iron, or if you don&#39;t like wearing socks that have been ironed, try using a hair dryer if one is available.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (which can cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, burn marks).
There are different ways to purify water, with some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas it is enough to boil water for one minute, in others several minutes are needed.
Filters vary in effectiveness and if you are concerned you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests that they do not know from home.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritations or, in worse cases, cause allergic reactions, spread poison or transmit diseases.
Infectious diseases per se, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people, are not usually considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods in certain places that are exempt from taxes and duties.
Travelers heading to countries with a high tax rate can sometimes save significant amounts, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont offers the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, often passing through isolated backcountry terrain.
Be careful if you are not used to driving on country roads: steep hills, narrow lanes and sharp bends abound.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than on stretches before and after — typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) — and it is even more important than usual to adhere to them accurately.
Oddly enough, mobile phone coverage is much stronger here than along many other sections of the route, such as Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria they are very flavorful and varied, just like in Germany&#39;s southern neighbor, Austria.
Baked goods with fruit are common: apples are baked into cakes all year round, and cherries and plums make their appearance during the summer.
Many German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. Popular cakes and a strong cup of coffee often go hand in hand
If you fancy some small but rich cakes, you can try what are called Berliners, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen depending on the region.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices together with either meat or vegetables.
A curry is either &quot;dry&quot; or &quot;wet&quot; depending on how much liquid is in it.
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries. In southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, it is common to use coconut milk.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella term that covers a wide variety of regional food cultures found throughout the country.
However, if the term is used without further elaboration, it typically refers to the food originally originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now Javanese cuisine is widely available throughout the archipelago; it consists of a variety of simply spiced dishes, with the most popular spices being peanuts, chillies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are supports for the rider&#39;s feet, which hang down on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but can present safety concerns due to the possibility of a rider&#39;s feet getting caught in them.
If a rider falls off the horse but has a foot caught in the stirrup, he can be dragged along if the horse runs away. To minimize this risk, one can take some safety measures.
First, many riders use riding boots with a heel and a soft, narrow sole.
Next, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars which cause the stirrup straps to come loose from the saddle if they are pulled backwards by a falling rider.
Cochamó Valley - Chile&#39;s top climbing destination, known as South America&#39;s Yosemite, has a series of large granite walls and cliffs.
Mountain peaks present absolutely breathtaking views from the peaks to all visitors. Mountaineers from all over the world are continuously establishing new routes among its endless potential for new climbing walls.
Alpine winter sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports activities that involve riding down snowy terrain with skis or a snowboard strapped to your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts - sometimes known as &quot;ski bums&quot; who plan their entire vacation around skiing in a particular area.
People have been skiing for thousands of years - cave paintings as far back as 5,000 BC show people skiing!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking on skis: This activity is also called backcountry skiing, ski touring or ski hiking.
It is related to, but does not usually involve, alpine style ski touring or mountaineering. The latter is carried out in steep terrain and requires much stiffer skis and boots.
You must see the ski route as if it were a similar hiking route.
In good conditions, you will be able to cover somewhat greater distances than if you walk - but it is very rare that you will get the same speed as on cross-country skiing without a heavy rucksack and on prepared tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would mean going through visa applications and passport control multiple times.
In this connection, however, the Schengen area functions more or less as one country.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can normally cross borders without having to go through passport control again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa you do not have to apply for a separate visa for each Schengen country, which saves time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what manufactured goods are considered antiques. Some tax authorities define items older than 100 years as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit can be lower in, for example, North America than in Europe.
Handmade products can be categorized as antiques even though they are younger than similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood for the Sami, and the culture surrounding it is also important for many Sami with other professions.
Even traditionally, however, not all Sámi kept reindeer in a big way, but they lived from fishing, hunting and the like and mainly used the reindeer as draft animals.
Today, many Sami work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sami area.
Although the word &quot;Gypsy&quot; is often used especially among non-Roma, it is often considered offensive due to the word&#39;s association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Roma population.
If travel restrictions arise in the country you are visiting, your travel insurance or cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may also want to get advice from governments other than your own, but their advice will be tailored to their own citizens.
One example is that American citizens in the Middle East may face a different situation than Europeans or Arabs.
The advice is only a brief overview of the political situation in a country.
The views expressed are often with a cursory look at the matter, general and simplified compared to the more detailed information that can be found elsewhere.
Extreme weather conditions are the general term for all dangerous weather phenomena that can cause damage or serious social disruption or cost human life.
Extreme weather conditions can occur all over the world and there are different types which can depend on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, extreme rainfall and wildfires are forms of, and effects of, severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, cloudbursts and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include blizzards, freezing, icing and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of any risk of severe weather affecting their area, as this could affect any travel plans.
Anyone who plans to visit a country that may be considered a war zone should undergo professional training.
An Internet search for &quot;Hostile Environment Course&quot; will likely yield the address of a local business.
A course will usually cover all the topics discussed here in much more detail, usually with hands-on experience.
A course will usually last from 2-5 days and will involve role playing, a lot of first aid and sometimes there will be weapons training.
Wilderness survival books and magazines are common, but there are not many publications that deal with war zones.
Travelers planning gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure that they bring valid documents with them for the journey home.
The willingness of governments to cooperate varies when it comes to issuing passports with gender unspecified (X), or documents updated to give a person a desired name and gender.
The willingness of foreign governments to respect these documents varies just as much.
Screening visits have also become more intrusive in the period since September 11, 2001.
Transgender passengers who have not had surgeries should not expect to get through the scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
The current from waves returning and breaking on the beach, often at a reef or similar, is called a counter current.
Due to the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper sections and a rapid flow to deep water can be formed.
Most deaths occur as a result of exhaustion from trying to swim back against the current, which can be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, it is no more difficult than usual to swim back.
Try to aim for a place where you won&#39;t be recaptured or, depending on your skills and whether you&#39;ve been spotted, you might be able to wait to be rescued.
Homecoming shock comes sooner than culture shock (there is not as much a period of excitement about the new), lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travelers who found it easy to adapt to the new culture sometimes find it very difficult to adapt to their own culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have adapted to the new culture and lost some of your habits from your home culture.
When you traveled abroad for the first time, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that a traveler in a completely new country needs to adjust.
People do not necessarily expect that it is necessary to show patience and understanding when returning home as a traveler.
The sound and light show of the pyramid is one of the most interesting activities in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can watch them in silence before the show begins.
Usually you always hear the sound of tourists and vendors. The story of sound and light is like a storybook.
The Sphinx is set as a background and tells a long story.
The scenes are shown on the pyramids and the different pyramids light up.
Discovered in 1819 and claimed by many nations, the South Shetland Islands have the most bases, with sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception, where the flooded caldera of an active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor area.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the peninsula bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here the mountains of the peninsula meet on the plateau and form the 360 km long chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, which is divided in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part of the Sentinel Range holds Antarctica&#39;s highest mountains, the Vinson Massif (also called Mount Vinson), which peaks at 4,892 m.
In remote areas without mobile coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a substitute for a cell phone, as you need to be outside and have a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a phone call.
This service is often used by shipping, including pleasure craft, as well as expeditions that need remote data and voice.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide you with more information about connecting to this service.
One option that is becoming more and more popular for those planning a sabbatical is to travel and learn.
This is particularly popular with school leavers as it allows them to take a year out before university without compromising their education.
In many cases, a course abroad during your gap year can actually improve your chances of getting a place at higher education in your home country.
There will typically be a tuition fee to enroll in these degree programs.
Finland is a great destination for sailors. The &quot;Land of a Thousand Lakes&quot; also has thousands of islands in the lakes as well as in the archipelagos along the coast.
In the island seas and lakes, you don&#39;t necessarily need a yacht.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are big enough for any yacht, you get a different experience in a smaller boat or even a kayak.
Sailing is a national hobby in Finland, where there is one boat for every seven or eight people.
This is somewhat reminiscent of Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise it is quite unique (e.g. in the Netherlands the number is one to forty).
Most Baltic cruises offer an extended stay in St. Petersburg in Russia.
This means you can visit the historic city for a couple of full days, returning and sleeping on the ship at night.
If you only go ashore with the ship&#39;s excursions, you do not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some cruises have Berlin, Germany in their brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not at all close to the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or if they have experienced a traumatic event.
It is nothing to be ashamed of: it is no different from the fear and hatred of other things that many people suffer from.
For some, understanding how an airplane works and what happens in flight can help overcome a fear based on the unknown or not being in control.
Delivery companies charge well for fast delivery. Time is often of the essence when it comes to business documents, goods or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes the larger companies have their own planes, but on other routes and in smaller companies there was a problem.
If they sent items via airfreight, on some routes it may have taken days to get through unloading and customs clearance.
The only way to get it through faster was to send it as checked baggage. Airline rules do not allow them to send baggage without a passenger. That&#39;s where you come into the picture.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to shell out a big wad of cash for the option (or better yet, get your company to do it for you).
This isn&#39;t cheap though: as a rough rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy class price for business class and eleven times the price for first class!
Generally speaking, there is no need to look for discounts at all on business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know that certain core groups of passengers are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting on quickly and comfortably, and they set their prices accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any member states of the United Nations.
Economic relations have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova despite the breakdown in political negotiations.
The largest religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is Turkey&#39;s third largest city with a population of approximately 3.7 million, the country&#39;s second largest port after Istanbul, and a very large transport hub.
What was once the ancient city of Smyrna is now a modern, developed and bustling trading city situated around a large bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, glass-fronted buildings and modern shopping malls are surrounded by traditional red-tiled roofs, the 18th-century old market and ancient mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere that is more Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík overlooks the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery there are interesting marble sculptures of doves above some tombstones.
It is worth spending half an hour walking around the exciting village.
To the north and within easy reach is the romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, made famous among foreigners by a glowing account of its splendor by Lord Byron.
Scotturb Bus 403 runs regularly to Sintra and stops at Cabo da Roca.
To the north you can also visit the great shrine of Our Lady of Fatima (altar) which is the place of world-famous Marian spirits.
Remember that you are actually visiting a mass grave site. A place that has an absolutely crucial meaning for a large part of the world&#39;s population.
There are still many men and women alive who survived their time here, and many more who had loved ones murdered or worked to death there, both Jews and Gentiles.
Please treat the place with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves. Don&#39;t tell jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not deface the site with markings or by scratching graffiti on the structures.
Barcelona&#39;s official languages are Catalan and Spanish. About half prefer to speak Catalan, the vast majority understand it, and almost all can speak Spanish.
However, most signs are only indicated in Catalan, because it has been established by law as the official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used, in public transport and other facilities.
General announcements in the metro are given only in Catalan, but unforeseen changes are announced via an automatic system in several different languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-absorbed, rude and arrogant.
Although this is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get along with people in Paris is to still behave as nicely as possible, you have to act like someone who is &quot;bien élevé&quot; (well-mannered). It will make getting around much easier.
The cool exterior of the Parisians evaporates quickly if you show basic courtesy.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is filled with forested areas - mainly beech and conifers - and offers a mix of both alpine and Mediterranean plants.
It has a remarkably wide variety of plant communities due to its many microclimates, different soil types and varying elevation levels.
The area is also home to an extremely large variety of animal and bird species.
Here, along with many more common species, you will find rare fauna such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat and bull.
When visiting the monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover the knees, while also having their shoulders covered.
Most of the monasteries have scarves for women who show up unprepared, but if you bring your own and especially some with strong colors, you will get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear trousers that cover the knees.
This can be borrowed from the warehouse at the entrance, but the clothes are not washed after each use, so you may not be completely comfortable wearing these skirts. One size fits all men!
Mallorcan cuisine, like other similar Mediterranean areas, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and the use of a lot of olive oil.
A simple, popular dinner, especially in summer, is Pa amb Oli: Bread with olive oil, tomato and any kind of side dish available such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, including the word Sie for you, always begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects
It undoubtedly also makes reading easier, although writing is somewhat complicated by the need to find out whether a verb or adjective is used in a substantive form.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The most important letters to watch out for are c and g, as their pronunciation varies depending on the trailing vowel.
Also, make sure to pronounce r and rr differently: caro means dear, while carro means carriage.
Persian has a relatively easy and mostly common grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammar primer will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and understand sentences better.
Just so you know, if you know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, people who know a little Spanish can quickly conclude that Portuguese is similar enough to not need to be studied separately.
Pre-modern observatories are usually obsolete today and remain as museums or educational sites.
Since light pollution in their heyday was not as much of a problem as it is today, they are usually found in cities or on campuses where they are easier to get to than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities in remote areas with good atmospheric conditions.
Viewing cherry blossoms, known as Hanami, has been a tradition in Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China, where blossoms from plum trees were the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were held by the emperor for only himself and other members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.
Plants look best when they are in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to &quot;just take one sample&quot;.
If you visit a publicly accessible garden, you will be kicked out without discussion if you collect &quot;specimens&quot;.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to visit and very easy to navigate around, and you can buy almost anything after you arrive.
But when you&#39;re in the &quot;high tropics,&quot; just a few degrees north of the equator, you have to deal with both heat (all the time) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, which is more rare).
There are also a few buses that go north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives.
Be sure to check that the bus you are considering taking goes into Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
The inland waterways can be a good theme to base a holiday around.
For example, visiting castles in the Loire Valley or the Rhine Valley, taking a cruise to interesting cities on the Danube or sailing along the Erie Canal.
They also define routes for popular walking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of Christianity&#39;s most important holidays and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians from around the world have adopted many of the holiday&#39;s traditions.
There is a tradition of staying awake on Easter night to watch the sunrise in an exposed location.
There are of course Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may very well be a spring and fertility ritual from before Christianity.
The more traditional churches often hold an Easter vigil on the Saturday evening of the Easter weekend, where the congregations often break out into celebration at midnight to celebrate Christ&#39;s resurrection.
All animals that originally arrived on the islands got here either by swimming, flying or floating.
Due to the long distance from the continent, mammals could not make the journey, making the giant tortoise the primary herbivore in the Galapagos.
Since the first humans came to the Galapagos, many mammals have been imported such as goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This provides a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky will be dark more or less around the clock.
Since not many people live in the areas, and therefore light pollution is often not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners are used to.
Suits are standard business attire, and colleagues address each other by their last name or job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is important, thus emphasizing group effort rather than praising individual achievements.
Workers often have to have their superiors approve all decisions they make, and they are expected to obey their superiors&#39; instructions without question.
