While a trial vaccine appears to be able to reduce the mortality rate of Ebola, so far no drugs have been shown that they can be used to treat an existing infection.
The antibody mixture ZMapp first seemed promising in the field, but formal studies indicated that it was less effective than the presumption of preventing deaths. 
In the PALM trial, ZMapp acted as control, meaning the researchers used it as a baseline and compared the other three treatments with it.
The U.S. Gymnastics supports the U.S. Olympic Committee's letter, and accepts the absolute need of the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all of our athletes.
We agree with the USOC statement that it is in the belief of our athletes and clubs, and their sports, best interests, to proceed with meaningful changes within our organization instead of de-certification.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widespread, it also provides details that fossils generally cannot, such as the color and the three-dimensional arrangement.
. . Scientists say this animal's plumage was chestnut brown at the top with a bright or carrot-coloured underside.
The find also provides insight into the development of feathers in birds. 
Because the dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, called a feather shaft, but have other hallmarks of feathers - rays and bee rays -- the researchers emitted that feather shaft was likely to be a later evolutionary development than these other characteristics. 
Removed structure suggests that they were not used for flying, but rather for temperature regulation or for garnish. The researchers believed that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows an adult plumage and not a chicken's down.
The researchers believe that the sample from the tail of the young dinosaur shows an adult individual's plumage and not a chicken's down.
A car bomb detonated at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning, killing two police officers and wounding more than twenty other people.

They found that the sun works on the same basic principles as other stars: the activity of all the stars in the system proved to be driven by their brightness, their rotation and nothing else.
The brightness and rotation are used together to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to the plasma stream.
The less the Rossby number, the less active the star in terms of magnetic terms.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was designed to simulate observations of the SagDEG galaxy.
The effect that the team was looking for would be a result of tidal-like forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts a move on Earth and causes tides, likewise the Milky Way exerts a force on the galaxy SagDEG.
The researchers could conclude that the dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory says that most dark matter around a galaxy is found around the galaxy in a kind of ring and consists of lots of tiny particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered the extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
He said in an interview that the new variant was "very worrying and that there was reason for alarm because of its very high mortality rate."  
Some patients may have had the virus in the hospital, believes Dr. Moll, and at least two were the hospital's health workers.
In a year's time, an infected person can infect between 10 and 15 close contacts. 
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the entire group of people with tuberculosis still seems low; 6,000 of the 330,000 infected people in South Africa at any given time.

During the day they are cooler than the surrounding surface, and at night they are warmer.
"Glen Cushing from the United States Geological Surveys (USGS) Astrogeology Team and Northern Arizona University, Flagstaff, Arizona said: "Their thermal behavior indicates that they are quite deep holes in the ground, even if they don't behave as stable as large holes on Earth that often keep a fairly constant temperature throughout the day." 
In France, voting has traditionally taken place low-techly: voters isolate themselves in a box and put a pre-printed piece of paper indicating their choice of candidate, in an envelope.
Once officials have verified the identity of the voter, the voter puts the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voting list.
The procedure is codified very accurately in French electoral law.
Since 1988, ballots have been transparent so that voters and observers can see that the urns do not contain ballots at the start of the vote and that no ballot papers other than those who are correctly counted and come from approved voters are added. 
Candidates can send representatives as witnesses to all parts of the process. In the evening, the votes of volunteers are counted under strict supervision and according to specific procedures.

Huhne has resigned and will be replaced in the Cabinet by MP Ed Davey. MP Norman Lamb is expected to take over the job of trade minister, which Davey leaves.
Huhne and Pryce are due to meet at the Westminster Magistratetes Court on February 16.
The dead were Nicholas Alden, 25 and Zachary Cuddeback, 21. Cuddeback was a driver.
Edgar Veguilla received arm and jaw wounds, while Kristoffer Schneider was left in need of reconstructing surgery for his face.
Uka's weapon failed while it was pointed towards a fifth man's head. Schneider has persistent pain, is blind in one eye, missing part of the skull and has a face that has been rebuilt with titanium.
Schneider testified via video link from a USAF base in his homeland. 
Besides Wednesday's event, Carpanedo competed in two individual races at the championship. 
Her first was slalom, where she didn't complete her first run. 36 of the 116 participants got the same result in the race.
In her second race, which was grand slalom, she finished in tenth place in the women's sitting group with a total maturity of 4:41.30. 2:11.60 minutes slower than the woman in first place, Austrian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary, who finished in ninth place.
Four skiers in the women's group for seated practitioners did not complete the race, and 45 out of a total of 117 skiers in the big slalom did not rank in the race. 
Police in Madhya Pradesh found the stolen laptop and mobile phone. 
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said: 'We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and we have found her mobile phone and laptop'. 
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki told reporters that the accused met in court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people in the house when the car hit it, none of them were injured.
The driver, however, sustained serious injuries to his head. 
The road where the accident took place was temporarily closed while the emergency services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth. 
He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge. 
Adekoya has since been charged with the Edinburgh Sheriff Court of murdering her son. 
She is in custody and is waiting to be indicted and come to court, but evidence from eyewitnesses may be flawed because her image has been published widely.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish courts are functioning differently and courts have considered the publication of images as potentially harmful. 
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee comments that "it certainly seems that journalists should be careful if they publish pictures of suspects and the like."
Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for prosecution, has indicated to journalists that no further comment will be given until the indictment is available. 
According to the leak, the document will refer to the border dispute that Palestine wants based on the pre-twiss border in 1967.
Other items that were covered signify, reportedly, include the future state of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both countries, as well as the problems surrounding the Jordan Valley. 
Israel demands a constant military presence in the valley for ten years when a deal has been signed, while the Palestinian authorities only agree to leave the valley for five years.
Shooters in the additional pest control experiment had to be followed closely by the parkers as the trial was monitored and its efficacy was evaluated.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program. 
According to Mick O'Flynn, the acting director of nature conservation and cultural heritage in NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received extensive safety and training instruction.
A new Provisional Election Council (CEP) of nine members was yesterday sworn in by Martelly.
It's Martelly's fifth CEP in four years. 
Last month, the earlier CEP's resignation was recommended by a presidential commission as part of a package of actions to move the country towards new elections.
Martelly's response to the widespread anti-regime protests, which began in October, was the commission.
The sometimes violent protests were sparked by failure to hold elections, some of them had not been held since 2011.
In approximately 60 notified cases, defective iPods have been overheated, causing a total of six fires and causing four people less burns. 
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that they had known 27 accidents that had to do with the units.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of another 34 instances of overheating, which the company called "non-serious."
The ministry responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "quite regrettable."
The earthquake hit Mariana at 9pm. 07:19 local time (09:19 GMT Friday). 
The North Marian Emergency Department announced that no damage had been reported in the nation.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no sign of a tsunami. 
A former Philippine policeman has taken tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the Philippines capital. 
Rolando Mendoza fired its M16 at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed as dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early and also the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took an elderly lady's place when she was going to the toilet. Mendoza was shot down. 
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and started a career in medicine.
He took an education as an obstetrician and in 1959 began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital.
While working in the hospital, Liggins began researching early births in his spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone were given, it would accelerate the development of the baby's lungs in the fetal stage. 
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two "black box" flight recorders on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.  
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the first queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna died at night with two moons. Pretty unique, just like herself. Strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as wild as me... maybe even more... love her and is going to miss her... hopefully she's a better place now." 
Out of 1,400 people surveyed ahead of the 2010 federal election, the number of those who oppose Australia becoming a republic grew by 8 percent since 2008.
Constituent Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the campaign for the 2010 federal election that she believed that Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those in the survey share this view, and want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
In the vote's various extremes, 29 percent of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent think Australia should never become a republic.   
The Olympic gold medal winner was to swim in the style of 100 m and 200 m free and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but because of his complaints, there have been doubts about his condition.
He could not take the medication needed to fight his pain, as these are banned during the Games.
Curtis Cooper, mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered d. January 25 the largest known prime number to date. 
Several people confirmed this discovery in early February using different hardware and software, and on Tuesday it was announced.
Comets may have been a source of water on the ground along with organic matter that can form proteins and support life. 
Scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, and especially how Earth was formed since comets collided with Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, became governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill that legalized marriage for same-sex couples.
He referred to the rumours as "political talk and foolishness." 
One wonders if he's running for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, enables aircraft to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel per year and reduce CO2 emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, unlike older technology based on radars on the ground, to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No extra transport is put in and the trains above ground will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and park-and-ride options will not be available on the ground.
Fear of lack of transport raised the possibility that one would be forced to play the match behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published in the journal Science reported on the formation of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galápago Lakes.   
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the new species was developed in just two generations, although it had been thought that this process should have taken much longer due to mating between the endemic Darwin-fine geospiza fortis and the invasive cactus finch geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be processed for all kinds of forms. It can be rolled into very small shapes. 
It can be pulled out to a thin cable, which can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into plates.
It can be made very thin and put on other metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted images in books, which were called "enlightened manuscripts."
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator by using red cabbage juice. 
The cabbage juice changes color, depending on how acidic or alkaline (alkaline), the chemical is.
The pH value is given by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the tested chemical. 
Brin options are protons that have had their electrons removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Shake the two dry powders together, then press them together into a ball with clean, wet hands. 
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which will feel strange and form a kind of shell. 
The towns of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet connected to a sophisticated sewage system in almost every house, 
Residues of sewage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan towns in Crete and Santorini in Greece.  
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women stayed together in mixed company.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and reflects it down again almost immediately.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and sight.
Putting a satellite or telescope into space requires a giant rocket that is over 100 feet high.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The biggest thing the wheel has done for us is that it has given us much easier and faster transport methods.
It has given us the train, the car and many other means of transport.
Underneath them, there are several medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey that range from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including loose domestic cats) who eat the far more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds. 
The secret to their success is a concept of the niche, a special task every cat has that keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats and live in large groups called flocks.
The flocks consist of one to three related adult males as well as up to thirty females and cubs. 
The females are usually closely related to each other and are a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion flocks react much like wolves or dogs in flocks, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
The tiger is a good athlete who can climb (though not well), swim, jump far and pull with five times the strength of a strong human being.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the loud roar from a lion, but sounds more like a phrase of sneering, shouted words.
Ozelotes prefer small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they have the opportunity. Almost all the animals that the ozelotte hunts are much smaller than that of itself.
Scientists believe that ozelots follow and find animals to eat (exchange) via smells, by sniffing out where they have been on the ground. 
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and they also move very quietly around. Ozelottes hunt their prey by going in one with their surroundings and then throwing themselves over their prey.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) is separated from the main population they came from (as if they move over a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island so they can't easily move back), they will often find themselves in a different environment than they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population has to have other features or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than it had previously been needed.
The indigenous population has not changed at all. It still needs the same adjustments as before.
Over time, while the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, they begin to resemble the rest of the population less and less.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process formificence, which simply means the formation of new species. Species are an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants make oxygen that humans inhale, and they absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhalate (i.e. exhale).
Plants make their food from the sun by photosynthesis. They also give shade.
We make our houses of plants and make clothes of plants. Most of the foods we eat are plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
Mosasaurus was the tip of the food chain in its time, so it feared nothing but other mossausures. 
Its long jaws had more than 70 razor-sharp teeth and an extra set at the top of the mouth, meaning there was no escape route for anything that crossed its path.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a split tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mossausures, and it may even have been a cannibal. 
It also attacked everything that got into the water. Even a giant dinosaur like a T. rex would nothing could run against it.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans ate some strange or unusual things, including wild boar, peacocks, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called a seven-sleeper.
Another difference was that while the poor and the women ate their food while sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to have large feasts together where they lay on the side while they were eating. 
Ancient Roman meals could not have contained foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had either corn, tomatoes, potatoes or cocoa, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built each of their gods a primary temple, which was considered home to the god. 
People brought sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and an inner sanctuary that only the priests had to enter. 
Sometimes pyramid-shaped towers, so-called ziggurats, were built as part of the temples. 
The top of the tower was a special shrine for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
The Hebrew family lived most of his life outdoors. 
Women made the food in the yard; the shops were just open discs that were facing the street. Stones were used to build houses.
There were no large forests in Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was settled with few people. In the Nordic sagas it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and as he travelled further west he found Greenland and called it Greenland. 
But regardless of his discovery, inuit tribes already lived in the area at the time. 
Although each country was "Scandinavisk", there were many differences between the people, kings, customs and history in Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the film National Treasure, you might think a treasure map is drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
That's not true, though. Even if something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.  
Written on the back of the American Declaration of Independence stood the words "Original Declaration of Independence, dated to July 4, 1776." The text appears at the bottom of the document when it is upside down.
Although no one knows with guaranteed who wrote it, it is known that early in its lifetime the large parchment document (it measures 293⁄4 inches x 241⁄2 inches) rolled up for storage.
So it is likely that the annotation was simply attached as an addition.
The D-Day landings and the following battles had liberated northern France, but the southern part was still not free. 
It was ruled by the French Vichy government - who are French who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with them instead of fighting them. 
On 15 August 1940, Allied troops invaded southern France; the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon."
In just two weeks, the Americans and free French forces had liberated southern France and were about to focus against Germany.
A civilization is a single culture divided by a larger, significant group of people living together and collaborating, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilization, meaning civil, and is related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city state; and it also somehow defines the size of society.
City-states are the precursors of nations. A culture of civilization involves the transmission of knowledge across generations, long-term cultural influence, as well as just communication. 
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving behind relevant historical evidence, and are not recognized as real civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government — with the Congress as the only component — under the Confederacy Articles.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and because there was no national executive or judicial authority, they depended on the state authorities, who were often uncooperative to enforce all actions.
It also had no right to override tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles demanded unanimous acceptance from all the states before they could be changed, and the states took so lightly at the central government that their representatives were often absent.
Together with Germany’s national football team, Italy’s national football team is the second most successful team in the world and became FIFA World Champion in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller skat hockey and F1 motorsport.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to, from a geographical point of view, as an "island group"
Taiwan's story begins all the way back in the 15. century, when European sailors on their way past the island named the Ilha Formosa or the beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan that started a change of the original grain production practices, and employed Chinese workers to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) troops take control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal areas and in 1885 declare Taiwan as a province of the Qing Empire. 
In 1895, after a defeat in the 1st Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Peace of Shimonoseki Treaty, with which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which governs over the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple with the three windows.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been re-established, and the excavations continue to this day.
For example, the most common photograph format in the world for stills is 35 mm, which was the most widely used film size at the end of the analogue film era. 
It is still produced today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been inherited by sensor formats in digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is actually, which can seem confusing, 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.  
The aspect ratio of this format is therefore 3:2 (divided by twelve to achieve the most simple integer ratio).
Many common formats (e.g. the APS formats) are equal to or close to this aspect ratio. 
The very abused and often ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline, which creates dynamism while keeping a certain order in an image. 
It says that the most effective place of the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period in the history of Europe, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and influential. 
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion bound European countries together despite different languages and customs. 
Its all-encompassing power affected everyone from king to ordinary citizens.
One of the most important Christian dogmas is that prosperity should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's financial means are used specifically for this purpose.  
The central authority of the Church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money prompted many to question whether this dogma was properly lived up to this dogma.
Shortly after the hostilities erupted, Britain launched a blockade at sea against Germany. 
The strategy proved effective and prevented important military and civilian supplies from reaching. This blockade was contrary to the recognized international laws coded in several international agreements in the last two centuries.
Britain laid mines in international waters to prevent ships from entering entire sections of the sea, which was a danger even to neutral ships.
As there was a limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a corresponding response to the country's unlimited submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the attitudes of most citizens and nations tended towards pacifism and isolation. 
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future. 
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work at the Edison Company in New York City. 
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents on him, a poetry collection and a written recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his boss from his former job) to Thomas Edison. 
In ancient China, different time periods were shown in a unique way; every Chinese period of time or each family in power was a distinct dynasty.
In addition, between each dynasty there was an unstable period of divided provinces. The most well-known of these periods was the epoch of three kingdoms, which lasted for 60 years between Han and the Jin Dynasty. 
During these periods there was fierce war between many noblemen who fought for the throne. 
The period of the Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient China's history. Thousands of people died in the battle to sit in the highest seat of the Grand Palace in Xi'an.
There are a lot of social and political effects, such as the use of the meter system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people, and not one ruler.
Also, after the revolution, the professions were open to all male applicants, which enabled the most ambitious and successful to perform well. 
The same goes for the military, because instead of class-based ranking in the army, the ranking was now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class people from other countries to start in their own internal revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in relationships beyond secular life. He used to visit a cave that became known as "Hira" on the mountain "Noor" (light) for immersing himself in his thoughts.
The cave itself, which has survived over time, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad’s spiritual inclinations. 
The cave is located at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca and completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it’s not easy to find at all, even if you know that it exists. When you're inside the cave, it's a total isolation.
Only the bright beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains can be seen. Very little of the outside world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders still standing today. 
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the third century BC and is one of many great pyramid structures that were built in honor of the dead pharaohs. 
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza necropolis" in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, contains several pyramids (of which the world-famous Great Pyramid is the largest of them all), several small tombs, more temples and the large Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created to honor the pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members. 
The "up-bow" mark looks like a V and "down-bow-mark" look like a staple, or a square that's missing its bottom side.
Up means you need to start at the tip and push the bow, and down means you need to start at the frog (there where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
Ascending usually produces a softer sound, while downstrews sound stronger and more powerful. 
You can always insert your own markings, but remember that the inscribed bow markings are determined for musical reasons, which is why they should usually be respected. 
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11 years old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles) and the king's sister, Mrs. Elizabeth, were forced back to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789 by a herd of market women.
They travelled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a screaming group of people shouting threats to the King and Queen. 
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep the windows in their carriage completely open. 
At one point, a member of the Mafia showed the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles for the frightened queen. 
The war spending of U.S. imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines was paid by the Philippine people themselves.
The Philippines had to pay tax to the U.S. colonial power to raise money for the bulk of spending, and the bond yields ran through the banks on Wall Street in the government's name.
Of course, the super profits from the long-lasting exploitation of the Philippine people would make up the fundamental gains of American imperialism.
In order to understand the Templars, one has to understand the context that underpinned the founding of the order.
The period of time in which these events took place is commonly known as the High Middle Ages, the part of Europe's history that took place in the 11th, 12th and 13th. century (1000–1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages preceded the early Middle Ages, which was followed by the late Middle Ages, which at convention ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice from technology as a driving force or technological necessity, to a narrow idea that the fate of man is driven by an underlying logic that is related to scientific laws, as well as the way they translate into technology. 
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a route largely outside of cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has an "influence" on societies that are hereditary and not socially conditioned.
For example, the motor-powered car may necessarily lead to the development of roads.   
But a nationwide road network is not financially viable for just a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car. 
When many own cars, more accidents also happen on the roads, leading to inventions of new techniques in the health field to heal body injuries.
The romance contained a great element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In connection with Romanticism, it was the geography that shaped the individual, and over time, customs and cultures emerged that were related to geography, and these were in harmony with the location of society and were therefore better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
In the same way that Paris today is known as the capital of fashion in the modern world, Constantinople was considered the capital of fashion in feudal Europe.
It is known for being an epicenter of luxury since about 400 AD and lasted until about 1,100 AD.
Its status fell in the 12th century, mainly because crusaders had returned with gifts such as silk and spices that had a greater value than what the Byzantine markets could offer.
It was at that time that the title of fashion capital passed from Constantinople to Paris. 
The Gothic style was most prevalent in the period between the 10th-11. century and the 14th century. 
At first, the clothes were largely inspired by the Byzantine culture in the East. 
However, as a result of the slow communication channels, the Western styles could lag behind by 25-30 years. 
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments of the time as a result of the Crusades was that people started using buttons to get dressed.
Subsistence farming is agriculture carried out in the production of sufficient food to simply meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence farming is a simple and often organic system that uses stored seeds native to the ecoregion, in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques, to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers have been engaged in subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring equal-minded individuals together, who feel overlooked by societal standards, and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be characteristic due to age, ethnic background, social class, location, and/or gender of members.
The qualities that regulate a subculture as being distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of several factors.
People who belong to a subculture often signal their affiliation through a clear and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, manners and slang.
One of the most common ways to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw on the few unhappy cases where children through failure, accident or wilful neglect have not been socialized by adults in their childhood. 
Such children are called "wild" or wild. Some feral children have been deprived by people (most often their own parents); in some cases, this child failure was caused by parental rejection of a child's serious intellectual or physical impairments.
Wild children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or ran away. 
Others are claimed to be brought up by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild on their own.
When raised by non-human animals, the feral child exhibits behavior (within physical boundaries) that is almost similar to the animal that has shown care for the child, such as its fear or lack of interest in humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further.
Scaffolding is a not a learning method, but a support for people who need to learn new things - for example, using a new computer program or rebooting a project. 
Scaffolding can be both virtual and genuine, in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is the little paper clip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is internalized in the software, and aims to question, ask for and explain procedures that may have been too challenging for the student to handle alone.
Children come in foster care for a wide variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment without nourishment, care and education, but they nevertheless do.
We see the system for foster families as a safety zone for these children.
Our foster family system must provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
A foster family is tasked with making all necessities available that did not exist in the home they were removed from. 
The Internet combines mass communication and interpersonal communication. 
The specific characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of use and satisfaction approach.
For example, it is proposed that "learning" and "socialisation" are important motives for Internet use (James et al., 1995). 
"Personal complicity" and "persistent relationship" were also identified as new motivators of Ehhmey and McCord (1998) as they examined the audience's reactions to websites.
The use of video footage has led to important discoveries in the understanding of micro expressions, which are facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can identify whether a person is lying by interpreting micro-expression correctly.
In his article The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks indicated how people who are unable to understand speech due to a brain injury are nevertheless able to assess sincerity with great accuracy.
He even believes that such abilities for the interpretation of human behavior can also be found in pets such as dogs.
Research from the twentieth century has shown that there are two different pools of genetic variation: the invisible and the visible. 
New genetic variation is added via mutation and it is removed from the pool of exact variations via selection."
Separation and recombination mix the variation back and forth between the two pools with each generation.
Out on the savannah, it's hard for a primate with a digestive system like humans to satisfy his need for amino acids from available plant sources.
In addition, there are serious consequences of non-compliance: decreased growth, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The most readily available plant resources would have been the proteins that exist in leaves and legumes, but for primates like us, these are hard to digest unless they are prepared.
Conversely, animal feed (animals, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest. It also provides large amounts of protein, which contains all the essential amino acids.
All in all, it should not surprise us if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in roughly the same way as chimpanzees on the savannah do it today.  
Sleep disturbance is the process of deliberately waking up during your normal sleep period and falling asleep shortly later (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you find that you turn off the clock while you sleep, you can place it at the other end of the room, forcing you to stand up to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) prior to sleep, forcing one to stand up and let the water.
The amount of inner calm that a person possesses corresponds entirely to the amount of tension a person possesses in body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force. All people have the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction. 
Everyone can learn to understand. The only thing that stands in the way of achieving this goal is our own tension and negativity.
The Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but was extended by the love path mahayana and with a lot of techniques from Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini-yoga, meditation and the path of all-encompassing love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy is awakened to life (enlightening energy) through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The Center for Tibetan Meditation is the Divinity Yoga ("Deity Yoga"). Through the visualization of various divinities, the energy channels are purified, the chakras are activated, and the enlightenment consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War 2, which led to a cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. When the war ended, the difference in the countries' system, process and culture led to the countries opposing each other.  
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies now became enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years and would be fought in earnest by deputy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defence had already been broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead. 
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when over 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union's Red Army took and set up the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading Poland's eastern regions in violation of the Riga peace treaty, the Polish-Soviet non-aggression pact, as well as other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral. 
The use of ships for freight transport is the most efficient way to transport large quantities of both people and goods across the oceans.
The task of the Navy has traditionally been to ensure that your country continues to have the opportunity to move your people and your goods, while also affecting your enemy's ability to move its people and its goods. 
One of the most notable recent examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. Americans tried to transport soldiers and materials across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German fleet, which mainly used submarines, tried to stop this traffic. 
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain just like the rest of Europe. 
As far as you know, goats were tamed for the first time about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.   
Ancient cultures and tribes began to hold them so they could have easy access to milk, fur, meat and skins.
Housewives were generally kept in flocks that wandered on hills or other pastures, often supervised by goat herds who were often children or teenagers, corresponded to the more widely known shepherds. These shepherds are still being used today. 
As early as the 16. Centurry was built wagon roads in England.
Although the lanes consisted of parallel wooden planks, they meant that horses could pull heavier loads faster than on the slightly more uneven roads of the time.
Swallows were invented quite early to keep the tracks in place. Gradually, however, it was realized that tracks would be more effective if they had an iron piece on top. 
This became common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wood wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first rails were used, made entirely of metal.
The first known method of transport was to go, people began to walk upright two million years ago with the advent of Homo Erectus (meaning upright man). 
Their predecessors Australopithecus did not usually go upright.
There are two-legged specializations in Australopithecus fossils that are 4.2-3.9 million years old, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs seven million years ago.  
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can become part of the environmental movement, and we may even be activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
In many cases, this is like the treatment of symptoms. But if we don't just want a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problems and disable them. 
It is obvious that the world has changed greatly because of the scientific and technological advances of mankind, and problems have increased due to overpopulation and the extravagant way of life of man.
After the Congress passed it on July 4, a handwritten draft was signed by chairman of Congress John Hancock, and Secretary Charles Thomsen was then sent to John Dunlap's printing company a few blocks away.  
Through the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now known as "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was conducted by John Nixon on July 8 in Independence Hall's farm.
One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6, and on July 9 he read it to his soldiers in New York. On August 10, a copy arrived at London.
The 25 Dunlap sheets that still exist are the oldest surviving version of the document. The original handwritten version is no longer available. 
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive. We call them birds.
Most people don't see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly. 
There are many things about birds reminiscent of dinosaurs. 
They have feet with dandruff and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their hind legs like a T-Rex. 
Almost all computers that are used today are based on the manipulation of information, which is coded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, for example. 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits - or bits, for now to use computer language.
Internal poisoning may not be visible immediately. Symptoms such as vomiting are far too general for a diagnosis to be made immediately.
The best indication of internal poisoning, may be the presence of an open medicine container or toxic household chemicals.
See the label for specific instructions on first aid for the specific venom. 
The term bug is used by entomologists as a formal description of this group of insects.
This term stems from ancient knowledge of bedbugs, which are insects that largely live as parasites on humans. 
Both prey and bed liars are nidicoless, meaning they are adapted to stay in their host's house or nest.
Across the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the largest neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system consisting of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice at higher risk of getting MS than men.
A couple may decide that it is not best for them or their child that they have a baby.
It is possible for these couples to make an adoption plan for their baby. 
Upon adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can take them over.  
The main objective of science is to find out how the world works through the scientific method. This method is actually used in most scientific studies. 
However, it does not stand alone, experimentation, and an experiment is a test used to remove one or more possible hypotheses. Asking questions and making observations also leads to scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle’s views on all scientific affairs, including psychology, were accepted.
As the knowledge of Greek disappeared, the West felt cut off from its Greek roots in philosophy and science. 
Many of the observations made in physiology and behaviour often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and the natural biological production. 
Periodic rhythms, which are not reactions to external periodic signals, have been documented for most living beings such as bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-propelled oscillators who will continue a period of free-running cycles, even without external signals. 
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading suggestions that DNA was a genetic material. 
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages or viruses to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
They did two experiments where they marked either the DNA in the subject with radioactive phosphorus or the protein in the subject of radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of effects depending on the mutation type, the importance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of enjoying the landscape as well as plant and wildlife.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird observation and visits to parks, as well as studies of information about the ecosystem.
An example is to visit, photograph and learn about orangutans in Borneo.
Where morning people leave small villages by car to go to their workplace, and passed by others whose places of work are the place that they have just left.
On this dynamic transport ferry, everyone is connected to, and supports, a transport system, which is based on private cars.
The decarbonized economy has loosened the biosphere from the stable phase that has supported human development for a few million years, science now believes. 
Everyone is part of society and uses the transport systems. Almost all complaints about the transport systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear as many complaints about water quality or bridges that collapse.
Why do transport systems give rise to such complaints, why are they failing on a daily basis? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is an examination of the movements of the individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interaction with each other.
Unfortunately, it's hard to study traffic flows because drivers' behaviors can't be predicted with a hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers typically behave reasonably consistently; thus, traffic is also typically reasonably consistent and can be calculated mathematically. 
In order to better represent the traffic flow, relationships between the three main characteristics are established: (1) current, (2) density and (3) speed.
These conditions help plan, design and operate road construction. 
Insects were the first animals to fly to the air. Their ability to fly helped them to more easily dodge enemies and find food and partners more effectively.
Most insects can fold their wings along the body.
This gives them a larger selection of small places where they can hide from predators.
Today, the dragonfly and round-the-clock fly are the only insects that cannot fold the wings back.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system moved around the Sun.
There were divided opinions about his theory - some thought he was right, while many meant the opposite: that the solar system, including the sun (and even the other stars), turned around the earth.  
It seems reasonable, because we can't feel the world turning around, right? 
The Amazon River is the largest and second-longest river on Earth. It contains over 8 times as much water as the Earth's second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the world's widest river, and is in some places up to six miles (approx. 9.6 km) wide.
The entire 20 percent of the water that flows through the planet's rivers and into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River collects water from thousands of smaller rivers, but the main river itself is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. 
Although the pyramid building with stone continued until the end of the ancient kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in the size and technical expertise of their constructions. 
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were astonished at the monuments of their ancestors, which at the time were well and truly a thousand years old.
The Vatican City's population is about 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world, and the country with the lowest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications. 
Italian is also the everyday language spoken by most of those who work in the state, while Latin is often used for religious ceremonies.
All residents of Vatican City are Roman Catholic. 
People have known the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper since ancient times, because they are found in nature in their natural form and are relatively easy to dig according to if you have the right tools.
The philosopher Aristotle had the theory that everything consists of a mixture of one or more of four elements. Namely, soil, water, air and fire. 
This was more like the four state forms of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, though he had also had a theory that they are changing into new drugs, to form what we see.
Alloys are basic mixtures of two or more metals. Do not forget that there are many drugs in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
You may also have alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter consists of tiny particles called atoms. 
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit into the sentence that ends this sentence. 
Therefore, the pencil was a good friend for most people when it came out.
Unfortunately, the pencil has lost status and is being used less since new writing methods have appeared.
People are now writing messages through computer screens and never have to get near a pencil sharpener.
You can only guess what will become of the keyboard when something new comes to.  
The fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to put together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons. 
Kind of like pushing a heavy cart up a hill. When the core splits again, some of the energy is released.  
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning they tend to collapse under little or no impact.
The surface of the moon is made of rock and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick at the front and 100 km thick at the back.
It is thinner during the maria and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more moon gardens on the front, as the crust here is thinner. It was easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are centered on figuring out what causes people to react or what appeals to them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they become more mature and reach adulthood.
The theories examine what it is with certain people that causes them to take certain actions and what elements in their environment that cause them to perform or fail to perform certain actions.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's theory of the pyramid of needs, and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two behaviors can occur when a manager begins to lead his former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is to try to remain “one of the guys” (or the girls).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary actions, performance evaluations, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable. 
At the opposite end of the spectrum, one is transformed into an unrecognisable individual who feels that he or she must change all that the team has accomplished and make it his own. 
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team's successes and failures.   
This behavior often results in problems between the leaders and the rest of the team.
There are the same expectations for expertise for virtual teams as conventional teams, but there are small differences.
Virtual team members often act as point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have greater autonomy than conventional team members, as their team can meet in different time zones, which their local management may not understand.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique part of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team that each of the members reports to. The invisible team sets the standards for each member. 
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? One of the goals of translating organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
Creativity and ingenuity begin to show when all available resources are used effectively across an organization’s functional departments.
As a result, the process in an organization that works together to cope with an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that meets the customer’s needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, leaders must create a culture that promotes innovation as well as knowledge sharing and organizational learning. 
Angel (2006) explains the continum approach as a method that can help organizations reach a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. Therefore, it narrows the research area and makes it much more accurate. 
The link between the pathology of the brain and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain injuries, trauma, lesions and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and examine brain structures and processes that we have never seen before. 
This gives us plenty of information and materials to build simulation models that can help us understand our mental processes. 
Although artificial intelligence is often associated with science fiction, it forms a very important branch of computer science that deals with behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in a machine. 
Research in AI includes being able to manufacture machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and schedules, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwritten recognition, voice and facial recognition.
Such things have become separate disciplines, with a focus on providing solutions to real life problems.
The AI system is now often used in the economic, medical, engineering and military business areas, as it has been built into several home computers and software applications for computer games.
Excursions are a big part of any class. Quite often, a teacher would love to take his students to places to which it is not possible to travel by bus.
The technology offers solutions with virtual excursions. Students can look at museum artes, visit aquariums or admire beautiful artworks while sitting in the classroom. 
Sharing an excursion virtually is also a good method to evaluate an excursion and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students from Bennet School in North Carolina each year design a website about their journey to the state capital, and every year the website is being remodeled, but old versions still exist online as a kind of scrapbook.
Blogging can also help improve student writing skills. Although students often begin their blog experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally corrects this.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog's author begins to endeavor to improve in writing to avoid criticism. 
In addition, blogging forces students to learn more about the world around them." The demand to give the audience what they want inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004). 
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to expand their learning far beyond the traditional school day. 
Appropriate use of blogs "can help students become more analytical and critical; by providing active response to internet materials, students can define their roles in relation to what others have written and describe their own perspectives on certain topics (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada’s charming, bilingual capital and has a number of art galleries and museums that exhibit Canada’s past and present.
Further south is Niagara Falls, and the northern part is home to Muskoka and the untapped natural beauty of other areas.
All these things as well as several highlight Ontario as what is considered true Canadian by outsiders. 
Further north, there are large areas, which are quite sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that surprises many: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is clearly the largest and is a continent of its own when it comes to wild animals.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or are connected to France and known for their luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the country, and the religion quickly became widespread on the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism started in the 15. century with Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama's discovery of the Cape route between Europe and India.
In the north, the region borders the Sahel, and in the south and west to the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: it is recommended that all female travelers say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It makes sense to wear what might look like a wedding ring (it just shouldn't look too expensive. 
Women should realise that cultural differences can result in what they would regard as harassment, and it is not uncommon to be persecuted, gripped by the arm, etc.
Be determined when rejecting men, and don't be afraid to say no (cultural differences or not, it's not OK!). 
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th. century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenides as a strategic harbor called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to leave it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, and it was named Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trade bases there. 
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan goods such as tagins, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes and a wide range of trinkets, but it is very touristy. 
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of Congo and is located right eastwards near Rwanda. 
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets in particular in the city centre. 
Despite the fact that Goma is reasonably safe, all visits outside Goma should be investigated, to understand the battles taking place in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for ascending the Nyiragongo volcano as well as one of the cheapest places to track mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is ~500 Congolese franc for the short trip.
Along with the city's relative inaccessibility, it has made "Timbuktu" a metaphor for exotic, distant regions. 
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, though its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered World Heritage Sites due to the threat posed by the desert sand. 
It was one of the bigger stops under Henry Louis Gates' special Wonders of the African World for PBS. 
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country's cities because it has a more Arab flair than an African. 
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east and Zimbabwe to the north, while the southern border is the Crocodile River. 
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which supports different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions in South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in all South African national parks, there are daily conservation and access fees to the park.  
It may also be advantageous to buy a Wild Card, as this either gives access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all of the South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the territory Hong Kong its name, and is the place that many tourists consider the primary focus area.
Hong Kong skyline is a group of buildings that, by their mirroring in the water in Victoria Harbour, are often compared to a glittering bar chart, 
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the Kowloon port front on the opposite side.
The majority of Hong Kong's urban development is packed together on land receded along the northern coast. 
This is the place that the British colonizers made their own, so if you look for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world stretching 80 km from the coast and into Bangladesh and India’s hinterland.
Sundarbans has been added to the UNESCO World Heritage List. The part of the forest that is within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
Forests, however, are not just mangrove swamps — they include some of the last remaining stands of the mighty forests that once covered the multi-scale plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which about a third is covered by water/mose areas.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal king tigers and about 30,000 chital deer in the area. 
There are buses from the interregional bus station (on the other side of the river) all day although most, especially those that go east and to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since the buses in the district are often full, it's a good idea to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small, Japanese buses, which are both comfortable and robust.
Deletaxas are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Now) and Punakha (200 Now).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable bridge. It stretches across the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters high, the bridge is 378 meters long and has two lanes that are 3.50 m wide.
The vertical ground clearance below the bridge is 15 metres. Construction was completed in August 2011. It did not open for traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaranís were the most significant group of natives who lived in the area which is now eastern Paraguay, and they lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also cultivated farming to survive.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurús and the Payaguás, which survived by hunting, collecting and fishing.
Paraguay, which was formerly called "India's Great Province," came into the world in the 16th. century as a result of the meeting of Spanish conquerors and the indigenous populations.
The Spanish started the colonization period, which lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve a lot of its original character and identity.
Argentina are known for having one of the world's best polo teams as well as some of the world's best players.
The biggest tournament of the year will take place in December at the Pole courts of Las Cañitas. 
Also, smaller tournaments and matches can be seen here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where to buy tickets, you can enquiry at the Asociacion Argentina de Polo. 
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is Falklandspod (FKP), the value of which is set at the value of a British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged in the only bank on the islands located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
Overall, British pounds are being taken everywhere on the islands, and within Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On the outlying islands, credit cards are unlikely to be applicable, although UK and US currencies may be able to be used; ask the owners in advance to know which payment method is accepted.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falkland's currency outside the islands, so be sure to exchange your money before you leave the islands.
As Montevideo lies south of the equator, it's summer there when it's winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa. 
Montevideo is in the subtropics; in the summer months it is normal to have temperatures above 30°C.
Winter can be misleadingly cool: temperatures rarely reach below freezing, but the wind and humidity together make it feel colder than what's on the thermometer.
There are no particularly "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rain remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed. 
According to park authorities, you must stay at least 100 yards/meter away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters from all other wild animals!
No matter how docile they look, bison, moose, bears, and virtually all large animals can well attack.
Every year, a lot of visitors get hurt because they don't keep proper distance. These animals are large, wild and can be dangerous, so give them space.
In addition, you should be aware that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid bringing or cooking food that smells, and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The town is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been Samoa's official capital since 1959.
The port formed the setting for a notorious naval confrontation in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the US and the UK refused to leave the port. 
All the ships were sunk apart from a British cruise ship. Nearly 200 American and German lives were lost. 
During the battle for independence, which was organized by the Mau movement, there was a peaceful gathering in the city that resulted in the killing of chief commander Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches because Auckland is close to two ports. The most popular are in three areas.
North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) are located in the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches with safe swimming, and most get natural shade from pohutukawa trees.
The Tamaki Drive beaches are found at Waitemata harbour in the exclusive suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.  
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good selection of shops along the sea. It's safe to swim here. 
The most widely used local beer is "Number One," which is not a complicated beer but is pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta."
There are many French wines to drink, but the New Zealand and Australian wines may be better to transport.
It's definitely drinking the local water from the tap, but it's easy to find bottled water if you're worried.
For Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is alien. A “short black” is called “espresso”, cappuccino has plenty of cream on top (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate lives up to the Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but in turn excellent.
Many visit the reef all year round, and people rarely get hurt on the reef for these reasons.
Always listen to the advice of the authorities, read and observe advice on signs, and give a lot of attention to security alerts.
Sea wasps occur near beaches and near estuaries from October to April north of 1770. They can occasionally also be found outside these times.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live their active lives in the ocean, their primary habitat is in estuaries north of Rockhampton. 
Advance booking gives the traveler peace of mind that they have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have offers on certain hotels, although it may be possible for you to book other forms of accommodation through a travel agent, such as campsites.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transport arrangements to/from the airport, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also keep the booking for you if you need time to consider the offer or provide other documents for your destination (e.g. a visa).
However, changes or requests should be directed to the tour operator first and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the majority of participants choose to camp on site, and many participants consider it a crucial part of the experience. 
If you want to be where it's going, you'll need to get an early spot close to the music. 
Remember that even though the music on the big stages is over, there may still be parts of the festival that play music until late into the evening. 
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
Check where your cabin is if you cross the Baltic Sea in winter, as sailing through ice can make a lot of noise for those closest to those.
Passengers on cruise ships are exempt from visa requirements (see terms), which is nice to know, as cruises to Saint Petersburg give passengers time to see the city.
Casinos do everything they can to make guests spend as much time and as much money as possible. Windows and clocks are usually not present, and it can be difficult to find an exit.
They usually have special offers on food, drink and entertainment to keep guests in a good mood and keep them in the house.
In some places, alcoholic drinks are offered at the house's expense. But drunkenness weakens judgment, and all real gamblers know how important it is to be sober. 
Anyone who has to drive at high latitudes or above mountain passes should take into account the possibility of snow, ice and minus degrees.
On ice- and snow-smooth roads there is low friction and you can't drive as you would normally do, on dry asphalt.
During a blizzard, in a very short time enough snow may fall to make you get stuck. 
Visibility can also be limited by snow falling or blowing, or by condensation or ice on the vehicle's glazing.
On the other hand, ice- and snow-smooth conditions are common in many countries, and traffic mostly glides undisturbed all year round.
Safaris are the highlight for many and are perhaps what draws the vast majority of tourists to Africa.
The term safari is often used to refer to land travel to see the splendid African wildlife, especially on the savannah.
Some animals such as elephants and giraffe tend to approach the cars, and standard equipment is therefore enough to see the animals.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy, and you can better see them with a binoculars.
A hiking safari (also called a "bush walk," "go-safari" or "safari on foot") consists of hiking that either takes a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will be held elsewhere in Japan. 
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted the two Summer Olympics as it also hosted the Games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and your accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may have trouble.
Cancellation policies vary, but from the end of March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies don't extend to July 2020 when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most tickets for the event will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with typical tickets cost around ¥7,000.
Ironing of damp clothing can help to dry it. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board that you can borrow, even if there is not one in the room.
If you do not have the option to use an iron, or if you do not like to wear socks that are ironed, you can try using a hair dryer if one is available.
Be careful not to let the substance get too hot (which can cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, burn marks). 
There are different ways to clean water, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas it is enough to boil water for a minute, in others more minutes are needed.
Filters vary in efficiency, and if you're worried you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company. 
Travellers may encounter pests that they don't know from home.
Pests can destroy food, cause irritations, or in worse cases cause allergic reactions, spread poison or transmit diseases.
Infectious diseases per se, or dangerous animals that can hurt or kill humans, are usually not perceived as pests.
Duty-free shopping is the option of buying goods in certain places that are exempt from taxes and duties. 
Travelers who are on their way to countries with a high tax rate can sometimes save significant amounts, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont offers the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, often passing through isolated terrain in the hinterland.
Be vaks if you are not used to driving on the road: steep hills, narrow lanes and sharp turns there are plenty of. 
The set speed limits are remarkably lower than on lines before and after — typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h.) — and it is even more important than usual to comply with them accurately.
Oddly enough, the coverage on mobile phones is much stronger here than along many other stretches of the route such as Pennsylvania Wilds.
German cakes are pretty good, and in Bavaria they are very tasteful and varied just like in Germany's southern neighbor, Austria. 
Baking goods with fruit are common: apples are baked into cakes year-round, and cherries and plums make their appearance during the summer.
Much German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. Popular cakes and a strong cup of coffee often go hand in hand
If you fancy some small but full-bodied, cakes, you can try what, depending on region, is called Berliner, Pfankuchen or the Strap.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices along with either meat or vegetables.
A curry is either "dry" or "wet" depending on how much liquid is in it.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries. In southern India and some other coastal regions on the subcontinent, it is common to use coconut milk.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an overall term that covers a large variety of regional food cultures found throughout the country.
But if the term is used without further elaboration, it typically refers to the food originally derived from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java. 
Now the Javanese cuisine is widely available throughout the archipelago; it consists of a series of single spicy dishes, where the most popular spices are peanuts, chilli, sugar (especially Javan coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are supporters of the rider's feet, which hangs down on each side of the saddle. 
They provide greater stability for the rider, but can cause safety issues due to the possibility of a rider's feet getting stuck in them.
If a rider falls off the horse but has a foot trapped in the stirrup, he or she can be dragged along if the horse runs away. To minimise this risk, some safety measures can be taken.
First, many riders use riding boots with a heel and a soft, narrow sole.
Next, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety hangers, which make the stirrup straps loosen from the saddle if they are pulled backwards by a falling rider.
The Cochamó Valley - Chile's largest climbing destination, known as South America's Yosemite, has a number of large granite walls and rocks. 
Mountain peaks present breathtaking views from the tops for all visitors. Mountain climbers from around the world are continuously establishing new routes among its infinite potentials for new climbing walls.
Alpin winter sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports activities that involve driving down snowy terrains with skis or a snowboard clamped on your feet.
Skiing is a great travel activity with many enthusiasts - sometimes known as "ship spaces" that plan the entire holiday around it to ski in a particular area.
People have been skiing for thousands of years - cave paintings dating back to the year 5,000 BC show people skiing!
Alpin skiing as a sport dates back to 17. century, and in 1861, the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking on skis: This activity is also called backcountry skiing, skiing or ski walking.
It is related to, but usually does not involve skiing in Alpine style or mountaineering. The latter is carried out in steep terrain and requires much stiffer skis and boots.
You should see the ski route as if it were a similar walking route.
In good conditions, you will be able to cover some greater distances than if you walk – but it is only very rare that you get the same speed as on cross-country skies without a heavy backpack and on ready-made tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, a journey through several countries would mean having to review visa applications and passport checks multiple times.
In this context, however, the Schengen area operates roughly as one country.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can usually cross borders without having to go through passport control again. 
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a separate visa for each Schengen country, saving time, money and paperwork.  
There is no universal definition for which manufactured goods are considered antiques. Some tax authorities define goods older than 100 years as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit may be smaller in, for example, North America than in Europe.
Handmade products can be categorized as antiques, even if they are younger than similar mass-produced goods. 
Reindeer farming is an important livelihood for the Sami, and the culture around it is also important for many Sami with other professions.  
Even traditionally, however, not all Sami kept reindeer on a large scale, but they lived on fishing, hunting and the like and used mainly the reindeer as draught animals.
Today, many Sami people work in modern subjects. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the area of the Sami.
Although the word "gypsy" is often used especially among non-Romans, it is often considered offensive because of the word's attachment to negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Roma population.
If travel instructions occur in the country you are visiting, your travel insurance or cancellation insurance may be affected.
It may also be that you want to get advice from governments other than your own, but their advice will be crafted for their own citizens.
One example is that U.S. citizens of the Middle East may face a situation other than Europeans or Arabs.
The advice is only a brief overview of the political state of a country.
The views expressed are often with a short-term look at the case, general and simplified in relation to the more detailed information that can be found elsewhere.
Extreme weather conditions are the general term for all dangerous weather phenomena, which can cause damage or serious social disturbances or cost lives. 
Extreme weather conditions can occur throughout the world, and there are different types that may depend on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Strong wind, hail, extreme rainfall and forest fires are forms of, and effects of, severe weather like thunderstorms, tornadoes, cloud pumps and cyclones. 
Regional and seasonal weather phenomena include blizzards, sealing, ice-strewn and dust storms. 
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of any risk of severe weather conditions that may affect their area as it could affect any travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that can be considered a war zone should undergo professional training. 
A search on the Internet for "Course in Enemy Environment" is likely to provide the address of a local business. 
A course will usually cover all the topics discussed here with far more details, usually with practical experience.
A course will usually last from 2-5 days and will involve role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes there will be weapons training.
Books and magazines that are about survival in the wilderness are common, but there aren't many releases dealing with war zones.
Travelers planning gender reassignment surgeries abroad must be sure to bring valid documents for the return journey.
Governments' willingness to cooperate varies when it comes to issuing pas with unspecs red-eyed (X), or documents that are up-to-date to give a person a desired name and gender.
The willingness of foreign governments to respect these documents varies as much.
Visitings in security checks have also become more intrusive in the period since 11 September 2001.
Transgender passengers who have not received operations should not expect to get through the scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
The flow of waves that return and break on the beach, often at a reef or equivalent, is called a countercurrent.
Due to the topology underwater, the return run is concentrated in a few deeper sections, and a fast current can be formed for deep water. 
Most deaths happen as a result of fatigue by trying to swim back towards the current, which may be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the stream, it's no harder than usual to swim back.
Try to aim somewhere where you don't get caught again, or, depending on your skills and whether you've been discovered, you might be able to wait for you to be rescued.
Homecoming shock comes faster than culture shock (which is not to the same extent a period of excitement over the new), lasts longer and can be more serious.  
Travelers who had an easy time adapting to the new culture sometimes find it very difficult to adapt to their own culture.
When you get back home, after living abroad, you've adapted to the new culture and lost some of your habits from your home culture.
When you traveled abroad for the first time, people were probably patient and understanding, as they knew that a traveler in a whole new country needs to adapt.
People don't necessarily expect it to be necessary to show patience and understanding when you as a traveler return home.
The Pyramid's sound and light show is one of the most interesting activities in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show begins.
Usually you always hear the sound of tourists and sellers. The story of the sound and light is like a storybook.
The sphinx is set as a backdrop and tells of a long story.
The scenes are shown on the pyramids, and the different pyramids light up.
The South Shetland Islands, which were discovered in 1819, claiming many nations, have the most bases, of which sixteen are active in 2020. 
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas. 
Others include Livingston Island and Deception, where an active volcano's flooded caldera provides a spectacular natural harbour area. 
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the peninsula bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here, the peninsula's mountains meet on the plateau and form the Ellsworth Mountains' 360 km long chain, which is divided into two of the Minnesota glacier. 
The northern part of the Sentinel Range possesses Antarctica's tallest mountains, Vinson Massif (also called Mount Vinson), which peaks at 4,892 m.
In remote areas without mobile coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone, as you need to be outside and have a free view of the satellite to make a phone call. 
This service is often used by shipping, including pleasure craft, as well as expeditions, that need remote data and speech.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide you with more information on connection to this service.
One option that is becoming more and more popular for those who are planning a gap year is to travel and learn. 
This is especially popular among those leaving school as it allows them to take a year out before university without compromising their education.
In many cases, a course abroad in your gap year can actually improve your chances of gaining a place in a higher education in your home country.
There will typically be a tuition fee, to enroll in these training programs.
Finland is a great destination for sailors. "The land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands in the lakes as well as in the archipelagos along the coast.    
In the archipelagos and lakes, you don't necessarily need a yacht.
Although the coastal archipelago and the largest lakes are large enough for any yacht, you get a different experience in a smaller boat or even a kayak. 
Sailing is a national hobby in Finland, where there is one boat for every seven or eight people. 
This is somewhat similar to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise it is quite unique (e.g. in the Netherlands, the figure is one for forty).
On most Baltic cruises, an extended stay is offered in St. Petersburg in Russia.
This means you can visit the historic city for a few full days where you go back and sleep on the ship at night.
If you only go on land with the ship's excursions, you don't need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some cruises have Berlin, Germany in the brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not at all close to the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Travel by plane for people of all ages and of any background can be a frightening experience, especially if they haven’t flown before or if they’ve experienced a traumatizing event.
It's nothing to be ashamed of: it's no different from the fear and the hatred against other things that many people suffer from.  
For some, understanding how a plane works and what happens at flight can be an aid to overcome a fear that is based on the unknown or not to have control. 
Delivery companies take good pay to deliver quickly. Often, time is very important when it comes to business documents, goods or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes, the larger companies have their own planes, but on other routes and in smaller companies there was a problem.
If they sent things via air freight, on some routes it may have taken days to get through reading and customs clearance. 
The only way to get it through faster was by sending it as checked baggage. The air carriers' rules do not allow them to send luggage without a passenger. That's where you get into the picture.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to put a big pile of money forward to get the opportunity (or even better, get your business to do it for you).
However, this is not cheap: as a rough rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the economy class normal price for business-class and eleven times the price for first class! 
Generally speaking, there is no need to look at all for discounts on seats in business or first class on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know well that certain core groups of passengers are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting out quickly and comfortably, and they set their prices accordingly. 
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also spoken to a wide extent.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered during ethnic conflicts. 
In 1994, this conflict led to the establishment of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but which is not recognized by any member state of the United Nations.
Economic relations have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova despite the breakdown in political negotiations.
The largest religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is Turkey's third-largest city with a population of approximately 3.7 million, the country's second largest port after Istanbul, and a very large transport hub.
What was once the old town of Smyrna is now a modern, developed and busy trading town located around a large bay and surrounded by mountains.  
The wide boulevards, the glass facade buildings and the modern shopping centres are surrounded by traditional red tiled roofs, the old market from the 18. centuries and ancient mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere that is more Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík overlooks the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery there are interesting marble sculptures of pigeons over some tombstones.
It's worth spending half an hour walking around the exciting village.
To the north and within easy reach lies the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, which was made famous among foreigners after a lauding account of its splendidity of Lord Byron.
Scotturb Bus 403 regularly drives to Sintra and stops at Cabo da Roca.
On the north you can also visit the great shrine of Our Lady of Fatima (altern) which is the place of world-famous Marian spirits.  
Remember that you are actually visiting a mass grave site. A place that is of a crucial importance to a large part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive who survived their time here, and many more who had loved ones who were murdered or worked to death there, both Jews and non-Jews.
Please treat the place with all the dignity, solemnity and respect that it deserves. Don't tell jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis. 
Do not shame the place with markings or by intruding graphiteti on the structures. 
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half prefer to speak Catalan, the vast majority understand it, and almost anyone can speak Spanish.  
However, most signs are only indicated in Catalan because by law it has been established as the official language.
Still, Spanish is also used extensively, in public transport and other facilities.
General announcements in the subway are only given in Catalan but unforeseen changes are announced via an automatic system in several languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.  
Parisians possess a reputation of being self-absorbed, rude and arrogant.
Although this is often only an imprecise stereotype, the best way to agree with people in Paris is still to behave as nicely as possible, you should act like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-behaved). It will make it considerably easier to get around.
The cool outer outer of the Paris quickly evaporates if you show basic courtesy.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is filled with woodlands - mainly with beech and conifers - and offers a mixture of both alpine plants and Mediterranean plants.
It has a remarkably wide variety of plant communities due to its many microclimates, different soil types and varying altitude levels.
The area is also home to an extremely large variety of animals and bird species.  
Together with many more common species of rare fauna such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat and tjur, you will find.  
During visits to the monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover the knees, while also having their shoulders covered.
Most of the monasteries have scarves for women who appear unprepared, but if you bring your own and especially some with strong colors, you get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear trousers that cover the knees.  
This can be borrowed from the warehouse at the entrance, but the clothes are not washed after each use, so maybe you are not completely comfortable wearing these skirts. One size fits all men!
The Mallorcan cuisine, like other similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and the use of a great deal of olive oil. 
A simple, popular dinner, especially in summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomato and any kind of available accessories such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, including the word Sie for you, always begin with big, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and lenses
It undoubtedly also makes reading easier, even if writing is complicated some of the need to find out whether a verb or adjective is used in a noun.
The pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to keep an eye on are c and g, as their pronunciation varies depending on the imitate vocals. 
Also, be sure to pronounce r and rr differently: caro means dear, while carro means cart. 
Persian has a relatively easy and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammatical basic book will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand sentences.
Just so you know, if you can a Romanesque language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, people who can do a little Spanish can quickly conclude that Portuguese is reminiscent of it enough that one does not need to study it separately.
Premature observatories are usually obsolete today and remain as museums or educational sites.
Since light pollution in their heyday was not such a problem as it is today, they are usually found in cities or on campuses where they are easier to reach than those built in modern times. 
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities in remote areas with good atmospheric conditions.
Looking at flowering cherry trees, known as Hanami, has been a tradition in Japanese culture since the 8. century. 
The concept came from China, where flowers from plum trees were the chosen flower. 
In Japan, the first cherry blossomfests were held by the emperor for only himself and other members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.
Plants look best when they are in a natural environment, therefore you need to resist the temptation to "just take one sample."
If you visit a publicly accessible garden, you will be evicted without discussion if you collect "samples."
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to visit and very easy to navigate around, and you can buy almost anything after you have arrived.
But when you find yourself in the "high tropes," only a few degrees north of the equator, you need to handle both heat (all the time) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, which is more rare). 
There are also a few buses that drive north to Hebron, the traditional burial site of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives.
Be sure to check if the bus you are considering taking is driving into Hebron, and not just for the nearby Jewish settlement Kiryat Arba.
The inland waterways can be a good theme to base a holiday around.
For example, visiting castles in the Loire Valley or Rhine Valley, going on a cruise to interesting cities on the Danube or sailing along the Erie Canal. 
They also define routes for popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of Christianity’s most important holidays and is celebrated as Jesus’ birthday.  
Non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians from all over the world have embraced many traditions of the holidays.
There is a tradition of staying awake at Easter night to see the sunrise in an exposed place.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may well be a spring and fertility ritual from before Christianity. 
The more traditional churches often hold Eastervigilie on Saturday night on the Easter weekend, where congregations often erupt into feasting at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All animals that originally arrived in the islands came here either by swimming, flying or floating. 
Due to the long distance from the continent, mammals could not cope with the journey, making the giant turtle the primary grass-eating animal on the Galapagos.
Since the first humans came to the Galapagos, many mammals have been imported such as goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.  
If you visit Arctic or Antarctic areas in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means the sun will not come up over the horizon.
This provides a great opportunity to see polar lights, as the sky will be dark more or less around the clock.
Since there are not many people living in the areas, and light pollution is therefore often no problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars. 
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formula than what Westerners are used to.
Suits are standard business clothing, and colleagues appeal to each other by their last name or job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is important, thus emphasizing the group effort rather than the praise of individual performance.
The workers often need to have their superiors to approve all decisions they make, and they are expected to obey the instructions of their superiors without asking questions.
