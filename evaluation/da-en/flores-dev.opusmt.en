Former President of the House of Representatives, Newt Gingrich, came second with 32 percent.
As the winner takes the whole state gave Florida all his fifty delegates to Romney and made him the leading candidate of the Republican party.
Organisers of the protest told that about 100,000 people appeared in German cities such as Berlin, Cologne, Hamburg and Hanover.
In Berlin, the police estimated 6,500 demonstrators.
Demonstrations also took place in Paris, Sofia in Bulgaria, Vilnius in Lithuania, Valetta in Malta, Tallinn in Estonia, Edinburgh and Glasgow in Scotland.
In London, some 200 people protested outside the offices of some major copyright owners.
Last month there were major protests in Poland when the country signed ACTA, which has meant that the Polish Government has decided not to approve the agreement, for now.
Both Latvia and Slovakia have postponed the process of joining ACTA.
Animal Liberation and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) again call for the installation of surveillance cameras in all Australian slaughterhouses to be mandatory.
New South Wales' RSPCA chief inspector David O'Shannessy told ABC that monitoring and inspection of slaughterhouses should be common in Australia.
"The monitoring will certainly send a strong signal to the people who work with animals that their welfare is of the highest priority."
The international earthquake map from the United States Geological Survey showed that there were no earthquakes in Iceland the week before.
No earthquake activity has been reported in the Hekla area in the last 48 hours, reports the Iceland Meteorological Institute.
The huge earthquakes of March 10, on the northeast side of the volcano's caldera, caused major phase changes.
Dark clouds that had nothing to do with volcanic activity were reported at the foot of the mountain.
The clouds showed the potential for confusion as to whether an outbreak had actually occurred.
Luno had 120°160 cubic metres of fuel on board when it broke, and high winds and waves pushed it into the wavebreakers.
The helicopters saved the 12 crew members, and the only damage was a broken nose.
The 100-metre-long ship was on its way to retrieve its usual cargo of manure, and initially investigators feared that the vessel would lose a cargo.
The proposed amendment was adopted in both houses as early as 2011.
A change was made at this parliamentary meeting when the second sentence was first deleted by the House of Representatives and then approved in a corresponding version of the Senate on Monday.
If the second sentence which proposes banning registered partnerships for persons of the same sex fails, it may open the door to registered partnerships in the future.
Following the process, HJR-3 is again reviewed by the next elected legislature in either 2015 or 2016 to remain in the process.
Vautier's achievements, in addition to being a film director, include a hunger strike in 1973 against what he regarded as political censorship.
French law was amended. His activism began when he was 15 years old and joined the French Resistance during World War II.
He wrote a documentary on himself in 1998.
In the 1960s he returned to the newly independent Algeria to teach film instruction.
The Japanese judo fighter Hitoshi Saito, the winner of two Olympic gold medals, has died at the age of 54.
Cause of death was reported as intra-Hepathic bile duct cancer.
He died in Osaka on Tuesday.
In addition to being former Olympic champion and world champion, Saito at the time of his death was also chairman of All Japan Judo Federation's training committee.
At least 100 people attended the party to celebrate the first anniversary of a married couple whose wedding was held last year.
A formal anniversary event has been scheduled on a later date, told officials.
The couple married in Texas a year ago and came to Buffalo to celebrate the wedding with friends and families.
The 30-year-old husband who was born in Buffalo was among the four people who were killed in the shooting, but his wife was not injured.
Karno is a well-known but controversial English teacher who taught during Modern Education and King's Glory and claimed to have 9,000 students when his career was greatest.
He used words in his notes, which some parents considered rude, and he supposedly used swear words per hour.
Modern Education accused him of printing large advertisements on buses without permission and lying by saying that he was the top English tutor.
He has been accused of copyright infringement before, but no charges were brought against him.
A former student told that he 'used slang in class, gave dating tips in notes and was as a friend to the students.'
Over the past three decades, China has developed a market economy, although it is officially still a communist state.
The first economic reforms were carried out under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping.
Since then, China's size has grown 90 times from an economic perspective.
For the first time last year, China exported more cars than Germany, and they also exceeded the US as the largest market in this industry.
China's GDP can be greater than that of the United States within two decades.
The tropical storm Danielle, the fourth named storm in the 2010 Atlantic Hurricane season, was formed in the eastern Atlantic.
The storm, which is about 3,000 miles from Miami, Florida, has a maximum sustained wind of 40 miles per hour (64 km/h).
Scientists at the National Hurricane Center predict that Danielle will increase in strength and become a hurricane by Wednesday.
As the storm is far from land, it is still difficult to assess its potential damage in the United States and the Caribbean.
Bobek was born in the Croatian capital Zagreb, and got his fame while playing for Partizan Belgrade.
He came to the club in 1945 and stayed until 1958.
During his time on the team he scored 403 goals in 468 matches.
No one has ever been more with or scored as many goals for the club than Bobek.
In 1995 he was elected by vote as the best player in Partizan's history.
The celebrations started with an excellent show from the world-renowned group, Cirque du Soleil.
They were followed by Istanbul State Symphony Orchestra, a janitshar band, and the singers Fatih Erkoç and Müslüm Gürses.
Then swirling dervish dancers went on stage.
The Turkish diva, Sezen Aksu, performed with the Italian tenor Alessandro Safina and the Greek singer, Haris Alexiou.
Finally, the show "Troy" was performed by the Turkish dance group, "Fire of Anatolia."
Thirteen-year-old motorcycle racer, Peter Lenz, has died in an accident at Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
During his warming round Lenz fell off his motorcycle and was then hit by another racer Xavier Zayat.
He was immediately visited by medical personnel on the track and transported to a local hospital where he later died.
Zayat wasn't hurt in the accident.
In relation to the global economic situation, Zapatero then stated that "the financial system is part of the economy, an essential part.
We have a year-long financial crisis that has had its toughest period in the last two months, and I believe that the financial markets are now starting to come back to a normal level."
Last week, Naked News announced that they would significantly increase their international language mandate for news reporting with three new broadcasts.
The global organisation, which already reports in English and Japanese, launches Spanish, Italian and Korean programmes for television, Internet and mobile devices.
Fortunately, nothing happened to me, but it was a macabre sight when people tried to break windows to get out.
People hit the windows with chairs, but the windows couldn't be broken.
"One of the windows was finally smashed, and they began to escape through the windows," said survivors Franciszek Kowal.
Stars emit light and heat due to the energy produced when hydrogen atoms are turned (or melted) together to shape heavier elements.
Scientists are working to produce a reactor that can produce energy in the same way.
However, this is a very difficult problem to solve and it will be many years before we see usable fusion reactors being built.
The steel needle floats on top of the water due to surface tension.
Surface tension occurs because the water molecules on the surface of the water are strongly attracted to each other, more than they are to the air molecules above them.
The water molecules collect and form an invisible membrane on the surface of the water, allowing objects such as needles to flow.
The magazine on a modern skate is double-edged with a hollow concave between them. The two edges give a better grip on the ice even when pouring.
As the bottom of the blade is slightly curved, the edge that is in contact with the ice also bows when the blade tilts to one side or the other.
This causes the skater to turn. If the skates are tilted to the right, the skater turns right, and if the skates are tilted to the left, the skater turns left.
To return to their previous energy level, they must burn the extra energy they received from the light.
It does this by sending out a small particle of light called a "photon."
Researchers call this process "stimulated radiation" because the atoms are stimulated by the clear light, causing the broadcasting of a photon of light, and light is a kind of radiation.
The next picture shows atoms emitting photons. Of course, photons are much smaller than those seen in the picture.
Photons are even smaller than what atoms consist of!
After hundreds of hours of operation, the bulb's filament burns out, and the bulb doesn't work anymore.
Then the bulb needs to be replaced. It is important to be careful when replacing the bulb.
First, the light switch must be switched off or the plug must have been removed.
This is because electricity flowing into the switch where the metallic part of the bulb sits can give you a severe electric shock if you touch the inside of the switch or metal at the bottom of the bulb while still partially in the socket.
The largest organ in the body's circulatory system is the heart that pumps the blood around.
Blood is directed away from the heart in veins called arteries and comes back to the heart in veins called veins, the smallest veins called capillaries.
A Triceratops' teeth would have been able to crush not only leaves but also very hard branches and roots.
Some scientists believe that Triceratops ate pine palms, a plant type that was common during the Cretaceous period.
These plants look like a small palm tree with a crown of sharp leaves with spikes.
A Triceratops may have used its strong beak to remove the leaves before eating the trunk.
Other scientists claim that these plants are very poisonous, so it is unlikely that some dinosaurs ate them, although both the sloth and other animals such as the parrot (a descendant of dinosaurs) today are able to eat poisonous leaves and/or fruits.
How would Io's gravity affect me? If you were standing on the surface of Io, you would weigh less than you do on earth.
A person who weighs 200 pounds (90 kg) on the ground would weigh about 36 pounds (16 kg) on Io. So gravity naturally draws less in one.
The sun doesn't have a crust that you can stand on, just like the Earth has. The whole sun consists of gases, fire and plasma.
The gas gets thinner the further away you come from the sun's center.
The outer part, which we can see when we look at the sun, is called the photosphere, which means "ball of light."
About three thousand years later, in 1610, Italian astronomer Galileo Galileo used a telescope to observe that Venus has phases, like the moon has.
Phases happen because only one side of Venus (or Moon) faces the sun gets light. Venus' phases supported Copernicus' theory that the planets orbit around the sun.
Subsequently, a few years later in 1639, an English astronomer, Jeremiah Horrocks, observed a Venus Passage.
England had lived through a long period of peace on top of the recapture of Danelagen.
In 991 Ethelred, however, faced a Viking fleet larger than anyone before since Guthrum's fleet from a century earlier.
This fleet was led by Olaf Trygvasson, a Norwegian with ambitions to retake his country from Danish domination.
After initial military setbacks, Ethelred was able to agree on the terms with Olaf, who returned to Norway to try to win his kingdom with partial success.
Hangeul is the only deliberately created alphabet used widely in daily life. The alphabet was invented in 1444 during the reign of King Sejong (1418-1450).
King Sejong was the fourth king of the Joseon dynasty and is one of the most respected.
Originally he named the Hangul alphabet Hunmin Jeongeum, meaning "the right sounds for the instruction of the people."
There are many theories about how Sanskrit came into being. One of them is about an Aryan migration from the West to India, where they took their language with them.
Sanskrit is an old language and can be compared to the Latin language spoken in Europe.
The earliest known book in the world was written in Sanskrit. After the collection of the upanishades faded Sanskrit simply as a result of hierarchy.
Sanskrit is a very complex and rich language which has formed the basis for many modern Indian languages, just as Latin forms the basis for European languages such as French and Spanish.
When the fight for France was over, Germany began preparing to invade Britain.
Germany gave the attack the code name "Operation Sea Lion." Most of the British army's heavy weapons and supplies were lost when they evacuated from Dunkerque, so the army was quite weak.
But Royal Navy was still much stronger than the German Navy and could have destroyed any invading fleet that was sent over the English Channel.
However, very few of Royal Navy's ships were based close to the likely invasion routes, as the admirals feared that they would be sunk by German air strikes.
Let us begin with an explanation of Italy's plans: Italy was mainly Germany's "little brother" and Japan's "little brother."
It had a weaker army and a weaker fleet, although they had just built four new ships just before the war started.
Italy's main objective was African countries; in order to conquer these countries, they needed a launch ramp for the troops so that they could sail across the Mediterranean and invade Africa.
To that they had to get rid of British bases and ships in Egypt. Besides this, Italy's warships were not meant to do anything else.
Now to Japan. Japan was an island kingdom like Britain.
Submarines are ships designed to travel underwater and remain there for a long time.
Submarines were used in both the first and the second world wars, and at that time they were very slow and had a very limited range of shootings.
At the beginning of the war they traveled mainly on top of the water, but when the radar began to evolve and became more precise, the submarines were forced to go underwater to avoid being seen.
German submarines were called U-boats. Germans were very skilled at steering and operating their submarines.
Because of their success with submarines, since the war, the Germans have not been trusted enough to let them have many of them.
Yes! King Tutankhamun, sometimes referred to as "King Tut" or "Boy King," is one of the most well-known ancient Egyptian kings in modern times.
Interestingly, he was not considered to be very important in ancient times, and on most ancient royal lists he was not registered at all.
But the discovery of his grave in 1922 made him famous. Although many of the tombs of the past were robbed, there was virtually no touching of his grave.
Thousands of objects made of precious metals and rare stones were buried together with Tutankhamon and are still extremely well preserved.
With the invention of the squirrel wheel, the Assyrian chariots became both lighter, faster, and better equipped to catch up with both soldiers and other chariots.
The arrows from their mortal crossbows could penetrate the armor of the enemies. Around 1,000 BC, the Assyrians introduced the first cavalry.
A cavalry is an army that fights on horseback. The saddle was not invented yet, so the Assyrian army fought on their horses' bare backs.
We know many Greek politicians, scientists and artists. Homer, the legendary blind poet, perhaps the most famous person from this culture, composed two masterpieces of Greek literature: The poems Iliad and Odysseyen.
Sophocles and Aristofanes are still popular playwrights, and their plays are considered to be among the greatest works of world literature.
Another famous Greek is the mathematician Pythagoras, who is best known for his famous theorem on the relationship between the sides of a right-angle triangle.
There are various estimates of how many people speak Hindi, which is assumed to be between the second and fourth most commonly spoken languages in the world.
The number of people speaking their mother tongue varies depending on whether you count very closely connected dialects with or not.
From calculations it is estimated that there are between 340 million to 500 million speakers and as many as 800 million people who can understand the language.
Hindi and Urdu are similar in their vocabulary but are different in writing; in daily conversation speakers of both languages can usually understand each other.
Around the 15th century, northern Estonia was greatly influenced culturally by Germany.
Some German monks wanted to bring God closer to the local people, so they invented the Estonian literal language.
It was based on the German alphabet and a single letter ".../õ" was added.
In time, many words borrowed from German merged together. This was the beginning of the Enlightenment.
Traditionally, the heir to the throne would enter the military directly after completing the school.
Charles, however, attended the University of Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studied anthropology and archaeology and later history and received a 2:2 (a lower second-class degree).
Charles was the first member of the British royal family to receive an education.
The European part of Turkey (Eastern Thrace or Rumelia in the Balkan Peninsula) accounts for 3% of the country.
Turkey's area is more than 1600 kilometres (1000 miles) long and 800 km (500 miles) wide, and it has a rectangular shape.
Turkey's land area, including lakes, is 783,562 square kilometers (300,948 square miles), of which 755,688 square kilometers (291,773 square miles) are located in Southwest Asia and 23,764 square kilometers (9,174 square miles) are located in Europe.
Turkey's land area makes it the world's 37th largest country, and it is about the same size as the French mainland and Britain combined.
Turkey is surrounded by three-sided seas: the Aegean to the west, the Black Sea to the north and the Mediterranean to the south.
Luxembourg has a long history, but its independence can be dated back to 1839.
Some of today's Belgium belonged to Luxembourg, but became Belgian after the Belgian revolution in the 1830s.
Luxembourg has always tried to remain a neutral country, but it became occupied by Germany in both the first and the second world wars.
Luxembourg became one of the founding members of the organization known today as the European Union, in 1957.
Drukgyal Dzong is a ruined fortress and a Buddhist monastery in the upper part of the Paro district (in the village of Phondey).
It is said that Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel in 1649 created the fortress to celebrate his victory over the Tibetan-Mongolian forces.
A fire in 1951 left only some of the Drukgyal Dzong relics such as the picture of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal.
After the fire the fortress was preserved and protected and now stands as one of Bhutan's most worthy attractions.
During the 18th century, Cambodia felt squeezed between the two powerful neighbors, Thailand and Vietnam.
The Thais invaded Cambodia several times in the 18th century and in 1772 they destroyed Phnom Phen.
The Vietnamese also invaded Cambodia at the end of the 18th century.
Eighteen percent of Venezuelans are unemployed, and most of them work in the informal economy.
Two thirds of Venezuelans in employment work in the service sector, almost a quarter work in the industrial sector, and one fifth work in agriculture.
An important industry for Venezuelans is the oil industry, where the country is a net exporter, although only one percent of the population works in the oil industry.
In the time after Singapore became independent, the Botanical Garden's expertise helped transform the island into a tropical garden city.
In 1981 the Orchid hybrid Vanda Miss Joaquim was chosen as the national flower of the country.
Each year, around October, nearly 1.5 million herbivorous species cross the Mara River from the northern mountains to the southern plains and the rain.
And then back north through the west - again across the Mara River after the rain season around April.
The Serengeti region includes Serengeti National Park, Ngorongoro Conservation Area and Maswa Game Reserve in Tanzania and the Maasai Mara National Reserve in Kenya.
Learning to create interactive media requires conventional and traditional skills as well as tools learned in interactive courses (storyboards, audio and video editing, storytelling, etc.)
Interactive design requires you to review your assumptions about media production and learn to think in non-linear ways.
Interactive design requires that the components of a project can be connected to each other, but at the same time makes sense as separate devices.
The disadvantage of zoom lenses is that the focal complexity and the number of lens elements required to achieve a range of focal lengths are much greater than for main lenses.
This becomes less problematic as lens manufacturers get higher standards in the production of lenses.
This has allowed zoom lenses to produce images of a quality comparable to that obtained by lenses having a fixed focal length.
Another drawback of zoom lenses is that the maximum glare (speed) of the lens is usually lower.
This makes cheap zoom lenses difficult to use in weak light conditions without a flash.
One of the most common problems when trying to convert a movie to DVD format is overscanning.
The majority of televisions are made in a way that works for most.
For that reason, everything you saw on TV was cut in the edges - the top, the bottom and the sides.
This is made to ensure that the image covers the entire screen. It is called overscan.
If you make a DVD, unfortunately its edges will also most likely be cut off, and if the video had subtitles too close to the bottom, they would not be fully visible.
The traditional medieval castle has long inspired the imagination, conjuring up pictures of knight's tournaments, banquets and Arthur chivalry.
Even when you stand in the middle of a thousand-year-old ruins, it is easy to think about the sounds and smells of battles that took place long ago, almost to hear the sounds of hooves on the cobblestones and smell the fear coming up from the dungeons.
But is our imagination based on reality? Why were castles built to begin with? How were they designed and built?
Kirby Muxloe Castle is typical of the time period as it is more like a fortified house than it is a real castle.
Its large glass windows and thin walls would not have been able to withstand a targeted attack for long.
In the 1480s, when the construction was started by Lord Hastings, the country was relatively peaceful, and there was only a need to defend itself against small roaming bands.
The European nations tried to maintain the national sovereignty of all European states by means of a system of balance of power.
The concept was that all European nations should try to prevent a single nation from becoming strong, and thus national governments often changed their alliances in order to maintain balance.
The Spanish succession war was the first war, the central point of which was the balance of power.
This marked an important change, as European powers no longer wanted the pretext that they were religious wars.
Artemis' temple in Ephesus was destroyed on July 21, 356 BC in a fire set by Herostratus.
According to history, his motivation was fame at all costs. The Ephesians furiously announced that Herostratus' name should never be registered.
The Greek historian Strabo later wrote the name, which is why we know it today. The temple was destroyed the night Alexander the Great was born.
As king Alexander offered him to pay for the temple's reconstruction, but his offer was refused. Later, after Alexander's death, the temple was rebuilt in 323 BC.
Make sure your hand is as relaxed as possible while still hitting all the tones correctly - also try to avoid making too many extra movements with your fingers.
In this way you exhaust yourself as little as possible. Remember that there is no need to hit the keys hard to get more sound like on the piano.
To get extra volume on the accordion, the fan bellows are used at higher pressure or speed.
Mystery is the persecution of fellowship with, identity with or awareness of an ultimate reality, divinity, spiritual truth or God.
The believer seeks a direct experience, intuition, or insight into divine reality/the Godhead or the gods.
Followers strive for certain ways of life and practices that aim to nurture those experiences.
Mystery can be distinguished from other forms of religious faith and worship by emphasising the direct personal experience of a unique state of consciousness especially those with a peaceful, insightful, happy or even ecstatic character.
Sikhism is a religion that originates from the Indian subcontinent. It originated in the Punjab region in the 15th century as a result of a sectarian division in the Hindu tradition.
Sikhs see their faith as a religion different from Hinduism, although they recognize its Hindu roots and traditions.
Sikhs call their religion Gurmat, which in Punjabi means "the way of the guru." The guru is a fundamental element of all Indian religions, but in Sikhism has been given a meaning which forms the foundation stone of the Sikhs' faith.
Religion was founded in the 15th century by Guru Nanak (1469-1539). He was followed by another nine guru in a row.
In June 1956, however, Krushchev's promises were put to the test when riots in Poland, where the workers' protests over lack of food and cuts in wages, became a general protest against Communism.
Although Khrushchev eventually sent tanks in to restore order, he met certain financial demands and agreed to appoint the popular Wladyslaw Gomulka as new prime minister.
The North-West Indian subcontinent, where the Indus culture was a widespread civilization in the Bronze Age, included most of today's Pakistan as well as regions in north-west India and north-east Afghanistan,
Civilization flourished in the basins of the Indus River, and that's where it's got its name.
While some scientists suggest that civilization, when it also existed in the now dried-up Sarasvati river areas, should be called the Indus-Sarasvati civilization, others call it the Harappa civilization after Harappa, the first of its excavation sites excavated in the 1920s.
The militaristic tendencies of the Roman Empire promoted the development of medical progress.
Emperor Augustus began recruiting doctors, and even made the first Roman medical corps to be used in the wake of the battles.
Surgeons knew of various forms of anesthesia such as morphine from poppy seed extract and scopolamine from buzzwood.
They became skilled at amputating to save patients from gangrene and to use atherosclerosis and artery clamps to reduce blood flow.
For centuries the Roman Empire led to great progress in medicine and formed much of the knowledge we know today.
Pureland origami is origami with the limitations that only one fold may be made at a time, that more complex folds such as reverse folds are not allowed, and that all folders should have simple locations.
It was developed by John Smith in the 1970s to help inexperienced leaflets or those with limited motor skills.
Children develop awareness of race and race stereotypes when they are quite young, and these race stereotypes affect their behavior.
For example, children who are identified with a racial minority that stereotyped as performing badly at school will do badly at school when they learn about the stereotype associated with their race.
MySpace is the third most popular website in the United States and currently has 54 million profiles.
These websites have received a lot of attention, especially in the field of education.
There are positive aspects of these websites which include easy to set up a class page which can include blogs, videos, images and other features.
You can create easy access to this page by simply providing one internet address that is easy to remember and easy to enter for learners who may have difficulty using the keyboard or spelling.
It can be customized so that it is easy to read and can be used as little or as much color as you want.
Attention Deficit Disorder "is a neurological syndrome whose classic triad of defining symptoms includes impulsiveness, distraction and hyperactivity or excess energy."
It is not about learning difficulties, but about learning disorders and "ranges from 3 to 5 percent of all children and perhaps up to 2 million children in the United States. "
Children with ADD find it difficult to focus on things like schoolwork, but they can concentrate on things they like such as playing games, watching their favorite comics or writing phrases without punctuation.
These children tend to run into a lot of problems, as they "begin risky behavior, get into fights, and challenge authorities" to stimulate their brains, as their brains are not being stimulated in the normal way.
ADD affects relationships with other peers as the other children cannot understand why they behave as they do or why they spell as they do or that their maturity is at a different level.
As the ability to gain knowledge and learn changed as described above, people's learning rates changed.
The approach to obtaining information was different: there was no pressure on individual memories anymore, but the ability to remember texts came more in focus.
In short, the Renaissance represented a significant change in the approach to learning and the dissemination of knowledge.
Unlike other primates, hominids no longer use their hands in motion to carry weight or to swing through the trees.
The chimpanzee's hands and feet have the same size and length, reflecting that the hand is used to carry weight when it goes knuckle.
The human hand is shorter than the foot and has more equal flangs.
Two to three million years old fossils of hands show this shift in hand development from movement to manipulation.
Some people think that it can be very exhausting when they experience many artificially induced Lucide dreams.
The primary reason for this phenomenon is that the result of the clear dreams extends the period between REM phases.
With fewer REMs per night, this condition in which you are actually asleep and your body is restored is rarely enough to become a problem.
It's just as exhausting as if you woke up every 20 or thirty minutes and watched television.
The effect depends on how often your brain tries to dream Lucide dreams at night.
The Italians had problems in North Africa almost from the start. Within a week after Italy had declared war on June 10, 1940, Britain's 11th Husars had taken over Fort Capuzzo in Libya.
In an ambush east of Bardia, the British captured General Lastucci, who was the engineer general of the Italian Ten Army.
On June 28, Marshal Italo Balbo, Governor-General of Libya and apparently Mussolini's successor, was killed by self-fire during landing in Tobruk.
Fighting as modern sport is exercised at many levels by students at universities for professional and Olympic tournaments.
The sport is primarily played in duel format, where one fencer duels with another.
Golf is a game where players use clubs to beat balls in holes.
Eighteen holes are played during a regular round, where players usually start on the first hole on the pitch and end on the eighteenth.
The player who uses the least punches or bends with the club to complete the pitch wins.
The game is played on grass, and the grass around the hole is beaten a bit shorter and is called "the green."
The most common type of tourism is probably the one most people associate with travel: leisure tourism.
That's when people go somewhere that's very different from their normal everyday life to relax and have fun.
Beaches, amusement parks and camping grounds are often the most visited places of holiday tours.
If the purpose of your visit to a particular place is to learn about its history or culture, it is called cultural tourism.
Tourists can visit different landmarks in a particular country, or they can choose to focus on just one area.
After seeing this activity, the colonists also called for reinforcements.
The troops that strengthened the front positions consisted of the two 200 men of 1st and 3rd New Hampshire regiments, led by the colonels John Stark and James Reed (who were subsequently appointed generals).
Stark's men positioned themselves along the fence at the north end of the colonists' position.
When low tides opened a hole along the Mystic River along the northeastern part of the peninsula, they quickly extended the fence with a short stone wall to the north that ended at the water edge of a small beach.
Gridley or Stark put a stake around 100 feet (30 m) in front of the fence and gave orders that no one should shoot before the soldiers passed it.
The American plan depended on coordinated attacks from three different directions being launched.
General John Cadwalder launched a diversion attack on the British garrison in Bordentown to block any reinforcements.
General James Ewing would take 700 men across the river at Trenton Ferry, take over the bridge over Assunpink Creek and prevent enemy troops from fleeing.
The primary attack force of 2,400 men had to cross the river nine miles north of Trenton and then split into two groups, one under Greene and one under Sullivan, to launch an attack at dawn.
With the change of the race from a quarter to a half mile, the speed of the runner becomes much less important while endurance becomes an absolute necessity.
Of course, a first-class half-miler, a person who can beat two minutes, must base his race on speed, but stamina is also an important factor.
Some cross-country skiing during the winter combined with gymnastics work for the upper part of the body is the best preparation for the running season.
Good nutrition habits alone cannot create performance in the elite class, but they can significantly affect the overall well-being of young athlete.
Maintaining a healthy energy balance, drinking plenty and understanding the meaning of taking supplements can improve athlete's performance and give them a better enjoyment when playing sports.
Mid-distance runs are a relatively cheap sport; however, there are many misunderstandings as to the few parts required as equipment to participate.
You can buy products as needed, but most will have little or no significant effect on your performance.
Athletes may feel that they prefer a product, even if it has no real advantages.
The atom can be considered one of the fundamental building blocks of all matter.
The unit is very complex unit and consists of a central core around which orbiting electrons, on approximately the same as the planets orbiting the sun, cf. a simplified Bohr model, see Figure 1.1.
The nucleus consists of two particles - neutrons and protons.
Protons have positive electrical charge while neutrons have no charge. Electrons have negative electrical charge.
To check the victim, you must first investigate the area to ensure your own safety.
You should notice the victim's position when you get closer to him or her and look for automatic warning signs.
If you get hurt while trying to help, you may only make the situation worse.
The study showed that depression, fear, and disaster mediated the relationship between pain and disability in people with lower back pain.
Only the effects of disaster thoughts, not depression or fear, were conditional on weekly structured meetings with a medical assistant.
Those who participated in regular activity required more support in terms of negative perception of pain, showing differences in chronic pain and feeling of discomfort from normal physical movement.
Vision, or ability to see, depends on sensory organs for the vision system or eyes.
There are many different structures of eyes that have different complexity depending on the requirements of the organism.
The different structures have different capabilities, are sensitive to different wavelengths and have different degrees of sharpness, they also require different treatments for input and different numbers to make sense, and it all works optimally.
A stock is a collection of organisms of a particular species within a particular geographical area.
When a country's population has common phenotypic features, they are called monomorphic.
When individuals display several variants of a particular trait, they are polymorphic.
Also colonies of hiking ants march and build nests in different phases.
In the nomadic phase, army ants march at night and stop to camp during the day.
The colony begins a nomadic phase when there are no doctors in the area. At this stage, the colony makes temporary nests that are changed every day.
Each of these nomadic ravages or marches lasts for about 17 days.
What is a cell? The word cell comes from the Latin word "cella," meaning "small space," and it was used for the first time by a microscopicist who observed the structure of cork.
The cell is the basic unit for all living things, and all organisms consist of one or more cells.
Cells are actually so basic and critical for studying life that they are often referred to as "the building blocks of life."
Nervous system disorders maintain homeostasis by sending nerve impulses throughout the body to keep blood flowing, as well as to keep it undisturbed.
These nerve impulses can be sent quickly around the whole body, helping to keep the body safe from any potential threat.
Compared to other violent storms, tornadoes hit only a small area, but they can destroy everything in their path.
Tornadoes rip out trees with their roots, rip boards of buildings and throw cars into the air. The most violent two percent of tornadoes last more than three hours.
These monster storms have won up to 480 km/h (133 m/s; 300 miles/hour).
Man has been making and using lenses for magnification for thousands of years.
However, the first real telescopes were produced in Europe at the end of the 16th century.
These telescopes used a combination of two lenses to make distant objects appear both larger and closer.
Greed and selfishness will always exist, and it is part of the way cooperation works that when the majority has taken over, it will always be possible to win more in the short term by acting selfishly.
Hopefully, most people will realise that their best option in the long term is to cooperate with others.
Many dream about the day when people can travel to another star and explore other worlds. Some wonder what is out there, and some believe that aliens or other life might live on another planet.
But if this ever happens, it probably won't happen until very long. The stars are so scattered that there are several billions of miles between stars that are "neighbors."
Will your great-grandchildren one day stand in a strange world and think of their ancient ancestors?
Animals are made from many cells, eating things, digesting them in their bodies, most animals can move.
Only animals have brains (although not all animals have one; jellyfish, for example, have no brain).
There are animals all over the world, digging in the ground, swimming in the oceans and flying in the sky.
Cells are the smallest structural and functional units for a living (thing) organism.
Cell comes from the Latin word cella, which means small space.
If you look at living things under a microscope, you will see that they are formed from small squares or balls.
English biologist Robert Hooke saw small squares in cork with a microscope.
They had a shape that resembled space. He was the first to be able to observe dead cells.
Elements and chemical compounds can go from one state to another without changing.
The nitrogen in gas form still has the same properties as liquid nitrogen. The liquid form has higher density, but the molecules are still the same.
Water is another example. Water is composed of two hydrogen atoms and an oxygen atom.
It has the same molecular structure, whether it's gas, liquid or solid.
Although its physical state may change, its chemical state remains the same.
Time is something that is everywhere, and it affects everything we do, but it's hard to understand.
Time has been studied by religious, philosophical, and scientific scientists for thousands of years.
We see time as a series of events going from the future through the present to the past.
Time is also the way we compare the duration (length) of events.
You can mark the course of time by observing the repetition of a cyclical event. A cyclical event is something that happens regularly over and over again.
Computers today are used to manipulate images and videos.
Advanced animations can be created on computers, and such animations are becoming more and more widespread in TV and movies.
Music is often recorded using sophisticated computers that can process and mix the sound.
In a large part of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, it was believed that the first inhabitants of New Zealand were the Maori who hunted giant birds called moas.
The theory then established the idea that the Maori migrated from Polynesia into a large fleet and took New Zealand from the Moriorians, and established an agricultural community.
New evidence suggests, however, that the Moriorians were a group of mainland Maori who migrated from New Zealand to the Chatham Islands and developed their own distinctive, peaceful culture.
There was also another tribe on the Chatham Islands, these were Maoris who had migrated from New Zealand.
They called themselves the Moriorians.There were a few clashes and in the end the Moriorians were wiped out.
Persons who had been involved for several decades helped us to appreciate our strengths and passions and at the same time assess our problems and errors sincerely.
As we listened to individuals sharing their individual, family and organizational stories, we gained a valuable insight into the past as well as some of the personalities that affected the organization's culture in a positive or negative way.
While understanding your history does not require understanding culture, at least it helps people to get a sense of where they fall into the organization's history.
When individuals assess the successes and discover mistakes, they and all the participating individuals gain a better understanding of the organisation's values, mission and driving forces.
In this case, it helped people to be open to new changes and a new direction for the local church to remember earlier cases of entrepreneurship and the successes it brought.
Such success stories diminished fear of change and created positive tendencies toward change in the future.
Converging thought patterns are problem-solving techniques that bring together different ideas or areas to find a solution.
The focus of this thinking is speed, logic and accuracy, as well as identification of facts, recycling of existing techniques, and gathering information.
The most important factor in this thinking is that there is only one correct answer: you think only of two answers: right or wrong.
The way to think is associated with specific scientific procedures or standard procedures.
People who think this way apply logical thinking, and they are able to remember patterns, solve problems and work with scientific tests.
Man is by far the most talented species in reading the thoughts of others.
This means that we are able to correctly predict what other people perceive, plan, believe, know or want.
Among these skills is the ability to understand the intentions of others. It enables us to clarify any ambiguity in physical actions.
For example, if you saw someone smashing a car window, you'd probably assume that he was stealing a stranger's car.
It would be necessary to judge him differently if he had lost his car keys and it was his own car that he tried to break into.
MRI is based on a physical phenomenon called nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), which was discovered in the 1930s by Felix Bloch (employee at Stanford University) and Edward Purcell (from Harvard University).
In this resonance, the magnetic field and radio waves cause the atoms to give off small radio signals.
In 1970, Raymond Damadian, a doctor and researcher, discovered the basis for using imaging with magnetic resonance as a tool for medical diagnosis.
Four years later, the patent was approved, which was the world's first patent approved within the MRI.
In 1977 Dr. Damadian completed the construction of the first "full-body" MRI scanner, which he called it "indomitable."
Asynchronous communication allows time to reflect and react to others.
This allows students to work at their own pace and manage how quickly they receive guidance information.
There are also fewer time limits and good opportunities for flexible working time. (Bremer, 1998)
The use of the Internet and the World Wide Web gives students access to information at any time.
Students can also submit questions to instructors at any time of the day and expect relatively quick answers, rather than waiting for the next physical meeting.
The post-modern approach to learning gives freedom from absolutes. There is not one particular good way to learn.
In fact, there is not a single good thing to learn. Learning takes place in the meeting between the learner and the knowledge presented.
Our current experience with all the do-it-yourself and informative, learning-based TV programs illustrates this point.
So many of us are where we are watching a TV show that informs us about a process or experience that we will never participate in, nor will we use the information we receive.
We will never renovate a car, build a fountain in our backyard, travel to Peru to investigate old ruins or rebuild our neighbor's house.
Thanks to underwater fiber optic cable connections to Europe as well as satellite broadband, Greenland is well connected and 93% of the population has internet access.
Your hotel or hosts (if you live in a guesthouse or private home) will probably have WiFi or a computer with internet connection, and all cities have an internet café or a place with public WiFi.
As mentioned above, although it is still considered acceptable in the United States, the word "Eskimo" is considered to be derogatory to many Arctic peoples outside the United States - especially in Canada.
While you may hear the word used by Greenlandic natives, it should not be used by foreigners.
The native inhabitants of Greenland call themselves Inuits in Canada, and in Greenland they call themselves Kalaaleq (majority: Kalaallit), which means "Greenlander."
In general, crime and hatred against foreigners are almost unknown in Greenland. Even in the cities there are no "dangerous areas."
Cold weather may be the only real danger facing the unprepared.
If you visit Greenland in the cold months (and rain that it gets colder and colder, the further north you take), it is essential to bring clothes that are warm enough.
The very long days of summer can lead to problems with getting enough sleep and accompanying health problems.
In summer, you should also keep an eye on the Nordic mosquitoes. They don't give you any diseases, but they can be annoying.
San Francisco's economy is associated with being a world-class tourist attraction, while its economy is diversified.
The main employment sectors are professional services, the public sector, finance, trade and tourism.
The fact that it is often portrayed in music, films, literature and popular culture has helped make the city and its landmarks known all over the world.
San Francisco has developed a large tourist infrastructure with numerous hotels, restaurants and the best conference facilities.
San Francisco is also one of the best places in the country for other Asian food: Korean, Thai, Indian and Japanese.
A trip to Walt Disney World is like a great pilgrimage for many American families.
The "typical" visit consists of flying to Orlando's international airport, driving a bus to a Disney hotel on site, a week's stay without leaving Disney's property and a return trip.
There are an infinite number of possible variations, but this is still what most people mean when they talk about "going to Disney World."
Many tickets sold online on auction sites such as eBay or Craigslist are partly used multiday Park Hopper tickets.
Although it is a very common activity, it is not allowed by Disney: the tickets cannot be transferred.
To set up camp in the Grand Canyon itself, a wilderness permit is required.
Permissions are limited to protect the gap and are available from the first day of the month, four months before the starting month.
Therefore, a backcountry permit for any start date in May will be available on 1 January.
Sites for the most popular areas such as Bright Angel Campground near Phantom Ranch, are generally filled up via the queries received on the first date they are open for reservations.
There are a limited number of permits reserved for drop-in requests which are available on the first-to-mill principle.
Getting to southern Africa by car is a great way to see the beauty of the whole region as well as to find places outside the normal tourist routes.
This can be done in a normal car with careful planning, but a four-wheel drive is highly recommended and in many places is only available with a four-wheel drive with a high wheel base.
Remember, when you plan that although South Africa is stable, not all neighbouring countries are.
Visa requirements and costs vary from nation to nation and change depending on the country you come from.
Each country also has unique laws that require different items for emergencies that must be found in the car.
Victoria Falls is a city in the west of Zimbabwe across the border from Livingstone, Zambia and close to Botswana.
The city is right next to the waterfalls and they are the main attraction, but this popular tourist destination offers both adventurers and tourists plenty of opportunities for a longer stay.
During the rainy season (November to March) the water volume will be greater and the waterfalls will be more dramatic.
You will definitely get wet if you cross the bridge, or walk along the paths that wind around the waterfalls.
On the other hand, it is precisely because the amount of water is so large that your view of the actual waterfalls is exposed to all the water!
Tutankhamun's tomb (KV62). KV62 is possibly the most famous of all the tombs in the valley, as it was the site of Howard Carter's discovery in 1922 of the almost perfect maintenance of the young king's royal burial.
Compared to the burial sites of most other Regents, Tutankhamun's tomb is hardly worth visiting, as it is considerably smaller and with few decorations.
If you are interested in seeing the damage caused to the mummy while trying to remove it from the coffin, you are disappointed because only its head and shoulders are visible.
The amazing wealth from the grave no longer exists in it, but has been moved to the Egyptian museum in Cairo.
It would be best if visitors with limited time spent their time elsewhere.
Phnom Krom, 12 km southwest of Siem Reap. This temple was built on a hilltop in the late 9th century during King Yasovarman's reign.
The gloomy atmosphere of the temple and the view over Lake Tonle Sap make it worthwhile to complete the climbing to the hill.
A visit to the area can easily be combined with a boat trip to the lake.
The Angkor passport is necessary to access the temple, so remember to take your passport with you when you travel to Tonle Sap.
Jerusalem is the capital and the largest city in Israel, although most other countries and the United Nations do not recognize it as Israel's capital.
The ancient city of the highlands of Judah has a fascinating history that goes back thousands of years.
The city is sacred to the three monotheistic religions - Judaism, Christianity and Islam and serves as a spiritual, religious and cultural center.
Due to its religious significance and in particular the numerous attractions in the Old City area, Jerusalem is one of the essential tourist destinations in Israel.
Jerusalem has many historical, archaeological and cultural sites, as well as lively and crowded shopping malls, cafés and restaurants.
Ecuador requires Cuban citizens to receive an invitation letter before entering Ecuador via international airports or crossing borders.
This letter shall be legalised by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ecuador and meet certain requirements.
These requirements aim to ensure an organised flow of immigration between the two countries.
Cuban citizens who have an American green card should go to an Ecuadorian consulate to obtain an exemption from the requirement.
Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months after the date of your trip. You must have a return ticket or a ticket for a further journey to prove the length of your stay.
Tours are cheaper for larger groups, so if you are alone or with only one friend, try to meet other people and make a group of four to six people so you can get a better price per person.
However, this should not be something you worry about, as tourists are often moved around to fill the cars.
It actually seems to be more of a way of tricking people into thinking that they have to pay more.
This steep mountain rises high above the northern end of Machu Picchu, and is often the background for many pictures of the ruins.
It looks a little scary from below, and it is a steep and difficult ascension, but most people in reasonable form should be able to cope with it in about 45 minutes.
Stone steps are laid along most of the path, and in the more steep sections steel cables form a supporting railing.
That said, you should expect to get out of breath, and you should be careful on the steeper parts of the route, especially in wet weather as it can quickly become dangerous.
There's a little cave close to the top that you have to go through, it's pretty low and narrow and hard to get through.
It is best to see the Galapagos'places and wildlife by boat, just as Charles Darwin did in 1835.
Over 60 cruise ships sail through Galapagos waters - with sizes from 8 to 100 passengers.
Most book their seats in good time (as the boats are usually well filled in during the peak season).
Make sure that the agent you book through is a specialist in Galapagos and is well acquainted with many different types of ships.
This will ensure that your special interests and/or limitations are matched with the ship that best suits them.
Before the Spaniards arrived in the 16th century, northern Chile was under the rule of the Incas, while the original Araucans (Mapuche) lived in central and southern Chile.
The Mapuche people were also one of the last independent American indigenous groups which were not completely integrated into the Spanish-speaking regime until after Chile became independent.
Although Chile declared its independence in 1810 (mid Napoleonic Wars which left Spain without a functioning central government for a few years), they did not achieve the decisive victory over the Spaniards until 1818.
The Dominican Republic (Spanish: República Dominicana) is a country in the Caribbean located on the eastern half of the island of Hispaniola, which it shares with Haiti.
In addition to white sandy beaches and mountain landscapes, the country is home to the oldest European city in America, which is now part of Santo Domingo.
The island was first inhabited by the Taínos and Caribes people. The Caribbean was an Arawakan-speaking people who had arrived about 10,000 BC.
Within a few years of the arrival of European explorers, the population of Tainos had been significantly reduced by the Spanish conquerors
Based on Fray Bartolomé de las Casas (Tratado de las Indias), the Spanish conquerors killed about 100,000 taínos between 1492 and 1498.
Jardín de la Unión. This area was built as an atrium for a 17th century monastery, where Templo de San Diego is the only surviving building.
It now acts as the central square, and there is always a lot, day and night.
There are several restaurants that surround the garden, and in the afternoon and evening, free concerts from the central garden pavilion are often given.
Callejon del Beso (Kysset's Gyde). Two balconies, separated exclusively by 69 cm, are home to a historical love legend.
Some kids will tell you the story for a few pennies.
Bowen Island is a popular destination for day trips or weekend excursions, featuring kayaking, hiking, shops, restaurants and more.
This authentic community is located in Howe Sound just outside Vancouver, and there is easy access via planned water taxis that depart from Granville Island in the centre of Vancouver.
For those who like outdoor activities, a trip up the Sea to Sky corridor is essential.
Whistler (1.5 hour drive from Vancouver) is expensive, but known because of the winter Olympics in 2010.
In winter you can try some of the best skiing in North America, and in summer you can try something authentic mountain biking.
Permissions must be reserved in advance. You need a permit to stay overnight in Sirena.
Sirena is the only ranger station which offers accommodation in dormitories as well as hot meals in addition to camping. La Leona, San Pedro and Los Patos offer only camping and no food.
Park permits are available at the ranger station in Puerto Jiménez, but they do not receive credit cards.
Parking services (MINAE) do not issue park permits more than one month before expected arrival.
CafeNet El Sol offers a reservation service of 30$ or 10$ for a one-day pass; more details can be seen on their Corcovado page.
The Cook Islands are an island island in free association with New Zealand, the islands are located in Polynesia, in the middle of the South Pacific.
It is an archipelago with 15 islands spread over 2.2 million km2 sea.
Since they are in the same time zone as Hawaii, the islands are sometimes thought of as "Hawaii below."
Although smaller, they remind some older visitors of Hawaii before it became a state, without all the major tourist hotels and other developments.
The Cook Islands do not have any cities, but are composed of 15 different islands. The main islands are Rarotonga and Aitutaki.
In today's developed countries, offering luxury beds and breakfast has been raised to some kind of art form.
Of course, at the top end Bed & Breakfasts competes mainly in two areas: sleeping conditions and breakfast.
Therefore, you can often find the most luxurious linens, perhaps a handmade quilted blanket or an antique bed in the finest such establishments.
Breakfast may include seasonal delicacies from the region or the host's specialty.
The place can be an old, historic building with antique furniture, a well-kept property and a swimming pool.
Getting in your own car and going on a long drive is in itself an appealing idea because it is so simple.
Unlike larger vehicles, you probably already know how to drive your car and you know its limitations.
Setting up a tent on private properties or in a city of any size can easily attract unwanted attention.
In short, the use of your car is a good way to take a road trip, but rarely in itself a form of camping.
Carcamping is possible if you have a large minivan, SUV, sedan or station wagon with seats that can be laid down.
Some hotels have a legacy from the golden age of steam railways and ocean ships: before World War II, in the 19th or early 20th century.
These hotels were where the rich and famous from that time lived, and often had fine dining places and nightlife.
The old-fashioned fittings, the lack of the latest facilities and a certain graceful aging are also part of their character.
Although they are usually privately owned, sometimes visiting Heads of State and other senior officials are accommodated.
A traveler with plenty of money may consider flying around the world and dividing the trip with stays at many of these hotels.
A network for the exchange of hospitality is an organisation that connects travelers and local residents of the cities they are going to visit.
Signing up for such a network usually only requires filling in an online form, even if some networks offer or require further confirmation.
A list of available hosts is then provided, either in print and/or online, sometimes with references and reviews from other travellers.
Couchsurfing was founded in January 2004, after the computer programmer Casey Fenton found a cheap flight to Iceland but needed a place to stay.
He sent e-mails to the students at the local university and received an overwhelming number of offers for a free place to stay.
Hostels are primarily aimed at young people - a typical guest is in his twenties - but often you can also find older travelers there.
Families with children are a rare sight, but some hostels allow them in private rooms.
The city of Beijing in China will be host to the Winter Olympics in 2022, which will make the city the first city to host both the summer and winter Olympics.
Beijing will host the opening and closing ceremonies as well as the indoor events on ice.
Other ski events will take place at the Taizicheng ski area in Zhangjiakou, about 220 km (140 miles) from Beijing.
Most of the temples have a festival once in the year, which takes place from late November to mid May. The festival varies according to the temple's annual calendar.
The temple festivals are often celebrated when the temple has an anniversary, when the presiding god has a birthday or in the case of other major events associated with the temple.
It is very interesting to see Kerala's temple festivals with their regular parade of decorated elephants, templelorches and other festivities.
A world exhibition (often called World Exposition or Expo) is a major international festival for art and science.
The participating countries present both artistic and educational exhibitions in their national pavilions to show the country's view of world problems or to show the country's culture and history.
International exhibitions on gardening are specialized events that showcase floral setups, botanical gardens and everything else that has to do with plants.
Although in theory they can take place annually (as long as they are in different countries), they do not do so in practice.
These events usually last between three and six months and are held in places which are at least 50 hectares large.
Over the years, many different film formats have been used. Standard 35 mm film (36 x 24 mm negative) is clearly the most common.
It can usually be replenished fairly easily if you run out and provides resolution that is roughly comparable to a current DSLR.
Some medium format film cameras use a format of 6 x 6 cm, more precisely a 56 x 56 mm negative format.
This gives a solution almost four times greater than a 35 mm negative (3136 mm2 versus 864).
Animal life is among the most challenging motifs for a photographer and requires a combination of good luck, patience, experience and good equipment.
Nature photography is often taken for granted, but like photography at all, a picture is worth a thousand words.
Nature photography often requires a long tele lens, but other lenses are needed for things such as a bunch of birds, or tiny creatures.
Many exotic animals are hard to find, and parks sometimes have rules as to whether to take pictures for commercial use.
Wild animals can be either shy or aggressive. The environment can be cold, warm or hostile in another way.
The world has over 5,000 different languages, with more than twenty of them having 50 million or more speakers.
Writing words are often also easier to understand than the spoken words. This is especially true for addresses that are often difficult to pronounce in an understandable way.
The people of many countries speak fluent English, and in even more countries a certain knowledge can be expected - especially among younger people.
Imagine people from Manchester, Boston, Jamaica and Sydney sitting around a table and having dinner together at a restaurant in Toronto.
They entertain each other with stories from their hometowns told with their local accents and special jargon.
The cheapest way to get food is usually to buy food at the supermarket. Without the possibility to cook food, however, the choice is limited to ready-made dishes.
Supermarkets are increasingly given a more varied range of ready-made food. Some even offer a microwave or the like where the food can be heated.
In some countries or types of shops there is at least one on-site restaurant, which is often quite informal and at affordable prices.
Make copies of your policy and your insurance company's contact details and make sure you have them with you.
They must show the insurance company's e-mail address and international telephone numbers for advice/authorisations and to notify cases.
Make sure to have an additional copy in your luggage and online (sent as attachment in an email to yourself or stored in "the cloud").
If you are travelling with a laptop or tablet, you can store a copy in memory or on disk (available without internet).
Also give copies of the policy/contact information to fellow travellers as well as family or friends at home who are willing to help.
Moose (also known as moose) is not as such aggressive, but they defend themselves if they experience a threat.
When people don't see moose as potentially dangerous, they can risk getting too close and putting themselves in danger.
Drink alcoholic beverages in moderation. Alcohol affects everyone in different ways and it is important to know your limit.
Possible long-term health effects from excessive drinking can include liver injury and even blindness or death. The risk increases if you consume illegally produced alcohol.
Illegal spirits may contain various dangerous impurities, including methanol, which can cause blindness or death even in small amounts.
Glasses can be cheaper abroad, especially in low-income countries where wages are lower.
Consider having an examination of the eyes in your own home, especially if the insurance covers it, and bring the prescription so that it can be filed elsewhere.
The exclusive frame from recognized brands found in such areas may have two problems; some may be cheap copies, and the genuine imported goods may be more expensive than at home.
Coffee is one of the world's most traded goods, and you can probably find many types in your homeland.
Nevertheless, there are many distinctive ways to drink coffee around the world that are worth experiencing.
Canyoning (or: canyoning) consists of walking at the bottom of a canyon that is either dry or full of water.
Canyoning combines elements of swimming, climbing and jumping - but it requires relatively little training or physical form to get started (compared with e.g. mountain climbing, diving or alpine skiing).
Walking is an outdoor activity that consists of walking in natural surroundings, often on hiking trails.
Daily walks involve distances from less than a mile up to longer routes that can be managed in a single day.
With a day walk on an easy route, there is no need for much preparation, and anyone who is in fairly good shape can enjoy the trip.
Families with young children may need more preparation, but one day outdoors is a good experience even with babies and kindergarten children.
Internationally, there are nearly 200 touring organizations, most of which are independent.
The successor of Global Running Tours, Go Running Tours, networks with up to several sightrunners spread across four continents.
With roots in "Barcelonas Running Tours Barcelona" and Copenhagen's "Running Copenhagen" "Running Tours Prague" ended, based in Prague, and others quickly joined them.
There are many things you need to consider before and when you go somewhere.
When you travel, you should expect that things are not as they are "at home." Manners, laws and rules, food, traffic, settlements, standards, languages and so on will to some extent be different from where you live.
This is something that you must always remember to avoid disappointments or perhaps even negativity over the locals' ways of doing things.
Travel agencies have existed since the 19th century. A travel agent is usually a good way to find a journey that extends beyond a traveller's previous experience with nature, culture, language or low-income countries.
Although most agencies are willing to accept most regular reservations, many agents specialize in specific travel types, price ranges or destinations.
It may be better to use an agent who regularly book similar trips to you.
Look at the tours the agency offers either on their website or in their store window.
If you want to see the world cheaply either of necessity, as a lifestyle or as a challenge, there are different ways to do so.
Overall, they fall into two categories: work while travelling or trying to limit your expenses. This article deals with the latter.
Those who are willing to sacrifice comfort, time and predictability to push spending down to almost zero can see under minimum budget travel.
The information is based on the fact that travellers do not steal, break in, participate in the illegal market, beg or otherwise exploit other people for their own benefit.
An immigration check is usually the first stop when you leave a plane, a ship or any other means of transport.
In some trains crossing national borders, inspections are carried out on the train and you should have valid ID with you when you board one of these trains.
On night trains with overnight accommodation, the conductor can collect passports so you don't have to be interrupted in your sleep.
Registration is an additional requirement in connection with the visa application. In some countries, you must register your place of residence, as well as the address at which you live, with the local authorities.
This may require you to fill out a form with the local police or visit the immigration offices.
In many countries with such a law, the local hotels handle the registration (make sure to ask).
In other cases, only those staying outside tourist accommodation should be registered.
Architecture is about the design and construction of buildings. A building's architecture is often a sight in itself.
Many buildings are beautiful to look at, and the view from a tall building or from a well-placed window can be a snare to the soul.
Architecture has much in common with other areas such as urban planning, civil engineering, decoration and landscape design.
Because many of the pueblos are so remote, you will not find any significant nightlife unless you travel to Albuquerque or Santa Fe.
However, drinks are served in almost all the casinos listed above, and several of them fetch famous entertainers (mainly the large ones located around Albuquerque and Santa Fe).
Beware: here the town's small bars are not always good places to hang out for visitors from other states.
First, northern New Mexico has major problems with drunk driving, and the concentration of drunk drivers is high close to bars in small towns.
Unwanted murals or drawings are known as graffiti.
Although it is far from a modern phenomenon, most people probably associate it with young people vandalizing public as well as private property with spray paint.
Nowadays, however, there are famous graffiti artists, graffiti events and "legal" walls. Graffiti paintings in this context often resemble works of art rather than unreadable tags.
Throwing with Boomerang is a popular ability that many tourists want to learn.
If you want to learn how to throw with a boomerang that comes back to you, make sure you have a boomerang that is suitable for the purpose.
Most of the boomerangs you can get in Australia are actually non-recurring. It is best for beginners not to try to throw in windstorms.
Hangi meals are prepared in a hot hole in the ground.
The hole is either heated with hot stones from a fire, and in some places geothermal heat will make soil areas naturally warm.
The hangi is often used to cook a traditional fried dinner.
Several places in Rotorua offer geothermal hangi, while other hangi can be tasted in Christchurch, Wellington and elsewhere.
MetroRail has two classes on commuter trains in and around Cape Town: MetroPlus (also called First Class) and Metro (called Third Class).
MetroPlus is more comfortable and less crowded, but a little more expensive - though still cheaper than the normal metro tickets in Europe.
All trains have both MetroPlus and Metro wagons; MetroPlus wagons are always in the rear part of the train closest to Cape Town.
Carry the luggage of others - Never let your bags out of your sight, especially when crossing international borders.
You can experience yourself being used as a drug carrier without your knowledge, which will cause a lot of trouble for you.
This includes standing in line, as drug dogs can come into use at any time without notice.
Some countries have very severe penalties, even for first-time crimes, such as prison sentences of over 10 years or the death penalty.
Abandoned bags are a target for thieves, and can also attract the attention of authorities on guard against bomb threats.
At home, this constant exposure to local bacteria means that you are probably already immune to them.
But in other parts of the world where the bacteriological fauna is new to you, you are much more likely to run into problems.
In warmer climates, bacteria also grow faster and survive longer outside the body.
From there come the plagues of Delhi, the curse of Pharaoh, Montezuma's revenge and their many friends.
As with breathing problems in colder climates, it is quite common to have intestinal problems in warm climates. In most cases they are extremely irritating but not really dangerous.
If you travel to a developing country for the first time - or to a new part of the world - do not underestimate the potential cultural shock.
Many stable and experienced travelers have been overwhelmed by the new development of world travel, where many small cultural adjustments can quickly become overwhelming.
Especially in your first days, you should consider not to hold back spending money on hotels, food and service in Western style and quality to help you fall to.
Do not sleep on a mattress or pillow on the ground in areas where you do not know about local wildlife.
If you want to camp, you should bring a camp bed or hammock to keep snakes, scorpions and so on away.
Fill your home with a tasteful coffee in the morning as well as relaxing chamomile tea in the evening.
When you are on a staycation, you have time to pamper yourself and spend a few extra minutes brewing something special.
If you feel more adventurous, you can seize the opportunity to make some smoothies:
Maybe you will find a simple drink that you can make for your breakfast when you return to your daily routine.
If you live in a city with a varied drinking culture, you can go to bars or pubs in neighborhoods you don't normally visit.
For those who do not know medical jargon, the words contagious and infectious have different meanings.
An infectious disease is caused by a pathogen such as a virus, bacterium, fungus or other parasites.
An infectious disease is a disease that is easily transmitted to other people who are near an infected person.
Many states require that visitors entering the country, or residents leaving the country, should be vaccinated against a number of diseases.
These requirements may often depend on which countries a traveler has visited or plans to visit.
One of the forces of Charlotte, North Carolina, is that the city has plenty of high quality offers for families.
Residents from other areas often mention good conditions for families with children as a primary reason for moving there, and visitors find that the city is easy to enjoy with children.
In the last 20 years, the number of child-friendly opportunities in Charlotte's catchment area has grown exponentially.
Taxis are generally not used by families in Charlotte, although they may be quite practical in certain situations.
There is a surcharge to have more than 2 passengers so that this possibility can become more expensive than it is necessary.
Antarctica is the coldest place on earth and surrounds the South Pole.
Tourist visits are expensive, require good physical fitness, can only take place during the summer months nov-feb, and are vastly limited to the peninsula, the islands and the Ross Sea.
A few thousand employees live here in the summer in about 50 bases mainly in these areas; a small number will be winter over.
Inner Antarctica is a desert plateau covered with 2-3 km of ice.
Sometimes there are special air trips into the country to climb mountains or to reach the South Pole, which has a large base.
The South Pole route is a 1,600 km long path from the McMurdo station at the Ross Sea to the pole.
It is compressed snow with cracks that are filled and marked with flags. The only thing that can move on it is specialised tractors that pull sleds with fuel and supplies.
These are not very easy, so the path must swing around the transantarctic mountains to look up on the plateau.
The most common cause of accidents in winter is slippery roads, road surface (walk) and especially stairs.
You will need at least footwear with suitable soles. Summer shoes are often very smooth on ice and snow, and some winter boots are even inadequate.
The pattern should be deep enough - 5 mm (1/5 inch) or more - and the material should remain soft in cold temperatures.
Some boots have buds, and there are extra buds for smooth conditions that can be put on most shoes and boots on either the heels or both the heels and sole.
The heels should be low and wide. Sand, gravel or salt (calcium chloride) are often spread on roads or paths, so that you can better stand firm.
Lavines are not abnormal; there is a limit to how much snow steep slopes can hold, so the excess amounts of snow will fall as avalanches.
The problem is that snow is sticky, so something is needed to calm it down; and when a bit of snow falls, may be the one that causes the rest to fall.
Sometimes it is the sun's warming of the snow that makes the impact, sometimes it is more snow or other natural events, and often it is a human being.
A tornado is a rotating column of air with very low pressure which sucks the surrounding air inwards and upwards.
They generate strong winds (often 100-200 miles/hour) and can lift heavy objects into the air and carry them around when the tornado moves.
They start as funnels coming down from storm clouds and become "tornadoes" when they touch the ground.
Providers of personal VPN (virtual private network) are an excellent way to bypass both political censorship and commercial IP geofiltration.
They are better than webproxys for several reasons: They redirect all internet traffic, not only http.
They usually offer higher bandwidth and better service quality. They are encrypted and are therefore also harder to spy against.
Media companies also regularly lie about the purpose of this, claiming that it is "preventing piracy. "
In fact, region codes have absolutely no effect on illegal copying: a bite-by-bit copy of a disk will play perfectly fine on any device where the original can be played.
The real aim is to give these companies more and better control over their markets; it is about making money.
Because calls are routed via the Internet, you don't need to use a telephone company where you live or where you travel.
Nor is there any requirement for you to obtain a local number from the local community where you live; you can obtain a satellite Internet connection in Chicken, Alaska, and choose a number that claims you live in the sunny Arizona.
For the most part, you need to purchase a global number separately, allowing PSTN phones to call you. The location of the number is important for people who call you.
Real-time text translation apps - applications that can automatically translate entire text parts from one language to another.
Some of the programs in this category can even translate texts in foreign languages on signs or other objects in the real world when the user points his smartphone towards these objects.
The translation machines have become much better, and now often provide more or less correct translations (and more rarely gibberish), but some care is needed as they may still have understood it completely wrong.
One of the most prominent apps in this category is Google Translate, which allows for offline translation when the preferred language data is downloaded.
GPS navigation apps on your smartphone can be the easiest and most convenient way to find your way around when you're not in your home country.
It can save money compared to buying new cards for a GPS, a separate GPS device or renting one from a car rental company.
If you do not have a data connection on your phone or when it is out of reach, its functionality may be limited or inaccessible.
Every kiosk is filled with a confusing selection of prepaid prepaid prepaid prepaid cards that can be used in payphones or regular phones.
Although most cards are good for calls everywhere, some are specialized in providing good call rates to particular country groups.
Access to these services is often via a toll-free telephone number, which can be dialed from most phones at no cost.
Rules regarding regular photography also apply to video recording, possibly even more.
If it is not allowed to take just a picture of something, you should not consider filming it at all.
If you are using a drone, you should check in advance what is allowed to film and what requires further permission.
Flying a drone close to an airport or above a crowd is almost always a bad idea, even if it is not illegal in your area.
Nowadays you rarely book flights directly with the airline, without first searching and comparing prices.
Sometimes the same flight may have very different prices from different providers, and it pays to compare results, as well as to examine the airline's own website before booking.
Although you may not need a visa for short visits as a tourist in certain countries, or for business visits, it often takes a longer stay there as a foreign student than to go there as a relaxed tourist.
Generally speaking, you must have a visa in advance if you are to stay in a foreign country for a longer period of time.
Study visas generally have different requirements and application procedures, in relation to normal tourist or business visas.
In most countries, you will need a letter of admission from the institution you wish to study with, as well as proof of the means to support yourself for at least the first year.
Contact the institution as well as the immigration authority in the country you wish to study in for detailed information about the requirements.
Unless you are a diplomat, work abroad usually means that you have to pay income tax in the country in which you are based.
Income tax is structured differently in different countries, and tax rates and classes vary greatly from one country to another.
In some federal countries, such as the United States and Canada, income tax is levied at both federal and local levels, so rates and tariffs may vary from one region to another.
Although immigration control does not normally take place or is merely a formality when you arrive in your home country, it can still be difficult to get through customs controls.
Make sure you know what you are allowed to do and what you are not allowed to bring and declare everything that is above legal limits.
The easiest way to get started with professional travel writing is to hone your skills on an established travel blog website.
Once you have become familiar with formatting and editing online, you can eventually create your own website.
Volunteering while travelling is a great way to make a difference, but it's not just about giving.
Living and volunteering in a foreign country is a great way to get to know another culture, meet new people, learn something about yourself, get a sense of perspective and even acquire new skills.
It may also be a good way of stretching a budget so that you can have a longer stay in a given place, as too many volunteer jobs are given board and lodging and for some also a small salary.
The Vikings used the Russian waterways to get to the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. Parts of these routes can still be used. Check if there is a need for special permits which may be difficult to obtain.
The connection between the White Sea and the Baltic Channel connects the Arctic Sea with the Baltic Sea via Lake Onegas Island, Lake Ladoga and Saint Petersburg, mostly via rivers and lakes.
Onegas Island is also connected to Volga, so you can still get through Russia from the Caspian Sea.
You can confidently trust that once you are in the marina everything will be pretty obvious. You will meet other boat hitches who will share their knowledge with you.
Basically, set up listings in which you offer your help, walk around the harbor, go up to people who clean their yachts, try to get in touch with sailors in the bar etc.
Try to talk to as many people as possible. After a little time, everyone will know you and give you tips on which boat is looking for someone.
You should choose your Frequent Flyer airline in an alliance with care.
Although you may think it makes the most sense to become a member of the airline you use most, you should be aware that membership benefits and point systems often vary and may be more advantageous with another airline in the same alliance.
Air carriers such as Emirates, Etihad Airways, Qatar Airways & Turkish Airlines have greatly expanded their services to Africa and they offer connections to many major African cities at more competitive prices than other European airlines.
From 2014 Turkish Airlines fly to 39 destinations in 30 African countries.
If you have longer time available, you can see how your total ticket price to Africa is in relation to a ticket for rounding the world.
Do not forget to add the extra costs of additional visas, departure fees, land transport, etc. for all areas outside Africa.
If you only want to fly around the world in the Southern Hemisphere, the range of aircraft is limited due to only few Transocean routes.
No association of airlines covers all three ocean crossings in the Southern Hemisphere (and SkyTeam does not cover any of them).
But the Star Alliance covers everything except the eastern part of the South Pacific from Santiago de Chile to Tahiti, which is a route operated by LATAM Oneworld.
This flight is not the only option if you want to skip the South Pacific and South America's west coast. (see below)
In 1994, the ethnic Armenian region of Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan declared war on Azerbaijan.
With Armenian support, a new republic was formed, yet no established nation - not even Armenia - officially recognises it.
Diplomatic differences around the region continue to exacerbate relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan.
The canal district (in Flemish: "Grachtengordel") is the well-known 17th-century district around Binnenstad in Amsterdam.
The entire district is designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its unique cultural and historical value, and its property values are among the highest throughout the country.
Cinque Terre, which means five countries, consists of the five small coastal villages of Riomaggiore, Manarola, Corniglia, Vernazza and Monterosso, located in the Italian region of Liguria.
They're on the UNESCO World Heritage List.
Throughout the centuries, people have carefully built terraces on the sturdy, steep landscape right up to the cliffs overlooking the sea.
Part of the charm is the lack of visible development. Paths, trains and boats connect the villages, and cars cannot get to the cities from outside.
The way French is spoken in Belgium and Switzerland is slightly different from in France, but they are similar enough to be mutually understandable.
In particular, the French-speaking Belgian and Swiss systems have some small peculiarities which are different from the French spoken in France, and the pronunciation of some words is slightly different.
Nevertheless, all French-speaking Belgians and Swiss would have learned standard French at school so that they would understand you even if you were using the common French numeral system.
In many parts of the world, waving a friendly gesture means "hello. "
However, in Malaysia, at least among the Malaysian population in rural areas, it means "come here," like the index finger bent to the body, which is a gesture used in certain Western countries, and the gesture should only be used for that purpose.
In the same way, a British tourist in Spain may misunderstand a farewell tip with the palm directed at the person who waves (instead of the person waved to) as a sign that they must come back.
Auxiliary languages are artificial or constructed languages designed to facilitate communication between persons who would otherwise have difficulty communicating.
They are different from lingua francas, which are natural or organic languages, which for one reason or another become dominant as a means of communication between people who speak other languages.
During the warmest time of the day, travelers may experience the fatamorgana, which forms an illusion of water (or other things).
These can be dangerous if the traveller pursues the illusion and spills precious energy and his remaining water.
Even the warmest deserts can become extremely cold at night. There is a real risk of hypothermia without warm clothes.
Especially in summer, watch out for mosquitoes if you decide to wander through the rain forest.
Even if you're driving through the subtropical rainforest, it's enough that your doors are open for a few seconds while you get in the car to get mosquitoes into the car with you.
Avian influenza, more formally known as avian influenza, may infect both birds and mammals.
Less than a thousand cases have ever been reported in humans, but some of them have been fatal.
Most people have affected people working with poultry, but there is also a certain risk for birdwatchers.
The steep fjords and valleys that suddenly give way too high and, more or less, even plateaus are typical in Norway.
These plateaus are often referred to as "wideness," meaning a wide, open, woodless place, a boundless extension.
In Rogaland and Agder they are usually called "hei," which means a woodless heath landscape that is often covered with heather.
The glaciers are not stable, but flowing down the mountain. This causes cracks and cracks, which can be well hidden by snow bridges.
The walls and roofs of the ice cave can collapse, and cracks can close.
At glacier edges large blocks rip loose, fall down and may jump or roll further away from the edge.
Tourist season for mountain towns is generally highest during the Indian summer.
However, they have a different kind of beauty and charm in winter, where many mountain towns get plenty of snow and offer activities such as skiing and snowboarding.
Few airlines are still offering family prices, which provide small discounts on last-minute journeys in connection with deaths.
Airlines offering these include Air Canada, Delta Air Lines, Lufthansa for flights from the United States or Canada, as well as WestJet.
In any case, you have to book directly directly with the airline.
