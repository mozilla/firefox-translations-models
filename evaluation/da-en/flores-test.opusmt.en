This not only confirms that there were at least some dinosaurs that had feathers, a theory that is already widespread, it also provides details that fossils generally cannot, such as the color and the three-dimensional arrangement.
Researchers say that this animal's plumage was chestnut brown at the top with a light or carrot-coloured underside.
The find also provides insight into the development of feathers in birds.
Because the dinosaur feathers do not have a well - developed shaft, called a feather handle, but have other characteristics from feathers - rays and bee rays - the researchers derived that feather shaft was probably a later evolutionary development than these other characteristics.
The structure of the remote suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or for decoration. The researchers believed that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows an adult plumage and not a chicken's down.
Scientists believe that the sample from the tail of the young dinosaur shows an adult individual's plumage and not a chicken's down.

The effect the team was looking for would be the result of tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon exerts a trait on the ground and causes tides, so does the Milky Way exert a force on the galaxy SagDEG.
Researchers could conclude that the dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter does.
This theory says that most dark matter around a galaxy is found around the galaxy in a kind of ring and consists of lots of small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered the extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
He said in an interview that the new variant was "very worrying and that there was cause for alarm due to its very high mortality."
Some patients may have taken the virus to the hospital, Dr. Moll believes, and at least two were hospital health care professionals.

In France, voting has traditionally been low-tech: the voters isolate themselves in a box and put a pre-printed piece of paper indicating their choice of candidate in an envelope.
Once officials have verified the identity of the electorate, the voter puts the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voting list.
The procedure has been codified very precisely in the French electoral law.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been transparent so that voters and observers can see that the urns do not contain ballot papers at the start of the vote and that no ballot papers other than those correctly counted and from approved voters are added.
Candidates can send representatives as witnesses to all parts of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision and according to specific procedures.

Her first was slalom, where she did not finish her first race. 36 of the 116 participants got the same result in the race.
In her second race, which was greatslalom, she ended in tenth place in the women's sitting group with a total duration of 4:41.30. 2:11.60 minutes slower than the woman in first place, Austrian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary, which ended in ninth place.
Four skiers in the women's group for seated riders did not complete the race, and 45 out of a total of 117 skiers in large slalom did not rank in the race.
Madhya Pradesh police found the stolen laptop and cell phone.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said: "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman, and we have found her cell phone and laptop."
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki told us that the defendants met in court with their faces covered.
Even though there were three people in the house when the car hit it, none of them got hurt.
However, the driver suffered severe head injuries.
The road in which the accident occurred was temporarily closed, while the rescue services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been accused in Edinburgh Sheriff Court of murdering her son.
She is in custody waiting to be prosecuted and brought to trial, but evidence from eyewitnesses may be flawed because her image has been widely published.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish courts operate differently and courts have considered the publication of images potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee comments that "it seems that journalists should be careful if they publish images of suspects and others."
The Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for prosecution, has indicated to journalists that no further comments will be made, at least until the indictment is available.
According to the leak, the document will refer to the border conflict that Palestine wants based on the borders of before the six-day war in 1967.
Other subjects covered reportedly include Jerusalem's future condition, which is sacred to both countries, as well as the problems surrounding the Jordan Valley.
Israel requires a constant military presence in the valley for ten years when an agreement has been signed, while the palistinean authorities only agree to leave the valley for five years.
Shooters in the additional pest control study were to be closely monitored by park officers as the experiment was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In a partnership between NPWS and Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association hunting programme.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of nature conservation and cultural heritage in NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive safety and training instructions.
A new Provisional Election Council (CEP) of nine members was sworn in yesterday by Martelly.
That's Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the resignation of the former CEP was recommended by a presidential commission as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
Martelly's response to the extensive anti-rule protests which began in October was the commission.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the lack of elections, some of them had not been held since 2011.
In approximately 60 reported cases, faulty iPods have been overheated, causing a total of six fires and giving four people less burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economics, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that they had been aware of 27 accidents involving the units.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of another 34 cases of overheating that the company called "non-serious."
The Ministry replied by calling Apple's postponement of the report "falsely regrettable."
The earthquake hit Mariana at 07:19 local time (09:19 GMT Friday).
The Northmarians emergency office announced that no damage was reported in the nation.
Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former Philippine policeman has taken tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 on the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, and at least six have been confirmed as dead so far.
Six hostages including children and the elderly were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took an older lady's place when she had to go to the bathroom. Mendoza was shot down.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and started a career in medicine.
He took an education as an obstetriker and began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While he was working at the hospital, Liggins began researching early births in his spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone were given, it would speed up the development of the baby's lungs in the fetal stage.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two "black box" aircraft recorders on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also hailed Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the first queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna died on the night with two moons. Quite unique, like herself. Strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as wild as me... maybe even more... love her and will miss her... hopefully she's in a better place now."
Out of 1,400 people polled prior to the federal elections in 2010, the number of those who are against Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Constitutional Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the campaign for the federal election in 2010 that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those in the study share this view and want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
In the various extremes of the vote, 29 percent of those polled believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic Gold Medal winner was to swim in the style of 100 m and 200 m free and in three batons at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints there has been doubt about his condition.
He could not take the medication necessary to combat his pain as these are prohibited during the games.
Curtis Cooper, mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered on January 25 the largest known prime figure to date.
Several people confirmed this discovery at the beginning of February using different hardware and software, and Tuesday it was announced.
comets may have been a source of water on earth together with organic material that can produce proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets are shaped, and especially how the Earth was shaped since comets collided with Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, became governor earlier this year and signed last month a bill that legalized marriage for people of the same sex.
He referred to the rumors as "political talk and foolishness. "
One wonders if he's running for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, allows aircraft to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel per year and reduce CO2 emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, unlike older technology based on ground radar, to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No extra transportation is put in and the trains above ground will not stop in Wembley, and car parking and park-and-ride options will not be available on the ground.
Fear of lack of transport raised the possibility that one would be forced to play the game behind closed doors without the team fans.
A study published on Thursday in Science magazine reported on the formation of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galápago lakes.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the new species was developed in just two generations, although it had been thought that this process should have taken much longer due to mating between the endemic Darwin-finch geospiza fortis and the invasive cactus finch geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be processed into all kinds of shapes. It can be rolled into very small shapes.
It can be pulled out to a thin cable that can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into plates.
It can be made very thin and put on other metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate the hand painted images in books, which were called "lit manuscripts."
This is called the pH value of a chemical. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes colour depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The PH value is given at the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the tested chemical.
Brintions are protons that have had their electrons removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Shake the two dry powders together and then squeeze them together into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers that will feel strange and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flushing toilet connected to a sophisticated sewage system in almost every house,
Remains of sewage systems have been found in the houses of the minoic cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women stayed together in mixed company.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in the room receives the call and reflects it down again almost immediately.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
Putting a satellite or telescope in space requires a giant rocket that is over 100 feet high.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The biggest thing that the wheel has done for us is that it has given us much easier and faster transport methods.
It has given us the train, the car and many other means of transport.
Under them there are several medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey that range from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, many small cats (including loose domestic cats) eat the far more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is a concept of niche, a special task each cat has that keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats and live in large groups called flocks.
The flocks consist of one to three related adult males as well as up to thirty females and cubs.
Females are usually closely related and are a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion flocks react much like wolves or dogs in flocks, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other large cats) in behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
The tiger is a good athlete who can climb (but not well), swim, jump long and pull with five times the strength of a strong person.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones who can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the loud roar of a lion, but sounds more like a phrase of snarling, shouting words.
Ozelots prefer small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they have the opportunity. Almost all the animals that the ozelotte hunts are much smaller than it itself.
Researchers believe that ozelotters follow and find animals to eat (exchange) by smells, by sniffing themselves to where they have been on the ground.
They can see very well in the darkness with night vision, and they also move very quietly around. Ozelots hunt their prey by walking in one with their surroundings and then throw themselves over their prey.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) are separated from the main population from which they came (as if they move over a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily move back), they will often find themselves in a different environment than they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population has to have other functions or adjustments in order to be a stronger competitor than had previously been necessary.
The original population has not changed at all; it still needs the same adjustments as before.
Over time, while the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, they start to look less and less like the rest of the population.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process species formation, which simply means the formation of new species. Species are an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants make oxygen that humans inhale and they absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e. exhale).
Plants cook their food from the sun by photosynthesis. They also give shade.
We make our houses of plants and make clothes of plants. Most food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
Mosasaurus was the top of the food chain in its time, so it feared nothing but other Mosasaurs.
Its long jaws had more than 70 sharp teeth and an extra set at the top of its mouth, meaning that there was no escape route for anything that crossed its path.
We do not know for sure, but it may have had a split tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked everything that came in the water. Even a giant dinosaur like a T. rex couldn't do anything against it.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans ate a number of strange or unusual things, including wild boars, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called a Dormouse.
Another difference was that while the poor and the women ate their food while sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to have large feasts together, where they lay on the side while eating.
Old Roman meals could not have contained food that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had neither corn, nor tomatoes, nor potatoes, nor cocoa, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built each of their gods a primary temple, which was considered to be the home of the god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and an inner sanctuary, into which only the priests could enter.
Sometimes pyramid - shaped towers, called ziggurates, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
The Hebrew family lived most of their lives outdoors.
Women cooked the food in the yard; the shops were just open disks facing the street. Stones were used to build houses.
There were no large forests in Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland lived with few people. In the Nordic sagas it is said that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and when he travelled further west he found Greenland and called it Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, there were already Inuit tribes living in the area at that time.
Although each country was "Scandinavian," there were many differences between the people, kings, customs and history in Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true: even though something is written in the back of the document, it is not a tax card.
Written on the back of the American Declaration of Independence stood the words "Original Declaration of Independence, dated 4 July 1776." The text appears at the bottom of the document when it is turned upside down.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in its lifetime the large parchment document (it measures 291⁄4 inch x 241⁄2 inch) was rolled up for storage.
So it is likely that the remark was simply appended as an addition.
The D-Day landings and the subsequent battles had freed northern France, but the southern part was still not free.
It was ruled by the French Vichy government - there are Frenchmen who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with them instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, Allied troops invaded southern France; the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon."
In just two weeks, the Americans and the free French forces had freed southern France and were focusing on Germany.
A civilization is a single culture divided by a larger, significant group of people living together and cooperating, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, and is related to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city state; and it also somehow defines the size of society.
City states are the runners of nations. A civilisation culture involves the transmission of knowledge across generations, long-term cultural influences and fair communication.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not recognised as real civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states first formed a weak government government with Congress as the only component of the Confederal Articles.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and because there was no national executive or judiciary, they were dependent on the state authorities, who often were not cooperative in enforcing all actions.
It also had no right to override tax laws and tariffs between States.
The articles demanded the unanimous agreement of all the States before they could be amended, and the States took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
Italy's national football team, together with Germany's national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and became FIFA World Champion in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, hockey, roller skating hockey and F1 motorsport.
Winter sports are most popular in northern regions, with Italians competing in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often described, from a geographical point of view, as an "island group"
Taiwan's history begins back in the 15th century when European sailors on their way past the island named it Ilha Formosa or the beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, which started a change in original grain production practices, and employed Chinese workers to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683 the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) takes control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal areas and declares in 1885 Taiwan as a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895 after a defeat in the 1st Chinese-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Peace in the Shimonoseki Treaty, with which it renounced sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which rules over the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures: Intihuatana, the temple of the sun and the temple of the three windows.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976 thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the excavations continue to this day.
For example, the most common photography format in the world for still images is 35 mm, which was the most widely used film size at the end of the era of analogue films.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been inherited by sensor formats in digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is actually, which can seem confusing, 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format is therefore 3:2 (revised by twelve to achieve the simplest integer ratio).
Many common formats (e.g. APS formats) are equal to or close to this image format.
The much abused and often ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism and at the same time keeps a certain order in an image.
It says that the most effective place for the main motif is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period in Europe's history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and influential, was considered.
For over a thousand years, Christian religion bound European countries together in spite of different languages and customs.
Its all-encompassing power affected everyone from king to ordinary citizens.
One of the most important Christian dogmas is that prosperity should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's financial resources are specifically used for this purpose.
The central authority of the Church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money caused many to question whether this dogma was properly lived up to.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain launched a blockade at sea against Germany.
The strategy proved to be effective and prevented important military and civilian supplies from reaching.
Britain laid mines in international waters to prevent ships entering entire sections of the sea, which was a danger even for neutral ships.
Since there was limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to the country's unlimited submarine war.
During the 1920s, most citizens and nations' opinions fell against pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884 Tesla moved to the United States to work at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents on him, a collection of poems and a written recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his boss from his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China different periods of time were shown in a unique way; every Chinese time period or family in power was a separate dynasty.
In addition, between each dynasty there was an unstable period of divided provinces. The most known of these periods was the epoch of three kingdoms, which lasted for 60 years between Han and the Jin Dynasty.
During these periods there was fierce war between many noblemen who fought for the throne.
The period of the Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died in the struggle to sit in the highest seat in the great palace of Xi'an.
There are a lot of social and political effects, such as the use of the meter system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not one ruler.
Even after the revolution, the professions were open to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to do well.
The same applies to the military, for instead of class-based ranking in the army, ranking was now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working class people from other countries to start their own internal revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in relationships beyond worldly life. He used to visit a cave that became known as "Hira" on the mountain "Noor" (light) to immerse himself in his thoughts.
The cave itself, which has survived through time, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca and completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find at all, even if you know it exists. When you are inside the cave, it is a total isolation.
Only the clear beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains can be seen. Very little of the outside world can be seen or heard from within the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders still standing today.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E. and is one of many large pyramid structures built in honor of the dead Pharaohs.
The Giza plateau, or "Giza-necropolis" in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, contains several pyramids (of which the world-famous Great Pyramid is the largest of them all), several small tombs, several temples and the great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was created to honor the Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The "up-bow" mark looks like a V and the "down-bow mark" looks like a staple, or a square missing its lower side.
Up means that you should start at the tip and push the bow, and down means that you should start at the frog (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
Strokes usually produce a softer sound, while strokes sound stronger and more powerful.
You can always insert your own markings, but remember that the inscribed arc markings are determined for musical reasons, which is why they should usually be respected.
The terrified King Louis-Charles 16, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11 years old Marie Therese and four years old Louis-Charles) and the King's sister, Mrs Elizabeth, were forced back to Paris from Versailles on 6 October 1789 by a bunch of market women.
They traveled back to Paris in a cart surrounded by a screaming group of people who shouted threats to the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and the queen to keep the windows in their carriage completely open.
At one point a member of the mob showed the head from a royal guard who was killed at Versailles to the frightened queen.
The war costs of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Philippine people themselves.
The Philippines had to pay taxes to the American colonial power to raise money for most expenses, and bond yields ran through the banks on Wall Street in the name of the government.
Of course, the super-profits from the long-term exploitation of the Philippine people would constitute the fundamental gains of American imperialism.
In order to understand the Knights Templar, we need to understand the context behind the formation of the Order.
The time period during which these events took place is commonly known as the High Middle Ages, the part of Europe's history that took place in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000°1300 AD).
The Middle Ages preceded the early Middle Ages, which was followed by the late Middle Ages, which by convention ends about 1500 C.E.
Technological determinism is an expression which includes a wide range of ideas in practice from technology as a driving force or technological necessity, to a narrow idea that the fate of man is driven by an underlying logic which is linked to scientific laws and the way they translate into technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a route largely outside cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has an "influence" on societies that are hereditary and not socially dependent.
For example, it can be said that the motor vehicle necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for just a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
When many own cars, there are also more accidents on the roads, leading to inventions of new health techniques to heal body damage.
Romanticism contained a major element of cultural determinism, taken from authors such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In connection with Romanticism it was geography that formed the individual, and over time customs and cultures that were related to geography arose, and these were in harmony with the location of society and were therefore better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris today is known as the capital of maturity in the modern world, Constantinople was regarded as the capital of fashion in feudal Europe.
It is known to be an epicenter of luxury since about 400 AD and lasted until about 1,100 AD.
Its status fell in the twelfth century, mainly because crusaders had returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which had a greater value than the Byzantine markets could offer.
It was at that time that the title of fashion capital passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style was most common in the period between the 10th-11th century and the 14th century.
At first, clothing was greatly inspired by the Byzantine culture in the East.
However, as a result of the slow communication channels, the Western styles could lag behind by 25-30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments of the time as a result of the Crusades was that people started using buttons to put clothes on.
Subsistence farming is agriculture carried out to produce sufficient food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence farming is a simple and often organic system that uses stored seeds native to the ecoregion, in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques, to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers have been engaged in subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel overlooked by social standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be characteristic due to age, ethnic background, social class, location, and/or gender of members.
The qualities that govern a subculture as being distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a combination of several factors.
People who belong to a subculture often signal their affiliation through a clear and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, manners and slang.
One of the most common ways to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw on the few unhappy cases where children through failure, accident or wilful neglect have not been socialized by adults in their childhood.
Such children are called "wild" or wild. Some wild children have been detained by people (most often their own parents); in some cases this child failure was caused by the parents' rejection of a child's serious intellectual or physical impairments.
Wild children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before leaving or running away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in nature on their own.
When brought up by non-human animals, the wild child exhibits behavior (within physical boundaries) that is almost the same with the animal that has cared for the child, such as its fear or lack of interest in humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but a support for people who need to learn new things - such as using a new computer program or starting a project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real, in other words a teacher is a kind of scaffolding, but so is the small paper clip-man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is internalized in the software, and aims to question, ask and explain procedures that may have been too challenging for the student to handle alone.
Children come into foster families for a wide range of reasons ranging from neglect to abuse and even blackmail.
No child should grow up in an environment without nourishment, care and education, but they do.
We see the system for foster families as a safety zone for these children.
Our foster family system must provide safe homes, loving carers, stable education and reliable healthcare.
A foster family has the task of providing all necessities which were not in the home from which they were removed.
The Internet combines mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of use and satisfaction approach.
For example, it is proposed that "learning" and "socialisation" are important motives for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "perpetual relationships" were also identified as new motivation factors by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they examined the audience's reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in understanding microexpressions, which are facial movements that last few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can identify whether a person is lying by interpreting micro-expressions correctly.
In his article The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks indicated how people who are unable to understand speech due to a brain damage are nevertheless able to assess sincerity with great accuracy.
He even believes that such ability to interpret human behavior can also be found in pets such as dogs.
Research from the twentieth century has shown that there are two different pools of genetic variation: the invisible and the visible.
New genetic variation is added via mutation, and it is removed from the pool of exact variations via selection."
Separation and recombination mixes the variation back and forth between the two pools with each generation.
Out on the savannah it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system such as man to satisfy his need for amino acids from available plant sources.
In addition, there are serious consequences of non-compliance: reduced growth, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The easiest available plant resources would have been the proteins that exist in leaves and legumes, but for primates like us, these are hard to digest unless they are prepared.
Conversely, animal feed (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easy to digest. It also provides large amounts of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
All in all, it should not surprise us if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a similar way to chimpanzees on the savannah do today.
Sleep disturbance is the process of consciously awakening during your normal sleep period and falling asleep shortly later (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without awakening you completely.
If you experience that you turn off the clock while you sleep, you can place it at the other end of the room, forcing you to stand up to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options involve drinking plenty of liquid (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) prior to sleep, which forces you to get up and leave the water.
The amount of inner peace that a person possesses is quite the opposite to the amount of tension that a person possesses in body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive is the life force. All people have the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can learn to understand. The only thing that stands in the way of achieving this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on Buddha's teachings, but was extended by the path of love mahayana and with a lot of techniques from Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini-yoga, meditation and the path of all-encompassing love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy is brought to life through yoga positions, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The centre for Tibetan meditation is the divinity yoga ("Deity Yoga"). Through the visualisation of various divinities, the energy channels are cleaned, the chakras are activated, and the awareness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years and would be fought seriously by deputy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defence had already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganise along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight when over 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers took over and set up the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading Poland's eastern regions in violation of the Riga peace treaty, the Polish-Soviet non-attack pact and other international treaties, both bilaterally and multilaterally.
Using ships for freight transport is the most efficient way to transport large quantities of both people and goods across the oceans.
The Navy's task has traditionally been to ensure that your country continues to have the opportunity to move your people and your goods while affecting your enemy's ability to move its people and its goods.
One of the most remarkable recent examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign in World War II. Americans tried to transport soldiers and materials across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German fleet, which mainly used submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
If the allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain like the rest of Europe.
As far as we are aware, goats were tamed for the first time about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros mountains in Iran.
Old cultures and tribes began to hold them so that they could have easy access to milk, fur, meat and skins.
House goats were generally kept in flocks that walked on hills or other pastures, often watched by goat shepherds who were often children or teenagers, they were more well - known shepherds, and these shepherding methods are still being used today.
As early as the 16th century, roadways were built in England.
Although the lanes simply consisted of parallel wooden planks, they meant that horses could pull heavier loads faster than on the slightly more uneven roads of the time.
Sleepers were invented quite early, to keep the tracks in place. Eventually, however, it was realized that tracks would be more effective if they had an iron piece on top.
This became common practice, but the iron resulted in more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767 the first rails were used, which were made entirely of metal.
The first known method of transport was to go, people began to walk upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (meaning upright man).
Their predecessors Australopithecus did not usually walk upright.
There are two-legged specializations in Australopithecus fossils, which are 4.2-3.9 million years old, although the Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs already seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can become part of the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to reduce future suffering to a certain extent.
This is in many cases like treating symptoms. However, if we do not just want a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problems and disable them.
It is obvious that the world has changed a lot because of mankind's scientific and technological advances, and problems have become greater because of overpopulation and man's extravagant lifestyle.
After the Congress adopted it on July 4, a handwritten draft was signed by the president of Congress John Hancock, and Secretary Charles Thomsen was then sent to John Dunlap's printery a few blocks away.
During the night between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap Broadsides."
First public reading of the document was carried out by John Nixon on July 8 in Independence Hall's farm.
One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6, and on July 9, he was read to his soldiers in New York, and on August 10, a copy arrived in London.
The 25 Dunlap sheets that still exist are the oldest surviving version of the document. The original handwritten version is no longer available.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and still live. We call them birds.
Most people don't see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
There are many things about birds that resemble dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers that are being used today are based on manipulation of information which is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one in two values, e.g. 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits - or bits, to now use computer language.
Internal poisoning may not be visible immediately. Symptoms such as vomit are too general for a diagnosis to be made immediately.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open medicine container or toxic household chemicals.
See the label for specific instructions on first aid for the specific poison.
The term bug is used by entomologists as a formal description of this group of insects.
This expression comes from ancient knowledge of bedbugs, which are insects that very much live as parasites on humans.
Both predators and bedbugs are nidic, which means they are adapted to stay in their host house or nest.
Across the United States there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the largest neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system consisting of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women have twice the risk of getting MS than men.
A couple may decide that it is not best for them or their child that they have a baby.
It is possible for these couples to make an adoption plan for their baby.
By an adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can take over.
The main aim of science is to find out how the world works through the scientific method. This method is actually used in most scientific studies.
However, it is not only experimental, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses. Asking questions and making observations also leads to scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of Greek disappeared, the West felt cut off from its Greek roots in philosophy and science.
Many of the observations made in physiology and behaviour often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and natural biological production.
Periodic rhythms, which are not reactions to external periodic signals, have been documented for most living beings such as bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-propelled oscillators which will continue a period of free-flowing cycles, even without external signals.
Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading suggestions that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophagi or viruses to insert their own DNA into a bacteria.
They did two experiments marking either the DNA in the bay of radioactive phosphorus or the protein in the bay of radioactive sulphur.
Mutations can have a variety of effects depending on the mutation type, the significance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of enjoying the landscape, plant and wildlife.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird observation and visits to parks as well as studies of information on the ecosystem.
One example is to visit, photograph and learn about orangutans in Borneo.
Where morning people leave small villages by car to go to their workplace and pass by others whose places of work are the place they have just left.
On this dynamic transport ferry, everyone is connected to, and supports, a transport system based on private cars.
The decarbonised economy has released the biosphere from the stable phase that has supported human development for a few million years, scientists believe now.
Everyone is part of society and uses transport systems; almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear as many complaints about water quality or bridges that collapse.
Why do transport systems cause such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is a study of the movements of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interaction with each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flows because the behaviour of drivers cannot be predicted with a hundred percent safety.
Fortunately, drivers typically behave reasonably consistently; thus, traffic is also typically reasonably consistent and can be calculated mathematically.
In order to better represent traffic flow, the three main characteristics have been compared: (1) current, (2) density and (3) speed.
These conditions help to plan, design and operate road systems.
Insects were the first animals to fly to the weather. Their ability to fly helped them to more easily avoid enemies and find food and partners more effectively.
Most insects can fold their wings along the body.
This gives them a larger selection of small places where they can hide from predators.
Today, the dragonfly and the flu are the only insects that can't fold their wings back.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system was moving around the sun.
There were differences of opinion about his theory - some thought he was right, while many thought the opposite: that the solar system, including the sun (and even the other stars), turned around the earth.
That makes sense, because we don't feel the world turning around, do we?
The Amazon River is the largest and second - longest river on earth, containing more than 8 times as much water as the world's second - largest river.
The Amazon River is also the world's widest river, and is in some places up to six miles (about 9.6 km) wide.
As many as 20 percent of the water flowing through the rivers of the planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River collects water from thousands of smaller rivers, but the main river itself is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long.
Although the pyramid building with stones continued until the end of the old kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in the size and technical expertise of their structures.
The ancient Egyptians in the New Kingdom were amazed at the monuments of their ancestors, which at that time were well over a thousand years old.
The population of the Vatican City is around 800; it is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the lowest population.
The Vatican City State uses Italian in its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language spoken by most of those who work in the state, while Latin is often used for religious ceremonies.
All inhabitants of the Vatican City State are Roman Catholic.
People have known about the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper since ancient times, because they are found in nature in their natural form and are relatively easy to dig for if you have the right tools.
The philosopher Aristotle had the theory that everything consists of a mixture of one or more of four elements: soil, water, air and fire.
This was more like the four state forms of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he had also had a theory that they change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basic mixtures of two or more metals. Do not forget that there are many substances in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter consists of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit into the period that ends this sentence.
That's why the pencil was a good friend to most when it came out.
Unfortunately, the pencil has lost status and is being used less since new writing methods have emerged.
People now write messages through computer screens and never have to get near a pencil sharpener.
You can only guess what to become of the keyboard when something new comes to.
The Fission Bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to put together a core with many protons and neutrons.
Kind of like pushing a heavy wagon up a hill. When the core is split again, some of the energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they tend to collapse under little or no influence.
The moon's surface is made of stone and dust. The moon's outer layer is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the front and 100 km thick on the back.
It's thinner under the maria and thicker under the highlands.
There may be several moon gardens on the front, as the crust here is thinner. It was easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are centered on finding out what makes people react or what appeals to them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or wishes that have been internalised as they become more mature and reach adulthood.
Theories examine what it is about certain people who cause them to do certain actions and what elements in their surroundings cause them to perform or fail to perform certain actions.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's theory of the need pyramid, and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two types of behavior can occur when a manager starts to lead his former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is to try to remain one of the guys (or girls).
This type of leader has difficulty in making unpopular decisions, doing disciplinary actions, performance evaluations, assigning responsibility and holding people accountable.
At the opposite end of the spectrum one turns into an unrecognizable individual who feels that he or she must change everything the team has accomplished and make it its own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team's successes and failures.
This behavior often results in problems between the leaders and the rest of the team.
There are the same expectations for virtual team expertise as conventional teams, but there are small differences.
Virtual team members often act as contact points for their immediate physical group.
They often have greater autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams can meet in different time zones, which their local management may not understand.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique part of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why should an organisation want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organisation? One of the objectives of translating organisational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
Creativity and inventiveness begin to emerge when all available resources are used effectively across the functional departments of an organisation.
As a result, the process of an organisation working together to cope with an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that meets the customer's needs.
Before an organisation can be innovative, managers must create a culture that promotes innovation, knowledge sharing and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method to help organisations reach a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence of a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. Therefore, it narrows the field of research and makes it much more precise.
The connection between the pathology of the brain and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and examine brain structures and processes that we have never seen before.
This gives us plenty of information and materials to build simulation models that can help us understand our mental processes.
Although artificial intelligence is often associated with science fiction, it constitutes a very important branch of computer science that deals with behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in AI includes being able to manufacture machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, scheduling and schedules, the ability to answer customer diagnostics and questions, as well as handwritten recognition, voice and face recognition.
Such things have become separate disciplines, focusing on providing solutions to real life problems.
The AI system is now often used in economic, medical, engineering and military fields, since it has been built into several home computers and software applications for computer games.
Excursions are a large part of any class. Quite often a teacher would love to take his students to places where it is not possible to travel by bus.
The technology offers solutions with virtual excursions. Students can look at museum objects, visit aquariums or admire beautiful artworks while sitting in the classroom.
Sharing an excursion virtually is also a good way to evaluate an excursion and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website every year about their trip to the state capital, and every year the website is rebuilt, but old versions still exist online as a kind of scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing skills. Although students often begin their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally corrects this.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog writer begins to strive to improve in writing to avoid criticism.
In addition, "blogging forces students to learn more about the world around them." The requirement to give the audience what they want inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to expand their learning far beyond traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "can help learners to become more analytical and critical; by providing active responses to Internet materials, learners can define their roles in relation to what others have written and describe their own perspectives on specific topics (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital and has a number of art galleries and museums that exhibit Canada's past and present.
Further south is Niagara Falls, and the northern part is home to Muskoka and the untapped natural beauty of other areas.
All these things as well as several highlight Ontario as what is considered real Canadian by outsiders.
Farther north there are large areas which are quite sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that surprises many: More African Americans live in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is clearly the largest and is a continent for itself when it comes to wild animals.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or associated with France and known for their luxurious stranded varieties.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the country, and religion quickly spread in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century with the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama's discovery of the Cape route between Europe and India.
In the north, the region borders the Sahel, and in the south and west to the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: it is recommended that all female travelers say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It makes sense to wear what might look like a wedding ring (it just shouldn't look too expensive.
Women should realise that cultural differences can result in what they would regard as harassment, and it is not unusual to be persecuted, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be determined when rejecting men, and don't be afraid to say no (cultural differences or not, it's not okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C. and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and morenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name of Casa Branca, only to leave it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, and it was named Casablanca by Spanish merchants as established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop throughout Morocco.
Around the old Medina it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan goods such as tagins, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes and a wide range of trinkets, but it is very touristic.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of Congo and is located all the way east of Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets in particular in the city centre.
Despite the fact that Goma is reasonably safe, all visits outside Goma should be investigated to understand the fighting taking place in the province of North Kivu.
The city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano as well as one of the cheapest places to track mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle-taxa) to get around in Goma. The normal (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for the short trip.
Along with its relative inaccessibility, it has made "Timbuktu" a metaphor for exotic, distant regions.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, even though its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990 it was added to the list of endangered World Heritage sites because of the threat from the desert sand.
It was one of the major stops under Henry Louis Gates' special Wonders of the African World for PBS.
The city stands in sharp contrast to the rest of the country's cities because it has a more Arabic flair than an African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east and Zimbabwe to the north, while the southern border is Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions in South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in all South African national parks, there are daily maintenance and access fees for the park.
It can also be advantageous to buy a Wild Card as this either gives access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all the South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives Hong Kong territory its name, and is the place that many tourists regard as the main focus area.
Hong Kong's skyline is a group of buildings that, by their reflection in the water of Victoria Harbour, are often compared to a glittering bar chart,
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the Kowloon harbour front on the opposite side.
The majority of Hong Kong's urban development is packed close to recovered land along the northern coast.
This is the place that British colonists made their own, so if you're looking for evidence on the colonial past of the area, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 km from the coast into Bangladesh and India's hinterland.
Sundarbans has been added to the UNESCO World Heritage List. The part of the forest that is within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not just mangrove swamps they include some of the last remaining stands of the mighty forests that once covered the gangly plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3.850 km2, about one third of which are covered by water/mosses.
Sundarbans has been a game reserve since 1966 and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal royal tigers and about 30,000 chital deer in the area.
There are buses from the interregional bus station (on the other side of the river) all day, although most people, especially those going east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since buses in the district are often drunk, it is a good idea to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese buses, which are both comfortable and sturdy.
Deletaxas are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
Oyapock River Bridge is a cable bridge, stretching across the Oyapock River and connecting the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 metres high, the bridge is 378 metres long and has two lanes that are 3.50 metres wide.
The vertical ground clearance below the bridge is 15 metres. The construction was completed in August 2011. It only opened for traffic in March 2017.
The bridge is planned to be fully operational in September 2017 when Brazilian customs control posts are expected to be completed.
The Guaranís were the most important group of natives who lived in the area now eastern Paraguay, and they lived as semi-Nomadian hunters who also cultivated farming to survive.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of native tribes such as the Guaycurús and the Payaguás, which survived by hunting, collecting and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called "the great province of India, " came into the world in the 16th century as a result of the meeting between Spanish conquerors and indigenous communities.
The Spaniards started the colonization period, which lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain a lot of its original character and identity.
Argentina is known to have one of the world's best polo teams as well as some of the world's best players.
The biggest tournament of the year will take place in December at the polobans in Las Cañitas.
Also smaller tournaments and matches can be seen here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments as well as where to buy tickets, you can check with Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falklands Pound (FKP), the value of which is fixed at the value of a pound sterling (GBP).
Money can be exchanged in the only bank on the islands located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
Britain's pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands, and within Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On the outlying islands, credit cards will probably not be available, although British and American currencies may be useful; ask owners in advance to know which method of payment is accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland's currency outside the islands, so make sure to exchange your money before you leave the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, summer is when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtrops; during the summer months it is normal to have temperatures above 30°C.
Winter can be misleadingly cool: temperatures rarely reach below freezing, but the wind and humidity combined make it feel colder than what is on the thermometer.
There are no particularly "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rain remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, animal life is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, you must be at least 100 yards/metre away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/metres from all other wild animals!
No matter how docile they look, bisons, mooses, bears, and virtually all large animals can attack.
Every year a lot of visitors get hurt because they don't keep a proper distance. These animals are big, wild and can be dangerous, so give them space.
In addition, be aware that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid bringing or preparing food that smells and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. It is located on the island of Upolo and has a population of just under 40,000.
Founded in the 1850s, Apia has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbour provided a framework for a notorious naval confrontation in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk except for a British cruise ship. Almost 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence, organized by the Mau movement, there was a peaceful assembly in the city that resulted in the assassination of the chief chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches because Auckland is close to two ports. The most popular are located in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) are located in the Pacific Ocean, stretching from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches with safe swimming, and most get natural shade from pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located at Waitemata Harbour in the exclusive suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good selection of shops along the sea. It is safe to swim here.
The most widely used local beer is "Number One," which is not a complicated beer but is pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta."
There are many French wines to drink, but the New Zealand and Australian wines may be better to transport.
It is absolutely safe to drink the local water from the tap, but it is easy to find bottled water if you are concerned.
For Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is foreign. A short black is called "espresso," cappuccino has plenty of cream on top (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets the Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but in turn excellent.
Many visit the reef all year round, and people rarely get hurt on the reef for these reasons.
Always listen to advice from the authorities, read and keep advice on signs, and give great attention to security warnings.
Sea wasps occur near beaches and near estuaries from October to April north of 1770. They can occasionally also be found outside these times.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and want to swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live their active life in the sea, their primary habitat is in estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Pre-reservation gives the traveler peace of mind that they have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have offers for certain hotels, although it may be possible for you to book other types of accommodation through a travel agent such as campsites.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transport arrangements to/from the airport or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They may also keep the reservation for you if you need time to consider the offer or obtain other documents for your destination (e.g. a visa).
However, changes or requests should be addressed to the tour operator first and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, most of the participants for music festivals choose to camp on site, and many participants consider it a crucial part of the experience.
If you want to be where it is going, you need to get in early to get a tent space close to the music.
Remember that even though the music on the big scenes is over, there may still be parts of the festival that play music until late into the evening.
Some festivals have special camping areas for small children's families.
Check where your cabin is if you cross the Baltic Sea in winter, as sailing through ice can make a lot of noise for those closest to it.
Passengers on cruise ships are exempt from visa requirements (see the terms), which is nice to know, as cruises to St Petersburg give passengers time to see the city.
Casinos do everything they can to ensure that guests spend as much time and money as possible. Windows and watches are usually not present and it can be difficult to find an exit.
They usually have special offers for food, drink, and entertainment to keep guests in a good mood and keep them in the house.
In some places alcoholic beverages are offered at the house, but drunkenness weakens judgment, and all genuine gamblers know how important it is to be sober.
Anyone who has to drive at high latitudes or above mountain passes should take into account the possibility of snow, ice and minus degrees.
On ice and snowy roads there is low friction, and you cannot drive, as you would normally do, on dry asphalt.
During a snowstorm, enough snow may fall in a very short time to make you get stuck.
Visibility may also be limited by snow falling or blowing, or by condensation or ice on the windows of the vehicle.
On the other hand, ice- and snow-smooth conditions are common in many countries, and traffic mostly slips undisturbed all year round.
Safarier is the highlight of many and maybe it is what attracts most tourists to Africa.
The term safari is often used to refer to land travel to see the beautiful African wildlife, especially on the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach the cars, so standard equipment is enough to see the animals.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes cloudy, and you can better see them with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk," "go safari" or "safari on foot") consists of hiking tours that either take a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held elsewhere in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two summer Olympics as it also hosted the Games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the delay was announced, you might get into trouble.
Cancellation policies vary, but from the end of March most Corona virus-based cancellation policies do not extend until July 2020 when the Olympic Games were scheduled.
It is expected that most tickets to the event will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, where typical tickets cost about ¥7,000.
Ironing of damp clothes can help dry it. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board that you can borrow even if there is no one in the room.
If you are not able to use an iron or if you do not like wearing ironed socks, try using a hairdryer if available.
Be careful to let the fabric get too hot (which can cause shrinkage or in extreme cases burns).
There are different ways of cleaning water where some are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas it is enough to boil water for a minute, in others several minutes are needed.
Filters vary in efficiency and if you are concerned you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travellers may encounter pests they don't know from home.
Pests can destroy food, cause irritations or, in worse cases, cause allergic reactions, spread poison or transmit diseases.
Infectious diseases in themselves, or dangerous animals that can hurt or kill people, are not usually perceived as pests.
Duty-free shopping is the possibility to buy goods in specific places that are exempt from taxes.
Travellers who are on their way to countries with a high tax rate can sometimes save considerable amounts, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The line between Point Marion and Fairmont offers the most challenging driving conditions at Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, which often goes through isolated terrain in the hinterland.
Be awkward if you are not used to driving on the road: steep hills, narrow lanes and sharp turns there are plenty of.
The speed limits set are remarkably lower than on lines before and after 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) and it is even more important than usual to observe them exactly.
Strangely enough, the coverage on mobile phones is much stronger here than along many other routes of the route such as Pennsylvania Wilds.
German cakes are quite good, and in Bavaria they are very flavorful and varied as in Germany's southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit bakery is common: apples are baked in cakes all year round, and cherries and plums make their appearance during the summer.
Very German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. Popular cakes and a strong cup of coffee often go hand in hand
If you want some small but full-bodied cakes, you can try what depending on region are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Crapfen.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices along with either meat or vegetables.
A Curry is either "dry" or "wet" depending on how much liquid is in it.
In the inner regions of northern India and Pakistan yogurt is often used in curry dishes. In southern India and some other coastal regions on the subcontinent, it is common to use coconut milk.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an overarching term that covers a wide range of regional food cultures found throughout the country.
But if the term is used without further deepening, it typically refers to the food that originally originates from the central and eastern parts of the main island Java.
Now the Javanese cuisine is widely available throughout the archipelago; it consists of a number of single spicy dishes, where the most popular spices are peanuts, chili, sugar (especially javanic coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are supports for the rider's feet, which hang down on each side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but can cause security problems due to the possibility of a rider's feet getting stuck in them.
If a rider falls off the horse but has a foot trapped in the stirrup, he may be dragged if the horse runs away. To minimize this risk, you can take some security measures.
First, many riders use riding boots with a heel and a soft, narrow sole.
Next, some saddles, especially English saddles, have headbands that release the stirrup straps from the saddle if pulled backwards by a falling rider.
The Cochamó Valley - Chile's largest climbing destination, known as South America's Yosemite, has a number of large granite walls and rocks.
Mountain peaks present breathtaking views from the peaks to all visitors. Mountain climbers from around the world continuously establish new routes among its infinite potentials for new climbing walls.
Alpine winter sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports activities that involve driving down snowy terrains with skis or a snowboard clamped on your feet.
Skiing is a great travel activity with many enthusiasts - sometimes known as "ship rooms" that plan the entire holiday around skiing in a certain area.
People have been skiing for thousands of years - cave paintings all the way back from the year 5,000 BC show people skiing!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking on skis: This activity is also called backcountry skiing, skiing or skiing.
It is related to, but usually does not involve skiing in alpine style or mountaineering. The latter is performed in steep terrain and requires much stiffer skis and boots.
I want you to see the ski route as if it were a similar hiking route.
In good conditions, you will be able to cover much greater distances than if you go but it is only very rare that you get the same speed as on cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack and on prepared tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries.
In this context, however, the Schengen area acts in a similar way to one country.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can usually cross borders without having to go through passport control again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa you should not apply for a separate visa for each Schengen country, which saves time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what manufactured goods are regarded as antiques; some tax authorities define goods older than 100 years as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations where the age limit may be less in North America, for example, than in Europe.
Handmade products can be categorized as antiques even if they are younger than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer keeping is an important livelihood for the Sami, and culture around it is also important for many Samer with other professions.
Even traditionally, however, not all Sami kept reindeer in a large style, but they lived on fishing, hunting and the like and used mainly reindeer as migratory animals.
Today, many Sami work in modern subjects. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the territory of the Sami.
Although the word "Gypsy" is often used especially among non-Romans, it is often considered offensive because of its attachment to negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Roma population.
If travel orders occur in the country you visit, your travel insurance or cancellation insurance may be affected.
It may also be that you want to get advice from governments other than your own, but their advice will be designed for their own citizens.
One example is that American citizens in the Middle East may face a different situation than Europeans or Arabs.
The advice is only a brief overview of the political state of a country.
The views expressed are often with a keen eye on the matter, general and simplified in relation to the more detailed information that can be found elsewhere.
Extreme weather conditions are the general term for all dangerous weather phenomena which can cause damage or serious social disturbances or cause human lives.
Extreme weather conditions can occur around the world, and there are different types that may depend on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Strong wind, hail, extreme rainfall and forest fires are forms of, and effects of, severe weather like thunderstorms, tornadoes, cloud pumps and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include snowstorms, rocks, ice strikes and dust storms.
Travellers are strongly advised to pay attention to any risk of serious weather conditions that may affect their area as this could affect any travel plans.
Anyone who plans to visit a country that can be considered a war zone should undergo professional training.
A search on the Internet for "Course in hostile environment" will probably give the address of a local company.
A course will normally cover all the topics discussed here with much more detail, usually with practical experience.
A course will normally last from 2-5 days and will involve role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes there will be gun training.
Books and magazines dealing with survival in the wilderness are common, but there are not many publications dealing with war zones.
Travellers planning sex-change operations abroad shall ensure that valid documents are brought for the return journey.
The willingness of governments to cooperate varies when it comes to issuing passports with unspecified sex (X), or documents that are updated to give a person a desired name and gender.
The desire of foreign governments to respect these documents varies as much.
Security checks have also become more intrusive in the period since 11 September 2001.
Tranquilized passengers who have not had operations should not expect to get through the scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
The current from waves that return and break on the beach, often at a reef or similar, is called a countercurrent.
Due to the topology under water, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper sections, and a rapid flow to deep water can be generated.
Most deaths occur as a result of fatigue by trying to swim back against the flow, which may be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the power, it's no harder than normal to swim back.
Try aiming at a place where you will not be caught again, or, depending on your skills and whether you have been discovered, you may be able to wait for you to be rescued.
Homecoming shock comes faster than culture shock (there is not a period of enthusiasm for the new), lasts longer and can be more serious.
Travellers who easily adapted to the new culture sometimes find it very difficult to adapt to their own culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have adapted to the new culture and lost some of your habits from your home culture.
When you went abroad for the first time, people were likely patient and understanding, knowing that a traveler in a whole new country needs to adapt.
People do not necessarily expect patience and understanding to be necessary when returning home as travellers.
The pyramid's sound and light show is one of the most interesting activities in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark, and you can see them quietly before the show begins.
Usually you always hear the sound of tourists and sellers. The story of the sound and light is like a history book.
The Sphinx is set as a background and tells of a long story.
The scenes are shown on the pyramids, and the different pyramids light up.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819 and claimed by many nations, have most bases, sixteen of which are active in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception, where an active volcano's flooded caldera provides a spectacular natural harbour area.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the peninsula bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here the mountains of the peninsula meet on the plain and form the 360 km long chain of the Ellsworth mountains, which is divided into two of the Minnesota glaciers.
The northern part of the Sentinel Range possesses Antarctica's highest mountains, Vinson Massif (also called Mount Vinson), which peaks at 4.892 m.
In remote areas without mobile coverage, a satellite phone can be your only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a substitute for a mobile phone, as you must be outside and have a free view of the satellite to make a phone call.
This service is often used by shipping, including pleasure craft, as well as expeditions that need remote data and speech.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide you with more information about connection to this service.
An opportunity that is becoming more and more popular for those planning a sabbath year is to travel and learn.
This is particularly popular among those leaving school as it allows them to take a year out before the university without compromising their education.
In many cases, a course abroad during your Sabbath year can actually improve your chances of getting a place in a higher education in your home country.
There will typically be a tuition fee for registering for these training programmes.
Finland is a fantastic destination for sailors. "The land of the thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands in the lakes as well as in the archipelagos along the coast.
In the archipelagos and lakes you don't necessarily need a yacht.
Although the coastal archipelago and the largest lakes are large enough for any yacht, you get another experience in a smaller boat or even a kayak.
Sailing is a national hobby in Finland, where there is one boat for every seven or eight people.
This is somewhat similar to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise it is quite unique (e.g. in the Netherlands the number is one to forty).
Most Baltic cruises offer an extended stay in St Petersburg in Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city in a few whole days when you go back and sleep on the ship at night.
If you only go to land with the ship's excursions, you do not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some cruises have Berlin, Germany in the brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not at all close to the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
It can be a frightening experience to travel by plane for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have not flown before or if they have experienced a traumatizing event.
It is nothing to be ashamed of: it is no different from the fear and hatred of other things that many people suffer from.
For some, understanding how an aircraft works and what happens when flying can help overcome a fear that is based on the unknown or not having control.
Delivery companies take good care to deliver quickly. Often time is very important when it comes to business documents, goods or spare parts for urgent repair.
On some routes the larger companies have their own aircraft, but on other routes and in smaller companies there was a problem.
If they sent things by air, it may have taken days on some routes to get through unloading and customs clearance.
The only way to get it through faster was by sending it as checked baggage. Airlines' rules do not allow them to send luggage without a passenger. That's where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to lay a large pile of money rather than get the opportunity (or even better, get your business to do it for you).
However, this is not cheap: as a rough rule of thumb you can expect to pay up to four times the economy class normal price for business class and eleven times the price for first class!
In general, there is no need to look at discounts on seats in business or first class on direct flights from A to B at all.
Airlines know very well that certain core groups of passengers are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of coming forward quickly and comfortably, and they set their prices accordingly.
Moldova's capital is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the establishment of the self-appointed Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but which is not recognised by any member state of the United Nations.
Economic relations have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova despite the collapse of political negotiations.
The largest religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is Turkey's third largest city with a population of about 3.7 million, the country's second largest port after Istanbul, and a very large transport hub.
What was once the old town of Smyrna is now a modern, developed and busy trading town located around a large bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, glass facades and modern shopping malls are surrounded by traditional red brick roofs, the old 18th-century market and old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere that is more Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík overlooks the nearby island of Eystroy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery there are interesting marble sculptures of pigeons over some tombstones.
It is worth spending half an hour walking around the exciting village.
To the north and within reach lies the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, which was made famous among foreigners after a commending account of its magnificence by Lord Byron.
Scotturb Bus 403 drives regularly to Sintra and stops at Cabo da Roca.
North you can also visit the great shrine of Our Lady of Fatima (altar) which is the place of world-famous Marian spirits.
Remember that you are actually visiting a mass grave site. A place that has a crucial importance for a large part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive who survived their time here, and many more who had loved ones who were murdered or worked to death there, both Jews and Gentiles.
Please treat this place with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves. Don't tell jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not shame the site with markings or by scratching graphiteti on the structures.
Barcelona's official languages are Catalan and Spanish. About half prefer to speak Catalan, the vast majority understand it, and almost everyone can speak Spanish.
However, most signs are listed only in Catalan because it has been established by law as the official language.
Nevertheless, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other facilities.
General messages in the metro are given only in Catalan, but unforeseen changes are notified via an automatic system in several different languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self - centered, rude and arrogant.
Although this is often only an imprecise stereotype, the best way to get along with people in Paris is still to behave as neatly as possible, you must behave as one who is "bee élevé" (bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee
The cool exterior of the Parisians evaporates quickly if you show basic courtesy.
The Plitvices National Park is filled with forest areas - mainly with beech and conifers - and offers a mix of both alpine plants and Mediterranean plants.
It has a remarkably wide variety of plant communities due to its many microclimates, different soil types and varying altitude levels.
The area is also home to an extremely wide variety of animals and bird species.
Here you find along with many more common species rare fauna such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, los, wildcat and thaw.
During visits to the monasteries, women are obliged to wear skirts that cover their knees while also having their shoulders covered.
Most of the monasteries have scarves for women who show up unprepared, but if you bring your own and especially some with strong colors, you get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear pants that cover their knees.
This can be borrowed from the warehouse at the entrance, but the clothes are not washed after each use, so maybe you are not quite comfortable with wearing these skirts. One size fits all men!
The Mallorcin cuisine, like other similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and the use of a great deal of olive oil.
A simple, popular dinner, especially in summer, is Pa amb Oli: Bread with olive oil, tomato and any kind of available accessories such as cheese, tuna etc.
All nouns, including the word Sie for you, always begin with large, also in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and lenses
It no doubt also makes reading easier, although writing complicates some of the need to find out whether a verb or adjective is used in a substantive form.
The pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to keep an eye on are c and g, as their pronunciation varies depending on the following vocal.
Also make sure to pronunciation r and rr differently: caro means loved ones, while carro means wagon.
Persian has a relatively easy and mostly common grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammatical basic book will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better to understand phrases.
Just so you know, if you know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, people who know a little Spanish can quickly conclude that Portuguese resembles it enough, that you don't have to study it separately.
Premodern observatories are usually obsolete today and remain as museums or educational sites.
As light pollution in their greatness was not such a problem as it is today, they are usually found in cities or on campuses where they are easier to reach than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities in remote areas with good atmospheric conditions.
Looking at flowering cherry trees, known as Hanami, has been a tradition in Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China, where flowers from plum trees were the chosen flower.
In Japan the first cherry flower feasts were held by the emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.
Plants look best when they are in a natural environment, therefore you must resist the temptation to "just take one sample".
If you visit a publicly available garden, you will be thrown out without discussion if you collect "samples."
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to visit and very easy to navigate around and you can buy almost anything after you have arrived.
But when you are in the "high tropes," only a few degrees north of the equator, you must handle both heat (all the time) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, which is more rare).
There are also a few buses going north to Hebron, the traditional burial place for the Biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives.
Make sure you check if the bus you're considering taking drives into Hebron, and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good theme to base a holiday around.
For example, to visit castles in the Loire Valley or Rhinalen, to go on cruise to interesting cities on the Danube or to sail along the Erie Canal.
They also define routes for popular hiking and bike paths.
Christmas is one of Christianity's most important holidays and is celebrated as Jesus'birthday.
Non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians from all over the world have embraced many of the traditions of the holidays.
There is a tradition of staying awake on Easter night to see the sunrise in an exposed place.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations of this tradition, but it may well be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
The more traditional churches often hold Eastervigilie on Saturday night at the Easter weekend, where the congregations often break out at the feast at midnight to celebrate Christ's resurrection.
All animals that originally arrived in the islands came here either by swimming, flying, or floating.
Because of the long distance from the continent, mammals could not make the journey, making the giant turtle the main grass-eating animal on Galapagos.
Since the first humans came to Galapagos, many mammals have been imported such as goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit Arctic or Antarctic areas in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not come up above the horizon.
This gives a good opportunity to see polar lights as the sky will be dark more or less 24 hours a day.
Since there are not many people living in the areas, and light pollution is often no problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese working culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners are used to.
Suits are standard business clothing, and colleagues address each other by their surname or job titles.
Harmony at work is important and thus places emphasis on group efforts rather than praise for individual performance.
Workers often need their superiors to approve all decisions they make, and they are expected to obey the instructions of their superiors without asking questions.
