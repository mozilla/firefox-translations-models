The U.S. Gymnastics Federation supports the letter of the U.S. Olympic Committee and agrees that it is imperative that the Olympic family promote a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the USOC statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs can be better served if we move forward with a meaningful change in our organisation, rather than if certification is removed.
The U.S. Gymnastics Federation supports an independent investigation that can shed light on how an abuse of proportions such as that so courageously described by the survivor Larry Nassar may have gone undetected for so long, and it welcomes necessary and appropriate changes.
USA Gymnastics and USOC have the same goal - to make gymnastics and other sports as safe as possible, so that athletes can follow their dreams in a safe, positive and strengthening environment.

It not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widespread, but also provides details that fossils often cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
The scientists say that this animal's plumage was chestnut brown on the top, with a pale or carotenoid-coloured underside.
The finding also provides insight into the development of feathers in birds.
While dinosaur feathers do not have a well - developed shaft, so - called coil, other characteristics of feathers — rays and bee rays — the researchers concluded that the coil was likely a later evolutionary development than these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers indicates that they were not used for flying but instead for temperature control or display. The researchers suggested that the specimen show an adult plumage and not the chicken down, even if the tail comes from a young dinosaur.
The researchers said that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult plumage and not young down.

Using brightness and rotation, the star's rossbytal is determined, which has to do with plasma flows.
The lower the rossby number, the less active is the star in terms of magnetic reversals.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made by the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect that the research team was looking for would be caused by forces reminiscent of the tides of the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon exerts attraction on earth, which causes tides, the Milky Way exercises a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists found that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter does.
This theory says that the vast majority of dark matter around a galaxy is located in a kind of halo, and is made from masses of small particles.

Tony Moll discovered the extremely drug-resistant form of tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
"In an interview he said that the new variant was "very worrying and alarming because of the very high mortality rate.""
Some patients may have been infected by the bacterium in the hospital, says Dr. Moll, of which at least two were hospital staff.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and place a printed sheet of paper with their elected candidate in an envelope.
After officials have verified the voter's identity, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voting document.
French electoral legislation codifies the approach quite strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes at the beginning of the vote and that no envelopes are added except those duly counted from the competent voters.
Candidates can send representatives to witness each part of the process. In the evening, the votes of volunteers under extensive supervision are counted, following specific procedures.

Madhya Pradesh police recovered the stolen laptop and cell phone.
"Vice Chief Inspector General D.K. Arya said: "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and found her cell phone and laptop."
The accused are named Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Inspector Chandra Shekhar Solanki announced that the accused appeared before the court with covered faces.
Although three people were in the house when the car collided with it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was closed temporarily while the emergency services cut the driver out of the red Audi TT.
He was first hospitalized at the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrook Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been accused in the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court of murdering her son.
She is in custody pending prosecution and trial, but any eyewitness evidence can be worthless because her picture has been widely published.
This is common elsewhere in the UK but Scottish law works differently and courts have considered the publication of photos to be potentially harmful.
"Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dundee University notes that "journalists choose a dangerous line if they publish images etc. of suspects."
The Criminal Department (Crown Office), which has overall responsibility for prosecution, has indicated to journalists that no further comments will be made before prosecution.
According to the leak, the document is about the border dispute, where the Palestinians want the borders to be based on them before the six-day war in 1967.
Other subjects reported are the future of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel requests ten years of constant military presence in the valley after an agreement has been signed, while PA only approves of leaving such a presence for five years.
Hunters in the additional pest control study would be closely monitored by parkkeepers when the study was observed and its effectiveness evaluated.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc. volunteers were recruited, under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of park conservation and culture at NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting mission received comprehensive safety and training instructions.
Martelly swore a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) of nine members yesterday.
It's Martelly's fifth provisional electoral council in the space of four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former Provisional Electoral Council, as part of a package of measures to bring the country closer to new elections.
The Commission was Mr Martelly's response to the extensive protests against the regime that started in October.
The semi-violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some that have lapsed since 2011.
There have been reports of about 60 cases of malfunctioning iPods overheated, causing a total of six fires and causing minor burns to four people.
Japan's Ministry of Economic Affairs, Trade and Industry (Meti) said that 27 accidents related to the units were known.
"Meti announced last week that Apple had informed of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company called "slight.""
"The Department responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report ""very regrettable.""
The earthquake hit Mariana at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT Friday).
The office of the Northern Mariana Civil Protection Service announced that no damage was reported in the country.
Even the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center announced that there was no indication of tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer has held tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, Philippines' Huvustad.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have so far been confirmed dead.
Six scourges, including children and the elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later changed places with an older lady because she was in need of toilet visits. Mendoza was shot down.
Lygins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working in the hospital, Ligins began to examine premature births during his free time.
His research showed that if a hormone was given, it would speed up the fetal pulmonary maturation.
"Xinhua reported that the government investigators salvaged two black boxes on Wednesday."
Wrestler colleagues also paid homage to Luna.
"Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first boss. Luna died during the night with two moons. Quite unique just like her. Strong woman."
"Distin ""Goldust"" Runnels said in a comment that ""Luna was as big a freak as I... maybe even bigger... loves her and will miss her...hopefully she has it better where she is now.""
Of 1,400 people questioned before the 2010 federal elections, the number against Australia becoming a republic had grown by 8 percent since 2008.
Prime Minister Julia Gillard argued during the campaign at the 2010 federal election that Australia should become a republic after Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of the participants in the survey share this view, that Queen Elisabeth II will become Australia's last last monarch.
At the extremes of the survey, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist would have swam 100 m and 200 freestyle as well as three relay races at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his troubles there have been doubts about his fitness.
He has not been able to take the medicines needed to overcome his pain as they are banned in the competition.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, has discovered the largest known prime number so far, on January 25.
Several people verified the discovery with various hardware and software at the beginning of February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Cometers may have been a source of water resources on earth, along with organic matter, that can form proteins and sustain life.
Since comets collided with the earth long ago, scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, especially how the earth was formed.
Cuomo, 53, admitted his rule earlier this year and last month signed a bill to legalize same-sex marriages.
"He referred to the rumors as "political chatter and nonsense."
There is speculation that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims would mean that planes fly shorter distances, save millions of litres of fuel each year, and reduce CO2 emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology unlike older ground radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No extra transport is set in, and trains over ground will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and park-and-ride stations are not available at ground level.
The fear of lack of means of transport opened up for the possibility that the game would have to be played behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported on the formation of a new bird species in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University reported that the new species developed in just two generations, although this process is believed to have taken much longer due to breeding between the endemic Darwinfinken, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant Españoladarwinfinken, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be processed into any form. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be drawn to thin wire that can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled in sheets.
"It can be made very thin and attached to other metals. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted images in books called "enlightened manuscripts"."
This is called the pH value of a chemical. You can make an indicator with red cabbage juice.
Saften from the cabbage changes hue depending on how acidic or alkaline (alkaline) the chemical is.
The PH value is shown in the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electrons (because hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dry powders together, then form them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will feel funny and form a kind of shell.
The cities Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a toilet with flushing in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Residues of sewage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman society, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women stayed together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the signal and reflects it back down almost immediately.
The satellite was sent into space by rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and visual field.
It takes a giant rocket of over 30 meters to get a satellite or telescope up into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The biggest thing that the wheel has brought is to give us much easier and faster transport methods.
It has given us the train, the car and many other means of transport.
Below them are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including loose pet treasures) that eat a much larger amount of small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of a niche, a special job for every cat that keeps it away from rivaling with others.
Lions are the most social cats, and live in large groups called flocks.
Flocks consist of one to three related adult males along with as many as thirty females and young.
Females are often closely related; a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lejob acts a lot like flocks of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other large cats) in behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
As an all-round athlete, the tiger can climb (but not well), swim, jump long distances and drag with five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger is part of the same group (the family Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roaring of the tiger is not like the roaring of the lion, but more like a sentence of growling, screaming words.
Ozelots like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can. Almost all animals that the ozelote hunt is much smaller than it itself.
Scientists believe that ozelots follow and find animals to eat (change) via the smell, sniffing on the ground where they were.
They can see very well in the dark with dark vision and also move very sneaky. Oceloter hunts his prey by melting into his surroundings and then throw himself over the prey.
When a small group of living beings (a small stock) are separated from the main stock from which they originate (for example, if they move across a mountain range or river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily get back), they often end up in a different environment than they used to be.
This new environment has other resources and other competitors, so to be a strong competitor, the new population needs different functions or adaptations than they needed before.
The indigenous population has not changed at all; they still need the same adjustments as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, they begin to look smaller and smaller as the second population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process specification, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that people breathe and they absorb carbon dioxide that humans emit (i.e. exhale).
Plants produce food using sunlight through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses of plants and make our clothes from plants. Much of the food we eat is plants. Without the plants the animals cannot survive.
Mosaic was at the top of the food chain during its time, so it had nothing to be afraid of, except other mosaics.
The long jaws were obsessed with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the palate, which meant that there was no chance to escape for anything that crossed its path.
We do not know for sure, but it may have had a split tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosaics, and it may even have been cannibal.
It also attacked everything that came into the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. rex was no match for it.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their fair share of strange or unusual feasts such as wild boars, peacocks, snails and a kind of rodent called hazelmus.
Another difference was that while the poor people and the woman ate their food while sitting in chairs, the rich men liked to have banquets together where they could half lie on the side while eating their meals.
Ancient Roman meals cannot have contained food that came to Europe from America or from Asia in later centuries.
For example, they did not have corn, nor tomatoes, nor cocoa, nor potatoes, nor had any ancient Romans ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods considered to be the god's home.
People brought offerings to the gods and the priests tried to appease the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary to which only the priests had access.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziqquarats, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house wasn't that important.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family took place outdoors.
Women cooked food on the farm; shops were just open dishes facing the street. Stone was used to build houses.
In the land of Canaan, there were no large forests, so wood was very precious.
Greenland was sparsely populated. The Nordic fairy tales say that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland as punishment for murder, and that when he traveled west he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
Whatever his discovery, Eskimo tribes already lived there at the time.
"Although each country was "Scandinavian" there were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs and history in Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland."
If you have seen the film National Treasure, you may think there is a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
That is not true, however; although there is something on the back of the document, it is not a tax map.
"On the back of the Declaration of Independence, the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776" were written. The text appears on the bottom of the document, upside down."
No one knows for sure who wrote it, but we know that the large parchment (with dimensions of 75,6 cm x 62,2 cm) was rolled up for storage early in its existence.
So it is likely that the text was just written there as a label.
The landings of Day D and the subsequent battles had freed northern France, but the south was still not free.
These were French people who got along with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
"On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion was called Operation Dragoon."
In just two weeks the Americans and the free French forces had freed southern France and turned against Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a significant group of people living and working together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilization, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city state, and which also somehow defines the size of society.
Urban states are the forerunners of the nations. A civilized culture means that knowledge is transferred between generations, a lingering cultural footprint and a fair distribution.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical traces, and are not recognised as real civilizations.
During the American War of Independence, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government - with Congress as the only component - according to the Confederacy articles.
The Congress lacked all the power to impose taxes and, because there was no national exercising power or judiciary, it fell on the governments, which were often uncooperative, to implement all its decisions.
Nor did it have the authority to suspend tax laws and customs duties between states.
The articles unanimously demanded the approval of all states before they could be added and the states attached so little importance to the central government that their representatives were often absent.
Italy's national football, together with the German football team, is the world's second most successful team and was the champion of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, bike, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, where Italians compete in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has almost 7000 islands (of which the largest is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
With its many islands, Japan is often counted in a geographical sense as an archipelago.
Taiwan's history dates back to the 15th century when European sailors passing past registered island names such as Ilha Formosa, which means beautiful island.
In 1624 the Dutch East Indian Company founded a base in southwestern Taiwan and initiated a transformation of the original production of cereals and hired Chinese workers to work on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683 the forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885 Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
After the defeat of 1895 in the first Sino-Japanese war (1894-1895) the Qing government signed the Shimonoseki Treaty, which grants sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which then governs the island until 1945.
Machu picchu consists of three main structures, Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple with the three windows.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they looked like in the original.
By 1976 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common format for still images in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analogue film era.
It is still produced today, but even more important is its image ratio inherited to the formats of photo sensors in digital cameras.
The 35-milimeter format is, somewhat confusing, 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The side ratio in this format (dividing by twelve to achieve the simplest full-digit relationship) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. APS format) correspond to this aspect ratio or are close to it.
The very abused and often ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while keeping a certain order in a picture.
It is claimed that the best location for the subject is where the lines that divide the image in thirds vertically and horizontally meet (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was examined.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion had bound European states together despite their differences in language and customs.
Its omnipresent power influenced everyone from king to common man.
One of Christianity's main doctrines says that wealth should be used to cushion suffering and poverty and that church funds are for that very purpose.
The central power of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this principle was fulfilled.
Shortly after the conflict broke out, Britain launched a sea blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective in cutting off the necessary military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified in most international agreements over the last two hundred years.
The UK mined international waters to prevent all ships from crossing entire areas of the sea, making it risky even for neutral ships.
With a limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unlimited underwater warfare.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitude was pacifism and isolation among most inhabitants and countries.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, countries wanted to avoid repeating such a situation in the future.
Tesla moved to the United States in 1884 to join Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four cents in his pocket, a poetry book and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his boss at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Old China had a unique way of distinguishing different periods of time; each stage in China's history, or every family in power, was a distinct dynasty.
Between each dynasty there was also an unstable period in which the provinces were divided. The most famous of these periods were the three kingdoms, which took place between the 60 years between the Han and the Jindynastia.
During these periods, violent warfare was often waged between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The three kingdoms were one of the bloodiest times in ancient China's history when thousands died in the battle to sit in the highest chair in the grand palace of Xi'an.
There were many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not one ruler.
Furthermore, the professions were opened up to all applicant men, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same applies to the military, when rank in the army was now based on caliber instead of class.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed people from the working class in other countries to make revolution.
"Muhammed was deeply interested in subjects beyond his everyday life. He often visited a cave that became known as "Hira" on the "Noor" mountain (light) to contemplate."
The cave itself, which survived the passage of time, gives a very clear picture of Mohammed's spiritual propensities.
The cave, located on one of the peaks north of Mecca, is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
It's actually not easy to find even if you know it exists. Inside the cave it is total isolation.
You can't see anything but the clear, beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from within the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only of the seven wonders that still exist today.
Built by the Egyptians of the third century B.C.E., the Cheops pyramid is one of many large pyramidal structures built to honor the dead pharaohs.
"Giza plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in the valley of Egyptian Death contains several pyramids (of which the great pyramid is the largest), several smaller tomb monuments, several temples and the great sphinx."
The Cheops pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
"The mark for "upward-strip" looks like a V and the mark for "down-strip" looks like a clump or square with no bottom side."
Up means you should start at the tip and push the bow upwards, and down means you should start at the froschen (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow down.
An upswing usually generates a softer sound, while a descent is stronger and more resolute.
You are welcome to draw your own markings, but remember that the printed string markings are there for a musical reason, so they should usually be respected.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two little children (11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles) and the king's sister, Madame Élisabeth, were forced back to Paris on October 6, 1789 from Versailles by a crowd of market women.
They traveled back to Paris in a chariot surrounded by a crowd screaming and calling out threats to the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep their wagon windows wide open.
On one occasion, one of the participants in the mob swung the head of an imperial guard killed at Versailles, in front of the terrified queen.
War expenses for the conquest of the Philippines by American imperialism were paid by the Philippine people themselves.
They had to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover most of the cost and interest on bonds in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Of course, the great profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the fundamental gains of American imperialism.
To understand the temple lords, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The era of events is often referred to as the period of European history during the 1000s to the 1300s.
The Middle Ages were preceded by the older Middle Ages and were followed by the late Middle Ages, which formally ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that embraces many different ideas in practice, from the fact that technology drives development or the technological imperative in the strict belief that man's destiny is driven by a fundamental logic connected with the laws of nature and how they manifest in technology.
"Most interpretations of technological determinism have two general ideas in common: that the development of technology itself follows a path that is largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has "effects" on societies that are original, rather than socially conditioned."
For example, it could be said that the motorized car necessarily leads to the construction of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically sustainable for just a small amount of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Mass ownership of cars also leads to a higher incidence of accidents on the roads, leading to the invention of new health care technologies to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism contained a great element of determinism originating from authors such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of romance, geography formed individuals, and over time, customs and culture related to this geography arose, and these, harmonizing with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily introduced laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicenter of luxury began to circulate at about the year 400 A.D. and continued until about the year 1100 A.D.
Its influence declined during the 1300s mainly due to the fact that Crusaders had returned with gifts such as silk and spices that were valued higher than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this time that the title Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak between the 12th and 13th centuries.
At first clothes were strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture in the East.
However, due to the slow communication routes, Western styles could lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments of the time as a result of the Crusades was that people began to use buttons to attach clothes.
Self-sustaining farms are farms that are carried out for the production of sufficient food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Self-catering farming is a simple, often ecological, system that uses saved seeds originating in the eco-region combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers carried out self-sufficient farming and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel overlooked by society and allow them to find their identity.
Subcultures may be distinct due to the age, ethnicity, class, location and/or sex of the members.
The characteristics that define a subculture that can be of linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual or geographical character, or it can be a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their affiliation through a distinct and symbolic style selection, which includes fashion, manners and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to look at the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, accident or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults during their childhood.
"Such children are called "wild". Some wild children have been shut in by people (usually their own parents); in some cases the abandonment of the child was due to the parents rejecting a child's serious intellectual or physical disabilities."
Wild children may have experienced serious abuse or trauma before being abandoned or fled.
Others are claimed to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wilderness on their own.
When brought up entirely by non-human animals, the wild child displays behaviors (within physical boundaries) almost identical to that of the specific care animal, such as its fear of or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, support education goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but a support to individuals who learn something new, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Support can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of support, but it is also the little gem-man of Microsoft Office.
Virtual support is internalized in the software and is meant to question, guide and explain methods that may have been too challenging for the student to manage for himself.
Children are placed in foster homes for many different reasons, from neglect to abuse and even blackmail.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not educational, caring or educational, but that happens.
We believe that the foster home system is a safe zone for these children.
Our family home system will provide safe homes, loving care providers, stable education and reliable medical care.
Foster homes are there to offer all the necessities that were missing in the home they used to come from.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive features of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of user theory.
For example, "learning" and "socialisation" are proposed as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Even "personal engagement" and "continuous relations" were identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when examining audience reactions to websites."
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial expressions lasting a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that it is possible to determine whether a person is lying by interpreting micro-expressions correctly.
"Oliver Sacks showed in his writing "The President's speech" how people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage can still judge sincerity correctly."
He even claims that we share such knowledge in interpreting human behavior with animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two areas of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of pronounced variation.
Segregation and recombination shovels variations back and forth between the two poles for each new generation.
Out on the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like man to satisfy his need for amino acids from the plants that are available.
Moreover, there is a lack of this serious consequence; retarded growth, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The most accessible plant resources would have been proteins found in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest, unless they are cooked.
By comparison, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible, but also offers high-quality proteins that contain all essential amino acids.
"After all, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way as chimpanzees on the savannah do today."
Sleep interruption is the process of deliberately waking up during your normal sleep period and falling asleep shortly thereafter (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock that brings you closer to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you usually turn off the clock in your sleep, you can set it at the other end of the room so that you have to get out of bed and turn it off.
Other biorythm-based options involve drinking lots of liquid (especially water or tea, a known liquid driver) before sleep, which means you have to go up and pee.
The amount of inner peace a person has correlates opposite to the amount of tension in their body and soul.
The lower the tension, the more positive is the present life force. Each person has the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment, and the only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on Buddha's teachings, but has expanded with the path of love within Mayan and many techniques in Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple; it consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the way of all-encompassing love.
Kundalini yoga brings the kundalini energy (information energy) through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The God-yogan is central to Tibetan meditation. By visualizing different gods, the energy channels are purified, chakras are activated and enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy during the Second World War, leading to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. When the war ended, the differences in systems, process and culture led to the collapse of the countries' cooperation.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and would be physically fought through contract armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize along the Romanian bridge head.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800 000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, after invading the eastern regions of Poland and at the same time violating the Riga peace agreement, the non-attack pact between the Soviet Union and Poland and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
By far the most effective way to move large quantities of people and goods across the seas is to use ships to transport goods.
The fleet's job has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move your people and goods, and at the same time disrupt the enemy's ability to move people and goods.
One of the most remarkable recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II. Americans tried to move troops and materials across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German fleet, mainly using submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain in the same way as the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been domesticated only about 10 000 years ago in the Zagrosbergs in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes had them for milk, fur, meat, and skin.
Tamgettes were usually kept in buckets that wandered on hills or other grazing areas, often tended by shepherds who were many times children or adolescents, similar to the more famous shepherd. These methods of flushing are still used today.
Tramways for wagons were built in England already in the 16th century.
Although wagon tracks consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses that drew them to reach higher speeds and to pull greater loads than on the rougher roads of the past.
Slippers were introduced quite early to keep the tracks in place. However, it was gradually realised that the tracks would be more effective if they had a layer of iron at the top.
This came to be the practice, but the iron tore more on the wagons' wooden wheels.
Wood wheels were eventually replaced by iron wheels. The first rails in iron were introduced in 1767.
The first known mode of transport was hiking, people began walking upright two million years ago when Homo Erectus (meaning the righteous man) saw the light of day.
Their predecessor, australopithecus, did not have the habit of walking uprightly.
Bipedal specializations have been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs already seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can engage in the environmental movement, and we can also become activists to reduce the future suffering to some extent.
This is in many cases as symptomatic treatment, but if we do not just want a temporary solution, we must find the root of the problems and deactivate them.
It is quite clear that the world has changed greatly because of the scientific and technological progress of mankind, and the problems have worsened because of overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of mankind.
After it had been adopted by Congress on 4 July, a handwritten draft, signed by Congress Speaker John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to John Dunlap's printery a few blocks away.
"During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as Dunlap Broadsides."
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon at the farm in Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, which was read to its troops in New York on July 9, and a copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 wide pages of Dunlaps that are known to still exist are the oldest preserved copies of the document. The handwritten original has not been preserved.
Many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and still exist today. We call them birds.
Many do not think of them as dinosaurs, because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things in birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, they lay eggs and they walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Virtually all computers used today are based on manipulation of information coded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1 and these numbers are called binary numbers - or bits to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning is not always noticed immediately. Symptoms such as vomiting are too general for an immediate diagnosis to be made.
The best sign of poisoning can be an open jar of medicine or toxic household chemicals.
See the label for specific first aid instructions for the specific poison.
The term rams is used in the formal sense by entomologists for this group of insects.
This term originates from ancient kinship with bedbugs, insects that are sharply adapted to parasiteize humans.
Both predator beetles and bedbugs are nesters, adapted to live in its host's nest or home.
In the United States there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely to have MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their interest, or in the best interests of their children, to raise a child.
These couples may choose to draw up an adoption plan for their child.
During adoption, biological parents renounce their rights so that another couple can raise the child.
Science's main goal is to find out how the world works through the scientific method. In fact, this method is indicative in almost all research.
However, it is not alone. To experiment, where an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, to ask questions and make observations, also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Bible written in Latin.
Aristotle's view of all scientific issues, including psychology, was accepted.
As knowledge in Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek roots in philosophy and science.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend largely on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms that are not only reactions to external periodic signals, have been documented in most living creatures, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
A biological clock is a self-propelled oscillator that repeats its cycle for a period even in the absence of external influences.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the main indications that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used fager, or virus, to plant their own DNA in a bacterium.
They did two experiments that marked either DNA in the substance with a radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the substance with radioactive sulphur.
Mutations can have a variety of effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected genetic material and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in reproductive cells can be inherited to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Natural-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of experiencing the landscape, including its plant and animal life.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
One example is visiting, photographing and learning more about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning people leave small country towns in cars to go to their jobs and are passed by others whose destination for work is the place they have just left.
In this dynamic shuttle traffic, everyone is somehow connected with, and supports, a transport system based on private carism.
Science now shows that this massive carbon economy has shaken the biosphere from one of its stable states that has supported human development over the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems. Virtually everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries similar complaints about water quality or bridges are rarely heard.
Why do transport systems generate so much complaints, why do they fall on a daily basis? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
Traffic flow is the study of how individual drivers and vehicles move between two points and how they interact with each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flows because pre-work cannot be predicted with 100% safety.
As is well, motorists tend to behave fairly consistently; thus traffic tends to flow on reasonably consistent and can broadly be presented mathematically.
To better represent the traffic flow, relationships have been established between three main variables: (1) flow rate, (2) density and (3) speed.
These conditions are helpful in planning, designing and operating facilities along the road.
Insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly helped them to avoid the enemy more easily and to find food and partners more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along the body.
This gives them more small spaces where they can hide from predators.
Today, the only insects who can't fold their wings are dragonflies and dayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchos said that the solar system moved around the sun.
Some people thought he was right but many believed the opposite; that the solar system moved around the earth, including the sun (and also the other stars).
This makes sense because it doesn't feel like the earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the world's most water-rich and second-longest river. Its water flow is more than 8 times as large as the second-largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on earth, 9 km wide in some places.
As much as 20 percent of the water flowing into the oceans from the rivers of the earth comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon's main channel is 6,387 km. It gets its water gets thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the pyramid building in stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza's size and construction technique were never surpassed.
The ancient Egyptians of the new kingdom marveled at the monuments of their predecessors who were well over a thousand years old at the time.
The Vatican State has about 800 inhabitants; it is the world's smallest independent country and the country with the lowest number of inhabitants.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and in official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All Vatican citizens are Roman Catholics.
People have known basic chemicals such as gold, silver and copper since antiquity, as these can be discovered in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle had a theory that everything consisted of one or more of a total of four elements: soil, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four phases of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he had theories that they switch to new substances to create what we see.
Alloys are a mixture of two or more metals. Remember that there are many different elements in the periodic table.
Substances such as calcium and potassium are counted as metals. There are of course also metals such as silver and gold.
There are also alloys containing small amounts of non-metallic substances such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them can fit into the point at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil was a faithful companion to many people when it came out.
Unfortunately, when newer writing methods have been developed, the pencil has been given lower status and fewer uses.
Today, people write messages on computer screens, and never have to come near a pencil sharpener.
You can only wonder what will become of the keyboard when something newer comes.
The fission bomb is based on the principle that it takes energy to produce a core with many protons and neutrons.
Kind of like rolling a heavy wagon up a hill, splitting the core again, releasing some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, and it does not take much for them to disintegrate.
The surface of the moon is made up of stones and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the far side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the moon seas and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more maria on the nearby side because the crust is thinner there. It made it easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories revolve around finding out what gets people started or what appeals to them.
Theories claim that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they become adults.
These theories look at what makes some people want what they want and what in their environment it is that makes them do or don't do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's needs hierarchy and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
"In general, two behaviors may appear when managers begin to lead their former likes. At one end of the spectrum, the boss tries to remain the ""one in the gang""."
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, performing disciplinary measures, evaluating achievements, assigning responsibilities and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum you turn into an unrecognizable person who feels that he or she must change everything that the team has done and make it his or her own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for whether the team succeeds or fails.
This behaviour often results in gaps between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams maintain the same high standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members tend to act as a contact point for the physical group.
They often have more to say than conventional team members as different time zones can influence when their team can meet and this may not be understood by management locally.
"The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p.109) is also a unique component of a virtual team."
"The "invisible team" is the management team that all members report to. The invisible team sets the standards for each member."
Why would an organisation want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organisation? One goal of starting to use organisational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively in an organization's functional departments, creativity and ingenuity can thrive.
Therefore, the process of an organisation working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that meets the customer's needs.
Before an organisation can become innovative, leadership must create an innovation culture as well as shared knowledge and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) describes the continuum approach as a method used to support organisations in achieving a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological information provides physical evidence of a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition, which makes the research area narrower and much more precise.
The correlation between brain diseases and behavior supports researchers in their research.
It has long been known that various brain damage, traumas, diseases and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The emergence of new technology allows us to see and examine brain structures and processes that we have not seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and materials to build simulation models that help us understand processes in our mind.
Although AI is strongly associated with science fiction, it is a very important branch of computer science that includes machine behavior, learning and intelligence.
Research in AI is about getting machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples of this are control, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, and also recognition of handwriting, voice and face.
Such things have become separate disciplines, focusing on offering solutions to real problems.
The AI system is now widely used in economics, medicine, technology and the military, and has been built into several home computers and video games software applications.
Field studies are a large part of the teaching in each class. Often the teacher wants to take the students to places where there are no buses.
Technology offers solutions with virtual study visits. Students can watch museum objects, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art sitting with their class.
Sharing a study trip virtual is also a good way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students from Bennet school in North carolina each year design a website about their trip to the state capital; the website is redesigned every year, but previous versions may remain online as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. Students often start their blog experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of readers improves this in general.
Since students are often the most critical readers, the blogger tries to write better to avoid criticism.
In addition, blogging forces students to become more aware of the outside world. The requirement to satisfy readers' interest stimulates students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning beyond the traditional school day.
"Suitable use of blogs" can give students the opportunity to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to internet material, students can define their positions in relation to what others have written, and explain their own perspectives on specific questions (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital and offers a series of galleries and museums showing Canada's present and past.
Further south is Niagara Falls and in the northern part is Muscoka's beautiful, untouched nature.
All of this and more, Ontario stands out with what outsiders consider to be the quintessence of Canada.
Large areas further north are very sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that surprises many: There are more African-Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and its own continent in terms of fauna.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or belong to France, and are known as luxurious seaside resorts.
The Arabs also introduced Islam to the areas, which had a great impact in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century after Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama rounded the Cape of Good Hope and thus found the sea route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered to the north by the Sahel and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is good to also wear a ring (not just one that looks too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences can result in what they would consider harassment, and it is not uncommon for someone to follow you, grab your arm, etc.
Be firm when you say no to men and don't be afraid to stand on you (cultural differences don't do it ok!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen during the 1000s B.C. and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and the Merenides as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca. only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the town of Daru l-Badya, which was named Casablanca by Spanish traders who established commercial bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping throughout Morocco.
Around the old Medina it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan products, such as tagine, ceramics, leather products, water pipes and a whole range of krimkrams, but that all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of Congo, located far east of the Rwandan border.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially in the central parts.
Goma is fairly safe, but if you're going to visit outside Goma, you should look into what it looks like with the fighting in the northern Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing the volcano Nyiragongo along with some of the cheapest tracks of mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price for the short trip is about 500 Congolese francs.
"Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has come to be used as a metaphor for exotic, distant places."
Today Timbuktu is a poor city, but its reputation makes it a tourist destination, and it has an airport.
In 1990 it was included in the list of threatened World Heritage Sites due to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the major sites under the Henry Louis Gates PBS program Wonders of the African World.
The city stands in stark contrast with the other cities of the country, with an atmosphere that is Arab rather than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and extends along the border with Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north, while the southern border is Crocodile river.
The park covers 19 500 km2 and is divided into 14 different eco-zones, each of which houses different wildlife.
It is one of the biggest sights in South Africa and it is considered to be the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all other South African national parks, the park charges daily conservation and entrance fees.
It can also be beneficial to buy a Wild Card, which either provides access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives Hong Kong's territory its name and is the place that many tourists consider to be the main focus.
The row buildings that make up Hong Kong's silhouette have been likened to a glittering bar chart reinforced by the water in Victoria's port.
To see the best prospects in Hong Kong, leave the island and head to Kowloon's sea side opposite.
The vast majority of the settlements on Hong Kong Island are densely packed together on the former seabed along the northern coast.
This is the place the British colonists took over, so if you're looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest coastal cave belt in the world and extends 80 km into Bangladesh and the Indian hinterland from the coast.
Sundarbans has been adopted on the UNESCO World Heritage List. The part of the forest located on Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not just mangrove swamps — they contain some of the last remaining settlements of the great jungles that once covered the Gangess plain.
Sundarban covers an area of 3 850 km2, of which about a third consists of wetlands.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife reserve, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and some 30 000 axial deer in the area.
Buses depart from the district-wide bus station (over the river) all day, but most, especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang, go between 6.30 and 7.30.
Since buses between the districts are often full, it is a good advice to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and stable.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to get to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Now) and Punakha (200 Now).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is a cable bridge that stretches across the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise up 83 metres, it is 378 metres long and has two passages 3,50 metres wide.
The vertical free height under the bridge is 15 metres. Construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened for traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is planned to be operational in September 2017, when Brazilian customs stations are expected to be completed.
Guaraní was the most important indigenous group that inhabited the present eastern Paraguay and lived as semi-Nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistant agriculture.
The Chaco region was populated by other indigenous tribes such as Guaycurú and Payaguá, who lived as hunters, collectors and fishermen.
"In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as "The Giant Province of India", was born as a result of the encounter between the Spanish conquerors and indigenous indigenous groups."
The Spaniards began the colonization period that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its domestic character and identity.
Argentina is well known because their polo team and players are among the best in the world.
This year's biggest tournament takes place in December at the polo courses in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here during other times of the year.
For tournament news and where to buy tickets to polomatcher, turn to Asociacion Argentina de polo.
The official Falklands currency is the Falklandspundet (FKP) whose value corresponds to the value of a British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley opposite the store FIC West.
GBP is usually received everywhere on the islands, and within Stanley it is often possible to pay by credit card and USD.
Credit cards will probably not be accepted on the remote islands, but British and American currency can be received; contact the owners in advance to determine what is an acceptable payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falklandscurrency outside the islands, so exchange money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone; during the summer months temperatures above +30°C are common
Winter can be deceptively cold: the temperature rarely falls below zero, but the wind and humidity combine and make it feel colder than the thermometer says.
"There are no special "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rain remains roughly the same throughout the year."
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, the wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authorities, you should stay at least 100 meters from bears and wolves and 25 meters from all other wild animals!
No matter how docile they look, bison, moose, candah deer, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year dozens of visitors are injured because they did not keep adequate distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
Remember, too, that odors attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid having or cooking food that smells and keep the camp clean.
The capital of Samoa is called Apia. It is located on the island of Upolu and has a population just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been Samoa's official capital since 1959.
The port was the scene of a notorious stalemate in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk, except for one British cruiser, nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful assembly in the city led to the murder of the highest chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches because of Auckland's location between two ports. The most popular beaches are divided into three areas.
North Shore's beaches (in the North Harbour district) are located on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of them are sandy beaches where it is safe to swim, and on most of them the Maori ant offers shade.
Tamaki Drives beaches are located on the Waitemata Harbour, in the exclusive suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes well visited family beaches with a good selection of shops located by the beach. Swimming is safe.
"The main local beer is "Number one", which is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta"."
There are many French wines, but the New Zealand and Australian wines may manage the trip better.
Local drinking water is completely safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you are worried.
"For the Australians, the idea of a flat white. A "short black" is "espresso", cappuccino has a pile of cream (not foam) and tea is served without milk."
The hot chocolate milk meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
There are many trips to the reef all year round and injuries due to any of these causes on the reef are rare.
Yet, take the advice of the authorities, obey all signs and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Kubmanets occur near beaches and near estuaries from October to April north of 1770. They can sometimes also be found at other times.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and would swim away.
The main habitat of the saltwater crocodile lies in the estuaries north of Rockhampton, so they do not usually live in the sea.
Booking in advance gives the traveller security and an assurance that they will have somewhere to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with special hotels, but it may be possible to book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies often offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, and even package tours that combine flights and hotels.
They may also reserve your reservation for you if you need time to reconsider the offer or obtain additional documents required for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, all changes and requests should go through the travel agency first, and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of the visitors of the music festival decide to camp on site, and most visitors see it as an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close where things happen, you have to come early to get a campsite near the music.
Remember that although the music performances on the main stage have stopped, parts of the festival can continue to play music until late into the night.
Some festivals have special campsites for families with small children.
If you cross the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the cab, because going through ice causes really terrible sounds for those who are most affected.
Cruises to Saint Petersburg include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (see conditions).
Casinos usually do everything they can to get guests to spend as much time and money as possible. There are often no windows or watches, and the exits are often difficult to find.
They usually have special offers of food, drink and pleasure to keep the guests in good spirits and make them stay in the room.
Some establishments offer alcoholic beverages free of charge. However, intoxication impairs judgment, and all good players know how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone travelling at high latitudes or above mountain passes should be aware that snow, ice and temperatures below freezing point may occur.
On icy and snowy roads the friction is low and you cannot drive in the same way as on bare asphalt.
During snowstorms there may fall enough snow in a very short time for you to get stuck.
Visibility may also be limited by snowfall or snowyness or by condensation or ice on the vehicle window.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues largely uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the largest tourism industry in Africa and the highlight of many visitors.
The term safari in popular use refers to trips across the country to see the amazing African wild animals, especially on the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to cars and with standard equipment it is possible to see them well.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and you see them better with binoculars.
"Going safari (also called "bush walk" and "hiking safari") consists of hiking either for a few hours or for several days."
Paralympics will take place between August 24 and September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other places around Japan.
Tokyo will be the only city in Asia that has hosted two summer Olympics, since they hosted the Games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the launch was announced, you can be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies related to the Corona virus are different, but by the end of March most do not go as far as July 2020, when the Olympic Games would have begun.
It is expected that most tickets to events will cost between 2 500 and 130 000 yen, with a typical ticket price around 7,000 yen.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board that can be borrowed, even if it is not in the room.
If no iron is available, or if you do not want to wear ironed socks, try using a hair dryer, if available.
Be vigilant and do not let the fabric get too hot (which can cause shrinkage or in extreme cases burning).
There are different ways to clean water, and some are more effective against specific dangers.
In some areas it is enough to boil the water for one minute, in others it takes several minutes.
Filters may vary in efficiency, and if you are unsure you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from an established company.
Travellers may encounter pests they are not familiar with from their home regions.
Harmful animals can destroy food, cause irritation or, in the worst case, allergic reactions, spread poison or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases, or dangerous animals that can harm or kill people by violence, are usually not classified as pests.
Tax-free shopping is the possibility to buy goods without tax or other supplements in some places.
Travellers on their way to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The route between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh road, which often goes through isolated forest terrain.
If you are not used to driving on highways, drive with reason: steep gradients, narrow lanes and cross curves are commonplace.
The speed limits set are noticeably lower than in previous and subsequent sections - usually 56-64 km/h (35-40 mph) - and that they are followed is even more important than otherwise.
Strangely enough, mobile coverage is much better here than on many other routes, such as Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are really good, and in Bavaria they are quite powerful and varied, similar to those from the neighbor in the south, Austria.
Bakings with fruit are common, with apples baked in pastries all year round as well as cherries and plums during the summer.
Many German pastries also have almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. Popular cakes are often especially suitable with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want small but powerful pastries you can try what depending on the region is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, along with either meat or vegetables.
"A curry can be either "dry" or "moist" depending on the amount of liquid."
In northern India and Pakistan's inland regions yoghurt is often used in curry dishes; in southern India and some of the subcontinent's coastal regions, coconut milk is often used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is a collective name that includes a wide variety of regional dishes spread throughout the country.
But if it is used without words of determination, the term tends to mean the food that originally came from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
The Javanese cuisine, now available everywhere in the island kingdom, offers an array of simply seasoned dishes, where the flavorers most used by the Javanese are peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
Stigbyglar is support for the rider's feet hanging down on both sides of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider but may pose a safety risk as the rider's feet can get stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown by a horse but is stuck with a foot in the stirrup, he can be dragged if the horse runs away. To minimize this risk, a number of security measures can be taken.
First of all, most riders have heeled boots and a smooth, rather narrow sole.
Then some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that make sure that a stirrup loosens from the saddle if it is pulled back by a rider who falls off.
The Cochamó Valley, Chile's main climbing destination, is known as South America's Yosemite, and has a number of large cliffs and granite walls.
The mountain peaks offer views that can take your breath out. Climbers from all corners of the world are constantly creating new routes among the countless mountain walls.
Cross-country skiing, which includes skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports where you glide down a snow-covered landscape with skis or a snowboard strapped to your feet.
Skiing is an activity that attracts many enthusiasts, sometimes called
The idea of skiing is very old – cave paintings depicting skiers date back as far as 5 000 BC!
Excurring as a sport has been around at least since the 1600s, and in 1861 the first leisure ski club of Norwegians was opened in Australia.
Backpacking on skis: this activity is also called backcountry skiing, tour skiing or skiing.
It is related to but usually does not involve alpine skiing or mountain climbing, the latter is performed in steep terrain and requires much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski trail as on a similar hiking trail.
In good conditions, you will be able to cope with slightly greater distances than when walking – but you only rarely get up at speeds like in cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack in prepared tracks.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small, but with many independent countries; under normal circumstances, travelling through several countries would mean going through visa applications and passport controls on a number of occasions.
However, the Schengen area functions like a country in this respect.
As long as you stay in this zone you can generally cross borders without going through passport checks more times.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa in each Schengen Member State separately, thus saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of which manufactured items are antiques. Some tax offices define goods older than 100 years as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where age limits may be shorter in North America, for example, than in Europe.
Handicraft products can be defined as antiques, although they are not as old as similar mass-produced goods.
reindeer husbandry is an important livelihood for the Sami people, and the culture surrounding trade is also important for many with other professions.
Even historically, however, not all Sami have been involved in large-scale reindeer husbandry, but lived from fishing, hunting and the like and used the reindeer most as draft animals.
Today, many Sami people work in modern industries. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the area of the Sami people.
"Even though it is often used, especially among non-romania, the word "gypsy" is often considered offensive because of its association with negative stereotypes and erroneous conceptions of Romani peoples."
If the country you are visiting is subject to a travel restriction, your travel health insurance or cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may also want to consult governments other than your own, but their advice is designed for their own inhabitants.
For example, for US citizens in the Middle East there may be other circumstances compared to Europeans or Arabs.
A travel council is just a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The picture presented is often quick, general and translucent compared to the more detailed information available from elsewhere.
Extreme weather is the general term for all dangerous weather phenomena with the potential to cause damage, serious social disturbances or the loss of human life.
Severe weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different varieties of them, which can be due to geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong wind, hail, heavy precipitation and wildfire are the types and consequences of extreme weather, such as thunderstorms, tornadoes, skies and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal serious weather phenomena include heavy snowstorms, dizzy weather, ice storms and sand storms.
Travellers are strongly recommended to be aware of the risk of harsh weather affecting their area, as it may affect travel plans.
Anyone who plans to visit a country that can be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
"A search on the Internet for anti-environment education will probably provide the address of a local company."
A course usually goes through all the questions mentioned here but much more detailed, usually with practical exercises.
A course normally lasts between 2-5 days and includes role-playing, very first aid and sometimes weapons training.
There are plenty of books on how to survive in the wilderness, while books on war zones are rare.
Travellers planning sex-correcting operations abroad must ensure that they hold valid documents for the return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports without the specified sex (X) or documents that are updated to match a desired name or gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to accept these documents varies just as much.
Security searches have also become much more intrusive in the post-11 September 2001 period.
Transmitters who have not undergone an operation shall not expect to be able to pass through the X-ray with integrity and dignity retained.
Rip currents are the returning flow from waves that break off at the beach, often at a reef or similar.
The underwater topology allows the reflow to be concentrated in a few deeper parts, and strong currents that lead to deep water can form there.
Most deaths occur as a result of exhaustion after trying to swim back countercurrents, which may be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the stream, it's no harder than normal to swim back.
Try to aim somewhere where you don't get caught again or, depending on your skills and whether you've been discovered, wait to be saved.
The return shock comes earlier than the cultural shock (there is not as much of a honeymoon phase), lasts longer and can be more serious.
Travellers who have had an easy time adapting to new cultures sometimes find it difficult to adapt to their original culture.
On your return from living abroad, you have adapted to a new culture and lost some of your home culture's habits.
When you first traveled abroad, people were likely patient and understanding, because of the knowledge that travellers in a new country have to adapt.
People may not expect patience and understanding also to be necessary for travelers returning home.
The pyramids' sound and light show is one of the most interesting things for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the performance begins.
Usually you always hear the sounds of tourists and sellers. The sound and light story is just like a storybook.
The background is Sphinxen, which tells a long story.
The scenes appear on the pyramids, and the different pyramids become illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, claim several countries and have the most bases, including sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of Halvön. The largest island is King George Island with the community of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception where the flooded crater into an active volcano constitutes a spectacular natural harbor.
The country of Ellsworth is the region south of the peninsula, bordering the Bellingshausen Sea.
The peninsula's mountain melts together with the plateau and then returns to form the 360 km long Ellsworth mountain chain, which is divided in half by the Minnesota glacier.
The northern part or the Sentinel Range has Antarctica's highest mountain, the Vinson massif, with a peak of 4892 m in Mount Vinson.
In remote places without mobile coverage, a satellite phone can be your only option.
A satellite telephone generally does not replace a mobile phone, since it is necessary to be outdoors with a clear line of view to the satellite in order to be able to call.
The service is often used by ships, including pleasure boats, as well as expeditions that need remote data and voices.
Your local telecommunications operator should be able to provide you with more information on how to connect to this service.
Travelling and learning is an increasingly popular option for those planning a free year.
This is particularly popular among recent graduates, allowing them to take a year off before the university without compromising their education.
In many cases enrolling in a sabbatical course abroad can actually increase the chances of entering a higher education in your home country.
Usually a fee is charged for registering on these teaching programmes.
Finland is very boat-friendly. The land of the thousand lakes also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and in the archipelagos.
In the archipelago and lakes you do not necessarily need a yacht.
Although the archipelagos and the largest lakes are really large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak can offer another experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with a boat of every seventh or eighth person.
This is matched by Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is otherwise quite unique (e.g. in the Netherlands the figure is one in forty).
Most of the specific Baltic cruises include a longer break in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a couple of full days while returning to and sleeping on the ship at night.
If you only go ashore with ship excursions, you do not need a separate visa (from 2009).
Some cruises include the German capital Berlin in its brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not located near the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by air can be a frightening experience for people, regardless of their age and background, especially if they have never flown before or experienced a traumatic event.
It is not something to be ashamed of: it is not different from the personal fear and reluctance of other things that very many people have.
Understanding how aircraft work and what happens during a flight can help some people to overcome a fear caused by discomfort before the unknown or by not having control.
Courier companies are well paid to deliver things quickly. Often, time is very important when it comes to business documents, merchandise or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes the larger companies have their own aircraft, but for other routes and smaller companies there was a problem.
If they have sent things with air cargo, it may have taken several days on certain routes to go through unloading and customs.
The only way to get it out faster was to send it as checked baggage. Airlines regulations do not allow you to send baggage without a passenger, and this is where you come in.
The obvious way to fly in first class or business class is to push out with a lot of money for the privilege (or even better, let your business do it for you).
However, this does not come at a cheap price: as a rough rule of thumb you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy price for business and eleven times for first class!
In general, there is no point even looking for discounts for business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
The airlines are well aware that there is a certain core group of travelers who are prepared to pay well for the privilege of travelling somewhere quickly and comfortably. The companies also charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is common.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has been affected by ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but which is not recognised by any of the Member States of the United Nations.
Economic relations have been restored between these two parts of Moldova, despite the failure of the political negotiations.
The largest religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
中zmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of about 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transport hub.
The city, which in historical times was called Smyrna, is today a modern, developed city and a lively commercial center located at a huge harbor surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, glass facade buildings and modern shopping centres are mixed with traditional red tiled roofs, the 18th century market and old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere that is more like Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers a view of the nearby island of Eysturoy, and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery there are interesting marble statues of pigeons over some of the graves.
It is worth wandering around half an hour in the captivating village.
Within the reach of the north is the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, which became famous among foreigners after a shimmering account of its grandeur by Lord Byron.
Scotturb bus 403 drives regularly to Sintra, stopping at Cabo da Roca.
In the north, also visit the amazing Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima, a place world famous for the revelations of Mary.
Remember, you are actually visiting a mass grave site and a place that has an almost incalculable impact on a significant part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women in life who survived their time here, and many more who had loved ones murdered or worked to death here; Jews as well as non-Jews.
Use the website with the great dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves. Don't joke about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not vandalize the site by painting or scraping graffiti on structures.
Barcelona's official languages are Catalan and Spanish. About half prefer to speak Catalan, an overwhelming majority understand it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, most of the signs are only in Catalan, since according to law it is the primary official language.
However, Spanish is also used in many places in public transport and other facilities.
Common messages in the subway are only made in Catalan, but unplanned interference is communicated by an automated system in a variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being egocentric, rude and arrogant.
"Although this is often just a wrong stereotype, the best way to get by in Paris is still to behave in the best way and act like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-mannered). It will make it considerably easier to get around."
The brusque appearance of the Parisians will quickly disappear if you show yourself from your polite side.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is covered with dense forest, mainly with beech, spruce and fir, and has a mix of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a striking diversity of species, due to the extent of microclimates, different soils and varying altitude differences.
The area is also home to an extreme diversity of animal and bird species.
Rare animal species such as European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wild cat and feather are there, along with many more common species
When visiting the monasteries, women must wear skirts that cover their knees, and also have their shoulders covered.
Most monasteries give shawls to women who have not prepared themselves in advance, but if you bring your own, especially one with bright colors, you get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
According to the same logic, men have to dress in trousers that cover their knees.
This can also be borrowed from the warehouse in the entrance but those garments are not washed after each person so you may not feel comfortable using these skirts. One size fits all applies to men!
Mallorcan food, like that in similar areas around the Mediterranean Sea, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and uses consistently olive oil.
A simple, popular dinner, especially during the summer, is Pa amb Oli: Bread with olive oil, tomato, and optional available accessories such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, as well as Sie for the pronoun you, are written with a large initial letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important method of distinguishing between certain verbs and objects.
According to some, it also makes it easier to read, although the need to find out if a verb or adjective is in noun form makes writing somewhat more complicated.
The pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written
The letters to watch out for are c and g, because their pronunciation varies on the basis of the following vowel.
Also make sure to pronounce r and r different: caro means love, while carro means wagon.
Persian has relatively easy and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, you can get good help in learning a lot about Persian grammar and understanding sentences better if you read this grammar textbook.
It will, of course, be easier for you to learn Portuguese if you already know a Romance language.
But people who know a little Spanish can quickly conclude that Portuguese is sufficiently similar because it does not need to be studied separately.
Pre-modern observatories are usually obsolete today and remain as museums or training places.
Since light pollution during their heyday was not the kind of problem they are today, it is usually found in cities or university areas, easier to reach than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities in remote locations with favourable atmospheric conditions.
Hanami, or the sight of cherry blossoms, has been part of Japanese culture since the 700s.
The concept came from China where plum flowers were used.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom feasts were held by the emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.
Plants look best in their natural environment, so try to resist the temptation to remove only one.
"If you visit an arranged garden, and you pick a "copy" it will also have you thrown out, without discussion."
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to stay and very easy to navigate in, and you can buy almost anything after arrival.
"But with its location in the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator, you must handle both heat (always) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, less often)."
There are also a small number of buses going north to Hebron, the traditional burial site where the Bible patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives rest.
Check that the bus that you are thinking of taking goes to Hebron, and not only to the nearby Jewish settlement Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good starting point to base a vacation around.
For example, visit the castle in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley or take a boat trip to interesting cities on the Danube or a trip along the Erie Canal.
They also define routes for popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important weekends in Christianity and is celebrated as Jesus' birthday.
Many of the traditions around the weekend have also been raised by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition of spending Easter night awake at some open place to see the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may well be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter Night Mass on Saturday evening during the Easter weekend. At midnight the congregation then breaks up to celebrate Christ's resurrection.
All the animals that originally arrived in the islands came here by either swimming, flying or floating.
Because of the long distance from the continent, mammals could not cross, so the giant turtle became the primary grazing animal on Galapagos.
Since man arrived in the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience polar nights, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a good opportunity to see the northern lights, as the sky is dark more or less around the clock.
Since the areas are sparsely populated, and thus light pollution is often not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the starry sky.
The Japanese working culture is more hierarchical and formal than Westerners may be accustomed to.
Costume is the normal business outfit, and colleagues appeal to each other by surname or by job title.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, emphasising joint efforts rather than highlighting the performance of individuals.
Workers often need the approval of their superiors for all decisions they make and are expected to follow the instructions of their superiors without hesitation.
