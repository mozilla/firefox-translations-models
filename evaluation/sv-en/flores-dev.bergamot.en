As a winner-takes-all-state, Florida awarded all fifty of its delegates to Romney, and pushed him forward as the premiership for the nomination of the Republican Party.
The organisers said around 100 000 people joined up to protest in German cities such as Berlin, Cologne, Hamburg and Hanover.
In Berlin, police estimated there were 6,500 protesters.
Protests also took place in Paris, Sofia in Bulgaria, Vilnius, Lithuania, Valetta in Malta, Tallinn in Estonia, as well as Edinburgh and Glasgow in Scotland.
In London, around 200 people protested outside some major copyright holders' offices.
Last month, large protests were held in Poland when the country signed ACTA, which led to the Polish government deciding to not ratify the agreement until further notice.
Latvia and Slovakia have both postponed the process of connecting to ACTA.
Animal Liberation and the Royal Society for the Prevention of cruelty to animals (RSPCA) again require it to become mandatory to install CCTV cameras in all Australian slaughterhouses.
Chief Inspector David O'Shannessy at RSPCA New South Wales told ABC that surveillance and inspections of slaughterhouses should be standard in Australia.
""Monitoring photography would certainly send a strong signal to those who work with animals that their welfare is of the highest priority.""
The United States Geological Survey's earthquake map did not show any earthquakes in Iceland in the previous week.
The Icelandic weather office also reported no earthquake activity in the Hekla area in the last 48 hours.
The noticeable earthquake activity that led to the phase change occurred on March 10 on the northeastern side of the volcano's peak caldera.
Dark clouds, which had nothing to do with volcanic activity, had been observed at the foot of the mountain.
The clouds created the potential for confusion as to whether an actual outbreak had occurred.
The luno had 120-160 cubic meters of fuel on board as it broke and strong winds and waves pushed it into the breakwater.
The twelve crew members were rescued by helicopter, and the only injury was a broken nose.
The 100-metre-long ship was on its way to pick up its usual cargo of fertilisers, and authorities initially feared the ship could spill some of its cargo.
The proposed addition was voted on in both houses in 2011.
A change was implemented during this legislature session, in which the second sentence was first removed by the House of Representatives, and then approved in a similar form of the Senate on Monday.
The failure of the second sentence, which proposes a ban on same-sex civil unions, could possibly open the door for civil trade unions in the future.
After the preparation, HJR-3 will be reviewed again by the next elected Legislative Assembly, either in 2015 or 2016 to keep the process active.
The achievements of the Vautians in addition to directing include a hunger strike in 1973 against what he considered political censorship.
French law changed. His activism went back to when he was 15 years old, when he joined the French resistance during World War II.
He documented himself in a book in 1998.
In the 1960s, he travelled back to Algeria, which has recently become independent to teach film directing.
Japanese judo practitioner Hitoshi Saito who has won two Olympic gold medals, has died aged 54.
The cause of death was cited as intrahepatic bile cancer.
He died in Osaka on Tuesday.
In addition to his status as Olympic champion and world champion, Saito was at the time of his death also chairman of the All Japan Judo Federation training committee.
At least 100 people attended the party to celebrate the anniversary of the couple who married last year.
A formal celebration of the anniversary was scheduled to be held at a later date, according to the authorities.
The couple had married in Texas a year earlier and came to Buffalo to celebrate with family and friends.
The 30-year-old man, who was born in Buffalo, was one of the four killed in the shooting, but his wife was not injured.
Karno is a well-known but controversial English teacher at Modern Education and King's Glory who claimed to have 9 000 students at the peak of their career.
In his notes, he used words that some parents considered gross, and reportedly used swearing during classes.
Modern Education accused him of printing large ads on buses without permission and lied by saying he was the main English supervisor.
He has also previously been accused of copyright infringement but was not prosecuted.
"A former student said he ""used slang in class, taught dating skills through notes and was just like the students' friend.""
In the last three decades, China has developed a market economy, even though it is officially still a communist state.
The first economic reforms were carried out under the leadership of the Deng Xiaoping.
Since then, China's economy has grown by 90 times.
Last year, China first exported more cars than Germany and surpassed the United States as the largest market for this industry.
China's GDP could be greater than America's within two decades.
Hurricane Danielle, the fourth named storm in the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season, has been formed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean.
The storm, which is approximately 3 000 English miles from Miami, Florida, has a maximum wind strength of 64 km/h.
Scientists at the National Hurricane Center predict that Danielle will increase in strength to a hurricane by Wednesday.
Because the storm is far from land, it is still difficult to assess potential impact on the United States or the Caribbean.
Bolek, born in the Croatian capital Zagreb, was praised when he played for Partizan Belgrade.
He joined them in 1945 and stayed until 1958.
During his time in the team, he scored 403 goals on 468 occasions.
No one has ever played more games or scored more goals for the club than Bobek.
In 1995 he was voted Partizan's best player of all time.
The celebration began with a special performance by the world-famous group of Cirque du Soleil.
It was followed by Istanbul's state symphony orchestra, a Janissary band, and the singers Fatih Erkoç and Müslüm Gürs.
Then the swirling dervishes captured the scene.
The Turkish divan Sezen Aksu performed with the Italian tenor Alessandro Safina and Greek singer Haris Alexiou.
"In conclusion, the dance group Fire of Anatolia erected from Turkey the performance ""Troja""."
Peter Lenz, a 13-year-old motorcycle contestant, has died after being in for a crash on the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
During the warm-up shipyard, Lenz fell off his motorcycle and was subsequently hit by his fellow competitor Xavier Zayat.
He was immediately cared for by medicated on site and transported to a local hospital, where he later died.
Zayat survived unscathed out of the accident.
"As for the global economic situation, Zapatero continued to say that ""the financial system is part of the economy, a crucial part.""
We have a financial crisis that has lasted for a year, where the last two months have been the most acute, and I think the financial markets are now starting to recover.”
Last week, Naked News announced a dramatic increase in its international language mandate for news reporting, with three new broadcasts.
The global organization is already reporting in English and Japanese, and now Spanish, Italian and Korean programs for TV, web and mobile devices are also being launched.
""Fortunately nothing happened to me, but I saw a macabre scene when people tried to smash windows to get out.""
People hit the windows with chairs, but the windows were unbreakable.
"One of the squares was eventually smashed and they started coming out the window," said surviving Franciszek Kowal.
Stars emit light and heat due to the energy created when hydrogen atoms merge to form heavier elements.
Scientists are working on building a reactor that can create energy in the same way.
However, this is a very difficult problem to solve and it will take many years before we see ready-made, useful fusion reactors.
The steel needle floats on top of the water due to surface tension.
Surface tension occurs when water molecules at the water surface are attracted more strongly to each other than to the molecules in the air above them.
"The water molecules form an invisible ""skin"" on the water surface, causing things like the needle to float on top of the water. "
The rail on a modern skate has a double edge with a concave hollow between them. The two edges allow for a better grip on the ice, even when tilted.
When the underside of the rail is slightly curved, the edge that is in contact with the ice is also curvatured, when the rail is tilted to one side or the other.
This makes the skater turn. If the skates tilt to the right turns, the skaters go right, if the skates tilt to the left turns the skier to the left.
To return to their previous energy level, they must get rid of the extra energy they got from the light.
They do this by sending away a photon, which is a small piece of light particle.
"Scientists call this process ""stimulated emission of radiation"," because the atoms are stimulated by the bright light, causing the emission of a light photon, and light is a type of radiation. "
The next image shows how the atoms emit photons. In reality, of course, the photons are much smaller than the ones in the picture.
Photos are even smaller than the components of an atom!
After hundreds of hours in operation, the filament finally burns off and the bulb ceases to work.
Then the light bulb needs to be replaced. It is important to be careful when replacing the light bulb.
First, the switch to the lamp fixture must be turned off or the cord disconnected.
This is because electricity flows to the plinth where the metallic part of the bulb sits and can give you a strong shock if you touch the inside of the socket or the metal base of the bulb when it is partially inserted into the plinth.
The main organ of the cardiovascular system is the heart, which pumps the blood.
Blood emanates from the heart of tubes called arteries and returns to the heart in tubes called veins. The narrowest pipes are called capillaries.
A ceratop's teeth would have been able to crush not only leaves but also very hard branches and roots.
Some scientists believe that tricateps to cyats, which is a kind of plant that was common under Crete.
These seedlings look like a small palm tree with a crown of sharp, thorny leaves.
A Triceratops could have used its strong beak to pull the leaves off before eating the tree trunk.
Other scientists claim that these plants are highly toxic and that it is not likely that any dinosaur ate them, although today's sloths and other animals such as the parrot (a descendant of the dinosaurs) can eat toxic leaves or fruit.
How would Ios gravity affect me? If you stood on the surface of Io, you would weigh less than you do on earth.
A person weighing 200 pounds (90 kg) on Earth would weigh 36 pounds (16 kg) on Io. So, of course, gravity draws less in you.
The sun has no crust like the Earth that you can stand on. The entire sun is made of gases, fire and plasma.
The gas gets thinner the longer you get from the sun's core.
"The outermost part that we see when we look at the sun is called the photosphere, meaning ""light ball""."
About three thousand years later, in 1610, the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei used a telescope to see that Venus has phases, just as the moon has.
Phases occur because only the side of Venus (or the Moon) facing the sun is illuminated. Venus's phases supported Copernicus' theory that the planets move around the Sun.
A few years later, in 1639, an English astronomer named Jeremiah Horrock saw a transit of Venus.
England experienced a long period of peace after the reconquest of the Dane Act.
In 991, on the other hand, Ethelred was met by a Viking raft larger than any other since Guthrums a century earlier.
This fleet was led by Olaf Trygvasson, a Norwegian with the ambition to reclaim his country from the Danish domination.
After suffering adversity at the beginning, Ethelred managed to reach an agreement with Olaf, who returned to Norway to successfully try to win his kingdom.
Hangul is the only intentionally invented alphabet in general daily use. The alphabet was invented in 1444 during the reign of King Sejong (1418-1450).
King Sejong was the fourth king during the Joseon dynasty and is one of the most reputable.
"From the beginning, he gave the Hangeul alphabet the name Hunmin Jeongeum, which means ""the right sounds for the enlightenment of the people""."
There are many theories about how Sanskrit came into being. One of them is about how an Aryan migration from the west and into India brought the language.
Sanskrit is an ancient language and is comparable to the Latin language spoken in Europe.
The earliest known book in the world was written in Sanskrit. After the compilation of the Uthaneouss, Sanskrit disappeared gradually because of hierarchy.
Sanskrit is a complex and rich language that has given rise to many modern Indian languages, in the same way that Latin underpins European languages such as French and Spanish.
When the battle for France was over, Germany began preparing the invasion of the island of Britain.
"Germany used the codename ""Operation Sea Lion"" for the attack. Most of the British army's heavy weapons and supplies had been lost when it was evacuated from Dunkirk, so the army was quite weak."
"But the Royal Fleet was still much stronger than the German navy ("Kriegsmarine") and could destroy any invasion fleet that was sent across the English Channel."
By contrast, few Royal Navy ships were based near probable invasion routes because the Admirals were afraid they would be sunk by German air attacks.
"Let's start with an explanation of Italy's plans. Italy was essentially the "little brother" of Germany and Japan."
They had a weaker army and a weaker navy, despite having built four new ships just before the war began.
Italy was mainly looking for African countries. To conquer these, a stepping stone was needed for the Italian troops, allowing them to sail across the Mediterranean and invade Africa.
For that, they have to get rid of British bases and ships in Egypt. Beyond that, Italy's warships would do nothing.
Now to Japan. Japan was an island nation, just like Britain.
Submarines are ships designed to travel underwater and remain there for a long time.
Submarines were used during World War I and World War II. At the time, they were very slow and had a very limited range.
At the beginning of the war they mostly traveled in overwater mode, but as the radar developed and became more precisely, the submarines were forced to under the surface to avoid being detected.
The Germans had submarines that they were very good at controlling and managing.
Due to its successes with submarines, Germany was not allowed to have many of them after the war.
"Yes! King Tutankhamun, sometimes referred to as ""King Tut"" or ""The Boy King,"" is one of the most famous ancient Egyptian kings of modern times.
Interestingly, he was not considered to be particularly important in ancient times and was not registered in most ancient royal lists.
But the discovery of his tomb in 1922 made him a celebrity. While many older graves were looted, this grave was left virtually untouched.
Most of the objects buried with Tutankhamon have been well preserved, including thousands of artifacts made from precious metals and rare stones.
The invention of wheels with spokesmen made the Assyrian wagons easier, faster and better equipped to drive faster than soldiers and other wagons.
Arrows from their deadly crossbows could penetrate the armor of enemy soldiers. About 1000 BC, the Assyrians introduced the first cavalry.
A cavalry is an army fighting on horseback. The saddle had not yet been invented, so the Assyrian cavalry fought on the horses' only backs.
We know many Greek politicians, scientists and artists. Perhaps the most famous person from this culture is Homer, the legendary blind poet who wrote two of the masterpieces of Greek literature: the poems Iliad and the Odyssey.
Sophocles and Aristophanes are still popular screenwriters and their plays are considered among the greatest works in world literature.
Another famous Greek is the mathematician Pythagoras, who is best known for his famous proposition about the relationship between the sides in right-angled triangles.
There are different estimates for how many people are talking Hindi. It is appreciated to be the second and fourth most spoken language in the world.
The number of people who have the language as their mother tongue varies depending on whether you are counting similar dialects.
Estimates range between 340 million and 500 million speakers and as many as 800 million people can understand the language.
Hindi and Urdu have similar vocabulary but the written language differs; in everyday conversations, speakers in both languages can usually understand each other.
Around the 15th century, Germany had a major cultural influence on northern Estonia.
Some German monks wanted to bring God closer to the natives, so they constructed the Estonian written language.
"It was based on the German alphabet and a letter ""Õ/õ"" added."
Over time, many words borrowed from German were merged. This was the beginning of the enlightenment.
After finishing the school, the heirs of the throne would traditionally go directly into the military.
However, Charles attended the university at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studied anthropology and archaeology, and later history, and was rated 2:2 (a lower-second grade rating).
Charles was the first member of the British royal family to graduate.
European Turkey (Eastern Thrace or Romania in the Balkans) covers 3% of the country.
The Turkish territory is more than 1 600 kilometers (1,000 miles) long and 800 km (500 miles) wide, with about a rectangular shape.
Turkey's surface, including lakes, occupies 783,562 square kilometers (300,948 sq mi), of which 755,688 square kilometres (291,7753 sq mi) are counted among Southwest Asia and 23,764 square kilometres (9.174 sq mi) are counted to in Europe.
Turkey's area makes the country the 37th largest in the world and is as large as France (the motherland) and the United Kingdom together.
Turkey is surrounded by seas on three sides: the Aegean Sea to the west, the Black Sea in the north and the Mediterranean Sea to the south.
Luxembourg has a long history but its independence has origins from 1839.
Parts of present-day Belgium belonged to Luxembourg earlier but became Belgian after the Belgian revolution in the 1830s.
Luxembourg has always tried to remain a neutral country but was occupied both in World War I and World War II by Germany.
In 1957, Luxembourg became a founding member of the organisation known today as the European Union.
Drukgyal Dzong is a fortruin and a Buddhist monastery in the upper part of the Paro district (in the Phondey village).
It is said that Zhabdrung Ngawangy Namgyel 1649 created the fortress to celebrate his victory over the Tibetan-Mongolian forces.
In 1951, a fire made that only some of Drukgyal Dzong's remains, such as the image of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal.
After the fire, the fort was preserved and protected, and remains as one of Bhutan's most sensational sights.
In the 18th century, Cambodia found itself sandwiched between two powerful neighbors, Thailand and Vietnam.
Thailand invaded Cambodia several times in the 17th century and in 1772 they destroyed Phnom Phen.
In the last years of the 17th century, the Vietnamese also invaded Cambodia.
Eighteen percent of Venezuelans are unemployed, and most of those who have jobs work in the informal economy.
Two-thirds of the Venezuelans working do so in the service sector, almost a quarter work in industry and a fifth work in agriculture.
An important industry for Venezuelans is oil, and the country is a net exporter, although only one per cent work in the oil industry.
Early in the country's independence, experts from Singapore's botanical garden helped transform the island into a tropical garden city.
The Orchid Hybrid Vanda Miss Joaquim was named the national flower in 1981.
Every year around October, nearly 1.5 million grass-eaters move for the rain from the northern hills towards the southern plains and cross the river Mara.
And then back to the northern part through the western, then they again cross the Mara River, after the rains that come roughly in April.
The Serengeti region consists of Serengeti National Park, Ngorongoro Nature Reserve and Maswa Wildlife Reserve in Tanzania and the Maasai Mara Nature Reserve in Kenya.
Learning to create interactive media requires both conventional and traditional skills, as well as tools one learns in interactive classes (storyboarding, audio and video editing, storytelling, etc.)
Interactive design requires you to rethink your image of what media production is and learn to think in new ways.
Interactive design requires the components of a project to be connected, but are also comprehensible as separate devices.
The disadvantage of zoom lenses is that the number of lens elements and the number of lens elements required to achieve a focal length range is much greater than for fixed focal length lenses.
This is becoming an increasingly small problem as lens manufacturers achieve higher standards of lens production.
This has enabled zoom lenses to provide images of a quality comparable to that achieved by fixed focal length lenses.
Another disadvantage of zoom lenses is that the largest aperture (and shutter speed) of the lens is usually lower.
This makes cheap zoom lenses difficult to use in low light without flash.
One of the most common problems when converting movies to DVD format is overshine.
Most televisions are designed to satisfy the public.
For that reason, everything you see on the TV has cut margins, top, bottom and sides.
This is done to ensure that the image covers the entire screen. It's called overscan.
Unfortunately, the edges are likely to be pruned when you make a DVD, and subtitles in the bottom of the image may then partially disappear.
The traditional medieval castle has long tickled the imagination and evoked images of tower games, banquets and Arthural kiderability.
Even when you stand among the ruins that are thousands of old, it is easy to imagine sounds and smells from ancient battles, you can almost hear hooves smattering on the cobbles and smelling the fear of the dungeons.
But is our imagination based on reality? Why was castles built in the first place? How were they designed and built?
The Kirby Muxloe castle is more of a reinforced house than a genuine castle, which is typical of the period.
Its large glazed windows and thin walls would not have been able to withstand a determined attack for very long.
In the 1480s, when construction began by Lord Hastings, the country was relatively peaceful and the defense was only needed against small wandering ass.
The balance of power was a system in which European nations sought to maintain the sovereignty of all European states.
The concept was that all European nations would work to prevent a nation from gaining too much power and therefore national governments often changed alliance affiliation to maintain balance.
The Spanish War of Succession was the first war whose central issue was the balance of power.
This marked an important change, as European powers would no longer have the pretext of religious wars. Thus, the Thirty Years' War would be the last war to be designated as a religious war.
The Temple of Artemis in Ephesus was destroyed on July 21, 356 B.C.E. in a fire set by Herostratos.
According to the story, his motivation was fame at all costs. The furious Ephesians announced that Herostrato's name would never be registered.
The Greek historian Strabo later noted the name, as it is called today. The temple was destroyed the same night Alexander the Great was born.
Alexander, as king, offered to pay to rebuild the temple, but his offer was rejected. Later, after Alexander had died, the temple was rebuilt in 323 BC.
Make sure your hand is as relaxed as possible while still hitting all the sheet music correctly. Also try not to make many superfluous movements with your fingers.
This way, you tire yourself out as little as possible. Remember that there is no need to hit the keys with a lot of power for extra volume as on a piano.
With an accordion, you use the bellows with more pressure or higher speed to get higher volume.
Mysticism is the pursuit of communion with, identity with, or conscious awareness of a supreme reality, divinity, spiritual truth, or God.
The believer seeks a direct experience, intuition or insight into the divine reality/divion or the deities.
Supporters follow certain ways of living, or customary habits intended to promote these experiences.
Mysticism can be separated from other forms of religious belief and worship by its emphasis on the strictly personal experience of a unique state of consciousness, especially that of a peaceful, insightful, blissful, or even ecstatic character.
Sikhism is a religion from the Indian subcontinent. It originated in the Punjab region in the 1400s through a sectarian division within the Hindu tradition.
Sikhs believes that their faith is a religion that is separate from Hinduism, although they recognize its Hindu roots and traditions.
"Sikher calls his religion Gurmat, which is Punjabi the "Gurun's Way." The Guru is fundamental in all Indian religions, but for the sake of Sikhism it is so significant that it forms the nucleus of the Sikh faith."
Religion was founded in the 15th century by Guru Nanak (1469 - 1539). Then another nine gurus followed in succession.
But in June 1956 Khrushchev's promises were put to the test when uprisings in Poland, where workers protested against lack of food and wage cuts, turned into a general protest against communism.
Although Khrushchev ultimately sent in tanks to restore order, he gave way to certain economic demands and agreed to appoint the popular Wladyslaw Gomulka as the new prime minister.
Industry culture was a Bronze Age civilization on the northwest Indian subcontinent that encompassed most of today's Pakistan as well as some regions of northwest India and northeastern Afghanistan.
Civilization flourished in the Indu valley River, from where it also got its name.
Although some scientists speculate that because civilization also existed around the now-deemed Sarasvati River, the more fittingly named Indus-Sarasvati civilization should be used, while some call it the Harappanish civilization after Harappa, the first of its places to be excavated in the 1920s.
The military nature of the Roman Empire facilitated the development of medical progress.
Doctors began being recruited by Emperor Augustus and even formed the first Roman medical corps for use after fighting.
Surgeons knew of several sedatives, including morphine from extracts of poppy seeds and shoe polamine from herb seeds.
They became proficient at amputation to save patients from cold fire as well as pressure dressings and arterial clamps to stop blood flow.
For several centuries, the Roman Empire had great success in the medical field and created much of the knowledge we have today.
Pureland origami is origami with the limitation that only one folding may be done at a time, more complicated folds such as reverse folds are not allowed, and all folds have easy placements.
It was developed by John Smith in the 1970s to help inexperienced folders or those with limited motor skills.
Children develop an awareness of race and racial stereotypes at quite an early age, and these racial stereotypes affect behavior.
For example, children who identify with a racial monument where the stereotype is that they don't do well in school tend not to perform well in school once they find out the stereotype that's linked to their race.
MySpace is the third most popular website in the United States and currently has 54 million user profiles.
These websites have received a lot of attention, especially in the field of education.
There are positive aspects to these websites, such as being able to easily create a class page that can include blogs, videos, photos and other features.
This page can be easily accessed by entering only one URL, making it easy to remember and easy to enter for students who may have trouble using the keyboard or with spelling.
It can be adapted to be more easy to read and with as much or as little color as desired.
"ADD (Attention Deficit Disorder) ""is a neurological syndrome whose classically defining triad of symptoms includes impulsivity, attention problems, and hyperactivity or excess energy""."
"It's not learning difficulties, but a learning disability; it ""affects 3 to 5 percent of all children, maybe as many as 2 million American children""."
Children with ADD have difficulty focusing on things like schoolwork, but they can concentrate on things they like playing games or watching their cartoon favorite shows or writing sentences without punctuation.
"These children tend to have a lot of trouble, because they ""are themselves at risky behavior, end up in fights and defy authorities"" to stimulate their brains, because their brains cannot be stimulated by normal methods."
ADD affects the relationship with other children because these cannot understand why they act the way they do, spells the way they do or that they are at a different level of maturity.
When the ability to acquire knowledge and learn changed in the above, the speed at which knowledge was obtained also changed.
The approach to the collection of information was different. The print was no longer on individual recalls, but the focus shifted more to the ability to recall text.
Essentially, the Renaissance meant a significant change in the approach to learning and the dissemination of knowledge.
Unlike other primates, hominids no longer use their hands to get around, to carry body weight or swing through trees.
The chimpanzee's hand and foot are roughly equal, reflecting the hand's use to carry the weight when the monkey walks on the knuckles.
The human hand is shorter than the foot, with straighter phalanxes.
Fossil hand legs that are two to three million years old reveal this change in the hand's specialization from movement to manipulation.
Some consider it highly exhausting to experience many induced lucid dreams too often.
The main reason behind this phenomenon is the consequence of clear dreams prolonging the time between the REM states.
With fewer REM episodes per night, this condition is reached where you experience actual sleep and your body rarely recovers enough to become a problem.
This is as strain as if you were to wake up every twenty or thirty minutes and watch TV.
The effect depends on how many times your brain tries to lucite per night.
Right from the start, it did not go well for the Italians in North Africa. Within a week of Italy's declaration of war on June 10, 1940, the British 11th Hussars had taken control of Fort Capuzzo in Libya.
In an ambush east of Bardia, the British captured the Italian Tenth Army's chief engineer, General Lastucci.
On June 28, Marshal Italo Balbo, Governor-General of Libya and the likely successor of Mussolini, was killed by a gunshot during landing in Tobruk.
The modern fencing sport is practiced on many different levels, from students at universities to professional and Olympic competition.
The sport is played mainly in a duel format, one fencer duel with another.
Golf is a sport where players use clubs to hit balls down into holes.
Eighteen holes are played during a regular round where players usually start on the first hole on the course and end on the eighteenth.
Winning makes the player who needs the least number of strokes, or swings with the club, to complete the course.
The game is played on grass and the grass around the hole is cut shorter and called the green.
Perhaps the most common type of tourism is what most people associate with traveling: recreational tourism.
This is when people go to a place that is very different from their everyday lives to relax and have fun.
Beaches, theme parks and campsites are among the most common places that tourists visit for relaxation purposes.
If someone visits a certain place to get to know its history and culture, then that kind of tourism is called cultural tourism.
Tourists can visit different sights in a particular country or so they can simply choose to target just one area.
The colonists who saw this activity, had also requested reinforcements.
Troops that reinforced the front lines included the 1 and 3rd regiment from New Hampshire with 200 men, led by the tops John Stark and James Reed (both then became generals).
Stark's men posted along the fence at the north side of the colonists' position.
When the low tide opened a gap along the Mystic River along the Northeast of the peninsula, they quickly built out the pace with a short stone wall towards the north end at the water's edge on a small beach.
Gridley or Stark placed a pin about 100 feet (30 m) in front of the fence and ordered that no one give fire until the trunk tigers passed it.
The US plan was based on the coordinated attack from three different directions.
General John Cadwalder would launch a sham to the British garrison at Bordentown in order to block any support troops.
General James Ewing would take a militia of 700 over the river at Trenton Ferry, take possession of the bridge over Assunkink Creek and prevent all enemy troops from escaping.
The 2,400 men's main attack force would cross the river nine miles north of Trenton and then split into two groups, one under Greene and one under Sullivan, to launch an attack before dawn.
With the change from a quarter to half an English mile running, the speed becomes much less important and endurance becomes an absolute necessity.
Of course, a first-class runner at the distance comes half an English mile, a man who can do it in under two minutes, to have to cope with quite a lot of speed. But perseverance must be taken into account at all costs.
Some trail running during the winter, combined with strength training for the upper body, is the best preparation for the running season.
Accurate nutrition habits cannot alone generate elite performance, but they can significantly affect the overall well-being of young athletes.
A healthy energy balance, effective hydration habits and knowledge of the various aspects of nutritional supplements can help athletes improve their performance and get increased enjoyment of their sport.
Middle-distance running is a relatively cheap sport, but there are many misconceptions regarding the small amount of equipment required to participate.
Equipment can be purchased if necessary, but most products have little or no impact on performance.
Although it does not provide any actual benefits, athletes may experience that they like a product more.
The atom can be seen as one of the basic building blocks of all matter.
It is a very complex device that, according to a simplified Bohr model, consists of a central core surrounded by electrons, something similar to planets orbiting the sun - see Figure 1.1.
The nucleus consists of two particles - neutrons and protons.
Protons have a positive electric charge while neutrons have no charge. The electrons have a negative electrical charge.
Before examining the victim, you must first check the surroundings to ensure your own safety.
You must note the victim's position as you approach him or her and any automatic red flags.
If you hurt yourself when you try to help, you only make things worse.
The study found that depression, fear and catastrophicisation were an indirect causal link between pain and disability in individuals suffering from lumbar spinal cord.
One only addressed the effects of black-painting in the weekly meetings, not the effects of depression and out of fear.
Those who participated in regular activity required more support when it came to negative experience of pain, which characterized the differences between chronic pain and discomfort from normal physical movement.
Vision, or the ability to tell depends on the sensory organ or eyes of the visual system.
Eyes are constructed in many different ways, with different complexity depending on what the organism requires.
The different designs have different capacities, are sensitive to different wavelengths and have varying sharpness levels. They also require different processing methods to interpret the input and different numbers to function optimally.
A population of organisms within a certain species in a particular geographical area;
When all individuals in a population are identical with respect to a particular phenotypic property, they are called monomorphic.
When the individuals exhibit multiple variants of a specific character trais, they are called polymorphic.
Colonies of hiking ants march and build nests in different phases as well.
In the nomadic phase, the wandering ants march at night and stop to camp during the day.
Colony enters a nomadic phase when available food decreases. During this phase, the colony creates temporary nests that are changed every day.
Each of these nomadic ravages or marches lasted about 17 days.
"What is a cell? The word cell comes from the Latin word ""cella,"" meaning ""small room"", and it was originally coined by a microscopyist who observed the structure of cork."
The cell is the base unit of all living things, and all organisms consist of one or more cells.
"Cells are so fundamental and critical for the study of life that they are actually often called ""the building blocks of life""."
The nervous system maintains the homeostasis by sending nerve impulses throughout the body to keep blood flow running without interference.
These nerve impulses can be sent so quickly throughout the body, helping to keep it safe from any threats.
Tromber affects a small area compared to other violent storms, but they can destroy everything in their path.
Tornador up trees with the roots, tearing boards from buildings, throwing cars into the sky. The most violent two percent of the tornadoes last longer than three hours.
These monster storms have winds of up to 480 km/h (133 m/s; 300 miles/h).
People have been manufacturing and using magnifying lenses for thousands of years.
However, the first real telescopes were created in Europe in the late 16th century.
These telescopes used a combination of two lenses to remove objects to appear both closer and larger.
Greed and selfishness will always be with us, and it is the nature of cooperation that when the majority benefits there is always more to gain in the short term by acting selfishly
In the long term, most people will hopefully realize that their best option is to work alongside others.
Many dream of the day when people can travel to another star and explore other worlds, some people marvel at what's out there, some believe that aliens or other lives can live on another planet.
"But if this ever happens, it probably won't happen in a very long time. The stars are so scattered that it is trillion kilometers between stars that are ""neighbors""."
One day, maybe your grandchildren's children look out over an alien world and think about their old ancestors?
Animals are made up of many cells. They eat things and digest food inside. Most animals can move.
Only animals have a brain (but not even all animals; jellyfish, for example, do not have a brain).
There are animals everywhere on earth. They dig into the ground, swim in the oceans and fly in the air.
A cell is the smallest structural and functional device in any living (object) organism.
The word cell is derived from the Latin cella, which means little room.
If you look at living creatures in a microscope, you'll see they're made of tiny squares or balls.
Robert Hooke, a biologist from England, saw small squares in cork with a microscope.
They looked like room. He was the first man to observe dead cells
Elements and chemical compounds can shift from one state to another without changing.
Nitrogen in gaseous form still has the same properties as liquid nitrogen. The liquid state is more compact but it is still the same molecules.
Water is another example. The compound water consists of two hydrogen atoms and an oxygen atom.
It has the same molecular structure whether it is gas, liquid or solid.
Although its physical condition may change, its chemical state remains the same.
Time is something that is all around us, and affects everything we do, but still is hard to understand.
Time has been studied by religious, philosophical and scientific scholars for thousands of years.
We experience time as a series of events that run from the future, through the present, to the past.
Time is also how we compare the duration (length) of occasions.
You can measure the passage of time yourself by observing the repetition of a cyclical event. A cyclical event is something that happens regularly again and again.
Today, computers are used to edit images and videos.
Sophisticated animations can be created on computers, and these types of animations are increasingly used in television and film.
Music is often recorded with sophisticated computers that process and mix audio.
Long during the eighteenth and twentieth centuries it was believed that New Zealand's first inhabitants were the Maori people, who hunted giant birds called moa birds.
The theory then established the idea that the Maori people migrated from Polynesia in a large fleet and took New Zealand from Moriori where they set up an agricultural community.
However, new evidence suggests that the Moriori people were a group of Maoris from the mainland who migrated from New Zealand to the Chatham Islands, and developed their own distinctive, peaceful culture.
There was also another tribe in the Chatham Islands and these were Maoris who moved from New Zealand.
They called themselves Moriori, there were some minor clashes and ultimately Moriori was eradicated
People who have been involved for decades helped us to appreciate our strengths and passions while openly assessing difficulties and even failures.
By listening to individuals’ personal stories about themselves, their family and their organization, we have gained valuable insights into local history and about the people who have influenced the organization’s culture positively or negatively.
Although knowledge of one's history is not the same as cultural insight, at least people give a sense of where they belong within the organization's history.
While the individuals and participants as a whole assess their successes and become aware of failure, they and all other participants discover the organization’s values, missions and driving forces on a deeper level.
In this case, it was helpful to remember past entrepreneurship and the successes that followed, for people to be open to change and a new direction for the local church.
Such success stories reduced the fear of change, while at the same time giving a positive attitude towards future change.
Convergent thinking is problem-solving techniques that unite different ideas or areas to find a solution.
This mindset focuses on speed, logic and accuracy, as well as identifying facts, reapplying existing techniques and gathering information.
The most important factor in this mindset is: there is only one correct answer. You only think of two answers, namely right or wrong.
This mindset is associated with some knowledge or standard routines.
People with this way of thinking have a logical thinking, can memorize patterns, solve problems and work with scientific research.
Humans are superior to other species in reading other people’s thoughts.
This means that we are capable of anticipating what other people experience, intending, believing, knowing or cravinging.
Among these abilities, it is important to understand the intention of others. This allows us to determine any ambiguities in physical actions.
For example, if you see someone smashing a car window, you probably take it for granted that he tries to steal a car that belongs to someone else.
He would have to be judged differently if he had lost his car keys and it was his own car he tried to break into.
MRI is based on a physical phenomenon known as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) discovered in the 1930s by Felix Bloch (at Stanford University) and Edward Purcell (Harvard University).
In this resonance, magnetic fields and radio waves cause atoms to emit small radio signals.
In 1970, physician and researcher Raymond Damadian discovered the basis for using magnetic resonance imaging as a medical diagnostic tool.
Four years later, a patent was granted, which was the first patent in the world to be issued within the MRI.
"In 1977, Dr. Damadian construction of the first ""wholebody"" camera, which he called ""Indomitable""."
Asynchronous communication encourages time for reflection and reaction towards others.
It gives students the opportunity to work at their own pace and control the speed of the instructive information.
In addition, there are fewer time restrictions on the possibility of flexible working hours. (Bremer, 1998)
The use of the internet and www means that students have access to information at all times.
Students can also submit questions to tutors at any time of the day and expect reasonable quick answers, instead of waiting until the next in-person appointment.
The postmodern pedagogical orientation offers freedom from absolute solutions. There is no perfect learning method.
In fact, there is not a good thing to learn. Learning takes place in the experience between the student and the presented knowledge.
Our current experience with all do-it-yourself and information-presenting, learning-based TV shows illustrates this point.
Many people watch a TV program that informs us about a process or experience that we will never participate in or apply the acquired knowledge.
We will never examine a car, build a fountain on our backyard, travel to Peru to investigate ancient ruins, or rebuild the neighbor's house.
Thanks to fiber optic cable links underwater to Europe and broadband satellite, Greenland is well connected where 93% of the population has internet access.
The hotel or hosts (if you live in a guest house or a private home) probably have wifi or a PC connected to the internet and all settlements have an internet cafe or any location with public wifi.
"As mentioned above, although the word ""Eskimo"" remains acceptable in the United States, it is regarded as derogatory by many non-American Arctic peoples, especially in Canada."
Although you may hear the word being used by native Greenlanders, foreigners should avoid using it.
Greenland's indigenous people call themselves Inuit in Canada and Kalaalleq (plural Kalaallit), Greenlander, Greenland.
"Crime, and hostility to foreigners in general, practically does not exist in Greenland. Nor are there any "ruffy neighborhoods" in the cities. "
Cold weather is perhaps the only real danger the unprepared meets.
If you visit Greenland during the cold season (given that it gets colder the further north you come), it is important to bring warm enough clothes.
The very long days of summer can lead to problems getting enough sleep and associated health problems.
During the summer, also watch out for the Nordic mosquitoes. Even if they don't spread any diseases, they can be annoying.
Although the San Francisco economy is linked to its status as a world-class tourist attraction, the economy is diverse.
The largest labour market sectors are professional services, government, finance, trade and tourism.
Its frequent portrait in music, films, literature and popular culture has helped make the city and its landmarks known all over the world.
San Francisco has developed an extensive tourism infrastructure with lots of hotels, restaurants, and first-class venues for gatherings.
San Francisco is also one of the country's best places for other Asian cuisines: Korean, Thai, Indian and Japanese.
A trip to Walt Disney World is a great pilgrimage for many American families.
"The ""typical"" visit involves flying to Orlando International Airport, going bus to a Disney hotel on site, spending about a week without leaving Disney's area, and returning home."
"There's an infinite number of variations, but this is what most people mean when they talk about ""going to Disney World""."
Many tickets sold online on auction sites such as eBay or Craigslist are partially used park-hopper tickets for several days.
Although it is very common, Disney prohibits: tickets may not be transferred.
Each campsite under the edge of the Grand Canyon requires a so-called land permit.
The permits are limited to protect the canyon, and are released on the first day of the month, four months before the start month.
Thus, a wilderness permit with any start date during May will be available on January 1.
The location in the most popular areas, such as Bright Angel Campground next to Phantom Ranch, is usually filled through requests received on the first day they open for booking.
There are a limited number of permits reserved to those who request to enter on foot, available according to the first-served principle.
Entering southern Africa by car is a fantastic way to see the beauty of the whole area and get to places beyond the usual tourist routes.
This can be done with a normal car with careful planning but all-wheel drive is highly recommended and many seats can only be reached with a car with four-wheel drive and high wheelbase.
Remember when you plan to even if South Africa is stable, not all of its neighboring countries are.
The requirements and costs of a visa vary from country to country and are affected by which country you come from.
Each country also has unique laws stating requirements on which devices must be in the car for emergencies.
The city of Victoria Falls is located in western Zimbabwe, on the other side of the border with Livingstone, Zambia and near Botswana.
The city is located right next to the waterfalls, and these are the main attraction, but this popular tourist destination offers enough opportunities for longer stays for both adventure seekers and those on the sightseeing.
During the rainy season (November to March), the volume of water is greater and the falls become more dramatic.
You are guaranteed to get wet if you cross the bridge or walk along the tracks that meander close to the falls.
On the other hand, it's precisely because the water masses are as huge as your view over the actual Niagara Falls is obscured - of all water!
Tutanchamon's tomb (KV62). The KV62 is perhaps the most famous of the graves in the valley, the site of Howard Carter's discovery of the nearly intact royal burial of the young king in 1922.
Compared to most of the other royal tombs, the tomb of Tutankhamon is barely worth visiting, as it is much smaller and has limited embellishment.
Anyone who wants to see evidence of the damage caused to the mummy in trying to move it from the coffin will be disappointed because only the head and shoulders are visible.
The outstanding treasures of the tomb are no longer there, but have been moved to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.
Visitors with short time do best to spend time somewhere else.
Phnum kraôm, 12 km southwest of Siem reap. This temple at the top of the hill was built during the late 800s, under King Yasovarman.
The seamicky atmosphere of the temple and the view of the lake Tonle Sap make the climb the hill worthwhile.
A visit to the site can easily be combined with a boat trip on the lake.
The Angra Pass is needed to enter the temple, so don’t forget to bring your passport when you get to Tonle sap.
Jerusalem is Israel's capital and largest city, although most countries and the United Nations do not recognize the capital of Israel.
The ancient city of Judea has a fascinating history that stretches back thousands of years.
The city is sacred to three monotheistic religions - Judaism, Christianity and Islam, and acts as a spiritual, religious and cultural center.
Jerusalem is one of the most important tourist destinations in Israel because of the religious significance of the city, and especially thanks to the many places in the Old Town.
Jerusalem has many historical, archaeological and cultural sites, along with bustling and crowded shopping centers, cafes and restaurants.
Ecuador requires Cuban citizens to receive an invitation before arriving at Ecuador via international airports or border crossings.
This letter must be approved by the Ecuadorian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and meet specific requirements.
These requirements are designed to create a regulated migration flow between the two countries.
Cuban citizens who have a U.S. Green Card should turn to an Ecuadorian consulate to get an exemption from this requirement.
Your passport must be valid at least six months after your travel dates. A ticket for re-travel or further travel is needed to prove how long you will stay.
The tours are cheaper for larger groups, so if you are alone or just with a friend, try to meet other people and form a group of four to six for a cheaper price per person.
However, it is not something that you should have to worry about, as tourists are often moved around to fill the cars.
In fact, it seems rather to be a way to fool people into thinking they have to pay more.
Above the northern part of Machu Picchu rises this steep mountain, which is often seen in the background of many photos of the ruins.
It looks a little scary from below, and it's a steep and severe climb, with most people who are in reasonably good condition should cope with it in around 45 minutes.
Stone staircases are laid along most of the path and in the steeper sections steel cables are used as railings.
So you can expect to be breathless, and take it easy in the steeper parts, especially when it is wet, as it can quickly become dangerous.
Near the top there is a small cavity that you have to pass, it is quite low and crowded to push your way through.
The places and wildlife in the Galápagos Islands are best seen by boat, just as Charles Darwin did it in 1835.
More than 60 cruise ships sail at the Galapagos – with varying sizes between 8 and 100 passengers.
Most people book their seats far in advance (because the boats are often full during peak season).
Make sure you book through a travel agency specializing in the Galapagos, with good knowledge of many different types of ships.
This will ensure that your special interests and/or limitations are matched with the ship that suits them best.
Before the Spaniards arrived in the 16th century, northern Chile was under the Inca rule while the indigenous araukans (Macuche) inhabited the central and southern parts of Chile.
Mapuche was also one of the last independent groups of American Indigenous peoples, not fully absorbed into the Hispanic rule until after Chile's independence.
Although Chile declared independence in 1810 (amidd the Napoleonic War that left Spain without a functioning central government for a couple of years), the decisive victory over the Spaniards was only achieved in 1818.
The Dominican Republic (Spanish: República Dominicana) is a Caribbean country that extends to the eastern half of the island of Hispaniola, which it shares with Haiti.
In addition to white sandy beaches and mountain scenery, the country is also home to the oldest European city in America, today part of Santo Domingo.
The island was inhabited from the beginning of the Tainos and the Caribbean. The Caribbeans were a people who spoke arawak and who arrived in the island about 10 000 B.C.
Within a few years of the arrival of European explorers, the number of the Taino populations had been greatly reduced by the Spanish conquerors.
Based on the Fray Bartolomé de las Casas (Tratado de las Indias), the Spanish conquerors killed about 100 000 Taínos between 1492 and 1498.
Jardín de la Unión. This space was built as an atrium for a monastery from the 1600s, of which Templo de San Diego is the only surviving building.
It now serves as a central square and there are always things happening, day and night.
There are a number of restaurants surrounding the garden and in the afternoons and evenings are often given free concerts from the gazebo in the middle.
Callejon del Beso (Kyssen's alley). Two balconies separated by only 69 centimetres are home to an old love legend.
Some children can tell you the story to you for a few bucks.
Bowen Island is a popular day trip or weekend tour that offers canoeing, hiking, shops, restaurants and more.
This authentic community is located in Howe Sound just outside Vancouver and is easily reached via water taxis on schedule, which departs from Granville Island in downtown Vancouver.
For those who like outdoor activities, it is a must to hike The sea-to-sky corridor.
Whistler (1.5 hours drive from Vancouver) is expensive, but well known due to the 2010 Winter Olympics.
Wintertime, enjoy among the best skiing in North America, and summertime try real mountain biking.
Permits must be booked in advance. You must have a permit to stay overnight at Sirena.
Sirena is the only park ranger station that, in addition to camping, offers overnight stays in dormitory and warm meals. La Leona, San Pedrillo and Los Patos offer only camping without catering.
It is possible to secure park permits directly from the park guard station in Puerto Jiménez, but they do not accept credit cards
The park service (MINAE) does not issue parking permits for more than one month before expected arrival.
CafeNet El Sol offers a booking service to a fee of $30, or $10 for a one-day pass; more information can be found on their Corcovado page.
The Cook Islands is an island free union with New Zealand, located in Polynesia, in the middle of the South Pacific.
It is an archipelago of 15 islands spreading over 2.2 million square kilometers of sea.
"With the same time zone as Hawaii, the islands are sometimes referred to as ""Hawaii down""."
Although it is smaller, it reminds some older visitors of Hawaii before statehood without all the major tourist hotels and other developments.
The Cook Islands have no cities, but consists of 15 different islands. The biggest ones are Rarotonga and Aitutaki.
Offering luxury bed & breakfasts has today been elevated to a kind of art form in I countries.
In the upper price range, hostels of course compete mainly with two important things: beds and breakfast.
Consequently, on the finest of such facilities you can probably find the most luxurious bedding, perhaps a handmade duvet or an antique bed.
Breakfast may contain seasonal delights from the region or the host's special dish.
The location can be a historic old building with antique furniture, well maintained plot and a pool.
Entering your own car and going on a long journey has an inherent lure in its simplicity.
Unlike larger vehicles, you’re probably already used to driving your car and know its limitations.
Slogning tents on private land or in cities of all sizes can easily attract unwanted attention.
In summary, your own car is a very good way to travel around, but that in itself does not mean the same as camping.
Camping by car is possible if you have a minibus, SUV, sedan or mansion trolley with seats that can be folded down.
Some hotels have ancestry from the golden era with steam iron roads and ocean liners; before World War II, in the 19th century or early 20th century.
It was in these hotels the rich and the famous stayed at the time, and often had big dinners and nightlife.
The old-fashioned fittings, the absence of the latest amenities, and a special elegant old age is also part of their character.
Since they are usually privately owned, they sometimes accommodate visiting heads of state and other dignitaries.
A wealthy traveler would perhaps consider a round-the-world trip with breaks at many of these hotels.
A hospitality network is an organization that connects between travellers and residents of the cities they are going to visit.
Joining such a network usually only requires filling out an online form; although some networks offer or require further verification.
Then a list of available hosts is given, either in print and/or online, sometimes with references and reviews from other travelers.
Couchsurfing was founded in January 2004 after programmer Casey Fenton found a cheap flight to Iceland, but had nowhere to stay.
He emailed students at the local university and received an overwhelming number of offers on free accommodation.
Hostels are primarily aimed at young people – a typical guest is in their 20s – but you can often find older travelers there as well.
Families with children are an unusual sight, but at some hostels they have the opportunity to stay in private rooms.
The city of Beijing in China will host the 2022 Winter Olympics, making it the first city to host both the Summer and Winter Olympics.
Beijing will host the inauguration and closing ceremonies and ice branches.
Other ski events take place in the ski area of Taizicheng in Zhangjiakou, located about 220 km from Beijing.
Most temples have an annual festival starting from late November to mid-May, which varies depending on each temple's annual calendar.
Most of the temple festivals are celebrated as part of the temple anniversary or present divinity birthday or any other major event associated with the temple.
Kerala's temple festivals are very interesting to see, with regular processions of decorated elephants, temple orchestras and other festivities.
A world exhibition (also called World Exposition or Just Expo) is a major international festival of art and science.
Participating countries present artistic and educational exhibitions in national pavilions to showcase issues related to the world or their country's culture and history.
International garden exhibitions are specialized events that show flowers, botanical gardens and everything else related to plants.
Although in theory they can be arranged annually (as long as they are in different countries), this does not happen in practice.
These events normally last anywhere between three and six months and are held in places that are at least 50 hectares large.
There are many different film formats that have been used over the years. Ordinary 35 mm film (36 times 24 mm negative) is the most common.
It can usually be refilled quite easily if it runs out and gives a resolution equivalent to about a modern DSLR.
Some medium-format film cameras use a format of 6 times 6 cm, more specifically a negative with 56 times 56 mm.
This provides almost four times better resolution than a 35 mm negative (3 136 mm2 compared to 864).
Wild animals are among the most challenging motifs for a photographer and require a combination of luck, patience, experience and good equipment.
Game photography is often taken for granted, but just as with photography in general, an image is worth a thousand words.
Photographing wild animals often requires a long telephoto lens, but things like a flock of birds or a small animal need other lenses.
Many exotic animals are hard to find, and parks sometimes have rules around photography for commercial purposes.
Wild animals can either be shy or aggressive. The surroundings can be chilly, hot, or otherwise undigest-friendly.
In the world, more than 5 000 different languages are spoken. Of these, more than twenty languages are spoken by 50 million people or more.
Often, written words are also easier to understand than spoken words. This is particularly true for addresses, which are often difficult to pronounce in a comprehensible way.
In many whole nations you are completely fluent in English and in even more you can expect limited knowledge - especially among younger people.
Imagine a corduroy resident, a Boston, a Jamaican and a Sydney resident sitting at a table eating dinner at a Toronto restaurant.
They entertain each other with stories from their hometowns, told in their distinctive dialects and local slang.
Buying food in supermarkets is usually the cheapest way to eat. Without cooking facilities, however, the choices are limited to ready meals.
Groceries are expanding their range of ready meals more and more. Some even have a microwave or something similar so you can heat the food.
In some countries or types of shops, there is at least one restaurant in place, often a fairly informal one with affordable prices.
Make copies of your policy and your insurance company’s contact information and carry them with you.
To obtain advice/authorizations or claim, they must present the insurance company’s e-mail address and international telephone number.
"Have an extra copy in your luggage and online (email yourself as an attachment, or save in the ""cloud"")."
If you are traveling with a laptop or tablet, make sure to store a copy of its memory or hard drive (available without internet).
Also provide copies of policy documents/contact details of travel companions and relatives and friends at home who are willing to help.
Moose are not normally aggressive but defend themselves if they experience a threat.
When people don't see moose as potentially dangerous they can get too close and put themselves in danger.
Ingest alcoholic beverages in moderation. Alcohol affects everyone differently, and it is important to know its limit.
Long-term health problems that can arise from too much supting include liver diseases and even blindness and death. The potential danger increases when consuming illegally produced alcohol.
Illegal liquor can contain various dangerous contaminants such as methanol, which even in small doses can cause blindness or death.
Glasses may be cheaper abroad, especially in long-income countries where labour costs are lower.
Consider examining the eyes at home, especially if the insurance covers it, and bring the recipe to get it archived elsewhere.
Exclusive branded frames available in such areas may have two problems; some may be plagiarism and the genuine ones imported can be more expensive than at home.
Coffee is one of the world's most traded ingredients and you can probably find many types in your home region.
Despite this, there are many special ways to drink coffee around the world that are worth experiencing.
Canyoning is about being at the bottom of a canyon, which is either dry or full of water.
Canyoning combines parts from swimming, climbing and jumping - but requires relatively little exercise or good physical shape to get started (compared to e.g. rock climbing, diving or alpine skiing).
Hiking is an outdoor activity that involves hiking in nature, often along hiking trails.
Day walks include distances of less than a mile up to longer distances that can be completed in one day.
For a day trip along a light track, little preparation is not needed and any average fit person can enjoy them.
Families with toddlers may need to prepare more, but one day outdoors is easy to implement even with toddlers and preschoolers.
Internationally, there are almost 200 organizations for running. Most of them seem independent.
"Global Running Tour's successor, Go Running Tours, connect dozens of suppliers of so-called ""sightrunning"" on four continents."
"With roots in Barcelona's ""Running Tours Barcelona"" and Copenhagen ""Running Copenhagen"," it was quickly expanded with ""Running Tours Prague"" based in Prague and other cities."
There are many things that you have to think about before and during that you travel somewhere.
"When you travel, don't expect things to be like ""there at home""." Behaviour, cooking, food, traffic, accommodation, norms, language and so on will differ in some way from where you live.”
This is something you always need to think about to avoid disappointment or perhaps even a distaste about local habits.
Travel agencies have been around since the 19th century. A travel agency is usually a good choice for a trip that goes beyond a traveler's previous experience of nature, culture, language or low-income countries.
Although many agencies are willing to take on most regular bookings, many agencies specialize in specific types of travel, budget ranges or destinations.
It may be better to use an agency that often books similar trips as yours.
Take a look at what journeys the agent markets, whether they are on a website or in a shop window.
If you want to see the world in a cheap way, either as a necessity, lifestyle or challenge, there are many ways to do it.
Basically, they can be divided into two categories: Either you work while traveling, or you try to limit your expenses. This article is focused on the latter.
"For those who are happy to sacrifice convenience, time and predictability to reduce spending to basically zero, see ""travel on minimal budget""."
The advice presupposes that travellers do not steal, intrude, participate in the illegal market, begging or otherwise exploiting other people for their own profits.
The border control is usually the first stop after disembarking from a plane, a boat or another vehicle.
On some trains crossing borders, checks are made while the train is in motion, and then you should have a valid ID document when getting on.
On night trains, passports can be collected by the conductor so you don't have to get your sleep interrupted.
Registration is another requirement for the visa process. In some countries, you must register your presence and the address where you live with the local authorities.
This may require a form to be filled in with the local police or a visit to the immigration authority.
In many countries with such a law, local hotels handle the registration (be sure to ask).
In other cases, you only need to register if you rent a room outside tourist accommodation. But this makes the law much obscure, so find out how it is in advance.
Architecture is about the design and construction of buildings. The architecture of a place is often a tourist attraction in itself.
Many buildings are quite beautiful to look at and the view from a tall building or a smartly placed window can be a very beautiful sight.
Architecture significantly overlaps other areas including urban planning, road and water construction, decorative art, interior design and landscape design.
Many villages are far away, so there is no real nightlife if you do not go to Albuquerque or Santa Fe.
However, almost all of the aforementioned casinos serve drinks and several of them also bring in famous names such as entertainment (mainly large ones from Albuquerques and Santa Fe's immediate surroundings).
Watch out: small town bars here are not always good places to stay for visitors from outside.
First, northern New Mexico has significant problems with drunk driving, and the concentration of drunk drivers is high near bars in small towns.
Unwanted murals or scribbles are called graffiti.
Despite being far from a modern phenomenon, most people probably associate with young people who vandalize public and private property with spray paint.
"Nowadays, however, there are established graffiti artists, graffitieneneng and ""legal"" walls. In these contexts, graffiti paintings often resemble works of art rather than ill-readable thorns."
Bummerang throwing is a popular skill that many tourists want to learn.
If you want to learn how to throw a boomerang that comes back to your hand, make sure you have a good boomerang returning.
Most boomerangers in Australia don't actually return. As a beginner, it's best not to throw in windy
Hangi-cooked food is cooked in a hot pit in the ground.
The pit is either heated with hot rocks from a bonfire or by the geothermal heat that in some places heats up the ground naturally.
Hangin is often used to cook a traditional kind of barbecue-dinner.
Several places in Rotorua offer geothermal hangi, while other types of hangi are available to taste in Christchurch and Wellington, among others.
MetroRail has two classes on commuter trains in and around Cape Town: MetroPlus (also known as first class) and Metro (known as third class).
MetroPlus is more convenient and not so crowded, but a little more expensive, but still cheaper than regular subway tickets in Europe.
Each train has both MetroPlus and Metro-carriages; the MetroPlus carriages are always at the end of the train closest to Cape Town.
Carrying to others - Never leave your bags out of sight, especially when crossing international borders.
You may end up in being used as a drug carrier without your knowledge, which can cause you to get into a lot of trouble.
This includes waiting in a row, as drug dogs can be used at any time without warning.
Some countries have very harsh penalties even for first-time offenders, these may include prison sentences of more than ten years or the death penalty.
Luggage left unsighted is a target for thieves and can also be noticed by authorities who are worried about bomb threats.
If you are at home, the odds are very high that you are already immune to them due to constant exposure to the local bacteria.
But in other parts of the world, where the bacteriological fauna is new to you, it is much more likely that you will encounter problems.
In warmer climates, bacteria can grow faster and survive longer outside the body.
Thus the plagues Delhi-smage, Pharaoh's Curse, Montezuma's Revenge and their many friends.
As with respiratory problems in colder climates, intestinal problems in warmer climates are quite common and in most cases noticeably irritating, but not exactly dangerous.
If you are travelling in a developing country for the first time – or in a new part of the world – do not underestimate the potential cultural clash.
Many experienced travelers have been enthenched by the new with travel in developing countries, where many small cultural adjustments can quickly become an advantage.
Consider, especially during your first days, hitting big with hotels, food and service with Western style and quality, to easier acclimatise.
Don't sleep on a mattress or cushion on the ground in areas where you don't know the local wildlife.
If you want to camp outside, bring a tent bed or hammock to keep you away from snakes, scorpions and the like.
Fill your home with tasty coffee in the morning and some soothing chamomile tea in the evening.
When you are on a home the holidays, you have time to take care of yourself and take a few extra minutes to brew something special.
If you feel more adventurous, you can take the opportunity to squeeze juice or mix smoothies:
Maybe you will discover a simple drink that you can make for breakfast when you are back in your everyday routine.
If you live in a city with a rich drinking culture, go to bars or pubs in neighborhoods you don't visit often.
For those who do not know medical jargon, the words infectious and contagious different meanings have.
An infectious disease is a disease caused by a pathogen, such as a virus, a bacterium, a fungus or other parasites.
An infectious disease is a disease that is easily transmitted by being close to an infected person.
Many state powers require that inmate visitors or outgoing residents of their countries be vaccinated for a variety of diseases.
These requirements can often differ depending on which countries a traveller has visited or intend to visit.
One of the strong things about Charlotte, North Carolina, is that it has an abundance of high-quality options for families.
Residents who have moved in from other areas often indicate the area's family friendliness as the main reason they moved there and visitors often experience the city as easy to enjoy together with children.
Over the past 20 years, the number of child-friendly choices in Charlotte’s northern central parts has increased exponentially.
Taxis are usually not used by families in Charlotte, although they may be used in certain circumstances.
A fee is added for more than 2 passengers, so this option may be more expensive than necessary.
Antarctica is the coldest place on Earth and surrounds the South Pole.
Tourist visits are expensive, require physical health, can only take place in the summer of Nov-Feb and are mostly limited to the peninsula, islands and Rossaven.
A few thousand employees live here in the summer at about four dozen bases, especially in the areas; a small number stays over the winter.
Antarctica's inland is a desolate plateau covered in 2-3 km of thick ice.
Occasional specialist tours travel inland via the air for mountaineering or to reach the pole where there is a large base.
The main road South Pole Traverse is a 1600 km distance from McMurdo Station on the Ross Sea to the South Pole.
It's compressed snow with cracks, stuffed and marked with flags. You can only travel there with special tractors, trailers and supplies.
These are not very flink so the trail has to take a long turn around the transatctic mountains to get up on the plateau.
The most common cause of accidents in winter is slippery roads, sidewalks and especially steps.
As a minimum, you need shoes with suitable soles. Summer shoes rarely grip well enough on ice and snow; even some winter shoes can be flawed.
The pattern should be deep enough, 5 mm (1/5 inch) or more, and the material soft enough in cold temperatures.
Some boots have studs and there are additional equipment with studs in slippery conditions, suitable for most shoes and boots, for the heels or heels and sole.
Heels should be both low and wide. Sand, gravel or salt (calcium chloride) is often used to improve the grip by spreading it out on roads or paths.
Lavins are not abnormal; steep slopes can only hold a certain amount of snow and the excess will fall down like avalanches.
The problem is that snow is sticky so it takes some trigger for it to come down, and snow that comes down can in itself become a trigger for the rest.
Sometimes the original triggering event is that the sun warms the snow, sometimes more snowfall, sometimes other natural events, often a human being.
A tornado is a spinning pillar with very low air pressure that sucks the surrounding air inwards and upwards.
They generate high winds (often 160-320 km/h) and can lift up heavy objects in the air and move them as the tornado moves.
"They start like funnels rising from storm clouds and becoming ""thea market"" when they come down to the ground."
A connection to a Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a great way to bypass both political censorship and commercial IP geofiltration.
They are superior to web proxy servers for several reasons: They redirect all internet traffic, not just http.
They usually offer a higher bandwidth and higher quality of service. They are encrypted and therefore harder to spy on.
"The media companies routinely lie about the purpose of this and claim it is to ""prevent piracy""."
In fact, regional codes have no effect whatsoever on illegal copying; a bit-by-copy of a disc works just fine on any device the original can be played on.
The actual purpose is to give these companies more control over their markets; it's about getting the money rolling.
Since the calls are connected over the internet, you do not need to use a telecommunications company where you live or where you travel.
There is also no requirement for you to obtain a local number from the community where you live; you can get an internet connection via satellite in the wasteland of Chicken, Alaska and choose a number that claims you are in sunny Arizona.
You can often buy a global number separately that allows PSTN phones to reach you. Where the number is from matters to people who call you.
Real-time text translation apps - applications that can automatically translate entire text segments from one language to another.
Some applications in this category may even translate text in foreign languages on signs or other objects in real life when the user directs their smartphone towards these items.
Translation engines have improved significantly, and nowadays often provide more or less accurate translations (and more rarely nonsense), but some caution is needed, as they may still have understood the text completely wrong.
One of the most prominent apps in this category is Google Translate, which allows translation offline after downloading data for the desired languages.
Using GPS navigation apps on your smartphone may be the easiest and most convenient way to navigate when you’re abroad.
It can be cheaper than buying new maps to a GPS, or a standalone GPS device or renting one from a car rental company.
If you do not have data connection on your mobile, or if it is without coverage, their performance may be limited or unavailable.
Each corner store is filled with a confusing collection of prepaid phone cards that can be used in phone booths or regular phones.
While most cards can be used to call anywhere, some specialize in providing favorable call tariffs to a particular group of countries.
Access to these services is often obtained through a free number you can call from most phones without it costing.
The rules that apply to regular photography also apply to video recording, perhaps even to an even greater extent.
If it's forbidden to just photograph something, then you shouldn't even think of filming it.
If you are using a drone, please check in advance what is allowed to film and what permits are required.
Flying with a drone near an airport or over a crowd is almost always a bad idea, even if it's not illegal where you live.
Nowadays, air travel is only booked in rare cases directly through the airline without first searching for and comparing prices.
Sometimes the price of the same flight can differ immensely with different booking points and it pays to compare search results and to look at the airline's website before booking.
You do not need a visa for short-term trips to certain countries such as a tourist or business traveler, but if you are going to study, you will probably stay in the country longer than if you are a tourist.
If you are staying in a foreign country for a long time, you generally need to obtain a visa in advance.
Student visas generally have different requirements and application procedures than regular tourist or business visas.
In most countries, you will need an invitation from the institution where you want to study, and also proof that you can support yourself financially during at least the first year of your course.
Check with the department, as well as the immigration department of the country you want to study in for detailed requirements.
Unless you are a diplomat, work abroad usually means you have to declare income tax in the country you work in.
Income tax is structured in different ways in different countries, and tax rates and tax brackets vary widely from one country to another.
In some federal countries, such as the United States and Canada, income tax is levied both at the federal and local level, so the tax rates and classes can vary from region to region.
Although entry checks are usually missing or forming a formality when you enter your home country, customs control may be cumbersome.
Make sure you know what you are getting and not being allowed to bring, and clear everything across the legal boundaries.
The easiest way to get started working as a travel writer is to hone your talents on an established travel blog site.
Once you’ve become comfortable formatting and editing on the web, you can later create your own web page.
Volunteering while traveling is a great way to make a difference, but it’s not just about giving.
Living and volunteering in a foreign country is a very good way to get to know a different culture, meet new people, learn more about yourself, get a sense of perspective and even gain new skills.
It can also be a great way to stretch a budget to allow a longer stay somewhere because many volunteer jobs offer food and lodging and a few pay a small salary.
Vikings used the Russian waterways to reach the Black and Caspian Seas. Parts of these joints can still be used. Examine whether special conditions are needed that can be difficult to obtain.
The White Sea-Baltic Sea Canal connects the Arctic Ocean with the Baltic Sea via the Bay of Onega, Ladoga and Saint Petersburg, mainly via rivers and lakes.
The Onega Sea is also connected to the Volga River, so it is still possible to get through Russia from the Caspian Sea.
You can rest assured that once you arrive at the marina, everything will be pretty obvious. You will meet other boaters who share their information with you.
You will basically set up notices where you offer your help, walk around the quays, talk to people who clean their yachts, try to make contact with sailors at the bar, etcetera.
Try to talk to as many people as possible. After a while, everyone will feel you and give you tips on which boat is looking for someone.
You should carefully choose your Frequent flyer airline in an alliance.
Although you may think it is intuitive to become a member of the airline you fly with the most, you should be aware that the benefits are often different and the bonus points can be more generous with another airline in the same alliance.
Airlines such as Emirates, Etihad Airways, Qatar Airways and Turkish Airlines have significantly expanded their tours to Africa, offering connections to many major African cities at prices more competitive than other European airlines.
In 2014, Turkish airlines flew to 39 destinations in 30 African countries.
If you have additional travel time, check how your total travel price to Africa compares to a round-the-world ticket price.
Do not forget to expect additional costs for additional visas, travel taxes, ground transport, etc. for all the places outside Africa.
If you want to fly around the world entirely on the southern hemisphere, the selection of flights and destinations are limited due to the lack of transoceanic routes.
No airline alliance operates all three ocean crossings in the southern hemisphere (and SkyTeam do not operate any of the crossings).
However, the Star Alliance covers everything except the eastern South Seas from Santiago de Chile to Tahiti, which is a LATAM Oneworld flight.
This is not the only flight option if you want to skip the southern part of the Pacific and western coast of South America.
In 1994, the ethnically Armenian region of Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan waged war against the Azeris.
With Armenian support, a new republic was created. However, no established nation recognizes it - not even Armenia.
Diplomatic arguments across the region continue to cloud relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan.
The Canal District (Dutch: Grachtengordel) is the famous 17th-century district surrounding Binnenstad in Amsterdam.
The entire area is designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO for its unique cultural and historical value, and its property values are among the highest in the country.
Cinque Terre, which means the five lands, consists of the five small coastal villages of Riomaggiore, Manarola, Corniglia, Vernazza and Monterosso and is located in the Italian region of Liguria.
They are a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
Over the centuries, people have carefully built terraces in the rugged, steep landscape all the way to the rocks that shoot out over the sea.
Part of its charm is the lack of visible business development. Paths, trains and boats connect the villages and cars do not reach them from the outside.
The variants of French spoken in Belgium and Switzerland are slightly different from French spoken in France, but they are just as similar enough to understand each other.
Especially in the numbering system in the French-speaking parts of Belgium and Switzerland there are some small peculiarities that are different from French spoken in France, and the pronunciation of some words is a little different.
Either way, any French-speaking Belgian and Swiss should learn standard French in school, so they would understand you even if you used the French standard system for numbers.
"In many parts of the world, a wineke is a kind gesture meaning "hello"."
"But in Malaysia, at least among Malaysians in rural areas, it means ""come here"," similar to the index finger bent against the body, a gesture used in some Western countries and should only be used for this purpose."
"Similarly, a British traveller in Spain may mistake a waving with the palm of his waving (rather than against the one being waved to) as a gesture that signals ""come back""."
Auxiliary languages are artificial or constructed languages created to facilitate communication between peoples that would otherwise have difficulty communicating.
They are different from lingua franca languages, which are natural or organic languages that become dominant for some reason as a way to communicate between speakers of other languages.
During the dinner heat, travelers may experience mirages that give the illusion of water (or other things).
These can be dangerous if the traveler tries to reach the mirage, while wasting precious energy and remaining water.
Even the hottest deserts can get extremely cold night time. Cooling down is a serious risk if you lack warm clothes.
Beware of the mosquitoes if you decide to hike in the rainforest during the summer.
Whether you drive through the subtropical rainforest, a few seconds with the doors open when you enter the vehicle is enough time for mosquitoes to get into the car with you.
Bird flu, or aviary influenza as it is called more formally, can infect both birds and mammals.
Less than a thousand cases have been reported in humans, but some have been fatal.
Most have been about people who work with poultry, but there is also some risk to birdwatchers.
Typical for Norway are steep fjords and valleys that suddenly give way to a high, more or less even, plateau.
"One often refers to these plateaus as ""blowing"", meaning a vast, open landscape without trees, a boundless width.                           "
"In Rogaland and Agder they are often referred to as "hei", which means a treeless heathland, often covered with heather.                         "
The glaciers are not stable, but move downwards along the mountain. This causes cracks, which can be hidden by snow bridges.
The walls and ceilings of ice caves can collapse and cracks can be closed.
At the edge of the glacier, large blocks are broken off, falling down and can sometimes jump or roll further from the edge.
The tourist season in the mountain towns generally has its peak during the Indian summer.
However, they have a different kind of beauty and charm during the winter, when many mountain stations get plenty of snow and offer activities such as skiing and snowboarding.
Only a few airlines still offer special fares in case of death, with a certain discount for last-minute trips to funerals.
Airlines offering these include Air Canada, Delta Air Lines, Lufthansa for flights starting from the United States or Canada, and Westjet.
The trip must always be booked directly with the airline by phone.
