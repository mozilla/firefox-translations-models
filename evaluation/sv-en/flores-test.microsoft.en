The U.S. Gymnastics Federation supports the U.S. Olympic Committee's letter and agrees that it is imperative that the Olympic family foster a safe environment for all of our athletes.
We agree with the USOC's statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs can be better served if we move forward with a meaningful change to our organization, rather than if certification is removed.

Not only does it confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widespread, but it also provides details that fossils are often unable to provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
. The researchers say that this animal's plumage was chestnut brown on top, with a pale or carotenoid-colored underside.
The find also provides insight into the development of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, but do have other characteristics of feathers – rays and bee rays – the researchers concluded that the coil was probably a later evolutionary development than these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers indicates that they were not used for flying, but instead for temperature regulation or for display. The researchers suggested that the specimen shows an adult plumage and not chicken down, even if the tail comes from a young dinosaur.
The researchers said that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult plumage and not young down.

They found that the Sun functioned according to the same basic principles as other stars: The activity of all the stars in the system was found to be driven by their brightness, their rotation, and nothing else.
Using brightness and rotation, the star's rossby number is determined, which has to do with plasma fluxes.
The lower the Rossby number, the less active the star is in terms of magnetic reversals.

The work carried out was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces in the galaxy's dark matter and the dark matter in the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts gravitational pull on Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The researchers succeeded in establishing that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter does.
This theory states that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is located in a kind of halo, and is made of lots of tiny particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered the extremely drug-resistant form of tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
In an interview, he said that the new variant was "very worrying and alarming because of the very high level of mortality."
Some patients may have contracted the bacterium at the hospital, Dr. Moll believes, at least two of whom were hospital staff.
During the year, an infected person can transmit the infection to between 10 and 15 close contacts.
However, it appears that the proportion of people with XDR-TB in the entire group of people with tuberculosis is still low; 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 people infected at any given time in South Africa.

Infrared images show that the temperature variations between night and day likely indicate that they are caves.
"They are cooler than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night."
"Their thermal behavior is not as stable as large caves on Earth that often maintain a relatively constant temperature, but that's consistent with the fact that these are deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey's (USGS) astrogeology team and of Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and put a pre-printed sheet of paper with their chosen candidate in an envelope.
After officials verify the voter's identity, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voting document.
French electoral college legislation codifies the procedure rather strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes at the start of voting and that no envelopes are added except those duly counted from the eligible voters.
Candidates can send representatives to witness every part of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers who are under extensive surveillance, and who follow specific procedures.

In her second race, giant slalom, she finished tenth in the women's seating group, with a combined time of 4:41.30. That was 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first place with Austrian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than ninth place with Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani.
Four skiers in the women's seated group were unable to finish their runs and 45 of the total of 117 participating skiers in the giant slalom did not manage to place in the competition.
Madhya Pradesh police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
"Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya said: "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop.""
The accused are named as Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Inspector Chandra Shekhar Solanki announced that the accused appeared before the court with their faces covered.
Although three people were in the house when the car collided with it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while the emergency services cut the driver out of the red Audi TT.
He was first admitted to hospital at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrook Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been accused in Edinburgh's Sheriff's Court of murdering her son.
She is in custody awaiting prosecution and trial, but any eyewitness evidence may be worthless because her picture has been widely publicized.
This is common elsewhere in the UK, but Scots law works differently and courts have considered the publication of photos to be potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "journalists are taking a dangerous line if they publish pictures etc. of suspects."
The Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for prosecutions, has told reporters that no further comment will be made before indictments.
According to the leak, the leak document is about the border dispute, where the Palestinians want the borders to be based on those before the 1967 Six-Day War.
Other topics said to be reported on are the future of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel is requesting ten years of constant military presence in the valley after an agreement has been signed, while the PA only agrees to leave such a presence for five years.
Hunters in the supplementary pest control experiment were to be closely monitored by the park keepers when observing the experiment and evaluating its effectiveness.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting programme.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of Park Conservation and Culture at NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting mission received extensive safety and training instruction.
Martelly swore in a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday.
It is Martellony's fifth provisional electoral council in the space of four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former Provisional Electoral Council (APC), as part of a package of measures to bring the country closer to new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread protests against the regime that started in October.
The partly violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which have been on hold since 2011.
There have been reports of about 60 cases of improperly designed iPods overheating, causing a total of six fires and causing four people minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (Meti) said it was aware of 27 accidents related to the units.
"METI announced last week that Apple had announced 34 additional incidents of overheating, which the company called "mild."
The department responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report ""very regrettable."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT Friday).
The office of the Northern Mariana Islands Civil Protection Service said there were no reports of injuries in the country.
Even the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center announced that there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer has held tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have so far been confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later swapped places with an elderly lady because she was in need of a bathroom visit. Mendoza was shot down.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and embarked on a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at the Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching premature births during his free time.
His research showed that if a hormone was given, it would speed up the fetus's lung maturation.
Xinhua reported that government investigators salvaged two "black boxes" on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first boss. Luna died during the night with two moons. Quite unique just like her. Strong woman."""
Runnels said in a comment that "Luna was as big a freak as I was... maybe even bigger... love her and will miss her... Hopefully she's better off where she is now."
Out of 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, the number opposed to Australia becoming a republic had grown by 8 percent since 2008.
Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
Thirty-four percent of the participants in the survey share this view, that Queen Elizabeth II will be Australia's last last monarch.
At the extremes of the survey, 29 per cent of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 per cent believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was due to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle as well as three relay races at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his condition there have been doubts about his fitness.
He has not been able to take the medication needed to overcome his pain as they are banned in the competition.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, has discovered the largest known prime number to date, on January 25.
Several people verified the discovery with different hardware and software at the beginning of February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water resources on Earth, along with organic matter, which can form proteins and sustain life.
Since comets collided with Earth a long time ago, scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and last month signed a bill to legalize same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as 'political chatter and nonsense.'"
There is speculation that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims would mean planes fly shorter distances, save millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to older ground radar-based technology to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport is provided, and above-ground trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and park-and-ride stations are not available at ground level.
Fears of a lack of transport opened up the possibility that the match would have to be played behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported on the formation of a new species of bird in Ecuador's Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although this process is thought to have taken much longer due to breeding between the endemic Darwin finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant Españoladarwin finches, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be processed into all kinds of shapes. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be drawn into thin wire that can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
"It can be made very thin and attached to other metals. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted images in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called the pH value of a chemical. You can make an indicator with red cabbage juice.
The juice from the cabbage changes shade depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH value is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electrons (because hydrogen atoms are made up of a proton and an electron).
Stir the two dry powders together. Then shape them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will feel lusty and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flushing toilet in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remnants of sewage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman society, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women stayed together.
When you call someone hundreds of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the signal and reflects it back down almost immediately.
The satellite was launched into space by rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and field of vision.
It takes a giant rocket of over 30 meters to get a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The biggest thing that the wheel has brought is to give us much easier and faster methods of transport.
It has given us the train, the car and many other means of transport.
Underneath them are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small felines (including loose pet cats) that eat a much larger amount of small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of a niche, a special job for each cat that keeps it away from competing with others.
Lions are the most social felines, living in large groups called packs.
Flocks consist of one to three related adult males along with as many as thirty females and young.
Females are often closely related to each other; A large family of sisters and daughters.
Lejob act a lot like packs of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and also very lethal to their prey.
As an all-round athlete, the tiger can climb (but not well), swim, jump long distances and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is part of the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones who can roar.
The roar of the tiger is not like the loud roar of the lion, but more like a sentence of growling, screaming words.
Ozelots like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that ozelots follow and find animals to eat (prey) by smell, by sniffing the ground where they have been.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision and also move very stealthily. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then pounce on the prey.
When a small group of living creatures (a small population) is separated from the main population from which they originate (for example, if they move across a mountain range or river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily get back), they often end up in a different environment than the one they were previously in.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so in order to be a strong competitor, the new population needs different features or customizations than they needed before.
The indigenous people have not changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new surroundings, they begin to look smaller and smaller like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe and they absorb carbon dioxide that humans emit (that is, exhale).
Plants produce food with the help of sunlight through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses out of plants and make our clothes out of plants. Much of the food we eat is plants. Without the plants, the animals cannot survive.
Mosasaurus was at the top of the food chain during its time, so it had nothing to be afraid of, except other mosasaurs.
The long jaws were studded with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra set on the palate, meaning there was no chance of escaping for anything that crossed its path.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked everything that came into the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. rex was no match for it.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their fair share of strange or unusual feasting elements such as wild boars, peacocks, snails, and a kind of rodent called a hazel mouse.
Another difference was that while the poor people and the woman ate their food while sitting in chairs, the rich men liked to have banquets together where they could half-lie on their sides while they ate their meals.
Ancient Roman meals could not have included food that came to Europe from the Americas or from Asia in later centuries.
For example, they did not have corn, nor tomatoes, cocoa, or potatoes, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple to each of their gods which was considered the home of the god.
People brought offerings to the gods, and the priests tried to appease the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary to which only the priests had access.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, known as ziqqurats, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the Hebrew family's life took place outdoors.
Women cooked on the farm; Shops were just open counters facing the street. Stone was used to build houses.
In the land of Canaan, there were no large forests, so wood was very precious.
Greenland was sparsely populated. The Norse sagas say that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland as punishment for murder, and that when he traveled west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
Regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at the time.
"Although each country was 'Scandinavian,' there were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland."
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think there's a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Even if it says something on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
"On the back of the Declaration of Independence were written the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776". The text appears on the bottom of the document, upside down."
No one knows for sure who wrote it, but we do know that the large parchment (measuring 75.6 cm x 62.2 cm) was rolled up for storage early in its existence.
So it's likely that the text was just written there as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles had liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
"It was ruled by the 'Vichy' French. These were French people who had come to terms with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them."
"On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon"."
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces had liberated southern France and turned against Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work together, a community.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state, and which also in some way defines the size of society.
City-states are the forerunners of nations. A civilised culture means the intergenerational transmission of knowledge, a lingering cultural footprint and a fair dispersal.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical traces, and are not recognized as real civilizations.
During the American War of Independence, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government – with Congress as the sole component – according to the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked all power to impose taxes and, as there was no national executive power or judiciary, it fell to the authorities of the states, who were often uncooperative, to carry out all its decisions.
Nor did it have the authority to suspend tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles required unanimous approval from all states before they could be added, and the states attached so little importance to the central government that their representatives were often absent.
Italy's national football, along with the German football team, is the world's second most successful team and was the champion of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller skating hockey, and Formula 1.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, where Italians compete in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has almost 7000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
With its many islands, Japan is often considered an archipelago in a geographical sense.
Taiwan's history dates back to the 1400s when European sailors passing by registered the island's name as Ilha Formosa, which means beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company founds a base in southwestern Taiwan and initiates a transformation of the original production of grain, employing Chinese laborers to work on the rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty forces (1644-1912) took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal areas, and in 1885, Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
After the defeat in 1895 in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signs the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which sovereignty over Taiwan is given to Japan, which then rules over the island until 1945.
Machu picchu consists of three main structures, the Intihuatana, the Sun Temple and the Temple with the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been remodeled to give tourists a better idea of what they looked like in their originals.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common format for still images in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analogue film era.
It is still manufactured today, but even more important is its aspect ratio inherited to the formats of photo sensors in digital cameras.
The 35-milimeter format is, somewhat confusingly, 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio in this format (dividing by twelve to achieve the simplest whole-digit ratio) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (such as APS formats) correspond to this aspect ratio or are close to it.
The much-abused and often ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while keeping some order in an image.
It is argued that the best placement for the subject is where the lines dividing the image into thirds vertically and horizontally meet (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was scrutinized.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion had bound European states together in spite of their differences in language and customs.
Its omnipresent power affected everyone from king to the common man.
One of the main tenets of Christianity states that wealth is to be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the Church's funds are for that purpose.
The central power of the Church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question the fulfillment of this principle.
Shortly after the conflict broke out, Britain launched a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective in cutting off essential military and civilian supplies, even though this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified in numerous international agreements over the past two hundred years.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ship from crossing entire areas of the ocean, making it risky even for neutral ships.
Because it had received a limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unlimited underwater warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitude was one of pacifism and isolation among most of the inhabitants and countries.
Having seen the horror and cruelty of war during World War I, countries wanted to avoid a repeat of such a situation in the future.
Tesla moved to the United States of America in 1884 to join the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his boss at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of distinguishing different time periods; every stage in China's history, or every family in power, was a distinct dynasty.
Between each dynasty there was also a period of instability in which the provinces were divided. The most famous of these periods was the Three Kingdoms, which took place between the 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, there was often fierce warfare between many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms were one of the bloodiest times in ancient China's history as thousands of people died in battle to sit in the supreme chair of the Great Palace of Xi'an.
There were many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not a single ruler.
Furthermore, the professions were opened up to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to achieve success.
The same is true for the military, as rank in the army was now based on caliber instead of class.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed people from the working class in other countries to make a revolution.
"Muhammad was deeply interested in topics beyond his everyday life. He would often visit a cave that became known as "Hira" on the "Noor" mountain (light) to contemplate."
the cave itself, which survived the passage of time, gives a very clear picture of Mohammed's spiritual tendencies.
The cave, which is located on one of the mountain peaks north of Mecca, is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find even if you know it exists. Inside the cave there is total isolation.
You can't see anything but the clear, beautiful skies and the many surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that still exists today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., THE PYRAMID OF Cheops is one of many large pyramidal structures built in honor of dead pharaohs.
The "Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several smaller funerary monuments, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Pyramid of Cheops was built in honor of the pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
"The marking for "up-bow" looks like a V and the marking for "down-bow" looks like a staple or a square that has no bottom side."
Up means that you should start at the tip and push the bow upwards, and down means that you should start at the frosch (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow downwards.
An upstring usually generates a softer sound, while a downstring is louder and more resolute.
You are welcome to draw your own markings, but keep in mind that the printed string markings are there for a musical reason, so they should usually be respected.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles) and the king's sister, Madame Élisabeth, were forced back to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789, by a crowd of market women.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd shouting and shouting threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep their carriage windows wide open.
On one occasion, one of the members of the mob swung the head of an imperial guard killed at Versailles, in front of the terrified queen.
The war expenses for the conquest of the Philippines by US imperialism were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They had to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover most of the cost and interest on bonds in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Of course, the huge profits derived from the protracted exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the fundamental gains of American imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The era in which the events took place is often referred to as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history from the 11th to the 14th centuries.
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which formally ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses many different ideas in practice, from technology driving development or the technological imperative to the strict view that human destiny is driven by a fundamental logic associated with the laws of nature and how they are manifested in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism have two general ideas in common: that technology itself follows a trajectory that is largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has "'effects'" on societies that are indigenous, rather than socially.
For example, it could be said that the motorised car necessarily leads to the construction of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically sustainable for just a small amount of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Mass ownership of cars also leads to a higher incidence of accidents on the roads, leading to the invention of new technologies in healthcare to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism contained a large element of determinism, originating in writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals and, over time, customs and culture related to this geography emerged, and these, harmonizing with the location of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicenter of luxury began circulating at about the year 400 e.Kr. and continued until about the year 1100 e.Kr.
Its influence declined during the 14th century mainly due to the fact that crusaders had returned with gifts such as silk and spices that were valued higher than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this time that the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its zenith between the 12th-13th centuries and the 14th centuries.
In the beginning, clothing was heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture of the East.
However, due to the slow lines of communication, the styles of the West could lag by 25 to 30 years.
towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments of the time as a result of the Crusades was that people began to use buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence farming is agriculture that is carried out for the production of enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic, system that uses saved seeds originating in the ecoregion combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yields.
Historically, most farmers were subsistence farmers, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel overlooked by society and allow them to find their identity.
Subcultures may be distinct due to the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinct may be of a linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual or geographical nature, or it may be a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their affiliation through a distinct and symbolic style choice, which includes fashion, mannerisms, and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to look at the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, accident, or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults during their upbringing.
"Such children are called 'savage'. Some feral children have been locked up by humans (usually their own parents); In some cases, the abandonment of the child was due to the parents' rejection of a child's serious intellectual or physical disability.'
Feral children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or fled.
Others are alleged to have been raised by animals; Some are said to have lived in the wilderness all on their own.
When the feral child is raised entirely by non-human animals, it exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) almost identical to those of the specific care animal, such as its fear of or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, remedial teaching goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but a support for individuals who are learning something new, such as how to use a new computer program or to start a new project.
Support can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of support, but so is the little gem-man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual support is internalized in the software and is meant to question, guide and explain methods that may have been too challenging for the student to manage on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that isn't nurturing, nurturing, or educational, but it happens.
We believe that the foster care system is a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable medical care.
Foster care is there to offer all the necessities that were missing in the home they previously came from.
The Internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinct characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of user theory.
"For example, 'learning' and 'socialization' are suggested as important motives for Internet use (James et al., 1995)."
"Even ''personal engagement' and 'continuous relationships' were identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when examining audience reactions to websites."
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial expressions that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that you can tell if a person is lying by interpreting microexpressions correctly.
"Oliver Sacks showed in his publication "The President's Speech" how people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage can still judge sincerity correctly."
He even claims that we share such knowledge in interpreting human behavior with animals such as domesticated dogs.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two areas of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of pronounced variation.
Segregation and recombination shovel variations back and forth between the two poles with each new generation.
Out on the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like a human to satisfy its need for amino acids from the plants that are available.
Moreover, an absence of this has serious consequences; stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most readily available plant resources would have been proteins found in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest, unless they are cooked.
In comparison, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also offer high-quality proteins that contain all the essential amino acids.
"After all, we shouldn't be surprised if our own ancestors solved their 'protein problem' in much the same way that chimpanzees on the savannah do today."
Sleep interruption is the process of intentionally waking up during your normal sleep period and going back to sleep shortly thereafter (10–60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock that brings you closer to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you usually turn off the clock in your sleep, you can put it at the other end of the room, so you have to get out of bed and turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options involve drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before sleep, causing one to have to get up and urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has correlates opposite to the amount of tension in their body and mind.
The lower the voltage, the more positive the present life force. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can attain enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been expanded with the path of love in Mahayana and many techniques in Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the all-encompassing path of love.
With Kundalini yoga, kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
God yoga is central to Tibetan meditation. Through the visualization of different gods, the energy channels are purified, chakras are activated, and enlightened awareness is created.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, which led to a collaboration between the Soviet Union and the United States. When the war ended, the differences in system, process and culture led to the collapse of the countries' cooperation.
Two years after the end of the war, the former Allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and would be physically fought through contract armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defenses were already broken and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when over 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the USSR entered and created the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts, having invaded the eastern regions of Poland and at the same time violated the Riga Peace Treaty, the Non-Aggression Pact between the Soviets and Poland, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
By far the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across the seas is to use ships to transport goods.
The job of the navies has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move your people and goods, while disrupting the enemy's ability to move people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II. The Americans tried to move troops and material across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, mainly with the help of submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain in the same way as the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been domesticated only about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes had them to obtain milk, fur, meat, and skin.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that wandered on hills or other grazing areas, often herded by shepherds who were often children or youths, similar to the more famous shepherd. These methods of herding are still used today.
Tramways for carriages were built in England as early as the 1500s.
Although carriage roads consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling them to reach higher speeds and pull greater loads than on the rougher roads of the time.
Sleepers were introduced quite early on to keep the tracks in place. However, it was gradually realized that the tracks would be more effective if they had a layer of iron on top.
This became the practice, but the iron wore more on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. The first rails made entirely of iron were introduced in 1767.
The first known mode of transport was walking, humans began to walk upright two million years ago when Homo Erectus (meaning the upright man) saw the light of day.
Their predecessor, australopithecus, was not in the habit of walking upright.
Bipedal specializations have been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can get involved in the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is, in many cases, as symptomatic treatment. However, if we do not want a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problems and deactivate them.
It is abundantly clear that the world has changed a great deal because of humanity's scientific and technological progress, and the problems have been exacerbated by overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of mankind.
After it was passed by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft, signed by Speaker of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to John Dunlap's printing office a few blocks away.
"During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as 'Dunlap broadsides.'"
The first public reading of the document was done by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who had it read aloud to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on 10 August.
The 25 of Dunlap's broadsides that are known to still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The handwritten original has not been preserved.
Many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and still exist today. We call them birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs, because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things in birds that still look like the dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary digits.
A binary number can only have one of two values, i.e., 0 or 1 and these numbers are called binary digits – or bits to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning is not always immediately noticeable. Symptoms such as vomiting are too general for an immediate diagnosis to be made.
The best sign of poisoning may be an open jar of medicine or toxic household chemicals.
Refer to the label for specific first aid instructions for the specific poison.
The term beetles is used in a formal sense by entomologists for this group of insects.
This term derives from ancient kinship with bed bugs, insects that are sharply adapted to parasitize on humans.
Both predatory beetles and bed bugs are nesters, adapted to live in their host's nest or home.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely to have MS than men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interest, or in the best interests of their child, to raise a child.
These couples can choose to draw up an adoption plan for their child.
During an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works through the scientific method. In fact, this method is guiding in almost all research.
However, it is not alone. Experimenting, in which an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, asking questions and making observations, also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Bible written in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific questions, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the Western world found itself cut off from its Greek roots in philosophy and science.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior are often largely due to the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms that are not just reactions to external periodic signals, have been documented in most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
A biological clock is a self-propelled oscillator that repeats its cycle for a period of time even in the absence of external influences.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the main hints that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to plant their own DNA in a bacterium.
They did two experiments that marked either the DNA of the substance with a radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the substance with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in reproductive cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of experiencing the landscape, including its plant and animal life.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, as well as visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
One example is visiting, photographing and learning more about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small country towns in cars to go to work and are passed by others whose destination for work is the place they just left.
In this dynamic shuttle traffic, everyone is in some way connected to, and supports, a transport system based on private motoring.
Science now shows that this massive carbon economy has disrupted the biosphere from one of its stable states that has supported human development for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems. Virtually everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear similar complaints about water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why do transportation systems generate so many complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of how individual drivers and vehicles move between two points and how they interact with each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flows because preparatory work cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, motorists tend to behave fairly consistently; Thus, the traffic tends to flow reasonably consistently and can be broadly presented mathematically.
To better represent the traffic flow, relationships have been established between three main variables: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These conditions help in the planning, design and operation of roadside facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly helped them to avoid the enemy more easily and to find food and mates more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings alongside their bodies.
This gives them more small spaces where they can hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that can't fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system moved around the sun.
Some people thought he was right but many thought the opposite; that the solar system moved around the Earth, including the Sun (and also the other stars).
This seems reasonable, as it doesn't feel like the Earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the world's most water-rich and second-longest river. Its water flow is more than 8 times that of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, 9 km wide in some places.
As much as 20 percent of the water that flows into the oceans from the world's rivers comes from the Amazon.
The main channel of the Amazon River is 6,387 km.  It gets its water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramid building continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, pyramids were never surpassed in Giza's size and construction technique.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their predecessors, which at that time were well over a thousand years old.
Vatican City has about 800 inhabitants. It is the world's smallest independent country and the country with the lowest number of inhabitants.
The Vatican uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the colloquial language used by most of those who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Humans have known about basic chemical substances such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, as these can be discovered in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle had a theory that everything consisted of one or more of a total of four elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four phases of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he had theories that they switch to new substances to create what we see.
Alloys are a mixture of two or more metals. Remember that there are many different elements in the periodic table.
Substances such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic substances such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them can fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil was a faithful companion for many people when it came out.
Unfortunately, as newer writing methods have been developed, the pencil has been given a lower status and fewer uses.
Today, people write messages on computer screens, and never have to come near a pencil sharpener.
One can only wonder what will become of the keyboard when something newer arrives.
The fission bomb is based on the principle that energy is required to produce a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Kind of like rolling a heavy cart up a hill. Splitting the nucleus again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei and it doesn't take much for them to decay.
The surface of the moon is made up of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the right side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the lunar seas and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more maria on the nearby side because the crust is thinner there. This made it easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories revolve around figuring out what gets people going or what appeals to them.
The theories claim that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they become adults.
These theories look at what makes some people want what they want and what it is in their environment that makes them do or not do certain things.
Two popular theories of content are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
"Generally speaking, two behaviors can emerge when managers begin to lead their former peers. At one end of the spectrum, the boss tries to remain "one of the gang."
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, performing disciplinary actions, evaluating performance, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, you turn into an unrecognizable person who feels like he or she has to change everything the team has done and make it their own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for whether the team succeeds or fails.
This behavior often results in rifts between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams hold the same high standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members tend to serve as a point of contact for the physical group.
They often have more say than conventional team members as different time zones can affect when their teams can meet and this may not be understood by management locally.
"The presence of a true 'invisible team'" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p.109) is also a unique component of a virtual team."
"The "invisible team" is the management team to which all members report. The invisible team sets the standards for every member."
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organization? One goal of adopting organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively in an organization's functional departments, creativity and ingenuity can thrive.
Therefore, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that meets the customer's needs.
Before an organization can become innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) describes the continuum approach as a method used to support organizations in achieving a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological information provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. Therefore, it makes the field of research narrower and much more precise.
The correlation between brain diseases and behavior supports researchers in their research.
It has long been known that various brain injuries, traumas, diseases, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes that we have not seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand processes in our mind.
Although AI is strongly associated with science fiction, it is a very important branch of computer science that involves machine behavior, learning, and intelligence.
Research in AI is about getting machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include controlling, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, and even handwriting, voice and face recognition.
Such things have become separate disciplines, which focus on offering solutions to real problems.
The AI system is now widely used in finance, medicine, engineering, and the military, and has been built into several home computer and video game software applications.
Field studies are a big part of the teaching in every class. Often the teacher wants to take the students to places where there are no buses.
The technology offers solutions with virtual field trips. Students can look at museum pieces, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art sitting with their class.
Sharing a field trip virtually is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website every year about their trip to the state capital; The website is redesigned every year, but previous versions are allowed to remain online as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. Students often start their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of readers improves this in general.
Since students are often the most critical readers, the blogger tries to write better to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "forces students to become more aware of the world around them." The demand to satisfy readers' interests stimulates students to be clever and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning far beyond the traditional school day.
"Appropriate use of blogs" can empower students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to online material, students can define their positions in relation to what others have written, as well as present their own perspectives on specific issues (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital and offers a range of galleries and museums showcasing Canada's present and past.
Further south is Niagara Falls and in the northern part is Muskoka's beautiful, unspoiled nature.
All this and more distinguishes Ontario with what outsiders consider to be the quintessence of Canada.
Large areas further north are very sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that surprises many: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and a continent of its own in terms of fauna.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or belong to France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also introduced Islam to the areas, which had a major impact in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century after the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama rounded the Cape of Good Hope and thus found the sea route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered to the north by the Sahel and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It's good to also wear a ring (not just one that looks too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences can result in what they would consider harassment, and it's not uncommon for someone to follow you, grab your arm, etc.
Be firm when you say no to men and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences don't make it ok!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 11th century BCE and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a strategic port named Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca. only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city of Daru l-Badya, which was named Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan products, such as tagine, ceramics, leather products, hookahs and a whole spectrum of knick-knacks, but it's all for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, located in the far east near the border with Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially in the central parts.
Goma is fairly safe, but if you are going to visit outside Goma, you should investigate the state of the fighting in the North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano along with some of the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price for the short trip is around 500 Congolese francs.
"Combined with its relative inaccessibility, 'Timbuktu' has come to be used as a metaphor for exotic, remote places."
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, but its reputation makes it a tourist destination, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was included in the list of World Heritage in Danger due to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the major stops during Henry Louis Gates' PBS program Wonders of the African World.
The city stands in stark contrast to the other cities in the country, with an atmosphere that is Arab rather than African.
Kruger national park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and stretches along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, while the southern border is the Crocodile river.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which is home to different wildlife.
It is one of the biggest attractions in South Africa and it is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
Just like any other South African national park, the park charges daily conservation and entrance fees.
It can also be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card, which either gives access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the territory of Hong Kong its name and is the place that many tourists consider as the main focus.
The buildings lined up that make up Hong Kong's skyline have been likened to a glittering bar graph enhanced by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To see the best views in Hong Kong, leave the island and head to Kowloon's waterfront opposite.
The vast majority of the buildings on Hong Kong Island are densely packed together on the former seabed along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonizers took over, so if you're looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, extending 80 km into Bangladesh and the Indian hinterland from the coast.
The Sundarbans has been admitted to the UNESCO World Heritage List. The part of the forest that is located in Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests aren't just mangroves, though—they contain some of the last remaining remnants of the vast jungles that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km², of which about a third is made up of wetlands.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and around 30,000 Axis deer in the area.
Buses depart from the district-wide bus station (across the river) throughout the day, but most, especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang, run between 6.30 am and 7.30 am.
Since buses between the districts are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and stable.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to get to nearby places like Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is a cable bridge. It straddles the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise 83 meters high, it is 378 meters long and has two passages that are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres. Construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian toll plazas are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group that inhabited what is now eastern Paraguay and lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was populated by other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who lived as hunters, gatherers and fishermen.
"In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as the 'Giant Province of India', was born as a result of the meeting of the Spanish conquistadors and indigenous groups."
The Spanish began the colonization period that lasted for three centuries.
Since Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well known for their polo teams and players being among the best in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo courts in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For tournament news and where to buy polo match tickets, head to the Asociación Argentina de polo.
The official Falklands currency is the Falkland Pound (FKP) whose value is equivalent to the value of one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, which is located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
GBP is generally accepted anywhere on the islands, and within Stanley it is often possible to pay by credit card and USD.
Credit cards will probably not be accepted on the outlying islands, but British and American currency can be accepted; Contact the owners in advance to determine what is an acceptable payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falklands currency outside the islands, so exchange money before you leave the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone; during the summer months, temperatures above +30°C are common
Winter can be deceptively cold: the temperature rarely drops below zero, but the wind and humidity combine and make it feel colder than the thermometer says.
"There are no special 'rainy' and 'dry' seasons: the amount of rain remains about the same throughout the year."
Despite the fact that many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, the wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authorities, you should stay at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves and 25 meters away from all other wildlife!
No matter how docile they look, bison, moose, canda deer, bears, and almost any large animal can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they did not keep adequate distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
Additionally, keep in mind that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid bringing or cooking food that smells and keep the camp clean.
The capital of Samoa is called Apia. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the scene of an infamous stalemate in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk, except for one British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the assassination of Supreme Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches due to Auckland's location between two harbours. The most popular beaches are divided into three areas.
The North Shore's beaches (in the North Harbour district) are located on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of them are sandy beaches where it is safe to swim, and on most of them offer shade.
Tamaki Drive's beaches are located on Waitemata Harbour, in the exclusive suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes well-frequented family beaches with a good selection of shops located on the beachfront. Swimming is safe.
"The main local beer is 'Number one', which is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta"."
There are many French wines, but the New Zealand and Australian wines may be better suited to the trip.
The local drinking water is completely safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you're worried.
"For Australians, the idea of 'flat white' coffee is unknown. A "short black" is "espresso", cappuccinos have a pile of cream (not foam) and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate milk complies with Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
There are many trips to the reef all year round and damage due to any of these causes on the reef is rare.
Nevertheless, take the advice of the authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Cube jellyfish occur near shores and near estuaries from October to April north of 1770. They can sometimes be found at other times as well.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and would swim away.
The saltwater crocodile's main habitat is in the estuaries north of Rockhampton, so they don't usually live in the ocean.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind and the assurance that they will have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, but it may be possible to book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent.
Travel agencies often offer packages that include breakfast, transfers to and from the airport, and even package tours that combine flights and hotels.
They may also reserve your booking for you if you need time to think about the offer or obtain additional documents required for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, all changes and requests should go through the travel agency first, and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of music festival visitors decide to camp on site, and most visitors see it as an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to where the action is, you'll need to arrive early to get a campsite close to the music.
Keep in mind that even though the music performances on the Main Stage have stopped, parts of the festival may continue to play music until late into the night.
Some festivals have special campsites for families with young children.
If you're crossing the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin, as walking through ice causes really horrible noises for those most affected.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (see terms and conditions).
Casinos usually do everything they can to get guests to spend as much time and money as possible. There are often no windows or clocks, and the exits are often hard to find.
They usually have special offers of food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests in good spirits and keep them staying in the venue.
Some establishments offer alcoholic beverages for free. But intoxication impairs judgment, and any good player knows how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone who is going to drive at high latitudes or over mountain passes should be aware that snow, ice and sub-freezing temperatures can occur.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and you can't drive in the same way as on bare asphalt.
During snowstorms, enough snow can fall in a very short time to get you stuck.
Visibility may also be limited by snowfall or blizzards, or by condensation or ice on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues almost uninterrupted all year round.
Safaris are perhaps the largest tourism industry in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The term safari in popular usage refers to trips across the country to see the amazing African wildlife, especially on the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to cars and with standard equipment it is possible to see them well.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and you can see them better with binoculars.
"Walking safaris (also called "bush walks" and "hiking safaris") consist of hiking either for a few hours or for several days.
The Paralympics will take place between August 24 and September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations around Japan.
Tokyo will be the only city in Asia to have hosted two Summer Olympics, having hosted the Games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodations for 2020 before the launch was announced, you may be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies due to the coronavirus vary, but by the end of March, most do not extend as far as July 2020, when the Olympic Games would have begun.
It is expected that most tickets for events will cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with a typical ticket price around 7,000 yen.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board that can be borrowed, even if it is not in the room.
If you don't have an iron available, or if you don't want to wear ironed socks, try using a hair dryer, if one is available.
Be vigilant and don't let the fabric get too hot (which can cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, stinging).
There are different ways to purify water, and some are more effective against specific hazards.
In some areas, it is enough to boil the water for one minute, in others several minutes are required.
Filters can vary in effectiveness, and if you're unsure, consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from an established company.
Travelers may encounter pests they are unfamiliar with from their home regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation or, in the worst case, allergic reactions, spread poison or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill humans by force, are not usually classified as pests.
Duty-free shopping is the ability to purchase goods without tax or other surcharges in certain locations.
Travelers heading to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, which often runs through isolated primeval forest terrain.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, drive sensibly: steep gradients, narrow lanes and sharp curves are common.
Fixed speed limits are noticeably lower than in previous and subsequent sections – typically 56-64 km/h (35-40 mph) – and adherence to them is even more important than otherwise.
Oddly enough, mobile coverage is much better here than along many other routes, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are really tasty, and in Bavaria they are quite rich and varied, similar to those of its neighbor to the south, Austria.
Pastries with fruit are common, with apples baked into baked goods all year round and cherries and plums during the summer.
Many German pastries also have almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cakes often pair especially well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want small but mighty pastries, you can try what is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, accompanied by either meat or vegetables.
"A curry can be either ''dry' or ''moist' depending on the amount of liquid."
In northern India and the inland regions of Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is a collective name that includes a wide variety of regional dishes scattered around the country.
However, if used without a qualifier, the term tends to mean the food that originally came from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, which is now available everywhere in the archipelago, offers a variety of simply spiced dishes, where the seasonings that the Javanese use the most are peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang down on both sides of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider but can pose a safety risk as the rider's feet can get caught in them.
If a rider is thrown off a horse but has one foot stuck in the stirrup, he or she can be dragged if the horse runs away. To minimize this risk, a number of security measures can be taken.
First, most riders have boots with heels and a smooth, fairly narrow sole.
Then, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that ensure that a stirrup detaches from the saddle if it is pulled backwards by a rider who falls off.
The Cochamó Valley, Chile's premier climbing destination, is known as the Yosemite of South America, and features a number of large granite cliffs and walls.
The mountain peaks offer views that can take your breath away. Climbers from all corners of the world are constantly creating new routes among the countless mountain walls.
Downhill skiing, which includes skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve gliding down a snow-covered landscape with skis or a snowboard strapped to your feet.
Skiing is an activity that attracts many enthusiasts, sometimes called "ski hoppers", who plan the entire holiday trip around skiing in a particular area.
The idea of skiing is very old – cave paintings depicting skiers date as far back as 5,000 f.Kr!
Downhill skiing as a sport has been around since at least the 1600s, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking on skis: this activity is also called backcountry skiing, ski touring or ski hiking.
It is related to but does not usually involve alpine skiing or mountaineering, the latter being performed on steep terrain and requiring much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski trail as a similar hiking trail.
In good conditions, you will be able to cover slightly larger distances than when walking – but you will only rarely reach speeds as in cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on groomed trails.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small, but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, travelling through several countries would require a number of visa applications and passport control.
However, the Schengen area functions much like a country in this respect.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can generally cross borders without going through passport checks more times.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa in each Schengen member state separately. This saves you time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of which manufactured objects are antiques. Some tax agencies define goods older than 100 years as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limits may be shorter in North America, for example, than in Europe.
Handicraft products can be defined as antiques, although they are not as old as similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood among the Sámi and the culture that surrounds the trade is also important for many with other professions.
Even historically, however, not all Sámi have been involved in large-scale reindeer herding, but have lived off fishing, hunting and the like, and used the reindeer mostly as draught animals.
Today, many Sámi work in modern industries. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the area of the Sámi people.
"Although it is often used, especially among non-Romani, the word 'Gypsy' is often considered offensive because of its associations with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about Romani people."
If the country you are visiting is subject to a travel restriction, your travel medical insurance or cancellation cover may be affected.
You may also have desires to consult governments other than your own, but their advice is designed for their own citizens.
For example, for U.S. citizens in the Middle East, the circumstances may be different from those of Europeans or Arabs.
A travel advice is just a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The picture presented is often brief, general and oversimplified compared to the more detailed information available from other sources.
Extreme weather is the general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or the loss of human life.
Severe weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different variations of them, which can depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, heavy rainfall, and wildfire are types and consequences of extreme weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, cloudbursts, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include heavy snowstorms, whirlwinds, ice storms and sandstorms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of the risk of severe weather affecting their area, as it may affect travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that can be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
"An Internet search for 'hostile environmental education' will probably yield the address of a local business."
A course usually goes through all the issues mentioned here but in much more detail, usually with practical exercises.
A course normally lasts between 2-5 days and includes role-playing, a lot of first aid and sometimes weapons training.
There are plenty of books on how to survive in the wilderness, while books about war zones are rare.
Travellers planning gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure that they have valid documents for the return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports without a specified gender (X) or documents updated to match a desired name or gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to accept these documents varies just as much.
Scans at security checkpoints have also become significantly more intrusive in the post-September 11, 2001 era.
Transgender people who have not undergone surgery should not expect to be able to pass through the X-ray check with their integrity and dignity intact.
Rip currents are the returning flow from waves that break off at the shore, often at a reef or similar.
The underwater topology means that the backflow is concentrated in a few deeper parts, and strong currents leading to deep water can form there.
Most deaths occur as a result of exhaustion after trying to swim back against the current, which can be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the stream, it's no harder than normal to swim back.
Try to aim somewhere where you won't get caught again or, depending on your skills and whether or not you've been spotted, wait to be rescued.
The comeback shock comes earlier than the culture shock (there's not as much of a honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who have found it easy to adapt to new cultures sometimes find it difficult to readjust to their original culture.
By the time you return from living abroad, you've adapted to a new culture and lost some of the habits of your home culture.
When you first traveled abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country had to adapt.
People may not expect that patience and understanding are also necessary for travelers returning home.
The sound and light show of the pyramids is one of the most interesting things for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show starts.
Usually, you will always hear the sounds of tourists and vendors. The sound and light story is just like a storybook.
The background is the Sphinx, which tells a long story.
The scenes are shown on the pyramids, and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, which were discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries, and they have the most bases, of which sixteen were active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island with the community of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception where the flooded crater of an active volcano forms a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth's land is the region south of the peninsula, bordering the Bellingshausen Sea.
The peninsula's mountains here merge with the plateau and then return to form the 360 km long Ellsworth mountain range, which is split in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part or Sentinel Range has Antarctica's highest mountain, the Vinson Massif, with a highest peak of 4892 m in Mount Vinson.
In remote locations with no cellular coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone generally does not replace a mobile phone, as you have to be outdoors with a clear line of sight to the satellite to be able to make a call.
The service is often used by vessels, including pleasure boats, as well as expeditions that need remote data and voices.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide you with more information on how to connect to this service.
Traveling and learning is an increasingly popular option for those planning a year off.
This is especially popular with recent graduates, allowing them to take a year off before university without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a gap semester abroad can actually increase the chances of getting into higher education in your home country.
Usually, a fee is charged to enroll in these tuition programs.
Finland is very boat-friendly. The Land of a Thousand Lakes also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and in the archipelagos.
In the archipelago and lakes, you don't necessarily need a yacht.
Although the archipelagos and the largest lakes are certainly big enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak can offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
This is matched by Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is otherwise quite unique (e.g. in the Netherlands the figure is one in forty).
Most of the specifically Baltic cruises include a longer layover in St. Petersburg in Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a couple of full days while returning to and sleeping on the ship at night.
If you only go ashore on ship excursions, you do not need a separate visa (from 2009).
Some cruises include the German capital Berlin in their brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is nowhere near the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can be a daunting experience for people, regardless of age and background, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
It's not something to be ashamed of: it's no different from the personal fear and aversion to other things that a lot of people have.
Understanding how airplanes work and what happens during a flight can help some people overcome fears that stem from discomfort with the unknown or from not being in control.
Courier companies are well paid to deliver things quickly. Often, time is of the essence when it comes to business documents, merchandise or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes, the larger airlines have their own aircraft, but for other routes and smaller companies, there was a problem.
If they have sent things by air freight, on some routes it may have taken several days to go through unloading and customs.
The only way to get it faster was to send it as checked baggage. Airline rules don't allow you to send luggage without a passenger, and this is where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first class or business class is to shell out a whole bunch of money for the privilege (or better yet, let your company do it for you).
However, this doesn't come at a cheap price: as a rough rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business and eleven times for first class!
In general, there's no point in even looking for discounts for business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain core group of travelers who are prepared to pay well for the privilege of traveling somewhere fast and comfortable. The companies also charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is commonly used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has been plagued by ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any of the member states of the United Nations.
Economic relations have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova, despite failures in the political negotiations.
The largest religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
İzmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of around 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transport hub.
The city, historically known as Smyrna, is today a modern, developed city and a bustling commercial center located on a huge harbor surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, glass-faced buildings and modern shopping malls are mixed with traditional red-tiled roofs, the 18th-century market and old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere more akin to Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers a view of the nearby island of Eysturoy, and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery there are interesting marble statues of pigeons over some of the graves.
It's worth strolling around for half an hour in the captivating village.
Within easy reach to the north is the romantic and fascinating town of Sintra and which became famous among foreigners after a shimmering account of its magnificence by Lord Byron.
Scotturb bus 403 runs regularly to Sintra, with a stop at Cabo da Roca.
To the north, also visit the stunning Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (shrine), a site world-famous for apparitions of Mary.
Remember that you are in fact visiting a mass graveyard and a place that has an almost incalculable significance for a significant part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women still alive who survived their time here, and many more who had loved ones who were murdered or worked to death here; Jews as well as non-Jews.
Use the site with the great dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves. Don't joke about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not vandalize the place by painting or scratching graffiti on structures.
Barcelona's official languages are Catalan and Spanish. About half prefer to speak Catalan, an overwhelming majority understand it, and almost all of them speak Spanish.
However, most of the signs are only in Catalan, as it is by law the primary official language.
However, Spanish is also used in many places in public transport and other establishments.
Regular announcements in the metro are only made in Catalan, but unplanned disruptions are announced by an automated system in a variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being egocentric, rude, and arrogant.
While this is often just a false stereotype, the best way to get by in Paris is still to behave in the best way and behave like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-mannered). It will make it much easier to get around."
The brusque exterior of Parisians will quickly disappear if you show your polite side.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is overgrown with dense forest, mainly beech, spruce and fir, and has a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a remarkably large diversity of species, due to the extent of microclimates, different soils and varying differences in altitude.
The area is also home to an extreme diversity of animal and bird species.
Rare animal species such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat and capercaillie are found there, along with many more common species
When visiting the monasteries, women must wear skirts that cover their knees, and also have their shoulders covered.
Most monasteries give shawls to women who have not prepared in advance, but if you bring your own, especially one with bright colors, you will get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
By the same logic, men must dress in pants that cover their knees.
This can also be borrowed from the warehouse in the entrance but those garments are not washed after each person so you may not feel comfortable using these skirts. One size fits all applies to men!
Mallorcan food, like that of similar areas around the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and uses olive oil throughout.
An easy, popular dinner, especially during the summer, is Pa amb Oli: Bread with olive oil, tomato, and optional accompaniments such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, as well as Sie for the pronoun you, are capitalized, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important method of distinguishing between certain verbs and objects.
According to some, it also makes it easier to read, although the need to figure out if a verb or adjective is in noun form makes writing a bit more complicated.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written
The letters to watch out for are c and g, as their pronunciation varies on the basis of the following vowel.
Also, be sure to pronounce r and rr differently: caro means dear, while carro means chariot.
Persian has relatively easy and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammar primer can help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and understand sentences better.
Of course, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese if you already know a Romance language.
However, people who know a little Spanish can quickly conclude that Portuguese is similar enough that it doesn't need to be studied separately.
Pre-modern observatories are usually obsolete today and remain as museums or training grounds.
Because light pollution in their heyday was not the kind of problem that they are today, they are usually found in cities or on university campuses, easier to reach than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities in remote locations with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Hanami, or the view of the cherry blossom, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China, where plum blossoms were used.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom feasts were held by the emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.
Plants look best in their natural environment, so try to resist the temptation to remove "just one" specimen.
"If you visit an arranged garden, and you pick a 'specimen', it will even get you thrown out, without discussion."
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to stay and very easy to navigate, and you can buy almost anything after arriving.
"But with its location in the 'high tropics' just a few degrees north of the equator, you have to deal with both heat (always) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, less often)."
There are also a small number of buses that run north to Hebron, the traditional burial ground where the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives rest.
Make sure that the bus you are considering taking goes to Hebron, and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good starting point to base a holiday around.
For example, visit castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley or take a boat trip to interesting towns on the Danube or a trip along the Erie Canal.
They also define routes for popular hiking and biking trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity and is celebrated as Jesus' birthday.
Many of the traditions around the holiday have also been taken up by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition of spending Easter night awake in some open place to watch the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may well be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter Night Mass on the Saturday evening of the Easter weekend. Then, at midnight, the congregation breaks up to celebrate Christ's resurrection.
All animals that originally arrived on the islands came here by either swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the long distance from the continent, mammals could not cross, and so the giant tortoise became the primary grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Since humans arrived in the Galápagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic areas in winter, you will experience polar nights, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky is dark more or less around the clock.
Since the areas are sparsely populated, and light pollution is often not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the starry sky.
The Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than Westerners may be used to.
Suits are the normal business attire, and colleagues address each other by their last name or job title.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, with an emphasis on the collective efforts rather than highlighting the achievements of individuals.
Workers often have to get the approval of their superiors for any decision they make and are expected to follow the instructions of their superiors without hesitation.
