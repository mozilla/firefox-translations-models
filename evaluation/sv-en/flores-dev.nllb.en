To return to its previous energy level, it must be able to absorb the extra energy from the light.
This is done by sending a photon, which is a small light particle.
"Forskare calls this process ""stimulating emission by strålning"", because the atomic energy stimulates by the stronger light, which causes the emission of a light photon, and light is a type of strålning".
The following image shows how the atoms emit photons, and in reality the photons are, of course, much smaller than on the image.
Photographs are even less than the components of an atom!
